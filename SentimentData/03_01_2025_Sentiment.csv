Here’s how,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-half-pump-could-send-xrp-to-27-heres-how/,"Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto recently shared a detailed update on XRP’s price trajectory, focusing on pivotal technical indicators and potential price targets. The analysis highlights both bullish and bearish scenarios, emphasizing the importance of key levels and formations in determining the asset’s next move. #XRP – Half Pump Could Lead to $27 (UPDATE): For a deeper understanding, check out my post from December 18, 2024: [Full Details Here] https://t.co/Nbpn96U2OW What’s Next for #XRP : 1️⃣ Fib Channel Break: #XRP has broken the 0.236 Fib Channel, but we still have 6 hours left for… https://t.co/SLTvnaV79E pic.twitter.com/b09i95BuDH — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 30, 2024 Current Analysis and Short-Term Outlook Egrag’s latest update highlights the following critical elements for XRP’s price movement: Fibonacci Channel Break: XRP has recently broken the 0.236 Fibonacci (Fib) Channel, a significant development. However, Egrag notes that the close of the daily candle will be crucial in determining whether this break is sustainable. The next six hours will clarify whether XRP can maintain this level or if a retracement is likely. Critical Bounce at $2.12: A bounce above $2.12 is essential for XRP to sustain bullish momentum. Closing the daily candle above this level would reinforce positive sentiment and mitigate risks of crashing further. Triangle Formation Breakdown: The systematic triangle formation observed on the chart has broken to the downside. The measured move of this breakdown points to a potential target of $1.67, suggesting caution in the near term. Equilibrium Levels: The equilibrium zone between $1.75 and $1.64 is a critical area to watch. Price consolidation within this range could provide clues about the next significant move. SRSI Accumulation: The Stochastic Relative Strength Index (SRSI) accumulates and signals preparation for a significant price move. While the exact direction remains uncertain, this setup warrants close attention. Long-Term Perspective Egrag’s December 18 analysis offers a broader view of XRP’s potential trajectory across multiple time frames, including monthly, weekly, and daily charts: Monthly Time Frame: The $0.75 zone was identified as a key price expansion target. XRP’s penetration of the 0.236 Fib Channel on the monthly chart is a bullish signal. A monthly candle close above this level would pave the way for targeting the 0.382 Fib Channel, potentially unlocking a rally toward $27 in the long term. Weekly Time Frame: Key weekly candle close levels are critical to XRP’s trajectory . If the price closes below $2.44, the chances of revisiting $2.05 increase significantly. Conversely, a close above $2.60 would enhance the likelihood of testing all-time highs (ATH) and could mark the beginning of a sustained bullish rally. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Daily and 3-Day Time Frames: On shorter time frames, XRP appears to be forming patterns with mixed implications. While the daily chart shows the potential for bullish and bearish outcomes, the 3-day chart hints at a bullish ascending triangle that could break out between December 25 and December 28, targeting $3.288. Implications for XRP Egrag’s analysis underscores the importance of monitoring critical price levels and technical formations. A close above $2.12 in the short term could mitigate bearish risks and restore bullish momentum. However, failure to hold key levels, such as $1.75-$1.64, may lead to further downside. For long-term investors, the monthly and weekly time frames suggest significant upside potential if key resistance levels are breached. The possibility of reaching $27 hinges on sustained momentum and favorable market conditions. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

38446464,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=636373,1735856843,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38446464.jpeg,Could PEPE become the next Dogecoin?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/could-pepe-become-the-next-dogecoin/,"PEPE is following the path of Dogecoin, which it might replace at some level. With Elon Musk’s endorsement and the community’s support, PEPE is ready for the 2025 rally, which looks eerily similar to Dogecoin in 2021. Dogecoin was initiated in 2013 as a joke based on the “Doge” meme, which had a picture of a Shiba Inu dog. For many years it was niche cryptocurrency with no serious backing or purpose, but this all changed with Elon Musk’s involvement. In 2021, Musk began to tweet about Dogecoin, calling it the “people’s crypto” and even gave himself the title of “DogeFather.” Instantly, the price of Dogecoin increased. However, Musk didn’t stop at social media instead, he stepped forward to make Dogecoin useful in real life. Tesla, his electric car company, began to accept Dogecoin as a payment for its merchandise. The space exploration company also did the same. All these developments took Dogecoin from just being a meme into an actual currency which people can use to settle transactions. After Dogecoin, Musk’s influence is now on PEPE. The inspiration for this new meme coin is the “Pepe the Frog” meme, which has been an internet icon for many years. The PEPE token is newer and has a smaller market cap than Dogecoin. He shared a meme of Pepe the Frog, where he stated, “ Explaining Constitutional Amendments.” After that PEPE coin had quickly gained popularity after launching in April. Can PEPE Reach Dogecoin’s Heights? The big question now is whether PEPE can rise to the same level of success as Dogecoin. While PEPE’s market cap is currently much smaller, the coin has been able to show very rapid growth because of Musk’s involvement. In fact, if Musk were to officially back PEPE, this coin would easily be catapulted into astronomical levels of popularity and price, which is a thing that happened to Dogecoin. Some continue to speculate t hat Tesla would accept PEPE as a way to pay for services, bu t until now, there is nothing concrete, although this happening would significantly increase PEPE’s credibility and visibility. However, in all probability, it might require more than the influence of Musk to sustain PEPE. Once again, the hype surrounding the coin is what will make or break PEPE, as in the case of Dogecoin. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that because of the gaffe, PEPE climbed 54.7%. The official PEPE Twitter account even quoted Musk’s tweet, adding a comment about “seizing the memes of production.” Elon Musk’s influence is deemed as crucial since his tweets can cause tremendous price movements in the crypto market. For instance, another meme coin, Milady Meme Coin (LADYS), surged 12,056% in price after Musk’s tweet about it. Another meme coin that shot up due to the influence of Musk was the Kekius Maximus abbreviated as KEKIUS, which rocketed by more than 3,000% since Musk put that name on his Twitter. However, the price of KEKIUS has decreased significantly since Musk changed his profile name. In short, Elon Musk’s tweets and actions frequently send meme coins soaring in price, but can drop just as quickly when the billionaire’s focus turns elsewhere. That Pepe is up 34% since its low in mid-December, with a big boost coming after Elon Musk changed his X profile picture to Pepe the Frog in gladiator attire. This shift from Dogecoin to Pepe increased the coin’s price, from $0.0000144 on December 24 to a high of $0.00002828. It’s now trading around $0.00002025 Analyst comparing it to Dogecoin and predicting it could grow a lot in the 2025 bull market, possibly reaching $40 to $125 billion in value. The coin is even now trading more than Dogecoin in terms of volume, with $3.8 billion in 24-hour trading, compared to Dogecoin’s $1.9 billion. As Pepe’s popularity rises, other Pepe-themed coins are also emerging, like Pepe Unchained, which is launching tools for creating memecoins without coding, and Wall Street Pepe, which is building a platform for memecoin trading and offering rewards. Wall Street Pepe’s presale raised $38.5 million in its first month, benefiting from the hype around Pepe. Analysts are very bullish on PEPE coin, comparing it to Dogecoin’s price action during the 2021 bull run. They believe PEPE is following a similar pattern, with its price rising while Bitcoin breaks its all-time high, and predict that PEPE will continue to climb higher, just like Dogecoin did in 2021. Last year, PEPE’s price movement was similar to Dogecoin’s in 2020, and since then, PEPE’s market cap has skyrocketed from $600 million to over $8 billion. With a year-to-date gain of 1,400%, the rally is just getting started. Crypto analysts are also optimistic, with some pointing out that PEPE is forming a “bull flag” or “bullish pennant” on its chart. These patterns suggest PEPE could keep rising, possibly reaching up to $0.000038 in the near future. Currently, PEPE is cooling off a bit but still trading at around $0.00002017.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD gaining 1.5% on the day, recovering from earlier dips to monthly lows. “Christmas Range has swept both sides for liquidity now,” trader Daan Crypto Trades observed, adding that the $95.8K mid-range level had acted as resistance during recent tests. Accompanying charts highlighted increased trading volume at the range lows, which some traders saw as a bullish signal. Daan Crypto Trades advised keeping an eye on range breakouts to anticipate Bitcoin’s movement over the next couple of weeks. Similarly, trader Jelle noted parallels between this year’s price action and last year’s, suggesting a potential upside resolution. “The similarities are there, with or without another sweep of the lows,” Jelle commented, forecasting a breakout to $130,000–$150,000. Entrepreneur Jason Williams shared a comparable outlook, describing the current price range as an accumulation zone. “$BTC has re-entered the accumulation zone,” Williams posted on X, predicting, “$131.5K+ by Q1 2025 feels inevitable. See you there.” His chart compared the current range to Bitcoin’s behavior after reaching all-time highs in March last year, which eventually led to a significant breakout after several months of consolidation. Market sentiment has turned bullish amid optimism about the return of traditional finance traders. Cole Kennelly, founder of crypto volatility index service Volmex, forecasted a renewed push for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. “My gut tells me the market goes full risk-on and a lot of money piles into crypto, now that end-of-year logistics/rebalancing/etc. is over,” Kennelly stated, anticipating a strong start to the year.

Per our technical indicators, ALGO’s price trend is bullish and the fear and greed index shows greed among investors. Data analysis, however, shows rising activity in decentralized finance applications and stablecoin demand. Why is ALGO up? ALGO is trading at previous highs set in 2022, the recovery could be attributed to the crypto market’s general bullish sentiment which saw its market cap rise above $3.2 trillion. Will ALGO reach $1? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, ALGO will break above $1 in the period ending 2028. Will ALGO reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $10 in the period ending 2030. Will ALGO reach $100? At $100, Algorand market capitalization has to rise above $700 billion from the current $1.2 billion. In comparison, Ethereum’s market capitalization is at $400 billion. Per our price prediction, Algorancd is highly unlikely to reach $100. Does ALGO have a good long-term future? Like most mega-altcoins, Algorand is trading at its lowest level this year. A break below 30 RSI will be crucial to sending it to previous highs. Looking ahead, ALGO will register new all-time highs in the coming years. Is ALGO a good investment? Analysis by Intotheblock shows that 97% of holders are at a loss at the current price. The figure will likely drop lower in the short term. However, as our Cryptopolitan price prediction shows, this will change over the long term. Recent news The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) now offers blockchain education training to 24,000 personnel worldwide, including UNDP, UN Volunteers, and the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF). The training for the academy is in partnership with the Algorand Foundation , an organization focused on enabling an inclusive, decentralized, and borderless global economy.

Algorand historic price sentiment Algorand price history: Coinstats Algorand held its token sale in June 2019 at $2.4 each. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to Coinmarketcap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.637 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. So, in 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.3 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It now trades at $0.13. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.61 in December. It then corrected into 2025 dropping to the $0.4 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-02 23:06:08

Trump 2025 (TRUM2025), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUM2025 is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump 2025 can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump 2025 could become the next viral memecoin. Trump 2025 launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump 2025 on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump 2025 by entering its contract address – 5K2ESM1q2SjZFybttofLFpbbW8yF3isBRW3ZxDPUVfVY – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUM2025. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-02 23:19:00

On this premise, Circle’s Policy Head Patrick Hansen took to X to clear a few of the misconstrued takes. Crypto Exchanges, Travel Rule and MiCA The Circle executive admitted to seeing several post from people who were mixing up EU’s Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR) Travel Rule and the newly implemented MiCA . The former mandates financial service providers to gather and exchange customers data amongst others. The Travel Rule also came into force on December 30, 2024, the same day as MiCA. As a result of its implementation, Hansen said Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) like custodian and brokers are now required to request for more information from users. This applies to both sender and receiver in any transactions. In addition, he added that CASPs are at liberty to exchange this information within themselves. The Circle Policy Head said this info exchange might take place through encrypted channels or travel rule networks like Trust or Notabene. The aim is to ensure that customers are not exposed to scams while trying to complete their crypto transactions. CASPs can also take some more delicate steps, depending on the amount of funds involved. Quick addition since I am seeing a ton of people mixing up EU crypto regulations (MiCA & TFR): Yes, since end of last year, the EU implementation of the travel rule (TFR) is in force as well. The application date (December 30th) was the same as for MICA. Exchanges and other… https://t.co/FYn2RN8Ei7 — Patrick Hansen (@paddi_hansen) January 2, 2025 Specifically, Hansen said CASPs would request that a customer verify ownership of his self-custody wallet once the transaction tops €1,000. Noteworthy, TFR or Travel Rule, like MiCA is designed to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. However, Hansen stated clearly that both rules are entirely unrelated, the major miscommunication among users. MoonPay Secures Approval Under New Regime Several crypto asset service providers are making efforts to ensure that they are not left out of the new crypto regulation dispensation in the EU. Renowned crypto infrastructure service provider MoonPay is one of firms that has taken a monumental stride by securing MiCA approval . By all means, the move aligns with the firm’s expansion plans in Europe. Meanwhile it has also positioned MoonPay as a crypto regulation-compliant entity in Europe. In the past, it has gained significant traction while empowering crypto payments across the region. With this achievement and the continuous bull cycle in 2025, MoonPay is likely to capture more EU market share.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogecoin whales buy millions while adding PropiChain, a hidden altcoin, for significant gains. Table of Contents Dogecoin whales acquire 270 million DOGE Why whales are flocking to PCHAIN’s presale PCHAIN for massive gains in 2025 Dogecoin whales are taking advantage of the recent dip to accumulate DOGE at low prices. They are splashing millions on DOGE and PropiChain (PCHAIN), a real estate tokenization platform. PropiChain’s ongoing presale has attracted smart money and retail investors. After raising over $1 million, PropiChain is set to transform the $300 trillion real estate industry. As whales prepare for 2025, DOGE and PCHAIN have emerged as the best altcoins to invest in. Dogecoin whales acquire 270 million DOGE Dogecoin whales spent nearly $90 million buying 270 million DOGE in 96 hours. Large acquisitions typically occur during market consolidation or price dips, allowing major investors to capitalize. Dogecoin dipped below $0.3, offering whales the opportunity to accumulate. DOGE has since risen to $0.3198, marking a 12.4% increase in the past week. Analysts are optimistic Dogecoin could reclaim the $0.35 mark in Q1 2025. However, others have sounded the alarm, claiming that DOGE has reached its local top and could see further selling pressure. Why whales are flocking to PCHAIN’s presale Dogecoin whales have joined smart money and retail traders in investing in PropiChain during its ongoing presale. The real estate altcoin is on course to surge 30,000% in 2025, making it a top crypto to invest in. At only $0.011, PCHAIN has an attractive point as it is near its possible lowest-ever price. This makes it easy for early investors to earn substantial gains after listing on exchanges. Yet, PCHAIN’s appeal lies in its value proposition. As a real estate tokenization platform, PropiChain will support fractional ownership of properties. This will allow multiple investors to own a single property, opening the industry to many investors. PropiChain’s users can also sell portions of their properties to raise capital. Investors are also impressed by PCHAIN’s use of AI to simplify property investing and management. The platform will use AI to conduct predictive market analysis, enabling users to identify patterns and predict future market behaviors. This will give them an edge over their peers as they can easily make data-driven, smart decisions. The platform will also take property valuations to the next level using automated valuation models (AVMs). AVMs will provide accurate valuations of properties, enabling buyers and sellers to get fair deals.

This process will remove manual work and third-party intermediaries, making transactions cheaper and faster. The project has had its smart contract audited by BlockAudit to make it safe for investors and users. Another important feature that investors appreciate is remote property tours using the metaverse. This allows investors to view and stage properties virtually, making it easier for them to make buying decisions. Dogecoin whales are betting on PCHAIN because they expect the real estate altcoin to be the biggest winner in 2025. Its growing community of investors highlights its strong potential for long-term growth. On the other hand, Dogecoin has already experienced significant upside, meaning it has limited room for an explosive rally. PCHAIN for massive gains in 2025 In the past week, whales have accumulated PCHAIN during its ongoing token presale. The real estate altcoin has already progressed to the second round, earning early investors a 200% gain. The project is on course to surge 30,000% in 2025 thanks to its tokenomics, incentives, and value proposition. The project secured a CoinMarketCap listing , adding layers of transparency and credibility. With over $1 million raised during the presale, PropiChain is expected to bring more investors on board.

LINK surged 20% in December, TON nears $7.2 resistance, and Lunex Network gains attention for its innovative DeFi features and investor appeal. December 2024 has been an eventful month for cryptocurrencies. LINK surged 20% to hit $30.94, while TON showed signs of breaking through resistance at $7.198. Investors are buzzing with optimism about the future, especially with Lunex Network stepping in to shake up the DeFi game. Offering innovative features and a focus on rewards, Lunex Network is turning heads for those who love to HODL and watch their investments grow. Lunex is the future of DeFi Lunex Network is turning heads in the DeFi space by enhancing crypto trading. It offers cross-chain liquidity linking over 50 blockchains and 50,000 trading pairs, addressing fragmentation issues and giving traders a broad range of options. The platform boosts security with a non-custodial wallet, ensuring users have full control over their assets. Additionally, its unified asset tracker simplifies portfolio management across more than 40 blockchains, making it easier to monitor holdings efficiently. The deflationary token model is another standout feature. LNEX’s price has already surged 380% during the presale, reaching $0.0049. This system, paired with strategic token buybacks and burns, supports long-term value growth. Lunex also offers attractive staking options, with up to 18% APY, appealing to both passive and active investors. Usability and scalability are central to Lunex’s appeal.

With its focus on rewards, innovation, and seamless functionality, Lunex is positioned as a top choice for those looking to hold and benefit from the growing DeFi market. It could be gearing up as the next big breakout. Chainlink (LINK) prediction and insights LINK has grabbed attention this December with a 20% surge, hitting a peak of $30.94. Analysts remain optimistic, with a Chainlink price prediction suggesting it could close 2024 at $13 and possibly soar to $40 by 2025. Despite recent corrections, investor sentiment around LINK stays strong, fueled by its growing market relevance. Some analysts highlight LINK’s strong investor sentiment despite a 15% correction in December. LINK’s price movements reflect renewed buying interest, supported by technical indicators and market fundamentals. With predictions suggesting a potential rise to $40 by 2025, LINK continues to be seen as a promising long-term investment. Toncoin’s December performance and future TON is showing promise this December, with analysts suggesting it could break resistance at $7.198 and push toward $8. Investor confidence is rising as TON’s exchange supply has dropped from 1.91 million to 1.85 million, indicating lower selling pressure. Technically, TON has recovered well, with its RSI bouncing back to 47 from a low of 18 earlier in the month. Analysts point to TON’s rising social and market activity as a key driver of its bullish momentum. Topping engagement charts in December, this surge reflects increased interest within the crypto community. Such heightened activity often precedes strong price action, suggesting TON could maintain its upward trajectory into 2025. Conclusion LINK and TON show potential but face mixed prospects. Lunex Network, with its token buybacks and burns, actively reduces LNEX supply, boosting long-term value for investors. Its innovative features make it a standout choice.

The duo spoke in the wake of a tumultuous end to 2024 in South Korea.

This led many South Korean and overseas shareholders to sell off their holdings amid talk of a stock market exodus. Kim said: “Let’s make 2025 the year when the foreign and domestic investors who left the market return.” The Financial Services Commission Chairman Kim Byung-hwan speaking to reporters in 2024.

The FSC appears ready to take up the mantle, however, with lawmakers “pausing” crypto legislation talks until the political turmoil abates . “We will institutionalize STOs to diversify the securities issuance and distribution system. […] We will reorganize the entire system. That will let comprehensive financial investment businesses perform their original role of providing corporate finance and venture capital.” Financial Services Commission Chairman Kim Byung-hwan “Last year, our capital market experienced considerable difficulties. The growth potential of our companies weakened due to the contraction of the domestic economy and an export slowdown. The market showed considerably sluggishness compared to major countries due to global conflicts and domestic political events.” Korea Exchange Chairman Jeong Eun-bo The FSC chief appealed to lawmakers, the ruling People’s Power Party, and corporate stock market investors to work together toward a common goal. He urged: “Although we are starting this year in difficult circumstances, the government, the National Assembly, and corporate investors should all work together. As one, we can make 2025 the year when both the overseas and South Korean investors who have exited our market make their return.” Late last year, Jeong said it was time for regulators to remove obstacles to adoption and called for South Korea to “institutionalize” crypto .

Here Are The Major Support And Resistances To Watch Out For,https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-to-0-000045/,"Technical analysis shows that Shiba Inu is currently at a critical juncture where it could either rebound to new multi-year highs or face declines to retest a few support levels. In light of this, a recent analysis on TradingView has highlighted crucial support and resistance levels that could dictate SHIB’s short-term movements. This analysis was made on the daily candlestick timeframe chart of SHIB against Tether (USDT), which reveals the potential for a substantial rally toward $0.000045 if key resistance levels are broken. Major Support And Resistance Levels For Shiba Inu According to the analysis, two significant resistance levels are important in SHIB’s path to the upside. The first is at $0.00003239 and represents an immediate hurdle that could attract sellers or trigger profit-taking. This is more revealing, considering it acted as resistance in December 2024. A decisive move above this level would signal bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Flag Pattern Says Crash Is Far From Over Despite Crash To $91,000 The second resistance level is at $0.00004563 and is considered a psychologically significant barrier that might test the strength of market optimism. This is because this price level serves as the peak of Shiba Inu’s price movement in early 2024. If the bulls were to complete a successful move above $0.00004563, it could signal a move that would push Shiba Inu to challenge its current all-time high. On the downside, there are also two critical support levels that could prevent further SHIB price declines. The first notable support is at $0.00001035. Shiba Inu rebounded quite a few times on the upper end of this support zone in 2024, with the most notable bounce taking place on August 5. Historically, this level has demonstrated strong buy interest, making it a potential floor for the current trend. However, if the price fails to hold above this critical support level, the situation could shift significantly. A break below $0.00001035 would likely diminish buyer confidence, paving the way for SHIB to test even lower levels of support. Technical Indicators And SHIB Trading Strategy The analysis notes that key indicators, such as the MACD and RSI, currently suggest a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment for Shiba Inu. The MACD is flat with minimal momentum, while the RSI hovers near 40, slightly below the midpoint. These indicators, coupled with subdued trading volume, suggest that traders are awaiting a decisive breakout or break below the Shiba Inu price.

Conversely, a break below $0.00001035 could reinforce a bearish scenario. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00002239 and is up by 8% in the past 24 hours. According to a similar support level analysis by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the $0.0000215 to $0.0000193 support zone must hold in order for Shiba Inu to stay bullish.

This includes securities fraud and money laundering conspiracy, all brought upon him by federal prosecutors in Manhattan. Since the crypto firm plunged in 2022, Kwon has been accused of playing a major role in misleading investors. Do Kwon Misled Crypto Investors He failed to reveal the true state, stability, and security of the US dollar-pegged stablecoin TerraUSD. Instead, he informed unsuspecting investors that TerraUSD’s price slip could be addressed by an algorithm known as the “Terra Protocol.” To cover up for his deceit, Kwon allegedly allied with a high-frequency trading firm to inject millions into the ecosystem to sustain TerraUSD’s value artificially. Unfortunately, it did not turn out as he expected. TerraUSD crashed intensely and left the broader cryptocurrency industry in a huge deficit. In other words, it rippled over and led to the devaluation of Luna and widespread disruptions across the cryptocurrency market. Do Kwon’s Extradition Causes a Ruckus So far, the Terraform Labs executive has been faced with a series of legal proceedings. A few back and forth have occurred in the past few months concerning his extradition. While he committed fraud in South Korea, Kwon was arrested in Montenegro for traveling on a fake passport. Hence, many discussions have been held about his extradition. Last week, Montenegro’s Constitutional Court reportedly dismissed his appeal , citing some legal inconsistencies. For background, Do Kwon appealed his extradition to Montenegro and accused the court of procedural unfairness and violations of his rights. Montenegro Court Rules in Favour of US In the following days, Montenegro’s Justice Minister, Bojan Božović, signed off on Kwon’s extradition in favor of the US. The authorities have devoted time and resources to evaluating requests from both the United States and South Korea. As part of this review, factors like the seriousness of the crimes and the order of requests were considered. Do Kwon’s extradition add to the growing list of legal actions levied on top crypto leaders? Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is serving his 25-year jail term at a federal prison in Mendota, California. Though he pleaded “not guilty,” his conviction could lead to an extension of his prison sentence.

Both platforms have been making significant progress—Render by incorporating AI cryptocurrency technologies in decentralized GPU rendering and Injective by pioneering new DeFi scalability solutions. The rising price of Injective is a clear barometer of its increasing acceptance in finance-related applications. Yet, amidst these technological strides, Web3Bay shines as a high ROI cryptocurrency with vast potential for the long haul. Positioned to revolutionize Web3 commerce, Web3Bay melds decentralized e-commerce with groundbreaking payment options and user governance. Its strategy to integrate DeFi, NFTs, and cross-chain functionalities provides a utility that may surpass other contenders. For investors hunting for both profitability and practicality, Web3Bay’s blueprint for decentralized shopping distinguishes it as an exceptional choice. Web3Bay: The High ROI Crypto Transforming Web3 Commerce Web3Bay is laying the groundwork for a revolutionary shift in e-commerce by harmonizing blockchain technology with the simplicity of online shopping. Tailored for both cryptocurrency enthusiasts and mainstream consumers, it seeks to remove intermediaries, reduce fees, and secure transactions. Its versatile dual payment system, accepting both crypto and traditional methods like PayPal, broadens its appeal. For those keen on enriching their portfolio with a high ROI crypto, Web3Bay promises enduring value through a dynamic mix of functionality and forward-looking design. The active presale of Web3Bay’s 3BAY token aims to offer exponential returns for early investors. Launching at $0.003 per token, the price is set to climb by 15% in each successive stage, targeting $0.1959 in the final round. This pricing model has captured significant attention, with early participants potentially reaping returns exceeding 6430%. So far, the presale has sold over 56 million tokens and has raised more than $183,000, with the tokens now priced at $0.00345. As a governance token, 3BAY not only powers transactions but also empowers owners to influence the platform’s evolution, boosting its attractiveness as a high ROI crypto. Looking ahead, Web3Bay plans to incorporate NFTs, DeFi staking, and cross-chain functionalities. These enhancements aim to cement its status in the decentralized commerce arena. By marrying long-term utility with immediate financial upside, Web3Bay is gaining notice among both investors and crypto aficionados. Render Network: Leading AI Crypto Innovations Render Network is spearheading decentralized GPU rendering, offering a cost-effective platform for creators across film, gaming, and virtual reality sectors. By integrating AI cryptocurrency technologies, it efficiently utilizes dormant GPU power, making intricate rendering tasks more manageable and economical. Its Burn and Mint Equilibrium (BME) model ensures economic stability by balancing token supply with demand, facilitating predictable pricing for rendering and AI operations. The network is broadening its ecosystem, having recently partnered with major players like Stability AI and incorporating tools such as Blender’s Cycles. Users now benefit from the convenience of downloading completed projects directly to storage services like AWS. Priced at $6.88, the RNDR token reflects Render’s commitment to scalability and AI cryptocurrency applications, positioning it as a versatile choice for content creators and developers. Injective Price Grows with DeFi Expansion Injective is bolstering its position within the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, providing a scalable layer-1 blockchain suited for derivatives, prediction markets, and broad financial services. Priced at $20.61, the Injective token reflects its rising adoption, fueled by innovations like the inEVM layer-2 solution, which integrates Ethereum-based applications seamlessly. The introduction of tokenized real-world assets and yield-generating stablecoins like USDM expands its user base. Recent developments, including the Helix Institutional platform, target financial entities by offering secure environments for trading derivatives, indices, and more. Injective’s strategy to blend DeFi with AI cryptocurrency ventures opens avenues for automated, intelligent trading systems, indicating strong potential for enduring growth. In Conclusion Render and Injective are blazing trails in blockchain innovation with their respective focuses on AI cryptocurrency and DeFi. Render’s commitment to decentralized GPU rendering and Injective’s scalable financial solutions underscore their respective strengths. However, Web3Bay offers a distinctive advantage with its practical applications in Web3 commerce. As a high ROI cryptocurrency , it merges potential profitability with sustainable growth through initiatives like its 3BAY token presale and forthcoming DeFi and NFT integrations. For those seeking utility and robust returns, Web3Bay’s approach to decentralized commerce presents it as the superior option over its peers.

SUI’s trading volume surged to $10.45 billion in December, marking its seventh consecutive all-time high and showcasing a strong trend in decentralised trading. Meanwhile, anticipation builds for the potential approval of a Solana ETF in 2025, signaling a pivotal moment for alternative cryptocurrency investment tools. Lastly, BlockDAG (BDAG) is redefining engagement with its TG Tap Miner game and X1 Miner app, which together boast 405K active users. Named the best crypto miner app, the X1 Miner enables users to earn BDAG effortlessly. This coin has already risen by 2240% and shows immense potential for growth in 2025. SUI Trading Volume Reaches New Heights in December SUI trading volume reached an impressive $10.45 billion in December, setting a new all-time high for the seventh consecutive month. This achievement reflects sustained activity in decentralised trading, bolstered by a 21% price increase during a challenging market period. With key resistance at $4.80 and support at $3.00, traders are closely monitoring potential breakout opportunities. This surge in SUI’s trading volume highlights a strong trend in investor engagement, with 77% of dYdX traders taking long positions. While technical indicators suggest short-term adjustments, the consistent growth in trading volume points to the potential for continued upward movement in SUI’s valuation. Insiders Anticipate Solana ETF Approval in 2025 The approval of a Solana ETF is widely anticipated for 2025, as industry experts, including ETF Store President Nate Geraci , cite potential regulatory shifts in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While applications for a Solana ETF were submitted earlier this year, no launch occurred in 2024. This delay positions 2025 as a pivotal year for the introduction of this financial product. The demand for crypto ETFs remains robust, evidenced by eight of the top ETF launches in 2024 being crypto-related. A Solana ETF could further establish its ecosystem, which has already seen increased activity and competitive trading volumes. Earning Made Easy with BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner & X1 App BlockDAG combines engaging gameplay and accessible mobile mining to create a vibrant ecosystem for its users. The TG Tap Miner fosters community participation, with over 105,000 active players earning Tap Points through a fun and straightforward Telegram game. Players burst different types of balls, with rarer balls offering higher points, creating a competitive and rewarding experience. These points hold real value, as they can be converted into BDAG coins once the BlockDAG blockchain goes live. Taking a step beyond gaming, the BlockDAG X1 Miner app provides a simple way to earn BDAG coins daily. With over 300,000 active users using the app, it is widely regarded as the best crypto miner app—available on iOS and Android. The app allows users to mine up to 20 BDAG coins per day through a user-friendly interface. Its innovative Proof-of-Engagement algorithm rewards daily activity with features like a lightning button to boost mining rates. Unlike traditional mining setups requiring extensive hardware, the X1 Miner is lightweight and energy-efficient, making crypto mining accessible to anyone. Together, these apps create a seamless link between user activity and coin accumulation. The coins earned through these platforms represent a significant opportunity, as BDAG’s presale has raised $174.5 million. With a 2240% increase in value since its first batch, BDAG has grown from $0.001 to $0.0234, supported by a passionate community. Over 17.6 billion coins have been sold, making this the largest presale in the market. As the blockchain launch nears, the TG Tap Miner game and X1 Miner promote adoption and position BlockDAG as a leader in the decentralized movement. Final Thoughts As the SUI trading volume continues its record-breaking streak, its growing decentralised activity signals a promising upward trajectory for the token. The anticipated approval of the Solana ETF in 2025 could open new doors for alternative crypto investments, solidifying its market presence. However, BlockDAG shines brightest with its TG Tap Miner game on Telegram and X1 Miner app on iOS and Android, widely regarded as the best crypto mining app in the market. With BDAG’s value skyrocketing by 2240% and its presale already the largest in the market, these mining tools provide early access to the BDAG coin, which is poised for significant growth in 2025.

Dogecoin has no maximum supply, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute. While initially dismissed as a joke, Dogecoin’s value skyrocketed in 2021, fueled by viral social media campaigns and high-profile endorsements. Dogecoin’s strength lies in its dedicated community and widespread recognition, making it one of the most well-known altcoins in the market. Its appeal fluctuates with market trends, but its growing popularity highlights the power of online communities to shape the crypto landscape. As a result, Dogecoin continues to be a notable player in the evolving world of alternative cryptocurrencies. Conclusion While coins like DOGE show less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out. Designed for those seeking success, it’s expected to grow 700% by the end of presale, with potential thousand-fold returns this altcoin season.

The coin gained popularity after a tweet by Elon Musk featuring BabyDoge as an adorable icon. Its primary utility is building a fun community and promoting animal welfare. The BabyDoge AI image generator allows users to create AI-generated BabyDoge characters, memes, and images without design experience; users can pay in BabyDoge to mint these images into NFTs. The project has donated over 81,000 pounds of dog food, holding an official world record for helping save dogs. BabyDogeSwap.com offers features like AMM, farms, token locker, burn portal, card, AI image generator, NFTs, and more. The coin’s focus on community and technology may attract interest in the current market cycle. CATSLAP: Challenging the market CATSLAP introduces the SLAP token as an aggressive entrant in the meme coin sector. Aiming to surpass established meme coins symbolized by frogs and dogs, SLAP seeks to capture attention with its unique approach. The platform encourages users, known as “Slappers,” to compete for high scores and elevate their country’s ranking on the “Slapometer.” This gamified aspect engages the community and adds a competitive edge. In the current market cycle, CATSLAP’s strategy to differentiate itself may appeal to those interested in emerging technologies within the crypto space. Conclusion While BabyDoge and SLAP may have less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to all. Offering a 700% ROI during its presale and triple utility features — governance, rewards, and staking — Catzilla invites enthusiasts to join the battle against crypto villains and reach new heights together.

Table of Contents Rollblock: Revolutionizing the $450B gambling sector through crypto Analyzing Dogecoin as a buy for 2025 Rollblock going strong into 2025 Trump’s presidency has positioned the crypto market for a major rally at the close of 2024. One decision, however, gave Dogecoin an edge over other coins: the establishment of the D.O.G.E. department in collaboration with Elon Musk. This department ignited Dogecoin’s surge, making it one of the top performers of 2024. Despite this, analysts predict that Rollblock is set to outshine Dogecoin in 2025. Rollblock: Revolutionizing the $450B gambling sector through crypto Rollblock’s main goal is to bring blockchain technology into the $450 billion gambling industry, removing issues that have plagued the industry for decades. Instead of dealing with hacks, the misuse of funds and fixed bets, Rollblock uses blockchain’s transparency and security to enhance the gaming experience. The project is already succeeding, raising over $8 million during its presale. Unlike other Web3 casinos, Rollblock takes security and compliance to a whole other level. With a Gaming Anjouan and a SolidProof audit, Rollblock can assure maximum security for both regular players and investors. The GambleFi protocol offers more than 7,000 games from more than 10 gaming providers, as well as newly introduced sports betting on major markets such as soccer, golf, and MMA. RBLK powers Rollblock’s ecosystem. The GambleFi protocol will use up to 30% of its revenue to buy tokens from the open market. From those tokens, 40% will be used as rewards for staking, and the rest will be burned to make RBLK deflationary. Currently in its ninth presale stage, analysts predict a bright future for the token. Some say that once RBLK hits the market, early investors will see a 100x return from its current price of $0.044. This prediction is fueled by Rollblock’s focus on utility. You might also like: 3 cryptos set to make new ATHs in January: XRP, RBLK and HBAR Analyzing Dogecoin as a buy for 2025 Dogecoin has seen a turbulent few weeks with recent challenges, including a vulnerability that caused a significant crash on its network. Despite this, the token has remained resilient, and many analysts maintain a bullish outlook for its future. Currently trading at $0.30930, Dogecoin has experienced a remarkable 245% gain in 2024, with hopes for further growth heading into the new year. A prominent market commentator, Ali Martinez, has consistently reiterated his ambitious price target for Dogecoin, forecasting a potential rally to as high as $18. While such a projection seems extraordinary, it’s grounded in the token’s previous price action. DOGE saw massive gains in the past, rallying 5,000% in 2017 and 12,000% in 2021. However, reactions from the market have been mixed, with critics arguing that an $18 price point would require a market capitalization of $2.65 trillion, far exceeding the market cap of Bitcoin. Nevertheless, even more conservative predictions of $4 still represent substantial upside and reflect the growing optimism for Dogecoin’s future. Rollblock going strong into 2025 Compared to Dogecoin, which lacks fundamental value and relies solely on capital gains, Rollblock is integrated into a robust ecosystem that leverages a market expected to reach $750 billion by 2028. This makes Rollblock a stronger contender for the 2025 altcoin season, offering far greater utility and significantly increasing the potential for a 100x return. With tokens currently priced at $0.044, this could be the perfect time to seize this opportunity before prices rise in the coming weeks.

Table of Contents Shiba Inu set for massive surge, analysts eye $0.000081 with rising burn rate Rexas Finance to yield 26,050% returns through real-world asset tokenization momentum Conclusion As 2024 comes to a close, there has been significant excitement in the crypto community. A leading analyst has made a bold prediction for 2025, suggesting that two tokens — Shiba Inu and a SHIB alternative focused on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization — could experience a surge of up to 26,050%. The new token in question is Rexas Finance , currently in its presale stage 11. Each token is priced at $0.175; in the next stage, the price will increase to $0.20. Shiba Inu set for massive surge, analysts eye $0.000081 with rising burn rate While trading at around $0.00002313, Shiba Inu still has room to push higher, and analysts have their hopes up. According to the analysis, SHIB can surge 234%, with a target price of $0.000081. This optimism comes with increased trading volume and a massive spike in the token’s burn rate. #ShibaInu Rebounds Strongly, Analysts Predict 234% Surge Toward $0.000081 $SHIB https://t.co/cvX6q1Mrmq — ChainAffairs ⚡ (@ChainAffairs) December 25, 2024 Rexas Finance to yield 26,050% returns through real-world asset tokenization momentum From the world of asset tokenization, Rexas Finance is carving out its niche in crypto. Currently, in Stage 11 of its presale, RXS is at $0.175, with the next stage bumping the price to $0.200. This presale has gained broad interest, already making $33,569,339 out of its $41 million goal. Platforms like Rexas Finance can fully meet the needs of investors looking to diversify their crypto portfolio further and enter the sphere of real estate or art. However, RWA tokenization has a market opportunity of one trillion dollars so that RXS could be at the confluence of this change. The exciting thing about RXS is the innovation and the huge potential gain. Since RXS is valued at $0.175 right now and historical data from other similar projects indicates that with rising adoption and changing market dynamics, projects of this nature could yield profits greater than 26050%, several experts believe this is a highly likely outcome. As blockchain technology breakthroughs continue to evolve, Rexas Finance is committed to helping improve liquidity and accessibility within the crypto ecosystem. If more and more investors understand that real-world assets can now be tokenized and tradable, demand for RXS may skyrocket. Additionally, RXS recently had an audit carried out by Certik and is now listed on leading trading platforms such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, making it increasingly visible to potential investors. Conclusion Analysts are coming out with predictions that SHIB could surge by 234% ROI and Rexas Finance a whooping 26,050%. It is clear that RXS investors stand to gain more than Shiba Inu. With its presale making alot of momentum, completing stages before its schedule, buying the presale at stage 11 could be a great addition to crypto portfolios.

They’ve evolved from internet inside jokes to legitimate financial opportunities, and the buzz? Oh, it’s louder than ever. Among the sea of LOL-worthy tokens, a few stand out as the best meme coins to buy today: BTFD Coin, Popcat, and Moo Deng. Trust me, you don’t want to sleep on these. Let’s start with the headliner, BTFD Coin . This one’s not just about memes — it’s about a lifestyle. As of now, BTFD Coin is in its 13th presale stage, priced at $0.000142.

Enter Popcat and Moo Deng, two coins that bring their own flavour to the mix. Stick around as we break down why these three projects are stealing the spotlight. BTFD Coin: Owning the Meme Coin Scene BTFD Coin isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s a rallying cry. BTFD Coin’s P2E game, in its entirety, is live, enabling players to experience the game and receive rewards. The name stands for “Buy The Dip,” and it’s here to remind you to seize the moment in market downturns.

Popcat: A Meme Coin That’s Purr-fectly Unique Next up, we have Popcat. If you’ve ever wasted hours on the viral Popcat game, you already know the drill. This token takes inspiration from the meme-famous feline with its signature wide-mouthed “pop.” But don’t let the silliness fool you — there’s more to this coin than adorable nostalgia. Popcat’s entire ecosystem revolves around fun. The developers have integrated mini-games and leaderboards into their platform, rewarding active players with tokens. Think of it as the Pokemon Go of crypto — except instead of catching Pikachu, you’re stacking Popcat tokens. What sets Popcat apart is its community. It’s a place where gamers, meme lovers, and crypto enthusiasts collide. The project’s roadmap includes partnerships with influencers and limited-edition NFT drops, keeping the excitement purring along. If you’re into playful vibes but still want a project with serious potential, Popcat is the one to watch. Moo Deng: The Bull Market’s New Bestie Lastly, let’s talk about Moo Deng, a meme coin with a name that’s a cheeky nod to farming and finance. This cow-themed crypto isn’t just about cute bovines; it’s also packed with features that make it a top-tier contender. Moo Deng integrates farming-inspired terminology with real-world decentralised finance (DeFi) applications. Users can “graze” their coins in liquidity pools, earning passive rewards while the tokenomics do their magic. The team behind Moo Deng knows how to milk (pun intended) the meme potential. From hilarious Twitter campaigns to viral TikToks, they’ve turned their marketing strategy into an art form. One thing that sets Moo Deng apart is its commitment to sustainability. The project donates a portion of its proceeds to environmental causes, making it a feel-good investment for eco-conscious crypto fans. Moo Deng proves that even in the world of memes, there’s room for meaningful impact. Final Words: Why These Three Are the Best Meme Coins to Buy Today When it comes to meme coins, it’s all about finding the balance between fun and functionality. BTFD Coin, with its robust rewards program and skyrocketing presale stats, is the clear leader. Popcat brings a playful twist with its gamified ecosystem, while Moo Deng combines humour with heart through its DeFi features and eco-friendly initiatives.

Table of Contents Pepe and DOGS: Promising meme coins for January 2025 Lightchain AI: A low-cap gem with high potential Why these altcoins could be the top picks for early 2025 January presents a golden opportunity for investors looking to diversify their portfolios with high-potential altcoins. Leading the pack are meme favorites Pepe and DOGS, which continue to gain momentum with their strong community backing and robust market performance. Adding to the excitement is the low-cap gem Lightchain AI , a platform looking to merge blockchain and AI. With its Lightchain AI presale offering discounted tokens, the project is set to disrupt decentralized AI with unique features and scalability. These altcoins combine hype, utility, and early adoption potential, making them standout picks this month. Pepe and DOGS: Promising meme coins for January 2025 As of December 2024, both PEPE and DOGE have demonstrated significant growth, positioning them as promising meme coins for January 2025. PEPE coin Launched in April 2023, PEPE is an ERC-20 token inspired by the popular “Pepe the Frog” meme. Despite its humorous origins, PEPE has garnered substantial attention, reaching a market capitalization exceeding $11 billion by December 2024. This surge is attributed to its strong community support and viral appeal. Analysts predict that PEPE could experience further appreciation, potentially reaching $0.00002 in the first quarter of 2025 and $0.00005 by year’s end. DOGE Originally created as a joke, Dogecoin has evolved into a widely recognized cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of approximately $23.3 billion as of November 2024. Its enduring popularity is largely due to its active community and endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. DOGE’s low transaction fees and fast processing times have also contributed to its adoption as a payment method by various businesses. Investment considerations While PEPE and DOGE have shown impressive growth, it’s important to recognize that meme coins are highly speculative and volatile. Their value is often driven by market sentiment and social media trends rather than fundamental utility. Investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before considering investments in these cryptocurrencies.

These changes hope to make Lightchain AI a top name in AI and blockchain. Investors must see that while Lightchain AI shows big growth potential it is still an unsure buy. Doing deep research and checking risk levels are key before putting money in. Why these altcoins could be the top picks for early 2025 As the crypto market evolves, certain altcoins are emerging as standout investments for early 2025 due to their unique propositions and growth potential. Pepe and DOGS continue to thrive in the meme coin space, leveraging strong communities and consistent market activity. However, the real disruptor is Lightchain AI, a next-gen platform combining blockchain and artificial intelligence.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. 1Fuel’s vision sets a new standard, challenging the dominance of PEPE and XRP. Table of Contents Why 1Fuel is a game changer in the crypto world PEPE’s viral appeal XRP’s institutional use cases vs. 1Fuel’s vision Conclusion The story of meme coins in 2024 would not be complete without mentioning the viral rise of PEPE, which hit its all-time high in December. In other news, the institutional use cases Ripple (XRP) offers have maintained the demand for the coin as one of the best cryptocurrencies. However, there is a new sheriff in town, 1Fuel. The presale for 1Fuel is already gathering steam as analysts predict the new token to grow up to 100x in 2025. Investors are paying attention because of its multi-chain technology and attractive presale prices which position it among the best cryptocurrencies to buy. Why 1Fuel is a game changer in the crypto world 1FUEL aims to simplify cryptocurrency access by eliminating technical barriers and providing a wallet that automates complex processes, ensuring top-tier security and privacy. It is designed to enhance the cryptocurrency experience for both novice and experienced traders. 1FUEL’s one-click solution will allow users to select the coin they wish to buy or transact with, eliminating the need to hold multiple cryptocurrencies for transactions on different networks. The unique features, advanced security protocols, privacy enhancements, peer-to-peer exchange, and seamless integration with traditional financial systems make it a transformative and accessible wallet on the market. Interested investors can secure 1Fuel tokens via presale. PEPE’s viral appeal As a deflationary meme coin, PEPE was launched on Ethereum. By enacting a tax-free policy and being transparent about its lack of utility, PEPE appeals to the cryptocurrency community and maintains its meme coin simplicity. On November 13th, the 24-hour trade volume of PEPE reached a massive $15.69 billion. The institutional utility that 1Fuel is expected to provide is absent with PEPE. The project is based on strong utility and a distinct cross-chain transaction vision. It distinguishes itself from the meme currency craze with its creative privacy mixer, cold storage options, and P2P exchange, providing investors with actual benefits. XRP’s institutional use cases vs. 1Fuel’s vision Ripple, a blockchain-based digital payment project, has developed a network and protocol using the cryptocurrency XRP and the XRP Ledger. XRP’s institutional collaborations and contribution to the easing of cross-border payments have long been acknowledged. In 2025, Japanese banks are expected to adopt XRP, which would simplify cross-border payments and remittances while lowering consumer expenses. Approximately 80% of all Japanese institutions will adopt Ripple’s XRP for cross-border payments and remittances. However, a strong alternative is provided by 1Fuel’s multi-chain technology with staking incentives of up to 30% APR. Individual investors are given full ownership over their assets by 1Fuel, whereas XRP concentrates on financial institutions. 1Fuel’s smart contracts, which have been independently verified for security, will provide a smooth and reliable experience. Conclusion 1Fuel’s virality in 2025 has been predicted by analysts. This, coupled with its multi-chain vision, makes it among the best cryptocurrency to buy in 2025.

This development marks a collaboration between traditional financial institutions and decentralized blockchain ecosystems, offering users a stable and yield-bearing digital asset option. BlackRock BUIDL Fund Becomes Backing Asset for frxUSD The Frax community has passed FIP-418, a governance proposal that enables BlackRock’s United States Dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) as collateral for the frxUSD stablecoin. The vote which took six days garnered full support from the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). To this end, Frax Finance stated that BUIDL will function as the ‘custodian asset’ for the creation and creation of frxUSD. The Fund, however, invests in fairly liquid instruments including cash, U.S Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. Frax founder Sam Kazemian said; “frxUSD is a bridge between the blockchain world with its openness and programmability and BlackRock’s prime treasury products with their credibility.” BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, which has as of now more than $648 million in AUM, expects to minimize counterparty risk while maximizing frxUSD holders’ yield opportunities. This decision is in line with the recent development in the stablecoin market that has seen the adoption of real-world asset (RWA) backing. Features of the Frax Finance’s frxUSD Stablecoin The newly launched frxUSD stablecoin is pegged to the U.S. dollar on a 1:1 ratio which forms a good condition for price stability for the users. Frax Finance has integrated with Paxos in order to allow the conversion of frxUSD directly into fiat currency. Furthermore, the frxUSD holders shall receive distribution from the yield generated from the underlying assets within the tokenized fund. The initiative comes as part of the Frax Finance’s strategy to bring traditional finance products into the world of decentralized finance. The company also unveiled its intention to apply for access to the US Federal Reserve Master Account that would make frxUSD useful in the regulated markets. Growing Adoption of BUIDL-Backed Stablecoins Frax’s frxUSD is the newest in a line of stablecoins whose value is anchored to BlackRock’s BUIDL token. Ethena Labs has introduced its own asset-backed stablecoin, USDtb, in December 2024 to be backed by BUIDL. The stablecoin has a market capitalization of $70 million and is intended to mitigate the volatility associated with synthetic dollar offerings in volatile market conditions. Similarly, in the decentralized exchange, Curve Finance, users have been able to mint Elixir’s deUSD stablecoin using BUIDL as collateral. Such advancements suggest that more tokenized funds are being used, particularly for the collateral of stablecoins such as BUIDL. On the same note, the introduction of frxUSD is timely given that the stablecoin market is in the process of transformation following shifts in the regulatory environment. The Markets in Crypto-Assets ( MiCA ) regulation of the European Union came into force in its entirety on December 30, 2024, and has set new standards for stablecoin issuers. At the same time, BlackRock’s participation in the tokenized assets market proves that traditional financial institutions are gradually stepping in to connect Web3 and traditional finance. With $10.4 trillion in assets under management, BlackRock’s participation in the digital asset space inclusive of Bitcoin ETF record achievements is viewed as a step toward broader institutional acceptance of blockchain-based financial products.

New Year New Shiba (NEWSHIBA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to surge over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because NEWSHIBA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, New Year New Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and New Year New Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. New Year New Shiba launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy New Year New Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for New Year New Shiba by entering its contract address – 7DjEUoHG7Yr3LpaqNPcyc5DgNEYSLrnPV8zsjQBbAYfh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like NEWSHIBA.

As Bitcoin approaches this key level, data shows that the top crypto has shown mixed signals across key market indicators, reflecting a subtle yet significant shift in investor sentiment. Particularly, analysts have identified specific patterns in funding rates and premium metrics, which serve as vital tools for interpreting market sentiment and predicting potential price movements. Related Reading: Bitcoin Decline Continues: Is $86,800 The Level To Watch? Bitcoin Current Funding Rates And What It Signals A notable observation by CryptoQuant analyst Mignolet highlights how funding rate movements reflect retail investor sentiment. According to Mignolet analysis, funding rates, which represent the cost of holding long or short positions in perpetual futures contracts, are exhibiting nuanced movements. Historically, during moments of strong resistance, funding rates tend to decline, signaling subdued sentiment and caution among investors. In late October 2024, when Bitcoin was approaching its all-time high, funding rates showed similar behavior, reflecting investor hesitation despite rising prices. However, the current scenario presents a contrasting sentiment. The analyst disclosed that while corrective price movements have emerged, investors are viewing these pullbacks as buying opportunities rather than reasons for fear or contraction. This subtle psychological difference could influence market dynamics significantly, potentially paving the way for sustained upward momentum. Mignolet wrote: Similar corrective candles have appeared, and from a technical perspective, this position might seem even more precarious. However, the sentiment is different. People now view this as an opportunity and believe it’s a reasonable position to buy. I believe this subtle difference in sentiment has the potential to produce very significant results. Coinbase Premium Indicator Reaches Historic Low Another key observation comes from the Coinbase Premium Indicator, a metric that measures the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase (a US-based exchange) and other global exchanges.

The pseudonymous trader known as Altcoin Sherpa says that he thinks the Solana ( SOL )-based memecoin Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) will still go up, but he notes that he has some concerns. “I decided to lower my size on this one yesterday and am going to be patient with Fartcoin from here on out. I still think it’s an amazing meme and it’s going to go much higher but I would like to see it chop around more and make sure it doesn’t suffer the same fate as the other big memes that just had perpetual futures on Binance. Virtual and aixbt are promising but I feel like that’s a bit different than this. Going to watch but will consider adding more later.” Fartcoin is trading at $0.954 at time of writing. The 122nd-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down nearly 9% in the past 24 hours but up more than 3,750% since it launched in late October. Altcoin Sherpa also outlines his strategy for investing in artificial intelligence (AI) tokens. “Most all crypto AI is going to do pretty well this cycle; you just have to choose your horses.

Its data center sales are expected to rise from $110 billion to $200 billion by 2025, with dominance in AI technology. Nvidia was among the greatest Wall Street successes of 2024 as its market valued more than $2 trillion, which is $3.28 trillion at year-end. This made Nvidia the world’s second most valuable company, ranking after Apple with a value of nearly US$4 trillion. Nvidia largely deserves its exponential increase in demand because it’s playing a big role by driving AI-related technology through their chips. Nvidia’s AI dominance Nvidia’s market growth has been rapid, mainly driven by the rising demand for AI. Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) have become essential for creating and running AI technologies, like ChatGPT. These GPUs are the core of AI models, making Nvidia’s hardware crucial to the AI revolution. With the rise of generative AI technologies, companies like Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, and Cohere turned to Nvidia for its specialized chips to train and run complex AI models. This surge in demand for AI-powered technologies boosted Nvidia’s revenue and market value. From $1.2 trillion at the end of 2023, Nvidia’s market value more than doubled to $3.28 trillion by the end of 2024 with strong investors. This made Nvidia to have competitors like Microsoft and Google. Its stock price soared as investors sought to profit from the booming AI market. As Apple continued to lead in market value, approaching a $4 trillion valuation, driven by its planned AI improvements to boost iPhone sales. By the end of 2024, Microsoft was in third place with a $3.1 trillion market value, while Alphabet and Amazon were valued at about $2.3 trillion each. These major tech companies helped raise global stock indexes in 2024, with the S&P 500 up by 23.3% and the Nasdaq rising by 28.6%. Nvidia stands out from its competitors because of its combination of advanced hardware, software capabilities, and strong business partnerships. Other companies, like Amazon and Google, are making progress in AI, but they lack the complete ecosystem Nvidia has built. Nvidia’s data center sales are expected to rise significantly, from $110 billion in 2024 to $200 billion in 2025, while competitors like Broadcom and Marvell are projected to generate much smaller sales. Strategic investments and Acquisitions strengthen Nvidia However, Nvidia’s success in 2024 wasn’t just about responding to demand it also made strategic investments and acquisitions to solidify its leadership in AI technology. By 2024, Nvidia had allocated more than $1 billion in strategic investments to AI start-ups and corporate deals, growing 15 percent year over year. The company put money into 50 start-ups, including xAI (Elon Musk’s AI venture) and OpenAI and made a few key acquisitions, such as Run.ai, specializing in AI, as well as CoreWeave, an AI cloud computing provider. This involvement of Nvidia with AI is not just about investment in start-ups. CoreWeave was valued at $7 billion a year ago; it is now estimated at $35 billion. This, of course, was mainly because of the investment by Nvidia. Besides that, Nvidia bought companies like Deci, Shoreline.io, and Brev.dev. These purchased companies enhance Nvidia’s portfolio in medical technology, gaming, drones, and even humanoid robots. Nvidia’s growth was fueled not just by the high demand for GPUs, but also by its strong presence in various industries that rely on AI. By supporting AI start-ups through its Inception program and investing in new technologies, Nvidia became a key player in the AI revolution. However competitors like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, are working on creating their own alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs, which could hurt Nvidia’s business. The company also faces scrutiny from regulators in the U.S., Europe, and China. Despite the challenges and competitions, Nvidia stays on top with its AI and semiconductors, where it leverages hardware, software, and strategic partnerships.

Robert Kiyosaki Says Bitcoin Will Surge to $175K-$350K In 2025 In a post on X , Robert Kiyosaki reiterated his bullish outlook on Bitcoin, predicting that the cryptocurrency could climb to $175,000 or even $350,000 in 2025. He attributed this to the growing market demand and the enhanced usage of Bitcoin as an investment instrument. Bitcoin, the world’s largest crypto by market capitalization, surged 121% in an year and hit a record high of $108,135 in mid-December. As of the time of this writing, Bitcoin has made a sharp recovery: from the low of $94,280, the cryptocurrency has managed to rise above $96,900. The price increase represents a 2.72% gain within the last 24 hours, with trading volumes spiking by 87.07% to $45.93 billion. This rally shows a rising market sentiment as Bitcoin price nears the $97k mark and increasing the market capitalization near $2T. Similarly, in December, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author warned of an impending global economic depression, highlighting downturns in Europe, China, and the U.S. Robert Kiyosaki advised individuals to protect their wealth by investing in assets such as Bitcoin, gold, and silver. Therefore, he stressed the need for self-custody of Bitcoin and discouraged investors from focusing on the institutional investment products such as ETFs. Interestingly, Kiyosaki did not change his stand that Bitcoin price could reach $350,000 by 2025. Bitcoin Price Actions and Other Analysts’ Predictions Other market experts have echoed Robert Kiyosaki bullish sentiments for Bitcoin. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee has projected a target of $250,000 for Bitcoin in 2025, while Galaxy Digital anticipates the cryptocurrency could surpass $150,000 within the first half of the year. Analysts point to growing institutional interest and macroeconomic conditions as drivers for these projections. Additionally, an economist, Alex Krüger, suggests that a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve in 2025 could act as a catalyst for BTC price rally. He explains that reduced interest rates may create a risk-on environment, boosting assets like Bitcoin. Krüger also notes that a strong equities performance in March or April could further amplify Bitcoin’s upward momentum. Moreover, Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise, suggested that Bitcoin could reach $1 million in 2025. However, he cautioned that this would depend on the implementation of a U.S. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, which he estimated has less than a 10% chance of occurring. Market optimism remains high, fueled by Robert Kiyosaki’s predictions and prospect of enhanced adoption and regulatory clarity.

Canada appears to be taking notes as its own crypto industry seeks greater recognition. While Canadian politicians still sideline crypto discussions, the country’s crypto industry hopes this will shift with the federal election just months away. Canada’s crypto sector wants to emulate the US’s industry During campaigns, Donald Trump painted himself as the “crypto candidate,” claiming his administration would implement favorable policies for the industry. He even hinted at the possibility of a national Bitcoin reserve, currying favor with crypto supporters and investors. After his election victory, Trump made an effort to nominate digital asset supporters to his administration, and even more so, BTC prices have surged by more than 40%, crossing the $100,000 mark for the first time. In addition to Trump’s active role in boosting crypto’s influence, political contributions from key industry figures further amplified the movement. The crypto sector contributed about $135 million to support candidates, with Crypto’s Fairshake PAC and affiliated super-PACs receiving funding from giants like Coinbase, Ripple Labs, and Andreessen Horowitz. In Canada, however, crypto has yet to stir much controversy in the political arena, especially given the many restrictions on candidate donations. Nonetheless, Dean Skurka, CEO of WonderFi Technologies Inc., believes it is much easier to have crypto discussions now than a month ago. He expects the current momentum to continue even if crypto players can’t make that many donations to political groups or candidates. He added : We’re hopeful, but it hasn’t quite played out that way in Canada historically, and obviously in the US, this is the first time that it’s really become an election issue. Hopefully, the positive response that it has seen will be a signal to Canadian politicians to take it seriously. ~ Dean Skurka Not to mention, Canada’s crypto industry hopes that crypto will have a larger wave and impact on its elections, similar to the United States. Some of Canada’s crypto regulations have discouraged crypto exchanges from operating there Canada has been keen to institute policies that efficiently govern and manage the crypto industry. However, some crypto institutions felt they could not meet the regulatory requirements, shying away from the Canadian market. Binance , Bybit , dYdX, Paxos , and OKX are just some of the institutions that closed their operations in the country in 2023. The Canadian government is still adding regulations to the crypto space, but only time will tell whether or not those rules will be favorable for the crypto industry. The Crypto Asset Framework, for starters, will take effect in 2026. The framework obligates all digital asset brokers, exchanges, and ATM operators to reveal their full transaction data annually. It also requires service providers to disclose client-specific information, such as names, residential addresses, and taxpayer identification numbers. Moreover, according to Sophia Cote, head of public policy at Montreal-based crypto trading platform Shakepay Inc., the Canadian government is still looking for ways to regulate stablecoins.

This decline has triggered a wave of sell-offs by Dogecoin millionaires seeking to hedge their funds in the rapidly growing AI altcoin market. One notable beneficiary of this shift is PropiChain (PCHAIN) , an AI-powered altcoin making waves with its innovative approach to real estate investment. Market analysts are forecasting an impressive 45,309% ROI after the AI altcoin listing, which is anticipated to end soon. Dogecoin Price Activity Amid Whale Movements Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to capture attention as whales remain active despite the market’s current downtrend. On December 30, over 816 million DOGE were shuffled across two massive transactions, totaling a staggering $260 million. These whale activities have raised speculation about potential market shifts as the meme coin struggles to regain bullish momentum. The first transaction involved a transfer of 466.89 million DOGE ($150 million) to a new wallet, while another whale moved 350 million DOGE ($109.9 million) shortly after. Despite these shifts, Dogecoin’s price continues its descent, trading near $0.3103, a 2% drop in 24 hours. This price decline has not deterred optimistic analysts, who point to Dogecoin’s historical fractal patterns as a sign of potential explosive growth, with some predicting a climb to $23 this cycle. With its continued bearish movement, whales have moved significant amounts to RCO FInance (RCOF) as a hedging option. PropiChain (PCHAIN): Improving Real Estate Investments with AI and Blockchain PropiChain (PCHAIN) is more than just another altcoin; it represents a leap for the global real estate market. Designed as a decentralized platform, PropiChain uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), NFTs, and blockchain to address the inefficiencies and barriers in the real estate markets. PropiChain tokenizes physical real estate assets into digital NFTs, enabling secure and transparent ownership transfers. This approach eliminates the need for physical documents, third-party intermediaries, and cumbersome processes, streamlining property transactions. The NFT-based system also allows fractional ownership, making high-value properties accessible to a broader audience. Investors can seamlessly diversify their portfolios across multiple assets and trade ownership shares, bringing liquidity to a traditionally illiquid market. PropiChain stands out by integrating AI to simplify and enhance real estate investment strategies. Its AI-driven tools analyze market trends, predict property valuations, and provide actionable insights for investors. For example, the platform’s Automated Valuation Models (AVMs) use historical data and economic indicators to deliver real-time property valuations, ensuring accurate and transparent pricing. These features empower investors to make data-driven decisions, reducing risks and maximizing returns. PropiChain takes property investment further by integrating the metaverse into its ecosystem. Through the “Propiverse,” users can explore properties in immersive 3D environments, eliminating the need for physical site visits. This feature allows buyers to interact with properties more engagingly and in a more detailed way, providing a comprehensive understanding of their value. Sellers, in turn, can use the metaverse to enhance their marketing strategies, connecting with a global audience like never before. PropiChain transactions are recorded on a decentralized ledger called the “Title Contract,” which provides unparalleled transparency and security. This system eliminates risks such as fraud and corruption, common in traditional real estate markets. PropiChain significantly reduces transaction costs and accelerates the buying and selling process by removing intermediaries like brokers and government officials. Smart contracts, audited by BlockAudit, simplify operations by automating lease agreements, rental payments, and renewals, providing tamper-proof transactions. The PropiChain ecosystem is powered by its native altcoin, the PCHAIN AI altcoin, which is the foundation for all platform functionalities. AI altcoin holders gain access to features such as purchasing property NFTs, using AI-driven market tools, and participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Current PCHAIN AI Altcoin Presale The ongoing PropiChain (PCHAIN) presale is the perfect chance for Dogecoin millionaires to participate in the ecosystem at a low price. With AI altcoins priced at just $0.011 each during this presale phase, current investors anticipate a listing of $0.032, which translates to over 890% ROI. Currently listed on CoinMarketCap , experts anticipate that those who invest now could see returns as high as 450x once the PCHAIN AI altcoin is fully listed on trading platforms. For instance, if growth projections hold true, an investment of $100 could yield an astonishing return of approximately $450,000 by Q2 2025. As more investors flock to this promising altcoin amid Dogecoin’s decline, PropiChain stands out as an alternative and a revolutionary AI altcoin poised to reshape how we think about property ownership and investment. With the presale running fast, now is the perfect time to visit the platform and stake your position in the future of real estate with the PCHAIN AI altcoin.

XRP is reinventing global transactions with unmatched speed and affordability, while Solana pioneers in rapid blockchain transactions. In contrast, Web3Bay is redefining e-commerce by leveraging blockchain’s transparency and decentralization, focusing on user-centric benefits, making it a formidable rival to conventional platforms. The 3BAY token presale is a cornerstone of this transformation, promising substantial returns and vibrant community involvement, setting Web3Bay apart by focusing on tangible user benefits. Web3Bay’s 3BAY Token: A Promise of 6430% ROI Web3Bay is transforming e-commerce by marrying the convenience of cryptocurrencies with the spirit of blockchain’s community ethos. Picture a marketplace where the power lies in the hands of the users, free from intermediaries and exorbitant fees, positioning Web3Bay to disrupt giants like eBay. This platform is more than just a marketplace; it’s a movement rewarding users financially and functionally. At the core of this ecosystem is the 3BAY token, serving as both currency and a voice for the community. With tokens priced at just $0.00345 in the presale’s second stage, early adopters are on the brink of a potential windfall. Each presale stage sees a 15% price increase, peaking at $0.1959, offering an impressive potential return of 6000% for early participants. The presale has so raised more than $183,000, underlining its strength in the long-term. This opportunity is not just an investment but a chance to actively shape the platform’s governance and future growth. With cryptocurrency adoption for online purchases increasing by 34% in 2023, the user base has expanded to 580 million. Young adults, especially those aged 26-35, are keen on using crypto for their digital transactions, with 39% planning to boost their spending in this area. Web3Bay seamlessly integrates crypto payments with conventional methods, bridging user enthusiasm with practicality, thus offering a promising hybrid shopping and investment platform ensuring security, transparency, and data ownership. XRP’s Potential Leap to $50 by 2025: Grounded Optimism? XRP, Ripple’s flagship, is under scrutiny with forecasts suggesting a surge to $50 by 2025, thanks to its utility in enhancing global payments efficiently and affordably. With capabilities like processing transactions in seconds and handling thousands per second at minimal costs, XRP is a favorite among financial bodies worldwide. Nevertheless, XRP’s trajectory is heavily influenced by its legal entanglements with the SEC, which has dampened its potential. Yet, a hopeful outlook persists that regulatory clarity, possibly under a pro-crypto SEC chair in 2025, could catalyze substantial institutional adoption and boost XRP’s valuation. Can Solana Hit the $1,000 Mark by 2030? Known for its swift transaction capabilities and low costs, Solana has made significant strides in the blockchain arena with its unique Proof-of-History consensus. Despite market fluctuations, Solana’s role in DeFi has seen its Total Value Locked grow significantly, signaling strong adoption and trust in its technology. Analysts are pondering whether SOL can achieve the ambitious $1,000 target by 2030. Factors like continued technological advancements, ecosystem expansion, and increasing blockchain integration will play crucial roles. Despite challenges in scalability and market competition, Solana’s active developer community and strategic innovations could thrust it towards this significant milestone. Concluding Insights As blockchain technology permeates various sectors, entities like XRP, Solana, and Web3Bay provide fresh insights into its capabilities. XRP excels in enhancing global payments, Solana in scaling DeFi solutions, and Web3Bay in innovating e-commerce through a user-driven approach. Together, they exemplify the transformative potential of blockchain, merging technical innovation with practical applications to reshape how industries operate.

This price weakness in the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has caused concern among investors and market enthusiasts. Despite its robust ecosystem and dominance in decentralized applications, the Ethereum price struggles have left the door open for competing altcoins to capture the spotlight. This downturn has fueled skepticism about ETH’s near-term performance and sparked a renewed interest in an emerging AI altcoin, PCHAIN . According to leading market analysts, this AI altcoin is poised to outrun Dogecoin as we head into the 2025 bull run. The token’s unique value proposition and growing real-world utility in the $600 trillion global real estate market has set it miles ahead of other digital assets. In a market heavily influenced by speculative trends and shifting sentiment, this emerging AI altcoin stands out by addressing critical gaps that Dogecoin and similar tokens often fail to fill. Analysts project the token will capitalize on the Ethereum price slump and capture the attention of both retail and institutional investors. The Ethereum Price Struggles The Ethereum price has faced downward pressure recently due to macroeconomic factors, network congestion, and competition from rival blockchains. While the ETH blockchain remains the dominant ecosystem for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), its high transaction fees and scalability challenges have left room for alternatives to gain traction. Investors have grown increasingly concerned about the Ethereum price movement. This perceived weakness in the Ethereum price has led to a rotation of capital into an emerging AI altcoin, PCHAIN, which promises faster growth potential than the legendary Dogecoin. The Rise of the AI Altcoin, PCHAIN, Amid Ethereum Price Struggles The AI altcoin sparking interest amid the Ethereum price struggle is PCHAIN, an RWA altcoin and the utility token of PropiChain, a blockchain-powered real estate platform. Unlike Dogecoin, which relies on its community and celebrity endorsements for value, this altcoin uses cutting-edge technology and a unique value proposition to carve out a niche in the market. This AI altcoin combines the appeal of memecoins with tangible utility, making it a hybrid asset that bridges the gap between speculation and functionality. As an RWA altcoin, PCHAIN bridges the gap between the traditional real estate market and the blockchain. Why PCHAIN Could Outpace Dogecoin Leading market analysts project this AI altcoin will outrun Dogecoin based on its solid fundamentals and value proposition in the multi-trillion-dollar global real estate market. Initially created as a joke, Dogecoin has defied expectations to become one of the most well-known crypto assets. However, over-reliance on market hype leaves it vulnerable to market cycles. While Dogecoin has benefited from the support of notable figures like Elon Musk, this reliance on external factors could hinder its long-term sustainability. In contrast, PCHAIN’s focus on utility and innovation provides a more robust foundation for growth. The token’s integration with the world’s number one asset class, real estate, makes it an attractive option for investors seeking assets with intrinsic value, especially now that the Ethereum price is witnessing downward pressure. PropiChain, PCHAIN’s parent project, is primed to take at least 1% of the $600 trillion global real estate market. The platform is on course to become a $6 trillion ecosystem, potentially driving the value of the AI altcoin even higher. Additionally, the RWA tokenization market is projected to hit $16 trillion , with real estate the biggest beneficiary. As an RWA altcoin that bridges the gap between the real estate market and the blockchain, the demand for PCHAIN is set to witness an unprecedented surge beyond the 2021 legendary Dogecoin rally of over 12,000%. PropiChain Powering the Future of Global Real Estate With Cutting-Edge Technologies PropiChain is transforming the global real estate market by integrating cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), smart contracts, the Metaverse, and Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization. Using smart contracts, PCHAIN optimizes key processes such as property leasing and lease renewals, significantly simplifying property management operations. These automated workflows eliminate the need for intermediaries, lower transaction costs, and enhance transparency and efficiency in managing real estate assets. Real estate investors can take advantage of 24/7 support from AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots. These assistants and chatbots provide personalized guidance at every stage of the real estate investment process, ensuring a seamless and informed user experience. Moreover, the platform’s advanced AI-driven predictive algorithms deliver detailed market insights and future trend analysis, enabling investors to identify and capitalize on profitable opportunities in the real estate sector. Another standout feature of PropiChain is its integration of the Metaverse to facilitate immersive virtual property tours. Using virtual reality and 3D visualization, investors can explore properties from anywhere in the world, eliminating the need for physical site visits and offering an engaging, interactive way to evaluate potential investments. Additionally, PropiChain is also revolutionizing the investment landscape through property tokenization. The platform enables fractional ownership by converting real estate assets into digital tokens, allowing investors with smaller budgets to invest in high-value properties. This innovation opens real estate investment opportunities to a broader audience, democratizing access to lucrative markets. Conclusion The Ethereum price weakness has created an opportunity for investors to explore new horizons in the crypto space, and the AI altcoin, PCHAIN, presents the ideal opportunity for massive gains. With analysts projecting it will outrun Dogecoin, PCHAIN’s growth potential could become one of the best in the crypto space. While the Ethereum price struggles, analysts strongly project that your $1000 investment in the ongoing PCHAIN presale would yield a massive $236,000 profit within Q1 of 2025. The first presale round raised over $1.3 million, and the ongoing second presale round has crossed the $590,000 mark. Join the PCHAIN presale now to enjoy unprecedented returns on your investment. After the second presale round, the token price will increase from $0.011 to $0.023. PCHAIN is listed on CoinMarketCap , reiterating the Project’s readiness to do bigger things in the crypto space. BlockAudit , a top blockchain security firm, audited the Project’s smart contract and found zero vulnerabilities.

Showing signs of strength daily, the asset looks poised for a leg up but is currently facing a resistance line. Last month’s correction seriously reduced XRP’s price, as it lost roughly 10% of its valuation in three weeks. This led to a small bearish phase, and the crypto ended the year 2024 on a weak note. However, it started the new year on a recovery note and is now showing signs of strength on the daily chart. The asset is still facing small hurdles under $0.25, but we may see a breakup in the coming days. The latest positive actions suggest a potential bullish move for XRP following a noticeable increase in the buying volume level since yesterday. Although the bullish signal is yet to be confirmed until the price breaks out of the previous monthly high. A continuous rejection at the falling resistance line could subject the market to a brief consolidation phase before rallying hard. Otherwise, it may roll back to a nearby support before activating bullish at full speed. That said, the overall market structure remains bullish on a macro level. The price must dip below the $0.4 level before we can start to consider a bearish move. XRP’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Now that has reacted positively to the latest surge across the market, it is facing resistance at $0.25. Scaling through this resistance could bring a full recovery to $2.9 with a potential breakout to $3.3. If the price plunges through $2.15 to the holding $1.9 support, the lower level to consider for a breakdown is $1.63, followed by $1.28.

Musk’s Tesla Fire (MUSKFIRE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFIRE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk’s Tesla Fire can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk’s Tesla Fire could become the next viral memecoin. Musk’s Tesla Fire launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk’s Tesla Fire on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk’s Tesla Fire by entering its contract address – HuyxQUYCfoVCBpNoS1LxC1kbQuajYW9EqEcKoJqtdS1C – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFIRE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-03 02:10:00

The pressure is currently low but we can expect a big price movement when volume increases. The past week’s trading was uninteresting for many traders as Avax entered a serious but brief consolidation mode due to volatility shrink. But things have turned out a bit positive amid rising volume in the past 48 hours, and as we can see on the daily chart, the crypto is slowly climbing back with a surge to the $40 level – which is currently rejected. This surge came after mounting support above the $33 level during last month’s correction. Looking at the market from a technical standpoint, the correction appears to have ended on the daily chart. A full recovery to the top should bring the bulls back in control. But for now, the demand level appears low. If the asset loses grip again, Avax may resume correction until it finds a solid ground. Currently, it shows no signs of weakness on a daily scale as the bulls commit strongly to the price. While volume is slowly flowing back in the market, a break above the previous high could feature a bigger upward rally in the coming days. Avax’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The $42 level is an immediate resistance to watch in the latest surge. An increase above this level could bring more recovery to the $48.1 and $55.5 levels with a potential break out. Aside from the $33.6 level that acted as support during last month’s drops, Avax currently trades above $39. If the mentioned support level fails to hold, lower levels to consider for drops would be $29.9 and $23.9.

The market is flooded with options, but few projects stand out with the substance to match their hype. Qubetics, Ethereum, and Monero represent a trio of innovative projects redefining what blockchain technology can achieve, both now and in the future. Qubetics ($TICS) is taking real-world asset tokenization to new heights, allowing access to investments that were previously out of reach for many. Ethereum’s powerful ecosystem continues to serve as the backbone for decentralised applications, while Monero leads the charge in privacy-focused transactions. These three cryptos bring unique strengths that make them the best cryptos to invest in for long term success. Qubetics Reshapes Investments Through Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics is pushing boundaries in the world of blockchain by turning physical and digital assets into tokenized investments. Imagine owning a share of a valuable property, a rare commodity, or even intellectual property—all via fractional ownership enabled by Qubetics’ tokenization technology. This groundbreaking approach democratises access to wealth-building opportunities that were once reserved for the elite. For example, consider a small business owner looking to invest in real estate but lacking the capital to purchase a property outright. Through Qubetics’ marketplace, they can buy a fraction of a commercial property and earn proportional returns. Similarly, a creative entrepreneur could tokenize their intellectual property, like music or patents, and trade them efficiently on the platform. Beyond access, Qubetics also addresses long-standing challenges like limited liquidity and market inefficiency. Its secondary market simplifies the trading process, ensuring that investors can buy, sell, and manage assets with ease. The Qubetics presale has already captured attention, with over 395 million $TICS tokens sold, raising $8.5 million and counting. The current presale stage offers $TICS tokens at $0.0414, with a 10% price increase every Sunday at midnight. Each presale stage lasts seven days, creating urgency for those looking to join early. If you’re curious about the potential of real-world asset tokenization, watch this video to learn how Qubetics is reshaping the investment landscape. Ethereum Powers Innovation in Decentralised Applications Ethereum is widely regarded as the foundation of decentralised finance and smart contract technology. From DeFi platforms to NFTs and beyond, its ecosystem supports thousands of applications that have revolutionised the blockchain space. With its unparalleled versatility, Ethereum remains a cornerstone for long-term investors seeking reliable and innovative projects. One of Ethereum’s standout features is its adaptability. Developers can build and deploy decentralised applications (DApps) across a range of industries, from gaming to finance. Imagine a digital marketplace where you can purchase items with cryptocurrency or a financial application that lets you earn interest without needing a traditional bank. These are just a few of the many possibilities Ethereum enables. Its transition to Ethereum 2.0 further enhances its appeal. With the move to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, Ethereum has become more energy-efficient, scalable, and secure. These upgrades not only strengthen its network but also make it an attractive option for developers and users alike. Ethereum’s ecosystem continues to expand, proving its resilience and adaptability in an ever-changing market. For investors looking for a blockchain that supports endless innovation and real-world applications, Ethereum remains a strong contender for the best cryptos to invest in for long term growth. Monero Pioneers Privacy in Blockchain Transactions Monero has carved a niche for itself as the go-to cryptocurrency for privacy. Unlike most other cryptos, Monero’s blockchain is designed to be untraceable, providing users with unparalleled confidentiality in their transactions. This makes it a favourite among individuals and businesses who value financial privacy in an increasingly transparent digital world. For example, consider an individual who wants to send funds without exposing sensitive personal details, or a business that needs to safeguard its transaction history from competitors. Monero’s technology ensures that all transactions are private by default, using advanced cryptographic techniques to obscure sender and receiver identities as well as transaction amounts. Despite its focus on privacy, Monero is also highly practical. Its network processes transactions quickly and securely, making it a viable option for everyday use. Moreover, its community-driven development ensures that the blockchain remains robust and secure over time. Monero’s dedication to privacy and usability has earned it a loyal following, positioning it as a top choice for those who prioritise confidentiality.

This marks Aave’s new all-time high (ATH) in net deposits since 2021. Aave Hits $35 Billion In Net Deposits – What’s Ahead? In an announcement made yesterday, the leading DeFi lending protocol Aave revealed that it had reached a new ATH in net deposits since 2021. With $35 billion in net deposits, Aave has solidified its position as the largest DeFi protocol at the time of writing. Related Reading: AAVE Price Soars 26% In A Single Week — Will Rising FOMO Lead To A Bust? To put this into perspective, Aave’s net deposits were $5.5 billion at the end of 2022, increasing to $10 billion by the close of 2023. The current figure of $35 billion at the end of 2024 reflects an astounding surge of over 535% in just two years. The year 2024 proved to be transformative for Aave, with the protocol experiencing heightened user adoption across multiple blockchains. Throughout the year, Aave added support for five new markets, including BNB Chain, Scroll, ZKsync Era, and Ether.fi. According to the announcement, Aave is poised to expand further by potentially adding support for six additional blockchains. These include Mantle, Sonic, Linea, BOB, Spider Chain, and Aptos, pending approval by the Aave decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). For the uninitiated, a DAO is a blockchain-based entity governed by smart contracts and decentralized voting, where decisions are made collectively by token holders without any central authority. DAOs enable transparent, democratic management of protocols in a trustless environment. In addition to expanding to new blockchain markets, Aave launched its latest protocol upgrade, Aave V4. This upgrade introduces significant improvements, such as enhanced modularity, reduced governance overhead, optimized capital efficiency, and innovative features like the Hub and Spoke liquidity architecture. Moreover, Aave’s decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin GHO is set to witness increased adoption. Plans are in motion to expand its cross-chain support across various smart contract platforms, including Coinbase’s Base and Avalanche (AVAX), by early 2025. DeFi To Make A Comeback In 2025? Following Donald Trump’s victory in the November 2024 U.S. presidential election, DeFi tokens have experienced a significant surge, driven by optimism surrounding favorable cryptocurrency regulations under the new administration. Related Reading: Chainlink And AAVE Surge After Trump’s Crypto Project Invests In Both Additionally, DeFi protocols have become increasingly secure, fostering greater user trust and leading to higher deposit volumes and a larger total value locked (TVL). A recent report highlighted that DeFi exploits decreased by 40% in 2024 compared to 2023, signaling improved security across the ecosystem. In addition, Q1 2025 is expected to be bullish for Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and home to the largest DeFi ecosystem. A positive price action for ETH is expected to benefit major DeFi tokens such as AAVE, Curve (CRV), Compound (COMP), and others. That said, the Solana (SOL) DeFi ecosystem is rapidly gaining traction and catching up with Ethereum in terms of adoption. This development could propel Solana-based DeFi tokens, such as Orca (ORCA) and Raydium (RAY), to reach new highs. At press time, ETH is trading at $3,461, up 4% in the past 24 hours.

This allows Binance to expand services, including securities distribution and EMI issuance, in Brazil. The approval underscores Binance’s strong commitment to compliance with AML and CFT standards. Binance crypto exchange in terms of trading volume has obtained approval from the Central Bank of Brazil to buy Sim; Paul, a licensed broker-dealer. Binance is the first crypto exchange that has received a broker-dealer license in Brazil, the biggest country in Latin America in population and economy. A Big Win for Binance This is Binance’ s 21st regulatory milestone across the globe. Thus, the company continues on its way toward attaining a standard of highest compliance. In Brazil, beyond just trading in cryptocurrencies, the exchange can provide distribution of securities and issue EMI. Binance, henceforth, is set to be an integral part of the regional financial sector. Binance CEO Richard Teng called this approval a major milestone for the company. He said, “ Brazil is home to a vibrant and forward-thinking crypto community. This approval reflects our commitment to compliance and security, and we’re excited to bring innovative financial services to users in Brazil.” Brazil is one of the leaders in the adoption of cryptocurrency worldwide and ranks 10th globally, according to Chainalysis. The country’s Central Bank and IRS have set out clear guidelines for the crypto industry, but have also been looking for public and business input on how to create fair and effective regulations. In 2024, for the first time in history, Brazil authorized its first-ever spot Solana ETF, shows digital assets into traditional finance. The same year, the Brazil crypto transactions market crossed the record $90.3 billion barrier, that shows how much Brazil really matters to global crypto space. Binance Expands to Latin America This approval made Binance’s position in Latin America. The company has already gained regulatory approval in countries like Argentina, and its new license in Brazil supports its mission to promote responsible crypto adoption worldwide. Internationally, Binance holds licenses in critical markets such as Dubai, France, El Salvador, and Japan. These licenses show that Binance is committed to regulatory compliance. Binance’s compliance program follows global standards, including strong anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CFT) measures. It features thorough identity verification processes (KYC and KYB) and a top-tier Financial Crime Compliance (FCC) unit. This unit helps law enforcement investigate crypto-related crimes and improve security across the ecosystem. With its broker-dealer license and the acquisition of Sim;paul, Binance is to play a much bigger role in Brazil’s crypto industry. As Brazil continues embracing crypto with clear rules and innovation, Binance has the best opportunities for advanced financial solutions and supporting the country’s growing digital economy. With its new broker-dealer license, Binance can now provide advanced financial services and support Brazil’s growing use of digital assets. Bionance is yet to hire 1000 compliance staff and contractors, ensuring crypto ecosystem’s growth sufficiently and responsibly globally.

For certain transactions, such as NFT sales, costs have exceeded $165, leaving many users frustrated by the high expenses. What’s Causing the Spike? The primary driver behind the rise in gas fees is network congestion. Ethereum currently has 151,751 pending transactions and a network utilization rate of 64.53%. This congestion creates intense competition among users to have their transactions processed, leading to higher fees. The spike in activity is tied to a range of use cases, including NFT sales, DeFi protocols, and general user transactions. As more people engage with Ethereum’s ecosystem, the strain on the network grows, pushing gas prices upward. Solutions in Progress Ethereum developers are actively working on solutions to improve scalability and reduce gas fees: 1. Layer 2 Solutions: Technologies like Optimistic Rollups and ZK Rollups allow transactions to be processed off-chain, reducing congestion on the mainnet. 2. EIP-4844 Update: A planned network upgrade, EIP-4844 aims to further optimize Ethereum’s efficiency and scalability. What Can Users Do Now? In the short term, users can adopt strategies to minimize costs: – Transact During Off-Peak Times: Gas fees tend to drop during periods of lower network activity. – Utilize Layer 2 Networks: Platforms like Arbitrum and Optimism offer faster and cheaper transactions compared to the Ethereum mainnet. Ethereum Gas Fee Surge: Causes and Solutions – about 80 gwei The recent rise in @ethereum gas fees is directly tied to network congestion and increased user activity.

This collaboration offers users yield-bearing opportunities and bridging decentralized finance (DeFi) with institutional financial systems. Recently, the newly launched stablecoin by Frax Finance will be collateralized with the BlackRock’s United States Dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, colloquially called BUIDL. It is a step toward to integrating traditional financial products into the decentralized ecosystem, aligning with the growing trend of stablecoin tokenization backed by real-world assets. Collateralization by BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund The Frax community passed governance proposal FIP-418 , which allowed BUIDL to be collateralized for the frxUSD stablecoin. BUIDL, tokenized by BlackRock, now has over $648 million in assets under management and invests mostly in liquid instruments such as U.S. Treasury bills and repurchase agreements. The tokenized fund is dedicated to decreasing counterparty risks and maximizing yields on frxUSD for holders, taking them to sources of financial opportunity in traditional markets of finance. Features of frxUSD The frxUSD stablecoin will maintain a peg at 1:1 against the U.S. dollar. Yield-bearing opportunities for the holder are also possible through the benefits accrued to the holder by virtue of the underlying assets within the BUIDL fund. Another thing, Paxos has been partnered with Frax Finance in a manner where it enables direct conversion of the stablecoin, frxUSD, into fiat currency for easy redemption into the stablecoin of the U.S. dollars. Frax also intends to apply for access to the U.S. Federal Reserve Master Account, so frxUSD can be used in regulated markets, which will further increase its legitimacy and usability. BUIDL-Backed Stablecoins Frax’s frxUSD falls under a more recent trend of RWA backings in the stablecoin market. Other stablecoin projects include Ethena Labs, with BUIDL-backed stablecoins such as USDtb, whose emphasis is placed on reducing volatility within synthetic dollar issuance. Decentralized exchange Curve Finance now accepts BUIDL as collateral to mint the Elixir’s deUSD stablecoin, thus a growing tendency for tokenized funds to back stablecoins. Accelerating this trend have seen changes in the regulatory environment. For example, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation of the European Union, adopted in December 2024, sets new standards for the issuers of stablecoins. This pushes towards greater transparency and accountability in the market. BlackRock in Digital Assets BlackRock is growing in the digital asset space. The asset management giant now oversees more than $10.4 trillion in assets worldwide. This company’s entrance into the tokenized asset market and its support for stablecoins such as frxUSD and USDtb point to a gradual institutional embrace of blockchain-based financial products. The strategic move into the crypto space by BlackRock, through achievements such as Bitcoin ETFs, signals a greater shift toward integration of traditional finance with the new digital asset economy. More traditional financial institutions will find themselves in the space, and it is in such an environment that stablecoins, such as frxUSD, supported by real-world assets.

If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,500 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,420 level and the trend line. The first major support sits near the $3,400 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,310 swing low to the $3,502 high.

This highlights the growing interest from traders and investors as they seek to capitalize on the consolidation breakout, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Data from POPCAT’s spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have experienced an outflow of a significant $1.7 million worth of POPCAT. This indicates that long-term holders have withdrawn these notable meme coins following the breakout, suggesting potential upside momentum and increased buying pressure. Source: Coinglass At press time, the major liquidation levels are at $0.826 on the lower side and $0.908 on the upper side, with traders over-leveraged at these levels, according to Coinglass data. If the market sentiment remains unchanged and the price rises to the $0.908 level, nearly $5.52 million worth of short positions will be liquidated. Conversely, if the sentiment shifts and price drops to the $0.826 level, nearly $4.42 million worth of long positions will be liquidated.",News|Meme Coins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-03 03:43:14

In light of this revival, crypto expert Miles Deutscher has revealed his forecasts for 2025, providing perspectives on the upcoming paths of key cryptocurrencies and market tendencies. Bitcoin Price Potential To Hit $1 Million Deutscher begins by addressing the current state of the Bitcoin dominance chart, suggesting that it has likely peaked for this cycle. He anticipates that while BTC may experience periods of outperformance, it will ultimately stabilize around 61.5% dominance. In addition, Deutscher has made bold predictions regarding Bitcoin’s future price, asserting that it will reach $140,000 by the end of 2025. While he has seen more aggressive forecasts predicting prices over $200,000, he considers these estimates “overly ambitious” within the next 12 months. However, the expert expresses a long-term belief in Bitcoin’s potential to evolve into a $1 million asset, indicating his confidence in the cryptocurrency’s future growth. Related Reading: XRP Price Targets $13 After Completing Highest Candle Body Close In History – Details On the other hand, Deutscher highlights that the most significant developments in the altcoin market will not materialize until the second half of the year. The expert acknowledges the macroeconomic challenges currently facing the market, which he believes have slightly delayed the overall cycle. Interestingly, he notes the historical trend of altcoin seasonality, which typically favors the first half of the year, suggesting the possibility of two distinct upward runs in the crypto market. Cryptocurrency ETFs Set To Flourish In 2025 In 2025, Deutscher further expects artificial intelligence (AI) to remain a dominant narrative within crypto. He believes that the integration of AI will lead to a major transformation in decentralized finance (DeFi) and on-chain trading, particularly through the development of AI agents. He forecasts that several AI-driven projects will achieve market capitalizations exceeding $1 billion, signifying a shift towards more sophisticated financial instruments. Deutscher also emphasizes the importance of Real World Assets (RWA), predicting they will gain significant traction throughout the year. He notes that asset tokenization is still in its infancy, with influential figures like Donald Trump and Larry Fink likely to champion this sector, fostering growth and innovation. Predictions regarding DeFi utility coins are particularly noteworthy. Deutscher anticipates that major protocols, such as Chainlink (LINK), Aave (AAVE), Enjin (ENA), and Uniswap (UNI), will outperform their peers as the market recognizes the value of income-generating utility protocols. The expert argues that the market has yet to fully appreciate the potential impact of the Trump administration on DeFi, suggesting that a favorable regulatory environment will benefit these protocols significantly. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Confirms Breakout: Analyst Sets New Price Targets Another key prediction from Deutscher involves the potential approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) and XRP. The analyst believes that a new regulatory regime will facilitate a more accommodating environment for cryptocurrency ETFs in 2025. In a broader context, Deutscher foresees a strategic Bitcoin reserve being established in the United States, paving the way for other nations to follow suit. This shift towards sovereign and institutional adoption of Bitcoin is expected to gain momentum, further legitimizing the market’s leading cryptocurrency as a viable asset class. As of now, BTC is priced at $97,570, showing an increase of almost 4% over the past 24 hours.

Trump Loves Dancing (TRUMPDAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPDAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Dancing can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Dancing could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Dancing launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Dancing on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Dancing by entering its contract address – HVnG6NJCvVDa34VxqR1wmSo18EGtNVJhNR8CQwNwjgpi – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPDAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-03 04:19:23

Deaton outlined the historical context of Ripple’s emergence, the strategic choices made by the company, and the broader implications of the case for the cryptocurrency industry. Ripple’s Early Vision and Strategic Decisions Deaton highlighted the circumstances surrounding Ripple’s inception in 2012, emphasizing that stablecoins did not exist at the time, and the cross-border payments market was an untapped opportunity. Ripple’s founders created XRP to streamline global financial transactions. While there was an internal debate about focusing on smart contracts versus payments, Ripple chose the latter, recognizing the significant potential in the cross-border payments sector . The global payments market has since grown exponentially. Deaton referenced data showing that in 2022, cross-border payment flows exceeded $150 trillion and are projected to reach $250 trillion by 2027. Ripple’s early focus on this market positioned it as a leader in leveraging blockchain technology for international remittances. The SEC’s Legal Action and Its Impact In December 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit alleging that XRP constituted an unregistered security. Deaton criticized the broad nature of the SEC’s claims, which he described as overreaching and unprecedented. He argued that the case disrupted Ripple’s business and significantly affected its partnerships. For instance, Coinbase, which had listed XRP in 2019 and promoted its use alongside USDC for efficient international payments, delisted XRP following the lawsuit. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 MoneyGram , a key Ripple partner, stopped using XRP and transitioned to XLM, a cryptocurrency created by Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb. Deaton questioned whether there was a meaningful legal distinction between XRP and XLM under securities law, suggesting that the SEC’s approach appeared inconsistent. Allegations of Conflicts of Interest Deaton also scrutinized the conduct of former SEC officials involved in the lawsuit. He pointed to potential conflicts of interest, noting that some individuals who advocated for the case later worked with competitors of Ripple and XRP. These associations, he argued, raised concerns about the impartiality and motives behind the enforcement action. Broader Implications for the Crypto Industry The Ripple case exemplifies the challenges faced by cryptocurrency projects navigating regulatory uncertainty in the United States. Deaton underscored the lack of clear guidelines for differentiating securities from non-securities, a gap that has stifled innovation and driven companies to seek clarity abroad. While Deaton openly acknowledges that he is not a “Ripple fanboy” and has been critical of the company’s practices, he maintains that the SEC’s lawsuit represents an overreach with far-reaching consequences. He urged industry stakeholders to recognize the broader issues at play, including the need for regulatory transparency and fairness. John Deaton’s critique of the SEC’s case against Ripple underscores the complexity of regulating emerging technologies in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. The case has reshaped Ripple’s trajectory and highlighted the urgent need for coherent regulatory frameworks to ensure innovation can thrive while protecting investors. As the cryptocurrency market continues to grow, the outcome of this case could set important precedents for the future of digital assets.

The appeal , which is currently awaiting review in the District Court, comes as part of Celsius’ ongoing litigation efforts to recover funds from FTX. Celsius’ Initial Claim According to court documents, Celsius had originally filed a claim of up to $2 billion in damages from FTX. The claim alleged that FTX officials had made “unsubstantiated and disparaging statements” against Celsius, which undermined its reputation and accelerated its collapse in 2022. However, before the bar date in July 2024, the company amended the claim to $444 million, stating that the new claim would focus on “preferential transfers” that allegedly gave some creditors an advantage over others. In December, Judge John Dorsey, the magistrate in charge of the case, rejected both claims. He pointed out the procedural flaws in Celsius’ filings, stating that they lacked sufficient evidence to maintain the preference claims. Judge Dorsey criticized Celsius’ amended filing, stating that it was improper since the company did not seek court approval. He also noted that the content of the amended claims was not remotely related to the original claims and could obstruct FTX’s restructuring plans. On December 31, Celsius’ litigation administrator, Mohsin Meghji, officially filed a notice of appeal disputing Judge Dorsey’s ruling. In the filing, Celsius argued that its initial fillings met all the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code despite lacking a detailed explanation. The company intends to continue pursuing the case to recover the disputed claim. Celsius’ Repayment Efforts Despite its legal woes, Celsius has made considerable progress to repay its creditors. In August 2024, the company began its repayment effort, distributing $2.5 billion in crypto and cash to more than 250,000 creditors in over 165 countries. In a more recent court filing in November, Celsius announced plans to disburse an additional $127 million to creditors. The company pointed out that this second payout will be made from funds recovered through its litigation efforts.

The move is a major scaleback of its once ambitious expansion plans as the company confronts rising competition in the AI industry and economic pressures. According to a recent Bloomberg report , the AI company is leaving its 11,000 sq ft space in Frasers Tower for something smaller. The shift comes as other tech firms, including ByteDance Ltd., are growing overseas while China’s economy sags. The downsizing comes at a time when Singapore’s prime office market is adjusting to lower demand from major Chinese companies and fluctuating vacancy rates. SenseTime’s move is part of a wider restructuring to concentrate on generative AI services, for which it received regulatory approval last year. Startups, such as Moonshot AI and Zhipu, are challenging the company’s repositioning. SenseTime is facing threats from larger companies and a new generation of well-funded startups The company was also one of China’s earliest to secure approval for generative AI services last year. While it is pivoting back to the newer field, it’ll be competing with larger companies and a new generation of well-funded startups, remarked a person familiar with the company’s strategies. SenseTime’s adjustment also follows the company losing Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. as a financial backer in 2023 and past controversies, including a 2019 U.S. blacklisting over alleged human rights violations in Xinjiang, which SenseTime has denied. However, these challenges have prevented access to vital capital and U.S. technology that could help the company operate and expand globally. SenseTime representatives in Singapore did not comment on these developments.

Altcoin Daily analyzes the crypto market insight of Dan Morehead, founder of Pantera Capital, who emphasizes the massive potential of altcoins in driving this next wave of adoption. With Bitcoin potentially hitting $85,000 soon and 2025 shaping up as a landmark year, institutions are focusing on innovative altcoins with real-world utility. Driving the crypto trend of corrections and rise, Morehead predicts Bitcoin could reach $117,000 by August 2025, driven by its historical halving patterns. Halving, which occurs every four years, reduces miners’ rewards and tightens Bitcoin’s supply , often leading to price surges. Following the April 2024 halving, which cut rewards to 3.125 BTC, Morehead notes Bitcoin typically starts rising 400 days before a halving and peaks 480 days after. Based on this trend, he expects Bitcoin to follow suit, climbing from its current price of $95,484 to $117,000, marking a 22.53% increase by mid-2025. Let’s dive into the top 10 altcoins gaining institutional attention. Top Altcoins Institutions Are Watching HyperLiquid (HYPE) HyperLiquid is a decentralized exchange (DEX) designed for perpetual futures, featuring a fully on-chain order book. Backed by strategic partnerships and recently added to Grayscale’s top 20 crypto list, it’s becoming a go-to for institutional investors. DeFiLlama reports over $12 billion in December trading volume, earning $8.6 million in revenue. Ethena (ENA) Ethena’s USDE stablecoin is backed by hedged positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum, offering yield through staking. Its alignment with pro-stablecoin regulations makes it a standout pick for institutions. ENA is currently trading at $1.07 with a rise of 16% this week. Virtuals Protocol (VIRUAL) Built on Ethereum’s Layer 2 network, Virtuals Protocol enables the creation of tokenized AI agents. These agents can perform autonomous tasks, making the platform a frontrunner in merging AI with blockchain . Jupiter (JUP) The top DEX aggregator on Solana, Jupiter boasts the highest total value locked (TVL) on the network. With Solana gaining traction, Jupiter is poised to capitalize on this momentum . Gito (GTO) A liquid staking protocol on Solana, Gito has shown impressive growth, generating over $550 million in revenue in 2024. Its strong financial metrics make it a favorite among institutions. Toncoin (TON) Backed by Telegram, Toncoin is gaining attention for its ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and its utility as a payment solution within Telegram’s vast user base. Solana (SOL) Known for its scalability and low transaction costs, Solana continues to attract institutional interest , especially with its growing ecosystem of dApps and DeFi projects. Ondo Protocol (ONDO) A lesser-known gem, Ondo Protocol focuses on financial derivatives, offering unique tools for hedging and trading. Its innovative approach is catching the eye of institutional players. Chainlink (LINK) A veteran in the space, Chainlink remains a top choice for its role in powering DeFi and smart contracts through reliable Oracle services. All these coins add a bullish momentum for altcoins. Bitcoin dominance at 47% shows that altcoins are gaining momentum. Trump’s win is more favorable for altcoins than Bitcoin as Bitcoin’s performance may drop if regulations are delayed. Hence a perfect scene for altcoins season is nearing. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The leak suggests that the platform may launch in the United States despite not having approvals in some states. X filed for money transmitter licenses for X Payments LLC to operate across the United States and has secured licensing in 39 states so far. A suspected screenshot of the latest code reveals, “X Money is not available in your state.” This has led some observers and analysts, including Alex Finn, a famous American entrepreneur, to theorize that X Money will likely launch without approvals from all 50 states. 🚨BREAKING: X PAYMENTS LAUNCHING IMMINENTLY New X code has just shipped that reveals X Payments will launch WITHOUT approval from all 50 states Meaning X Payments could launch TODAY Creators could start earning WAY MORE money immediately States it will be available: 1.… pic.twitter.com/8Wej1XrIQK — Alex Finn (@AlexFinnX) January 2, 2025 The platform may support cryptocurrency due to Elon Musk’s openness to digital assets X Money will help support content creators on the X platform by allowing users to tip them. There are also talks that the payment system will support cryptocurrency, as Elon Musk, the owner of the X platform, has accepted Bitcoin and Dogecoin payments in his other businesses. One of the X users responded to Finn’s post, saying that creators are about to make money without stringent regulations. “No permission needed, no holding back, just pure opportunity.” In a self-hosted X space, Finn explained that X payments will support cryptocurrency somehow, clarifying that it will be the fastest way to move currency. He said that crypto will probably be a good amount of rails for X payments. The speculations around the X payment launch are happening against the backdrop of X CEO Linda Yaccarino confirming on the social media platform in a December 31 X post that X Money would launch in 2025. However, Aaron Perris, one of the MacRumors researchers, has not authentically confirmed the leaked source code. X is silent on whether the X launch is happening today or not. X Money launch may happen in phases as some states await approvals Suppose the launch rumors and speculations are true; the initial launch will happen in 39 states. These are the states where it has already obtained money transmitter licenses. As Finn stated, some states, including Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Indiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New York, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, wouldn’t be immediately supported. Elon Musk has been a staunch supporter of Bitcoin, and DOGE and industry analysts hold that memecoin could be among the two cryptos supported by the platform. The speculations may be true as Tesla, a vehicle manufacturing firm that Elon Musk owns, supports DOGE payments while holding Bitcoin worth $1.1 billion.

Musk’s Tesla Fire (MUSKFIRE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFIRE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk’s Tesla Fire can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk’s Tesla Fire could become the next viral memecoin. Musk’s Tesla Fire launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk’s Tesla Fire on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk’s Tesla Fire by entering its contract address – HuyxQUYCfoVCBpNoS1LxC1kbQuajYW9EqEcKoJqtdS1C – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFIRE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-03 05:10:00

Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a 3.5% rise in the past 24 hours, trading around $96,600, following a volatile end to 2024. After hitting an all-time high of $108,268 in mid-December, Bitcoin dropped to $92,000. With the new year comes optimism, as analysts predict strong growth driven by macroeconomic trends and potential regulatory changes under the upcoming Trump administration. With new SEC chair Altcoins ETFs, regulations by enforcement ends the market tends to react positively this year. Let’s see how things will be in 2025 for Bitcoin and Altcoins. Analyst shares a 2025 Crypto Outlook Tony Edward from Thinking Crypto offers an optimistic view, forecasting a strong year for Bitcoin and altcoins, with Bitcoin potentially hitting new all-time highs. As Trump officially joins this month the bullish sentiments are already high as congress is expected to pass crypto regulations in his first 100 days of taking charge. Edward draws comparisons to past years, such as 2013, 2017, and 2021, when the crypto market saw significant growth after Bitcoin’s halving events . We are also getting more adoption news this year by big bulls, hence Bitcoin’s potential to reach between $150,000 and $200,000 if Trump manages to approve his Bitcoin Reserve plan. As more institutional investors continue to show interest in crypto, Bitcoin’s dominance is expected to grow , which could push the overall market cap to $9 trillion or more. One of the driving forces behind this bullish outlook is the possibility of lower interest rates and increased liquidity from the Federal Reserve. This could result in more capital flowing into the crypto market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Altcoins Institutions Are Betting On in 2025 , Altcoins are Best Choice to Divert Portfolio In terms of altcoins, Ethereum and Chainlink are expected to perform well, with Ethereum’s continued dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts . Edward also sees AI-related cryptocurrencies might also see higher adoptions, as artificial intelligence continues to make waves in the tech world. However, Edward advises caution for investors. He emphasizes the importance of having a clear exit strategy and being mindful of taxes when making profits. As the crypto market enters 2025, there are plenty of opportunities, but staying informed and prepared will be key to navigating the year’s potential gains. With simple ETF push this year, crypto saw an impressive change, and Bitcoin doubled in price, and if it gets full political support in the US, targets like $140K will not be far. With regulatory clarity this year crypto will see a new era in the digital assets space. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

These crypto players aim to invite new investors into the crypto loop and maintain those already in it. Moreover, ETFs will likely expand beyond Bitcoin and Ether in 2025 as companies like VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital have already filed for spot Solana ETFs. Canary Capital has also requested approval to launch a Litecoin ETF, an XRP ETF, and an HBAR ETF. Solana ETFs listing odds in 2025 are rising On December 27, ETF Store president Nate Geraci disclosed that Volatility Shares had submitted its S-1 registration statement for its futures-based Solana ETF with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Before then, VanEck, 21 Shares had already requested approval to list their spot Solana ETFs in June and Canary Capital in October. With all these companies having sent in their applications, multiple analysts, including Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of research, are projecting that Solana ETFs are a must-have in 2025 . On January 1, Polymarket, a cryptocurrency prediction platform, assessed the likelihood of a US Solana ETF being listed in 2025 at 77% , a probability Sigel described as “underpriced.” By January 2, however, the platform’s projected odds had elevated to 84%. Aside from Solana ETFs, 2025 may also be a promising year for XRP ETFs. Canary Capital and Bitwise filed their S-1 registration statements for spot XRP ETFs in October. Therefore, Bloomberg Intelligence’s Athanasios Psarofagis believes 2025 will be the year of “crypto everything,” as crypto leaders are expected to further integrate cryptocurrency strategies into ETFs. He also noted that since the ETF evolution theme is still “hot” and raving at the moment, more issuers will step up. More convertibles will emerge in 2025 The REX ETF plans to focus primarily on convertible bonds from Bitcoin-holding corporations. On Friday, December 27, REX Shares filed an application to launch the REX Bitcoin Corporate Treasury Convertible Bond ETF. Under normal market conditions, the ETF will commit at least 80% of its net assets, including borrowed capital, to these bonds. Any changes to this policy require a 60-day notice to shareholders. Additionally, asset management firm Strive wants to introduce a new derivatives-focused fund. The fund will deal with swaps and options to gain exposure to convertible securities issued by MicroStrategy and other similarly aligned firms.

This optimism is further dispplayed by a recent transfer of $55 million from the fee account of the meme coin platform Pump.fun to the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, which catalyzed a remarkable 10% rebound in Solana's price. As investors and analysts alike closely monitor developments in the cryptocurrency landscape, the broader market sentiment is becoming increasingly positive regarding the possibility of a US spot Solana ETF being listed in 2025. This anticipated event could significantly impact Solana's market dynamics, attracting more institutional investment and further solidifying its position within the competitive cryptocurrency ecosystem. The excitement surrounding these developments is palpable among traders and enthusiasts alike. Solana ETF Prospects in 2025: Betting Markets Signal Bullish Sentiment Amid Industry Optimism The odds of a Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF) gaining regulatory approval in the United States by 2025 are higher than expected, according to Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of research. Sigel’s perspective, shared via a post on X, aligns with growing optimism in the cryptocurrency industry about increased ETF listings under a new political administration. On Jan. 1, the cryptocurrency prediction platform Polymarket projected a 77% chance of a Solana ETF listing in the US in 2025. By Jan. 2, this figure had risen to 84%, reflecting bullish sentiment among bettors. Prediction markets like Polymarket allow users to trade contracts based on specific events, with pricing influenced by real-time market expectations. Sigel described the platform’s initial forecast as “underpriced,” indicating his belief that the odds of a Solana ETF approval are even more favorable. The optimism surrounding Solana ETFs is partly attributed to President-elect Donald Trump’s vocal support for cryptocurrencies. Following his election victory in November, Trump pledged to make the United States “the world’s crypto capital,” a stance that has sparked hopes for a more lenient regulatory environment for digital assets. Industry insiders view Trump’s pro-crypto agenda as a potential catalyst for the approval of various cryptocurrency ETFs currently under review by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Analysts believe that more than half a dozen proposed crypto ETFs could see the green light in the coming years. Despite the positive outlook, Solana ETFs face significant regulatory hurdles. In June, VanEck and 21Shares filed applications with the SEC to list spot Solana ETFs. However, the SEC has expressed concerns over whether SOL qualifies as a security rather than a commodity, complicating its inclusion in ETFs. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) ETFs—currently the only cryptocurrency ETFs permitted on US exchanges—utilize a specialized ”grantor trust” structure designed for single-commodity funds. For Solana ETFs to succeed, issuers must ensure that their structures align with regulatory expectations. The cryptocurrency industry is betting on 2025 as a breakthrough year for the market. Polymarket’s rising odds for Solana ETF approval are mirrored by broader market optimism. Bettors anticipate not only new ETF listings but also a resurgence in cryptocurrency prices, with predictions of Bitcoin and Ethereum reaching all-time highs. Sigel has been vocal about his confidence in Solana’s prospects, stating in November that the odds of regulatory approval for Solana ETFs are “overwhelmingly high.” This sentiment reflects a growing belief that Trump’s administration will be more accommodating to cryptocurrency innovations, potentially paving the way for a wave of new ETFs. The Role of Betting Markets Betting platforms like Polymarket have gained credibility for their accuracy in predicting significant events, including Trump’s election victory and the Republican Party’s control of Congress. In December alone, Polymarket recorded nearly $2 billion in trading volume, showcasing its influence as a barometer of market sentiment. During the US elections, betting platforms outperformed traditional polling methods, signaling their effectiveness in capturing real-time market expectations. With a proven track record, Polymarket and similar platforms are now key indicators of sentiment in the cryptocurrency sector. The interplay between regulatory challenges, market sentiment, and political developments sets the stage for an eventful 2025 for cryptocurrency ETFs. As optimism builds around Trump’s pro-crypto policies and the evolving regulatory landscape, the potential approval of Solana ETFs could mark a significant milestone for the industry. While uncertainties remain, the convergence of favorable market conditions and political support has positioned Solana as a strong contender in the race for ETF listings. For now, betting markets and industry leaders alike are bullish, signaling that 2025 could be a transformative year for cryptocurrency adoption and innovation. Solana Price Surges 10% Amid $55 Million Kraken Transfer and Growing ETF Anticipation Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) has made a significant recovery in the cryptocurrency market, with its price surging approximately 10% to over $200 following a substantial $55 million transfer from Pump.fun’s fee account to the Kraken exchange. The price movement has rekindled bullish sentiments in the market, with analysts and traders speculating on the potential for further gains in the near term. Solana’s price rebounded sharply on Jan. 1 after a brief dip to $189 at 5:00 PM UTC. The recovery began an hour later, around 6:00 PM UTC, as Pump.fun, a meme coin launch platform, transferred $55 million worth of SOL to Kraken. Solscan data reveals that Pump.fun made two significant deposits to Kraken that day: The first transfer of $22.8 million occurred at 4:37 PM UTC. The second transfer, worth $32.7 million, followed at 5:45 PM UTC. These transfers appeared to alleviate selling pressure, providing a catalyst for Solana’s rebound. Pump.fun’s activity has been a significant factor in Solana’s price dynamics throughout 2024. According to Lookonchain data, the platform has deposited over $303 million worth of SOL to Kraken and sold more than $41 million worth of SOL tokens to date. While Pump.fun’s actions provided an immediate boost to Solana’s price, the larger ETF narrative is shaping the asset’s future. With market anticipation for the approval of a spot Solana ETF in the United State growing steadily, industry experts predict a potential rally to $400 if approval is granted. The possibility of an ETF approval has not been fully priced into Solana’s market value, according to Alejo Pinto, founder of the Solana layer-2 network Lumio. Pinto commented, “Since it is still very uncertain, an ETF approval in the US would have a positive price impact on Solana since the probability is low and therefore not yet priced in.” Several prominent asset management firms, including VanEck, Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Canary Capital, are actively pursuing approval for a spot Solana ETF. Key deadlines are approaching, with Grayscale’s application due for a decision by January 23 and preliminary decisions for other applicants expected by Jan. 25. A precedent for Solana ETFs has already been set in global markets. Brazil approved its first Solana ETF on Aug. 7, 2024, signaling increasing institutional interest in the altcoin.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-03 05:30:00

This decline has led to growing concerns among investors about whether the market is entering a prolonged cooling-off period or if this correction signifies the end of the bull cycle. However, historically, such phases have been common in Bitcoin’s market cycles, often followed by periods of renewed upward momentum. Analysts are now turning to key on-chain metrics to provide insights into the current phase and its implications for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Related Reading: Market Alert: Bitcoin’s $81K Support Zone Could Decide Its Next Big Move Key On-Chain Indicators Reflect Market Sentiment A CryptoQuant analyst known as Avocado Onchain recently shared an analysis suggesting that the market remains within a broader bull cycle. Using on-chain indicators such as the Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), Miner Position Index (MPI), and funding rates, the analyst outlined the current state of Bitcoin. According to the report, the SOPR (7-day Simple Moving Average) remains above 1 but is trending downward, indicating reduced profit margins for sellers. This metric often acts as an early signal of market sentiment shifts, with drops below 1 historically triggering rebounds as selling pressure subsides. The report further analyzed Bitcoin’s Miner Position Index (MPI). This index measures miner behavior, particularly their tendency to sell Bitcoin in anticipation of significant market events, such as halving cycles or peak price levels. The current trend in MPI shows no significant outflows from miners to exchanges, suggesting that large mining operations are holding their Bitcoin reserves. Avocado added that this indicates confidence in the long-term value of Bitcoin, even as short-term volatility persists. However, periodic sell-offs to cover operational costs are still expected. Another important indicator highlighted by the CryptoQuant analyst is total network fees, measured using a 7-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This metric reflects transaction activity and overall on-chain engagement. Avocado disclosed that the recent decline in network fees suggests reduced trading activity and a temporary cooling-off phase in market participation. Historically, such periods of lower transaction activity have preceded periods of renewed bullish momentum, especially when other indicators align with this trend. Bitcoin Funding Rates And Investor Sentiment Funding rates, another significant indicator in the analysis, have shown a downward trend. Funding rates represent the cost of holding long or short positions in Bitcoin futures contracts and are often used to gauge market sentiment. During bull cycles, sharp drops in funding rates have often been followed by rebounds, as bearish sentiment reaches an extreme point and buyers return to the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Eyes Fresh Gains: Can Bulls Break Through? The analyst emphasized that while current on-chain data suggests a cooling-off phase rather than the end of the bull cycle, short-term price movements remain uncertain. Historically, funding rate drops have served as buying opportunities for long-term investors, particularly during periods of heightened market pessimism.

Cardano (ADA) also turned in an attractive performance in Q4 after overcoming critical barriers. But Rollblock (RBLK) is the top-rated crypto in the presale market, and has seen a huge cash influx, ending 2024 with over $7.9 million raised. Let’s examine why RBLK is tipped for mammoth returns in 2025. Rollblock (RBLK): the top-rated crypto in GambleFi This Ethereum-based iGaming protocol is causing a cosmic storm in the gambling industry with incredible revenue-sharing benefits. The Rollblock crypto casino features over 1,000+ games and a wide selection of live sports events.

That has made this emerging iGaming powerhouse the go-to crypto betting platform for Gen Z betters, boosting its gaming revenues. Here’s the real deal: A portion of the revenue collected on the platform’s casino floor is paid as a weekly dividend to players and investors. RBLK token holders staking their tokens to provide liquidity can earn up to 30% APY! Chip in Rollblock’s growth potential . The iGaming market is forecast to surpass $700 billion by 2028. Capturing even a tiny share of this treasure chest of cash will be sufficient to drive RBLK’s market cap into the billions, pumping the token price to lofty heights. Analysts anticipate the RBLK token price will increase 880% in presale, followed by a potential 50x explosion on launch! Cardano (ADA) might smash $3 in 2025 ADA was a top-rated crypto asset in the Smart Contracts sector before the 2022 bear market pushed Cardano into dejection. Fortunately, ADA awoke in Q4, rising from a low of $0.27 in August to $1.32 in December for a nearly 5x return. Recently, ADA has been experiencing a pullback, falling over 25% monthly to hover in the $0.85 zone. As of press time, ADA was sitting on a mere 42% yearly return, but the Cardano community sentiment was quite bullish at 90%. CoinCodex data shows ADA could witness a 400% blast to enter the $4.4 zone. XRP news of RLUSD sparks optimism XRP is the top-rated crypto for cross-border settlements. The altcoin broke out in November, rising from the doldrums in the $0.3 region to hit $2.9 in December, pulling an impressive 9.6x yield. Bullish XRP news of the Ripple-SEC win, RLUSD launch, and plans to introduce smart contracts into the Ripple Ledger are some of the bullish factors that restored investors’ confidence in the XRP prospect. Per CoinCodex, XRP could reach $4.4 in March, returning over 100% in the coming months. An 87% bullish community sentiment adds to the positive outlook. ADA and XRP take a back seat to RBLK Though XRP and ADA are predicted to deliver solid returns in 2025, their prospects pale before RBLK’s potential.

The XRP price has been consolidating above the $1.96 mark, a key resistance level from 2021. This price point formed in April and May 2021, and it was recently broken in early December 2024. Since then, XRP has remained above this level, showing strength and stability. This is a positive sign for XRP holders, as it means a market shift from the volatility seen in previous years when prices often broke above resistance levels, only to fall quickly afterward. Potential for Another High in XRP’s Price Looking ahead, there is a potential for XRP to form another high. This could be the fifth wave in an Elliott Wave pattern, hinting at a possible continuation of the bullish trend. While it’s not guaranteed, the expectation is for at least one more high in this cycle. Triangle Pattern Forming on Smaller Timeframe On the smaller time frame, XRP appears to be forming a triangle pattern. Triangles typically evolve into ABCDE structures, with each wave in the triangle representing higher lows and lower highs. If this pattern holds, XRP could see another high before completing the triangle. Key Support and Resistance Levels For continued bullish momentum, XRP must maintain its position above the 20th December low, around $0.96. A break below this support level could signal a bearish trend, but the larger bullish thesis would remain intact. On the micro scale, XRP might experience one more push upwards, potentially touching new resistance levels. The immediate target areas to watch are between $2.42 and $2.45, followed by higher resistance at $2.54, $2.61, and $2.62. Should XRP break below the $2.22 level, it could signal a shift towards lower levels.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-03 05:50:22

This uptrend is driven mainly by optimism due to historical trends, Trump’s pro-crypto regulations and the Fed’s relatively dovish stance. This CoinGape article outlines the top five Bitcoin price predictions for 2025. *bitcoin price updated as of No data found for bitcoin on 24 minutes ago. Top 5 Bitcoin Price Predictions For 2025 As noted in a previous CoinGape article, we predicted that Bitcoin’s price could peak on October 6, 2025 , based on Mars-Vesta’s 3.9-year cycle. In this article, we will outline the top five Bitcoin price predictions from popular investors and founders in the crypto space. Fundstrat Global Advisors’ Tom Lee: $250,000 Tom Lee noted in a CNBC interview, “We expect something around $250,000 for Bitcoin in 2025.” Lee adds, “We see Bitcoin closer to $250K by Thanksgiving next year (2025).” In a November Wealthion interview , Lee said, “Bitcoin could hit $250K next year.” The optimism surrounding this prediction comes from the fact that the Fed is cutting interest rates in the growth phase of the business cycle, providing the much-needed oomph to push markets higher. Bitwise: $200,000 Asset manager Bitwise is also optimistic about cryptocurrencies in 2025, with their BTC price target of $200,000 by the end of 2025. The head of research at Bitwise Invest, Ryan Rasmussen , posted “Bitwise’s 10 Predictions for 2025,” which included a “BTC to $200K,” among other forecasts such as Bitcoin ETF inflows hitting a new high in 2025, Coinbase stock price hitting $700 and so on. Standard Chartered: $250,000 Like Tom Lee and other popular analysts, Standard Chartered’s target for 2025 is $250,000. QCP Capital While QCP Capital did not provide exact figures, their outlook for Q1, 2025 is cautiously optimistic. The company’s Telegram post added, “Despite a lackluster finish, BTC will close the year up 120%, outperforming globally stocks and gold. For 2025, while optimism surrounds crypto-friendly regulations post-Trump inauguration, we think the key catalyst may come in January as institutions readjust asset allocations.” Other Notable Figures’ Bitcoin Price Prediction For 2025 Anthony Pompliano, Co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital said, “Bitcoin could hit $250,000 by 2025.” His target is driven by increasing demand for BTC due to its fixed 21 million supply. American venture capitalist and billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya noted that Bitcoin could reach an all-time high of $500,000 by October 2025. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Forecasting Short-term BTC Targets The one-day Bitcoin chart forecasts an ongoing trend, where BTC tanks at the start of the month. Since May 2024, Bitcoin price has swept the lows formed in the previous month. This sweep wipes out early bulls and allows smart money to position before the uptrend kickstarts. If such a history were to repeat, a correction is due for Bitcoin. If Bitcoin gets rejected at around $99,963, a key lower high will form in December, then a correction is highly likely. In such a case, the retracement could undo 2025 gains and sweep the December 30 swing low at $91,530. This move would fulfill the ongoing trend and set the stage for an expansion to the upside. The RSI is also attempting to reclaim the 50 mean level, indicating that the bulls are attempting a recovery rally but are not successful yet. Hence, investors should not disregard a potential correction before the uptrend kickstarts. BTC/USDT 1-day chart Bitcoin Price Targets In the past seven months, a sweep of the previous monthly lows has catalyzed a Bitcoin price rally of 25% to 50% in 18 to 25 days. Assuming the lower limit, BTC could set up a new all-time high of $114,000 before President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20. Conclusion While Bitcoin’s outlook at the start of a new year is bullish, no doubt, investors need to pay attention to the macroeconomic and geopolitical news. China’s increasing excess, falling 10-year bond, Trump’s inauguration, the Nonfarm Payrolls and the Fed’s interest rate decision, there are plenty of macroeconomic events that could disrupt the uptrend and trigger a massive correction. From a market structure perspective, the 15% correction from ATH $108,421.80 has not confirmed a reversal yet. Hence, investors must be cautious and wait for confirmation before investing based on FOMO.

The technical setup for ADA shows that the altcoin could be gearing up for a mega rally of 300% in the next few weeks from here moving all the way to $4. Here’s Why Cardano Price Can Rally to $4 Amid the broader market recovery, Cardano is showing greater strength in comparison to its peers with a remarkable gain among the other top altcoins . Crypto analyst Ali Martinez draws parallels between the current Cardano price action and its performance in the previous market cycle between November 2020 and August 2021, when ADA experienced a mega bull rally. Considering a similar breakout ahead, Martinez believes that ADA price could surge all the way to $4 in the coming weeks. Source: Ali Martinez Following Donald Trump’s victory, the crypto staged a 3x rally in a month’s time amid strong euphoria in the broader altcoin market. Market analysts believe that the altcoin market cap can be nearly 5x in 2025 reaching all the way to $7 trillion. Thus, this 300% rally won’t come as a surprise in that case. ADA price today was up 8.07% at $1.01 with a market cap of $35.63 billion. Also, the daily trading volume has surged by 5% to $1.26 highlighting the chances of a sustained rally moving ahead. As per the Coinglass data , the ADA open interest is also up 7% and is currently at $781 million. Also, amid the Cardano price surge, the 24-hour liquidations have soared to $2.38 million with $1.56 million in short liquidations. Charles Hoskinson Stays Bullish for ADA in 2025 Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson also shared a bullish take on Cardano (ADA) for this year of 2025. Hoskinson has forecasted unprecedented growth for the network, citing the potential integration of Bitcoin DeFi through the BitcoinOS network as a key driver. This development could channel billions of dollars into the Cardano ecosystem by incorporating Bitcoin’s liquidity and functionality. Furthermore, Hoskinson remains committed to greater decentralization for the Cardano blockchain adding that his last “duty is to remove any roadblock for this transition, and there is no way in hell anyone or thing is going to derail that process”. Recently, he had also questioned the Cardano Foundation’s stronger control in overall decision-making. Such developments could be bullish for Cardano price in the long term.

Thiel touted Bitcoin's long-term potential as a significant investment, advising people to allocate a small amount of funds to BTC each month. “Put some money in Bitcoin every month and forget about it,” Thiel said, adding that consistent investments can grow significantly over a few years, citing Bitcoin’s historical performance of averaging annual returns of between 29% and 50% despite occasional downturns. Bitcoin started 2025 with strong momentum, rising 3.25% to $97,605 as of January 1. Analysts and industry leaders, including Thiel, attribute the bullish trend to a more favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration. Estimates for Bitcoin’s price range from $150,000 to $250,000 by the end of the year, driven by factors such as increasing institutional adoption and central banks potentially adding BTC to their reserves. Related News: Big Bull Michael Saylor Shares New Predictions About Bitcoin Thiel highlighted Marathon Digital’s strategic moves in this growing market. The company, the world’s largest Bitcoin miner, currently holds 44,893 Bitcoins worth over $4 billion and adds 700 to 900 new Bitcoins per month through mining. The CEO also pointed to the transformative role of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which currently collectively hold more than 1 million BTC. He noted that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s endorsement of Bitcoin as “digital gold” has boosted the asset’s credibility among investors. Thiel also commented on broader developments, such as Switzerland's upcoming referendum on creating a national Bitcoin reserve and the growing interest of financial giants like Fidelity and E-Trade in crypto trading services. Marathon Digital remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s future, with Thiel predicting continued growth due to limited supply, increasing demand, and broader acceptance among institutional and individual investors. “BTC doesn’t provide returns; it provides appreciation,” Thiel said, likening Bitcoin to gold as a store of value. *This is not investment advice.

In this regard, there are worthy coins to be staked which include Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and one of the newly launched memecoins, Pepeto (PEPETO) . Pepeto Presale: Golden Opportunity for Early Investors The ongoing Pepeto presale offers early investors an opportunity to acquire tokens at a highly favorable price of $0.000000101. The project has already raised over $3 million, signalling strong support from the crypto community. Additionally, Pepeto plans to list on five major exchanges following its presale phase, ensuring broad accessibility and liquidity. To buy and stake $PEPETO, start by creating a Metamask wallet (or another compatible wallet) if you don’t have one. To continue, either use a card or load your wallet with crypto (ETH, USDT, or BNB). Next, link your wallet to the Pepeto website, decide how you want to pay, and pick how much $PEPETO you want to buy. For maximum gains, you can buy and stake your $PEPETO directly from the website. Ethereum’s Strong Position in the Crypto Market Ethereum, thanks to its proven versatility, has established itself as a major platform for building decentralized applications. In 2022, the ETH 2.0 upgrade introduced the proof-of-stake consensus, which made the network faster and more energy-efficient. In gaming and finance, Ethereum utilizes Layer 2 solutions such as Arbitrum and Polygon to process additional transactions and serve numerous sectors. Ethereum is trading at $3,394.37 at press time with a daily volume of over $13 billion. Changelly’s blog price predictions for 2025 suggest an exchange rate range of $2,357.19 to $3,168.69 for Ethereum. With its resilience and growth potential, the average price may rise to $3,980.19. Solana: High-Speed Blockchain with Decentralized Applications Solana’s capabilities handling large volumes of transactions at a very high speed have attracted massive backing. At its base level, Solana is a decentralized application that doesn’t need Layer 2 solutions because the network is expected to handle up to thousands of transactions per second. This makes it different from rivals such as Ethereum and Cardano which are regarded as competitors within the market. Trading around $195.18 at press time, Solana’s value has grown by over 5% in the past day, supported by a trading volume of $2.3 billion. In 2025, Changelly blog analysts expect Solana’s price to range from $138.50 to $177.29, with an average price of $216.07. Pepeto Takes Memecoin Sector by Storm The memecoin space, often dominated by hype, now sees Pepeto emerging as a strategic contender. Unlike its predecessors, Pepeto is built on the pillars of sustainability, technology, and optimization. It combines unique storytelling with cutting-edge blockchain innovation to offer a new standard for memecoins. Pepeto’s narrative begins with the god of frogs gathering six sacred principles Power, Energy, Precision, Efficiency, Technology, and Optimization over centuries. These features serve as the basis for the project. Besides, Pepeto’s ecosystem introduces staking, a cross-chain bridge, and a dedicated exchange for memecoins. The $PEPETO token offers staking rewards of up to 484% annually, incentivizing long-term participation while securing the network. The staking feature supports passive income generation and enhances the project’s stability. A New Year’s Message from the God of Frogs As the New Year begins, the God of Frogs, Pepeto Himself, shares a message of triumph and faith for the loyal Pepeto Army: The Plan Unfolds: The roadmap progresses flawlessly, as foretold. Every milestone has been achieved, and the… pic.twitter.com/zCmy1bTRQY — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) January 1, 2025 Additionally, Pepeto includes a powerful cross-chain bridge, enabling seamless interoperability between memecoins and other cryptocurrencies. This functionality provides liquidity and accessibility, addressing a common limitation in the memecoin market. Pepeto’s roadmap reflects its ambitious vision. In its initial phases, the project focuses on community building, social media engagement, and securing exchange listings. Later stages emphasize technology testing, exchange platform launches, and extensive marketing campaigns. This strategy positions Pepeto as a strong competitor in the crypto market. Memecoin With Substance With 2025 set to bring about new opportunities, Ethereum, Solana, and Pepeto are positioned for substantial growth. Investors will benefit from Ethereum’s proven ecosystem, Solana’s scalability, and Pepeto’s unique memecoin model. Pepeto is especially unique because it has struck a balance between offering the lore we’ve come to expect from its meme coin peers and bringing the same type of substance from a project like Ethereum or Solana. As staking becomes more popular, these tokens are poised to provide steady rewards and long-term value. For those looking to add another layer to the crypto portfolio, the time is now to look into these staking options. For more information, visit the official Pepeto presale at https://pepeto.io/ ABOUT PEPETO Pepeto is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency project blending the playful spirit of memecoins with a powerful utility-driven ecosystem. It features a zero-fee exchange, a cross-chain bridge for seamless swaps, and staking rewards designed to support the next generation of tokens.

New Year New Shiba (NEWSHIBA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to surge over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because NEWSHIBA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, New Year New Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and New Year New Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. New Year New Shiba launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy New Year New Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for New Year New Shiba by entering its contract address – 7DjEUoHG7Yr3LpaqNPcyc5DgNEYSLrnPV8zsjQBbAYfh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like NEWSHIBA.

With the Altcoin chart — Total Cap 2 — trading within a bullish accumulation zone, several tokens might begin to rise, with analysts predicting 1Fuel (OFT) could generate one of the most significant gains, possibly exceeding 100x, among other altcoins from its current presale price of $0.012. Here’s what’s driving the optimism: XRP Is Oversold: Will The Price Jump? After establishing a new high of $2.90 on December 3, XRP has plummeted, causing the asset to lose 29.64% of its price, according to the Binance chart on TradingView. While this downward trend persists, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), a technical indicator that determines whether the market is overbought or oversold, shows the asset in oversold territory at press time, meaning a bounce-back is much anticipated. On the 4-hour chart, XRP’s potential bounce back is in motion, trading within a 4-week-long accumulation zone on the chart. This means bidding is taking place by large and retail investors, and XRP will soon rally. Once the rally happens, XRP will return a 1x trade. Its current price of approximately $2.10 on the chart could become $4.20. Other investors looking for more gains consider SHIB but find new insights SHIB Struggles To Attract Investors As large investors begin to consider SHIB, they soon find out that the asset has been in a downward trend. According to CoinMarketCap, SHIB has been predominantly bearish across all time frames, losing 22.19% in the past month, 6.41% in the past 7 days, and 2.06% in the past 24 hours. The volume surge is a testament to the rising lack of interest among holders of SHIB, as they’ve begun selling. In the last 24 hours, the volume has surged by 24.35%, accompanied by a price decline, which means the market is selling fast. Investors find this bearish undertone an unsafe option to put their funds into and have channeled them into 1Fuel. Its rapid sale worth over $935,000 and status as a utility token make it the best cryptocurrency to invest in for 2025. Why 1Fuel Could Lead The Next Altseason Analysts predict that the upcoming altseason will be dominated by utility-focused cryptocurrencies, with 1Fuel positioned at the forefront. 1Fuel is designed to power its ecosystem’s cryptocurrency wallet, currently in development. This wallet will enable staking, gas fee settlements, rewards, and fund allocation—all built around the 1Fuel token. According to its roadmap, the wallet aims to be a comprehensive solution, offering services like seamless on-ramping and off-ramping through integrated crypto banking. It also promises competitive APRs for staking and streamlined interaction with DeFi protocols. 1Fuel’s cryptocurrency wallet will support multi-chain transactions while maintaining ultra-low gas fees and providing a unified payment mechanism for gas fees, setting it apart from competitors. Conclusion As the altseason approaches, 1Fuel remains the best asset to prioritize, as it’s set to return the most gains—potentially as high as 100x, according to analysts, who call it undervalued at $0.012 compared to XRP and SHIB. If the market run begins in full force, missing out on 1Fuel’s rally could lead to huge regret, as it’s considered the best cryptocurrency to invest in for 2025.

The firm raised its price target from $145,000 in a note to investors today, implying a potential upside of over 130%. “Based on our analysis of historical price cycles and recent price action, we predict that BTC will reach $225,000 per coin by the end of 2025, driven by the prospect of a more favorable U.S. regulatory environment under the new administration, the availability of spot Bitcoin ETFs, and accelerating adoption by institutional investors and corporations,” said HC Wainwright analyst Mike Colonnese. The projected price translates to a market cap of around $4.5 trillion, roughly 25% of gold’s total market cap. However, Colonnese warned investors to expect some volatility, noting that Bitcoin has historically experienced declines of 30% during bull markets. Related News: Expert Reveals 5 Different Cryptocurrency Predictions for 2025 - “All Will Come True” “BTC price action is highly correlated with global liquidity (measured by M2), which has been on a downtrend since October,” Colonnese added. “We estimate that Bitcoin could drop to $70,000 levels in early Q1 2025 before rebounding.” Colonnese also highlighted a potential game-changer: the creation of a U.S. national Bitcoin reserve. The idea, first proposed by Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis and later echoed by President-elect Donald Trump, envisions Bitcoin as a strategic treasury reserve asset. HC Wainwright put the probability of the U.S. adopting such a reserve this year at 60%, which could push Bitcoin’s price “significantly above” the firm’s $225,000 target. This year is expected to bring critical developments in crypto legislation, with investors hoping that Congress will provide long-awaited regulatory clarity. HC Wainwright predicts that this could lead to more investment in Bitcoin, including advisory allocations and public companies adding BTC to their balance sheets. *This is not investment advice.

They have a notional value of $1.93 billion, which is a fraction of last week’s mammoth end-of-year expiry event, so the impact on spot markets is likely to be minimal. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.68, meaning that there are more long (call) contracts expiring than short (put) contract sellers. Open interest, or the value or number of options contracts yet to expire, is highest at the $120,000 strike price, with $1.4 billion in OI, according to Deribit. There is also $1.3 billion in OI at $110,000, so derivatives traders remain bullish with open contracts at higher strike prices. Bitcoin options OI by expiry. Source: Deribit On Jan. 2, Deribit reported that the continuous trading market, or perpetual swaps, is showing more optimistic signals, similar to what was seen before the recent downturn. “Options markets report a similarly mixed message: BTC’s short-tenor volatility smiles remain slightly more skewed toward OTM puts, while longer tenors have increased their bullish tilt.” It added that December’s end-of-year expiration of a significant proportion of the market’s OI in options “did not result in the fireworks that some expected.” Earlier this week, crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live observed that a major short call position had been put on Bitcoin with a notional value of $42 million. The speculator is betting that BTC will not exceed $150,000 by March 28 and stands to net $900,000 from the bet if successful. In addition to today’s Bitcoin options, around 205,000 Ethereum contracts are expiring today. These have a notional value of $710 million and a put/call ratio of 0.82. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $2.6 billion. Crypto Market Outlook Around $160 billion has entered crypto markets since the beginning of the year on Wednesday, lifting total capitalization to $3.56 trillion. Bitcoin has had a solid 24 hours, gaining 1.7% to stand close to the $97,000 level during early trading in Asia on Friday. However, it remains range-bound and needs to clear resistance at the psychological $100,000 level to see further momentum. Meanwhile, Ethereum, which has been predicted to perform well this quarter, has fared better, gaining 2% on the day as it approaches the $3,500 price level. ETH needs to clear $3,600 to break resistance and notch further gains. The altcoins were pretty much all in the green this Friday, with most of them outpacing Bitcoin on daily gains.

Aiming to make the most of this bull run, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA) whales have been stacking up DTX Exchange (DTX) , a new DeFi coin with huge upside potential. It costs only $0.14 in the seventh round of the ICO, approaching its launch scheduled for Q1. The rising whale activity pushed it above $11.2 million in early funding, highlighting its rapidly growing community and trust in its potential. DTX Exchange (DTX): The Next Billion-Dollar Crypto Project? DTX Exchange (DTX), hailed as the next big thing, is a new DeFi project not to miss. The Ethereum-based cryptocurrency has become a subject of much interest, from its unique offering to its massive growth prospects. Its value proposition revolves around a hybrid trading platform—a blend of the best elements of centralized and decentralized exchanges. It also aims to narrow the gap between the crypto world and traditional financial systems. Its novel unified blockchain, VulcanX, already live, will integrate conventional financial instruments with Web3 products, hailed by experts as groundbreaking. Given the above, it is set to reshape the $3.2 billion global trading market, making the DTX token a must-have. Aside from being used to trade tokenized financial instruments and cryptocurrencies, it also has governance functions. Equally important, token holders are in for massive ROIs after Tier-1 exchange listings, considering the projected 100x upswing. This drives interest among Cardano (ADA) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales, positioning it as arguably the best new crypto to invest in. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Little Room for Growth Shiba Inu (SHIB), the second-largest memecoin and the biggest within the Ethereum blockchain, is among the best altcoins. Following a quick bounce, the Shiba Inu price hovers around $0.000022, reclaiming lost price levels. Key technical indicators like the 9-HMA and 10-SMA point to further upswings, making it one of the altcoins to watch. At the same time, experts’ bullish forecasts highlight its potential, even though it has little room for growth considering previous rallies. CW8900, one of the leading crypto experts on X, targets $0.000035 once Shiba Inu (SHIB) breaks out above $0.000022. Digitalknol, another crypto trader and analyst, predicts SHIB will hit $0.00015 in 2025—probably too ambitious. However, as one of the leading cryptocurrencies, it has limited upside potential compared to DTX Exchange (DTX), making the latter more appealing. Cardano (ADA) Targets Further Upswings Cardano (ADA), one of the top ten cryptocurrencies, swung high. Selling pressure eased as the bulls regained control, pushing the Cardano price above $0.9—a 10% upswing on the daily chart. Considering current momentum, Darren, a top analyst, predicts Cardano (ADA) will reach $1.80 before the end of January. Solana_king, also bullish on the Layer-1 crypto, suggests it could trade around $3.50 this year. Backed by key technical indicators like the 9-HMA and 20-VWMA, Cardano is a top crypto to invest in. However, it has limited upside potential as a large-cap token, sparking a shift to DTX Exchange , a new DeFi coin with 100x growth prospects. DTX Exchange (DTX): The Next Cardano (ADA) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) The growing whale interest in DTX Exchange (DTX) can be linked to its massive growth prospects—a projected 100x rally post-launch. In addition, its unique hybrid trading platform makes it fundamentally solid, further driving demand. Hailed as the next big thing, it might be a more promising alternative than Cardano (ADA) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).

Sui (SUI) Targets $6 Price Level The Sui coin is among the top crypto coins that are showing positive movement in the market. CoinMarketCap data shows the value of Sui (SUI) has risen by 4.2% on the weekly chart. The cryptocurrency’s price has also risen by 22.2% in the monthly timeframe. Looking ahead, analysts expect the Sui price could rally to new highs in the coming weeks. Cryptoknight890 forecasts the value of the altcoin might rise to $7.4 soon. Another analyst called Suipiens told his followers the price of the Sui token might drop to the $3.3-$3.5 zone first. Afterward, he expects a breakout to $6 to follow. Notably, Suipiens told his followers to remain positive as this could be SUI’s last price dip. In other news, the cryptocurrency’s largest perpetual DEX has reached $100 million. This is an increase of 450% in the last two months, signaling high interest from investors.

Notably, intraday burn statistics flagged a whopping 1500% uptick, primarily against the backdrop of over 30 million tokens destroyed. In turn, crypto market participants are now speculating whether Shiba Inu price could hit a $0.001 target this month. SHIB Burn Rate Shoots Up 1500% Echoing Market Optimism As per a recent X post by the community’s official tracker Shibburn, the SHIB burn rate was up 1550%, underscoring a massive hit to the circulating supply. Per the data shared, 33.01 million coins were burnt in the past 24 hours, aiding the burn rate uptick. For context, the Shiba Inu token burn mechanism primarily focuses on permanently reducing the asset’s circulating supply. As a result, market participants anticipate a bullish impact on the top meme coin’s future movements, aligning with the law of supply and demand. Simultaneously, weekly burn statistics indicated that 44.03 million tokens were taken out of the supply, adding to market optimism surrounding the asset. Also, recent ecosystem developments have further aided the leading dog-themed meme coin in retaining its bullish stance across the market. CoinGape reported that the crypto’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, recently confirmed the TREAT token launch . This chronicle, expected to support the broader ecosystem substantially, remains much awaited in the market. Simultaneously, the Shiba Inu price also remains extensively eyed by market watchers in anticipation of considerable gains in 2025, primarily in the wake of community advancements and constant SHIB burns. Price To Hit $0.001 This Month? SHIB price today showcased gains worth 2% intraday and is currently resting at $0.00002264. The meme coin’s 24-hour low and high were $0.00002198 and $0.00002294, respectively. Notably, the rising price trajectory aligns with the remarkable surge in the SHIB burn rate, as mentioned above. Moreover, a recent Shiba Inu price analysis by CoinGape further rationalized a $0.001 price target for the token, looming for this month. Breaking through the critical resistance level of $0.000025 remains highly pivotal for the crypto. Besides, the broader ecosystem developments and rising adoption of Shibarium have further weighed the scales towards the bullish side of the coin. As the supply continues to shred in the interim, a $0.001 price target appears to be scalable ahead, as market experts also expect a bull cycle continuation in 2025.

This upward momentum brings the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization closer to its all-time high achieved in November 2024. However, market experts caution that Solana may face significant pressure in the coming days. A Double-Edged Sword For Solana Investors Ben Lilly, a market analyst at Jarvis Labs, recently highlighted potential risks tied to the “Grayscale Effect.” In a social media post, he warned that the upcoming Grayscale SOL tokens unlock could create substantial selling pressure on the altcoin. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Confirms Breakout: Analyst Sets New Price Targets Grayscale, a prominent digital asset management company, enforces a policy to protect assets for 12 months following acquisition. As the two major unlocking periods near—January 24 to February 2 and July 24 to August 7—Lilly warns that investors should stay alert. The mechanics of the Grayscale Trust are similar to those seen in the past with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). In that case, investors would purchase Bitcoin (BTC) through Grayscale, which would hold the assets for a period before issuing shares. This created a premium, where the shares traded at a higher price than the actual Bitcoin price, leading to significant market rallies. However, when that premium disappeared, it marked the peak of the market in 2021, resulting in a cascade of failures for firms like Three Arrows Capital, BlockFi, Celsius, and Voyager. Potential Price Drop Ahead For SOL’s Price Lilly points out that Grayscale is now executing a comparable strategy with Solana, and the upcoming unlocks could mirror the past volatility seen in the crypto market. The analyst notes that previous large purchases of SOL tokens saw private placements unlocked from late July 2024, during which the price dropped by 40% in just ten days. The concern is that the same trend may emerge with the January 2025 unlocks, potentially leading to a significant sell-off. The analysis suggests that when investors who benefited from the premium in the past go to sell their holdings, they may flood the market, creating downward pressure on the SOL price. Related Reading: XRP Price Targets $13 After Completing Highest Candle Body Close In History – Details Lilly recommends that Solana holders consider selling in advance of the January 24 unlock date, as this could mark a critical turning point for the asset. While the Grayscale Trust for Solana is relatively small compared to the overall market cap of SOL, the potential impact on price cannot be overlooked. According to Lilly’s analysis, historical trends indicate that even small unlocks can significantly influence market behavior. He reassures that while the upcoming sell pressure may not lead to catastrophic losses, it could result in local tops and a decrease in premiums. As of this writing, SOL is priced at $205, decreasing slightly more than 20% from its peak of $263 attained on November 24 last year.

Most observers expect 2025 to be just as remarkable, with projections placing BTC at $185,000 and higher. The road, however, may be as straightforwardly bullish as expected, as the recent price action suggests sellers are looking to reassert themselves, raising the possibility of a notable price drop ahead. We are referring to the price action of December, when bitcoin reached a record high above $108,000 but ended the month negatively, below $94,000, registering its first monthly loss since August. The two-way price action formed a bearish reversal candlestick pattern called the ""shooting star"" on the monthly chart. The candle features a long upper wick or shadow, reflecting a substantial gap between the high and the open for the given period, paired with a small body, representing a minimal difference between the open and close. The wick needs to be at least twice the size of the body, and the lower wick could be minuscule at best. In BTC's case, the upper wick is nearly four times bigger than the body, with a tiny lower wick. The shape of the shooting star shows that buyers initially drove prices higher, only for sellers to take control near highs and push prices below the opening level, hinting at a renewed bearishness in the market. ""The bears are potentially in control,"" explains the CMT Association's Level III textbook, shedding light on the psychology behind the shooting star pattern. The shooting star has appeared after a notable uptrend from $70,000 to over $100,000, warning of a potential bearish reversal ahead, which would be confirmed if prices dip below the December low of $91,186. That's the level to defend for the bulls. Note that similar candles with longer upper wicks have marked previous bull market tops. Short-term pain The cautious message of the latest shooting star fits into the broader macroeconomic landscape, indicating challenging times for risk assets. It's primarily driven by recent hawkish signals from the Fed , coupled with rising Treasury yields and a strengthening dollar index . Analysts, however, are confident that the Fed will walk back on its recent decision to signal fewer rate cuts for 2025, ensuring a bullish broader trajectory for BTC and risk assets in general. My prediction for 2025 is simple: higher. Nothing has fundamentally changed since Nov. 5. February will be the best-performing month, with the recent Fed hawkishness still holding broader markets back short-term,"" trader and analyst Alex Kruger said on X. ""The Fed will swing back dovish sometime in Q1, with traders pricing more cuts back in,"" Kruger said.",Markets|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Price|Technical Analysis|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-03 07:12:57

Trump Loves Dancing (TRUMPDAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPDAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Dancing can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Dancing could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Dancing launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Dancing on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Dancing by entering its contract address – HVnG6NJCvVDa34VxqR1wmSo18EGtNVJhNR8CQwNwjgpi – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPDAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-03 07:15:00

BTFD Coin Is the Second Chance Bulls Have Been Waiting For,https://thecoinrise.com/watching-andy-soar-was-tough-btfd-coin-is-the-second-chance-bulls-have-been-waiting-for/,"Have you ever felt like crypto is a game of “what if”? What if you had jumped in early on Bitcoin? What if you’d bought Dogecoin before it went viral? And most recently, what if you had invested in ANDY during its rise? Watching a coin like ANDY soar while you’re stuck on the sidelines can feel like watching someone else win the lottery with your ticket. It’s frustrating, sure, but crypto is full of second chances if you don’t know where to look. ANDY’s launch had all the makings of a hit—a clever concept, ties to the ever-popular Pepe meme, and solid rewards for holders. But if you missed your chance to ride its wave, don’t lose hope. Enter BTFD Coin , the next big opportunity for bulls ready to make their mark. With its explosive presale, impressive staking rewards, and long-term growth potential, BTFD is quickly being hailed as one of the best meme coins to join this month. Let’s break down why BTFD is the fresh start you’ve been waiting for and why it’s capturing the attention of investors everywhere. BTFD Coin: The Bulls’ Second Chance If ANDY’s rise left you feeling like you missed out, BTFD Coin is here to make things right. This isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a carefully crafted investment opportunity that’s drawing in bulls from across the crypto world. Currently in its 13th presale stage, BTFD has already raised over $4.6 million, attracted more than 7,300 holders, and sold 61 billion coins. At its current price of $0.000142, it’s a steal for investors who want to get in before the coin’s predicted rise to $0.0006 by the end of the presale . One of BTFD’s standout features is its 90% APY staking programme, which allows holders to earn significant rewards simply by staking their tokens. Imagine this: you invest $10,000 in BTFD, stake your coins, and by the end of the year, you’ve earned an additional $9000 in passive income—all while waiting for the coin’s value to climb. It’s the kind of win-win scenario that makes BTFD one of the best meme coins to join this month . But that’s not all. BTFD’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) game is another reason bulls are rallying behind this coin. BTFD Coin has officially launched the full version, the game is designed to reward players with $BTFD tokens, creating an engaging ecosystem that adds value for both investors and gamers. This isn’t just a token you hold—it’s a token you can experience, and that’s a game-changer in the meme coin market. BTFD isn’t just about hype; it’s about delivering real value. With its combination of affordability, high ROI potential, and community-driven innovation, it’s easy to see why bulls are calling this their second chance to own the dip and win big. ANDY: Pepe’s Best Friend Makes His Move ANDY made waves in the crypto world by riding on the popularity of Pepe, the iconic meme character that has inspired countless tokens. Billed as Pepe’s lifelong best friend, ANDY launched as an ERC20 token with a clever twist—holders earn 3% PEPE reflections on every buy and sell transaction. This unique reward system added a layer of value that appealed to both Pepe fans and meme coin enthusiasts. The coin quickly gained traction, attracting a loyal community of investors who were drawn to its playful concept and solid rewards. ANDY wasn’t just another meme coin; it was a celebration of friendship, humour, and the ever-growing meme coin culture. However, like many meme coins, its rise was swift, leaving many potential investors on the sidelines. Whether you hesitated or simply didn’t hear about it in time, missing ANDY’s wave was a tough pill to swallow. But that’s the beauty of crypto—there’s always another opportunity around the corner, and this time, it’s BTFD Coin that’s taking centre stage.

With Bitcoin price trading above $96.5k on Friday, January 3, during the early European session, more crypto traders have turned greedy in anticipation of a parabolic market rally in the near term. Moreover, Bitcoin’s fear and greed index surged from 64 percent on January 1 to 74 percent at the time of this writing, signaling market greed. With Bitcoin dominance forming a lower high in the weekly time frame, more crypto traders are betting on a major altseason in the coming weeks. Top Predictions by Bitwise Researchers As the United States federal government prepares to change the crypto course under the upcoming Donald Trump administration, Ryan Rasmussen, the Head of Research at Bitwise Investments, is confident of further web3 growth in 2025. In a recent X post , Rasmussen highlighted that Bitcoin price will rise to $200k in 2025, while Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) scale to $7k and $750 respectively. After making a bold and successful prediction for 2024 about the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, Rasmussen now believes that the spot BTC ETFs flows will top last year’s peak in 2025. Furthermore, Rasmussen expects billions of dollars to flow into the cryptocurrency industry through the 401k plans, following the expected favoring regulatory frameworks. With the success of the publicly traded companies that have adopted a Bitcoin strategy, Rasmussen expects Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN) to enter the S&P 500 while MicroStrategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR) gets incorporated into the NASDAQ index. In 2025, Rasmussen believes the real-world assets (RWA) Tokenized industry will surpass $60 billion. Moreover, the stablecoins industry grew steadily in 2024 and could reach $400 billion by the end of this year. Rasmussen expects the countries adopting the Bitcoin strategy to double in 2025, potentially led by the United States. As for the memecoins, Rasmussen expects AI-launched tokens to lead in 2025. Meanwhile, Rasmussen expects Bitcoin’s valuation to overtake Gold’s $18 trillion market capitalization by 2029.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-03 07:29:59

According to a report by The Information, this decision aligns with expectations of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment under incoming US President Donald Trump. The move shows how banks are getting serious about crypto assets with the changing crypto scenario in the US . Trump in his election campaign pledged to position the US as a global crypto hub, promising to appoint industry-friendly leaders to regulatory agencies and to create a Bitcoin Reserve to stabilize the US economy. This anticipated policy shift has encouraged Morgan Stanley to explore crypto trading, potentially bringing digital assets to the 5.2 million accounts on E-Trade, which collectively hold around $360 billion. If implemented, the move will be a hit-and-trial to establish E-Trade as one of the largest traditional financial institutions to enter the digital space, giving direct competition to big crypto exchanges like Coinbase and would turn out to be a massive entry point for mainstream investors interested in trading these assets. Crypto’s entry in Traditional Brokerages Though E-Trade is not alone in the race, competitors such as Robinhood, Fidelity, and Interactive Brokers already offer crypto trading, with Charles Schwab planning to join the fray this year. However, these platforms typically provide access to a more limited selection of tokens compared to crypto-native exchanges like Coinbase. The profitability of crypto trading is undeniable. Robinhood’s Q3 2024 results revealed a 165% surge in crypto revenue year-over-year, reaching $61 million. Plus, Robinhood’s $200 million acquisition of Bitstamp in June expanded its capabilities to serve institutional investors in the US. Meanwhile, Coinbase reported $1.2 billion in Q3 2024 revenue, primarily from crypto trading. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Outlook: Bitwise Predicts Bitcoin to $200K in 2025 , Morgan Stanley’s Crypto Momentum Morgan Stanley has been ahead of the curve among traditional wealth managers in adopting crypto. In August, the firm authorized its 15,000 financial advisors to recommend Bitcoin ETFs to clients. These include BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, both regarded as premium Bitcoin ETFs. With $3.75 trillion in managed assets, including $1 trillion in self-directed accounts, Morgan Stanley’s move to integrate crypto trading into E-Trade could significantly broaden access to digital assets. Following the suit, other institutions like Goldman Sachs are also diving for clear crypto rules. Recently after hesitations and restricting crypto European Financial institutions are also shifting their focus on crypto with the implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Political action committees and executives of major crypto companies were key players in the 2024 elections, donating millions of dollars to candidates willing to advance the interests of the pro-crypto agenda. Groups such as Fairshake and Protect Progress invested in multi-million dollar ad buys that helped shape what could be a cryptocurrency-friendly Congress. Major Investments in Pro-Crypto Candidates Crypto PACs’ involvement was pivotal in a number of elections, but in many cases most prominently in close elections. In Ohio, for instance, Republican Bernie Moreno defeated incumbent Senator Sherrod Brown by some 200,000 votes after a staggering $40 million media campaign by the Defend American Jobs PAC. That influence trickled down to smaller but meaningful donations, like the $6,600 Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen gave to Senator Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland. Protect Progress gave Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin more than $10 million, a reminder that crypto money played a key role in campaigns at all sizes. Crypto Influence Expands in the US House The House also witnessed significant crypto-backed wins with 63 new members poised to join the chamber. Their campaigns were widely funded. For example, Protect Progress spent $1.7 million in media buys to help Alabama Representative Shomari Figures defeat Anthony Daniels in a primary. These are the kinds of investments demonstrating the emerging influence of crypto PACs in the setting of the legislative landscape. While not every representative-elect directly received crypto support, the majority of new members are considered “pro-crypto”, according to advocacy group Stand With Crypto. That influence positions the crypto industry to play a major role in shaping upcoming financial and regulatory policies. 2026 and Beyond: Continued Crypto Advocacy Crypto PACs are already preparing for future elections, with over $100 million earmarked for the 2026 cycle. Large donors like Coinbase and Ripple want to ensure the industry has a foothold in US politics. In 2026, with all 435 House seats and a third of the Senate on the ballot, crypto backers will continue their strategy of endorsing candidates friendly to the sector. All that would suggest this sustained engagement could have serious implications for proposed legislation like the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, setting the course of crypto regulation in the United States.",Blockchain|Regulation|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-01-03 07:34:00

Mellon Auditorium in Washington, D.C. The event celebrates the inauguration of President Donald Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance. Tickets? A cool $2,500 each. Time? 8:00 p.m. to midnight. Attire? Black tie, of course. With cocktails, hors d’oeuvres, and valet parking, the crypto industry is making sure it’s seen, heard, and, most importantly, taken even more seriously than it already has been. Crypto’s millions flood Trump’s inauguration Trump’s inauguration committee has raked in $200 million so far, with projections of hitting $225 million by the big day. This is one of the largest in history, and crypto money is all over it. Ripple alone dropped $5 million, making it one of the top donors. Coinbase and Kraken each donated at least $1 million. Big tech names like Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Sam Altman joined the mix, each contributing $1 million. The tech sector sees crypto’s rising influence and wants a piece of the action—or at least a favorable regulatory shake-up. Paul Atkins , a long-time crypto ally, is expected to replace SEC chair Gary Gensler. If this happens, it would end what the industry sees as an era of hostility. Atkins is viewed as someone who gets it—I mean, this guy first invested in Bitcoin over ten years ago. Other nominees include Scott Bessent for Treasury and Howard Lutnick for Commerce. Both have pro-crypto views. Crypto’s regulatory reset? Later today, the 119th Congress will get to work. They’re mostly Republicans eager to push Trump’s picks through as quickly as possible, paving the way for big changes in regulations. For the crypto community, this can’t happen fast enough. Everyone’s counting on Trump to sign executive orders right after he’s sworn in. The real action kicks off on January 20. The day starts early, with security gates opening at 6:00 a.m. ET to accommodate the crowds. By 9:30 a.m., musical performances will warm up the audience. At 11:30 a.m., dignitaries will gather for opening remarks on the Capitol’s West Front. Then J.D. Vance will take his oath as vice president, followed by Donald Trump swearing in as the 47th president of the United States. His inauguration speech is expected to lay out all plans for the next four years, and crypto insiders will be listening closely. Why? Because the industry anticipates immediate executive orders that could change everything. Gary Gensler, the current SEC chair, is gonna resign right before the inauguration begins. After the ceremony, Trump and Vance will head to the President’s Room for photos and transitional documents. Lunch at the National Statuary Hall will bring together congressional leaders and select guests, setting the tone for the administration’s first official day.

Amid this, Ripple’s native crypto emerged as a top player, with a flurry of developments backing the positive outlook for the crypto. In addition, the soaring anticipation over a potential approval of the Ripple ETF, as per the betters on the prediction marketplace Polymarket, has further boosted market sentiment. XRP News: Ripple ETF Speculations Boost Sentiment In the latest XRP news, Polymarket showed that there is a 70% probability of a potential Ripple ETF approval in the US. According to the data, the bets have increased significantly over a potential approval by December 31, 2025. This has fueled speculation among investors, especially as market sentiment has recently been boosted after Donald Trump’s election win. Source: Polymarket For context, Bitcoin as well as the top altcoins has recorded a robust rally over the past few months. Donald Trump’s victory and his active support for the crypto market during his election campaign have bolstered the market sentiments. Besides, his recent nomination of crypto-friendly Paul Atkins as the new US SEC chair after Gary Gensler has further fueled investors’ hope. This move has also sparked discussions over a potential dismissal of the Ripple Vs SEC lawsuit under the incoming SEC chair. Having said that, several experts anticipate a flurry of crypto ETFs to be approved this year. Apart from XRP ETF, the market experts are also putting their bets on the Solana ETF approval in 2025. Notably, Polymarket data showed that there is an 82% chance of a potential SOL ETF approval in 2025. What Lies Ahead For Ripple Coin? XRP price today was up over 3% and traded at $2.42, while its market cap touched $138.88 billion. The one-day trading volume of the crypto fell 41% to $6.22 billion. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour high and low of $2.47 and $2.35, respectively. However, despite the surge, Ripple Futures Open Interest slumped 2%, highlighting the cautious stance of the investors. However, the market experts remained optimistic about the future trajectory of the coin. For context, in a recent X post, renowned analyst Dark Defender said that Ripple’s price is poised to hit $5.85 once it soars past the critical support of $2.72. He also noted that the crypto has found a new support at $2.22.

Its price recently reached a record high of $0.45, doubling in value and jumping into the top 10 cryptocurrencies. A big reason for this success is Justin Sun, TRON’s founder, who invested $30 million in World Liberty Financial (WLF), a crypto project connected to Donald Trump. This decision has made everyone a lot more interested in TRON and also made Sun an advisor to WLF. TRON’s growth is just one trend of the many in the crypto market right now. It’s become a go-to in decentralized finance (DeFi) and works with stablecoins like USDT. Folks are now comparing TRON’s features to big names in crypto like Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, with its lower costs and quicker speeds giving it an advantage. One area where TRON is making a big difference is online gambling. Crypto casinos are starting to use TRON’s technology to make gaming faster and cost-effective, as explained by crypto expert, Geoff Kukard. Privacy, speed, and convenience are a must in this industry, online casinos know this and are moving accordingly. This shows how TRON is finding useful ways to fit into daily life, where speed and simplicity are important. As blockchain technology grows, TRON continues to be a key example of how innovation can transform industries. If the increased adoption and interest are anything to go by, it’s clear that Justin Sun’s efforts are a big part of this success. As noted by Damian Chmiel from Finance Magnates , Sun is known for high-profile partnerships and smart strategies. Because of everything he’s done, TRON’s value has grown to nearly $39 billion and made investors believe even more in its future. TRON’s interoperability with other blockchains enhances its strengths. TRON’s ability to work with different networks is pretty much a dream and highly advantageous for both app developers and investors. This cross-chain compatibility makes the system more flexible which contributes to growth in different sectors of the crypto market. Although it’s been a success in many regards, opinions on TRON’s future are still pretty mixed. Some experts think its growing network could push its price to $0.50 or higher in 2024. Others see the price swings and legal issues linked to Justin Sun as a problem. So, if you’re an investor, this may be an incentive to do proper research before going all in. TRON’s rise is also part of a much bigger movement. Cryptocurrencies are being used in more areas, from gaming to financial services. As the need for fast and secure blockchain solutions grows, TRON is in a great position to meet these demands. Its practical features and real-world uses make it stand out in the fast-changing crypto space. By focusing on new ideas and easy-to-use tools, TRON is not just keeping up but excelling. Its growth shows how smart planning and forward thinking can turn a blockchain project into a major player in the cryptocurrency world. TRON’s journey so far points to its potential to influence both technology and finance in the future.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-03 07:40:35

The multi-billionaire openly supports the crypto industry, especially the Dogecoin meme coin, but he has also shown support for others, including Kekius Maximus, whose price blew up 1200% recently. Interestingly, Musk again indirectly endorsed a Pepe-themed crypto, pumping CumRocket price by 400%. Let’s discuss what’s happening. Elon Musk Tweet Pumped CumRocket Price to 6-Month High Elon Musk is known for his open-book nature, where he speaks and does things freely. With this attitude, he took over Twitter and turned it into X and hundreds of other things. Interestingly, the same attitude pumped some of the cryptocurrencies massively, as Musk shared or talked about them in public, pumping their prices. This time, an adult-themed cryptocurrency, CumRocket (CUMMIES), rose 400% after Musk tweeted a joke on the IRS featuring a frog variation of the PEPE Apu Apustaja image. Although the post was to mock the IRS tax reporting requirements, it referenced the popular meme coin . As a result, the CumRocket price surged 400%, reaching a six-month high at $0.0225. However, the hype did not last long, and the token’s price dropped to $0.009959, but it was still up by 136% in the 24-hour timeframe. Its market capitalization is $15,293,181, with $9,888,109 in trading volume. Interestingly, this is not the first time Musk has interacted with this PEPE-themed meme coin. Musk also tweeted about the CUMMIES in June 2021, when the token-inspired meme was really popular. Even at the time, Musk’s involvement pumped the CumRocket price by 400% within just ten minutes. Elon Musk Previously Pumped the Kekius Maximus By 1200% The Kekius Maximus holders received the best New Year’s gift from the Tesla owner, who updated his X profile with Kekius Maximus on December 31. He changed his name and profile picture to this PEPE meme coin, eventually pumping the KEKIUS price by 1200%, currently trading at $0.154. The rally continued for two days before Elon changed his profile again. In this period, many crypto traders made heavy returns. One trader made 17,000% returns on KEKIUS investment within just 60 minutes. However, those who followed FOMO and bought the token later experienced heavy losses. Musk’s changing profile led to selling sentiment among holders, which crashed the token. As a result, one person lost a Million within 12 hours . Regardless of the fluctuations, Musk’s endorsement and interactions with cryptocurrencies have been amazing for the holders. What’s In There For You? Crypto investors use various trading strategies to profit from the market. One strategy is to follow influential people’s investments in their token endorsements, which usually boosts token prices. The best example is these two tokens, Kekius Maximus and CumRocket, which surged to new highs after Elon Musk’s tweet. Interestingly, many traders have made heavy profits from the CumRocket price rally, but the hype does not last long, putting the later boomers at risk of loss.

Currently, the BTC price has also gained some strength and as a result, popular altcoins like Hedera & Algorand have displayed immense strength since the start of the year. Therefore, the prices of HBAR & ALGO are believed to remain elevated and reclaim $1 at the earliest. Algorand (ALGO) Price Analysis The Algorand price faced over 36% pullback from the December highs and with the latest rebound, the token has confirmed the possibility of a continued ascending trend. The price has reached the neckline of a bullish pattern and hence a breakout from the range may attract another 25% gain. However, the interim highs at $0.5 seem to have been capitulated by the bears and the question arises whether the ALGO price will manage to surpass these levels or not. The ALGO price was juggling between 0.382 & 0.5 FIB at $0.3 and $0.36, which was breached after the latest rebound. With this move, the token completed a double-bottom pattern and reached the neckline. The RSI is incremental, while the conversion & baseline of the Ichimoku cloud is about to undergo a bullish crossover. Therefore, the Algorand price is expected to clear the resistance zone between $0.4 and $0.41 anytime from now and trigger a healthy upswing to 0.786 FIB at $0.5 shortly. Hedera (HBAR) Price Analysis The latest breakout seems to have induced significant momentum within the HBAR price rally as the price remains consolidated within a decisive phase. Moreover, the consolidation seems to have reached a peak that may result in a bullish breakout but only after another small outback to $0.28. As mentioned above, the price is trading within the decisive symmetrical triangle, and as it is facing significant upward pressure, the possibility of testing the support. Meanwhile, the volume has dropped heavily, which appears to have been dominated by the sellers. However, a bullish reversal is expected to revamp as the RSI has bounced off from the average levels, which may head towards the upper threshold. Besides, the MACD could undergo a bullish crossover, which may help the token break the pattern and enter the resistance zone between $0.32 and $0.33. Both the tokens are stuck within a decisive phase and hence the upcoming weekly close may have a huge positive impact over the Algorand (ALGO) & Hedera (HBAR) prices.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALGO|ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|HBAR,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-03 07:54:56

Start Small, Scale Gradually : Begin with a basic plan, and reinvest some of your earnings to upgrade your contract. Stay Updated : Keep an eye on cryptocurrency trends to understand market fluctuations. Leverage Referral Programs : Many platforms, including DDB Miner, offer bonuses for referring new users. Diversify : Consider mining multiple cryptocurrencies to reduce risks associated with market volatility. If someone registers and invests using your unique link, you can get a cash reward of 3% of the investment amount; if the subordinate invites a friend (subordinate) to invest, you can also get a cash reward of 1.5% of the subordinate’s investment value. Is Cloud Mining Risk-Free? While DDB Miner offers a streamlined and secure mining experience, it’s essential to approach cloud mining with awareness. Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile, and returns are not guaranteed. Always invest amounts you can afford to lose and diversify your income streams. Conclusion Financial freedom is achievable with the right strategies and tools. DDB Miner simplifies cloud mining, making it accessible to anyone looking to generate passive income. By starting small and staying consistent, you can work towards earning $5000 or more daily.

In an interview on The David Lin Report, Thiel says that between the beginning of 2025 and around the date of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, Bitcoin will start to “run again.” According to the Marathon Digital CEO, Bitcoin could first fall to levels last witnessed in November 2024 before exploding by around 108% from the current level over the coming months. “I think the majority of the people who look at B itcoin price are expecting a correction into the low $ 90, 000 s, high $ 80, 000 s and then a return to growth ending somewhere approaching $ 200,000 by the end of next year. I think that’s a pretty valid scenario just based on the demand that we’re seeing kind of on the sidelines.” Thiel further says if the US sets up a strategic Bitcoin reserve, it could also serve as a price catalyst for the crypto king. “If a strategic reserve is announced [by the US], that will drive a relatively big push. If other countries start announcing reserves… again there’s a finite supply of Bitcoin. There are only 21 million Bitcoin that will ever exist, 20 million more or less have been mined. And of that maybe four million are in wallets that either have keys that are lost or inaccessible for other reasons or just won’t move… a million of which is in the Satoshi wallet itself. So there’s not a lot of Bitcoin to go around… …and so you start adding up those demands on supply and it’s a big number. And then you look at pension funds that want to put 1% or 2% into Bitcoin. And you see just the growth of the ETFs… the Bitcoin ETFs in 12 months have grown to have more assets under management than gold ETFs took 20 years to accumulate.” Bitcoin is trading at $96,200 at time of writing. ?

Moreover, the cryptocurrency industry ended 2024 on a high note after the spot Bitcoin ETF broke the record in the ETF market. With the alluring prospect of a parabolic Bitcoin rally in the near term, more institutional investors and nation-states are expected to follow in the footsteps of MicroStrategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR) and El Salvador. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve at State Level After Trump recently indicated that his administration will do something great with the crypto industry, more states have been seeking to adopt a strategic Bitcoin reserve. According to Dennis Porter, the CEO and co-founder of Satoshi Action Fund (SAC), at least 13 states are working on strategic Bitcoin reserve legislation. “January is going to be a record-breaking month for Bitcoin policy,” Porter noted . The announcement by Porter aligns with predictions by Franklin Templeton and Bitwise Head of Research, Ryan Rasmussen. According to Franklin Templeton, several nations will add a strategic Bitcoin reserve in 2025, as the United States establishes itself as a crypto hub. On the other hand, Rasmussen believes that the number of countries holding Bitcoin as a strategic reserve will double in 2025. Market Impact The mainstream adoption of Bitcoin by nation-states will escalate the ongoing supply vs demand shock. The supply of Bitcoin on centralized exchanges has continued to drop exponentially to hover about 2.21 million, despite the ongoing price consolidation.

In a recent interview with Fox Business, Thiel emphasized Bitcoin’s historical resilience and its long-term growth potential, noting that BTC has experienced price declines only three times in the past 14 years. Citing Bitcoin’s annual price increases, which historically range between 29% and 50%, Thiel highlighted the cryptocurrency’s capacity to deliver robust returns over time. This strategy, he argued, is ideal for retail investors seeking to navigate Bitcoin’s volatility and benefit from its upward trajectory. The ‘Invest-and-Forget’ Strategy Explained 1. Long-Term Holding as a Key to Success Bitcoin’s historical data shows consistent growth over extended periods despite short-term volatility. Thiel’s strategy encourages investors to focus on Bitcoin’s long-term value rather than reacting to market fluctuations. 2. Minimal Engagement, Maximum Gains Retail investors often struggle to time the market effectively, leading to missed opportunities. An “invest-and-forget” approach reduces emotional decision-making, allowing investments to grow unimpeded. Why Bitcoin Is Suited for Long-Term Investment 1. Historical Growth Trends Bitcoin has delivered annual price increases of 29% to 50%, showcasing its strength as a long-term asset. Over 14 years, BTC has only recorded three annual price declines, underlining its resilience. 2. Limited Supply With a capped supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin’s scarcity drives demand, reinforcing its long-term value proposition. 3. Institutional Adoption Increasing adoption by institutional investors and governments further validates Bitcoin’s role as a reliable investment asset. The Challenges of Short-Term Trading 1. High Volatility Bitcoin’s price fluctuations can make short-term trading risky and emotionally taxing. Retail investors often lack the tools and experience to navigate volatile markets effectively. 2. Timing the Market Research shows that even seasoned traders struggle to consistently time entry and exit points. Missing a few key bullish days can significantly impact overall returns. Thiel’s View on Bitcoin’s Future Positive Long-Term Outlook Thiel predicts continued growth for Bitcoin, driven by its increasing adoption and role as a store of value. He highlighted Bitcoin’s ability to act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and inflation. Advice to Retail Investors Stay focused on Bitcoin’s long-term potential rather than reacting to short-term price movements. Use the “invest-and-forget” strategy to avoid the pitfalls of emotional trading. Tips for Implementing an ‘Invest-and-Forget’ Strategy Set a Realistic Investment Amount Invest what you can afford to hold long-term without financial strain. Choose a Secure Storage Method Use hardware wallets or trusted custody solutions to safeguard your Bitcoin holdings. Stick to Your Plan Resist the temptation to sell during dips or chase gains during rallies. Monitor Occasionally While minimal engagement is key, periodic reviews ensure your strategy aligns with broader financial goals. FAQs What is the ‘invest-and-forget’ strategy? This approach involves buying Bitcoin and holding it long-term without reacting to short-term market movements, leveraging its historical growth. Why does Fred Thiel recommend this strategy? Thiel believes Bitcoin’s strong long-term growth and limited annual price declines make it ideal for retail investors seeking simplicity and stability. Is Bitcoin still a good long-term investment? Yes, Bitcoin’s scarcity, institutional adoption, and historical performance suggest strong long-term potential despite short-term volatility. How does Bitcoin compare to other assets for long-term growth? Bitcoin’s annual returns (29%-50%) often surpass those of traditional assets like stocks and gold, making it a compelling addition to diversified portfolios. What are the risks of this strategy? While it minimizes emotional trading, investors must remain aware of market trends and store their Bitcoin securely to mitigate risks. Can retail investors adopt this strategy easily? Yes, retail investors can start by setting a budget, purchasing Bitcoin on reputable platforms, and securely storing it for the long term. Conclusion Fred Thiel’s “invest-and-forget” strategy offers retail investors a straightforward and effective way to navigate Bitcoin’s volatility while benefiting from its long-term growth potential. By focusing on Bitcoin’s historical performance and reducing the emotional pitfalls of active trading, this approach aligns with the cryptocurrency’s trajectory as a maturing asset class. As Bitcoin continues to gain acceptance as a hedge against economic uncertainty, retail investors can leverage this strategy to build sustainable wealth over time.

Can Dogecoin compete with Solana meme coins like Fartcoin and Solana AI coin ai16z? These newer coins have seen significant price surges, attracting attention from investors. The rising popularity of these coins raises questions about the DOGE long-term position in the meme coin space. Can Dogecoin Price Contest with New Meme coins? Dogecoin price, the original meme coin, maintains a leading position with its strong market capitalization and established reputation. Emerging meme coins like Fartcoin and AI16z have gained attention, but Dogecoin’s resilience and partnerships set it apart. Collaborations, such as the D.O.G.E. department initiative with Elon Musk, have bolstered its presence in the crypto market. Fartcoin price is trading at $1.34, with a 3% surge in the past day and more than $1 billion in market cap. Additionally, the Solana AI meme coin ai16z is trading at $1.98 with $2.16 billion market cap. Dogecoin’s simplicity remains a significant advantage, making it user-friendly and appealing while surviving multiple market cycles. This streamlined framework ensures accessibility for new and seasoned investors alike. Recent whale activity indicates growing confidence in Dogecoin, with substantial accumulation highlighting its enduring relevance amid rising meme coin competition. Whales Accumulate 1.08 Billion DOGE Crypto analyst Ali shared an X post highlighting a massive Dogecoin purchase by whale investors in the past 24 hours. The post revealed that over 1.08 billion DOGE tokens were accumulated by these large holders during this period. This surge in whale activity is a notable development for the meme cryptocurrency. The chart included in the post illustrated a correlation between whale movements and the recent fluctuations in Dogecoin’s price. It showed a clear buying trend among addresses holding between 10,000 and 1,000,000 DOGE tokens. This behavior suggests increased confidence in Dogecoin despite its recent price volatility. Source- X DOGE Technical Analysis: Can Dogecoin Hit $1? Dogecoin has experienced a notable 270% surge in years 2024, with hopes for further rally in the year 2025. As of Friday, the DOGE price hovered at $0.3378, with a 1% in the past 24-hours. Most of the cryptocurrency has seen a market recovery with BTC hovering above $95k fueling the market rally. With the surge in the crypto market and meme based coins may fuel the surge. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) highlights weakening bearish momentum as green bars begin to appear. This trend suggests the possibility of a bullish reversal. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows a narrowing gap, indicating reduced selling pressure. Dogecoin Price Targets The Dogecoin price prediction points to the potential for a breakout as it consolidates near crucial resistance levels. DOGE price is approaching significant resistance at $0.50 and $0.736, presenting key hurdles for upward momentum. If these levels are breached, a rally toward $1 could be in sight, representing a 201% increase from current levels. However, if bears gain another power the the meme-based coin might see a corrections. Dogecoin Price Chart: TradingView To conclude the Dogecoin price strong foundation and whale accumulation showcase its resilience. However, competing with new memes like Fartcoin and ai16z poses challenges. Reaching $1 depends on breaking key resistance and maintaining momentum.

The Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) of the US Department of Defense(DoD) has completed the Crowdsourced AI Red-Teaming (CAIRT) Assurance program pilot. This initiative is dedicated to integrating AI chatbots into military medical services. The large language model (LLM) chatbots were implemented in the CAIRT program. Additionally, CAIRT assisted the DoD in the development of decentralized, crowdsourced strategies for AI Risk Mitigation and AI Assurance. Over 200 clinical providers and healthcare analysts contributed to the identification of potential vulnerabilities in the use of AI chatbots in military medical applications. Notably, the pilot identified several hundred potential issues, as reported by the DoD. To that end, the DoD said, “This exercise will result in repeatable and scalable output via the development of benchmark data sets, which can be used to evaluate future vendors and tools for alignment with performance expectations.” CAIRT program behind the scenes According to DoD, a non-profit humane intelligence conducted the CAIRT LLM pilot. It achieved this in partnership with the Defense Health Agency (DHA) and the Program Executive Office of Defense Healthcare Management Systems (PEO DHMS). In addition, the humane intelligence used the red-teaming methodology to identify specific system issues. This involved the internal testing of system resiliency using adversarial techniques. Furthermore, red-teaming drew participants who are interested in interacting with emerging technologies and as potential future beneficiaries. They were allowed the opportunity to contribute to the enhancement of the systems. In this program, humane intelligence used crowdsourced red-teaming to address two potential applications in military medicine: clinical note summarization and a medical advisory chatbot. Although vulnerabilities were identified, DoD highlighted, “these findings will play a crucial role in shaping DoD policies and best practices for responsible use of Generative AI (GenAI), ultimately improving military medical care. If, when fielded, these prospective use cases comprise covered AI defined in OMB M-24-10, they will adhere to all required risk management practices.” Still, the DoD stated that the CAIRT Assurance Program will keep testing LLMs and AI systems. This will speed up the CDAO’s AI Rapid Capabilities Cell, make the GenAI goal more effective, and help build trust across all DoD use cases. CDAO’s lead for this initiative, Dr. Matthew Johnson, also said, “Since applying GenAI for such purposes within the DoD is in earlier stages of piloting and experimentation, this program acts as an essential pathfinder for generating a mass of testing data, surfacing areas for consideration, and validating mitigation options that will shape future research, development, and assurance of GenAI systems that may be deployed in the future,” The upcoming administration is expected to continue these projects. Trump’s team is open-minded about AI even as it looks to compete with China. How safe is AI in the medical landscape? Although AI has a hugely beneficial impact on medical science, it is followed by several significant risks and dangers. For status, AI systems use specific algorithms that require massive datasets to increase accuracy. This method puts sensitive patient data at risk for security, privacy, and confidentiality. Presently, since pharmaceutical and insurance corporations are interested in such datasets, hacking has expanded greatly . Medical file hacking may also be part of a government cyberattack. In addition, data poisoning, the intentional modification of medical data to induce errors or biases in healthcare, is another major risk of medical data misuse. This hurts medical advice accuracy and reliability. AI using different epidemiological data models, like in the COVID-19 pandemic, may yield diverse results. Another issue would be a flawed medical algorithm. This may be due to inadequate algorithm testing since there are no established standards to test its validity. For instance, double-blind trials are the most effective way to prove a treatment works. Still, who would be liable for such a mistake—the personal doctor, the hospital, the equipment provider, or the algorithm developer? Thus, medical errors caused by machine malfunction raise serious legal issues. AI chatbots playing doctor? 🤖 Not quite yet. A study reveals their diagnostic skills are shaky at best. Healthcare AI still needs a brain boost before it can be trusted with your health. 🩺 pic.twitter.com/W2ast8S7iO — CAD Authority (@CAD_Authority) January 2, 2025 Also, AI may also impair doctor-patient relationships. Therefore, doctors are required to understand AI evaluation and performance to explain its role to patients and reduce patient anxiety. Finally, there is a phenomenon known as the “lazy doctor” effect. If the physician exclusively employs AI algorithms for diagnosis and treatment, this may result in a progressive, irreversible loss of practical skills, intellectual creativity, and the ability to solve medical problems. However, people have gotten used to Chatbots in their daily lives. With proper research, AI Chatbots can eliminate the small mistakes that doctors make, hence making the medical space safer.

This milestone follows Binance's acquisition of Sim;paul, a licensed broker-dealer, strengthening its foothold in one of Latin America's largest economies. The license allows Binance to offer enhanced services while complying with Brazil's evolving financial regulations. Sim;paul holds licenses for securities distribution and electronic money issuance, providing Binance with a strategic advantage in expanding its services locally. Binance CEO Richard Teng highlighted Brazil's importance in the company's global growth strategy, while Guilherme Nazar, Binance’s Head of Latin America , emphasized the achievement as a testament to Binance's dedication to regulatory compliance and service excellence. Brazil is becoming a global leader in cryptocurrency regulation. The country ranks 10th on Chainalysis' global crypto adoption index and is actively developing regulatory frameworks focused on asset segregation and stablecoins . Legislative proposals currently under review reflect Brazil's commitment to balancing innovation with financial security. This regulatory green light positions Binance to further integrate into Brazil’s rapidly growing crypto sector. Brazil has already shown significant adoption trends, including leading the charge in the Solana ETF market. Binance’s success in Brazil is part of a larger global regulatory strategy. Earlier in 2023, Binance achieved milestones in Argentina and India, securing licenses to operate within their expanding crypto ecosystems. Additionally, Binance became the first exchange to earn a full regulatory license in Kazakhstan from the Astana Financial Services Authority (AFSA). The company’s compliance framework includes robust anti-money laundering (AML) measures, controls against terrorism financing (CFT), and advanced identity verification processes. Binance expanded its compliance team by 34% in 2023, now employing over 1,000 professionals dedicated to regulatory adherence worldwide. Despite its regulatory achievements, Binance continues to face legal challenges. Australia's financial regulator ASIC has filed a lawsuit against Binance Australia , alleging consumer protection failures. In India, authorities are pursuing the exchange over unpaid taxes. Additionally, Binance faces accusations from a whistleblower regarding bribery and internal misconduct. Binance’s ability to secure approvals in 21 jurisdictions underscores its leadership in global financial innovation. The company's continued focus on compliance, transparency, and strategic partnerships positions it to drive sustainable digital asset adoption in Brazil and beyond.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-03 09:21:41

While still in the early planning phase, this move reflects the growing anticipation of pro-crypto regulatory changes under Donald Trump’s administration following his recent election victory. Currently, E-Trade only offers indirect exposure to digital assets through investment products. However, this potential shift toward direct trading marks a significant change in Morgan Stanley’s approach to the crypto market. The firm has historically shown support for Bitcoin , notably through its involvement in promoting cryptocurrency ETFs earlier this year. With a team of 15,000 brokers, Morgan Stanley actively pushed Bitcoin ETFs and invested nearly $300 million into them by October. If E-Trade proceeds with its plan, it could reshape Morgan Stanley's position in the digital asset sector. The initiative aligns with the firm's expectation of a favorable regulatory environment driven by Trump's pro-crypto stance. His victory has already sparked optimism in the market, with many firms preparing for policy changes that could ease restrictions and encourage innovation. Despite the enthusiasm, Morgan Stanley’s plans are still in the exploratory phase , and no specific timeline or details have been announced. The firm is assessing the feasibility of direct crypto trading while navigating potential challenges in infrastructure and compliance. The crypto market has become increasingly attractive to major financial players due to its rapid growth and expanding adoption across industries. E-Trade’s entry into direct trading would allow Morgan Stanley to compete more effectively with platforms already offering such services, capitalizing on the surging interest from both retail and institutional investors. Trump's presidency, set to begin in less than a month, is expected to prioritize clearer regulations for the crypto sector. This potential regulatory clarity serves as a strong incentive for financial giants like Morgan Stanley to prepare their infrastructure and strategies in advance. If favorable regulations are introduced, E-Trade could be well-positioned to quickly roll out its direct crypto trading services. However, it’s important to note that no final decision has been made yet , and the outcome will depend heavily on regulatory developments and internal assessments at Morgan Stanley. For now, the firm remains focused on evaluating its options and preparing for a market shift that could open significant opportunities in the digital asset space.",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-03 09:27:02

Smart Money Grabbing Lunex Network’s Token Citing Better Jump,https://timestabloid.com/decade-old-ethereum-whale-up-to-1-million-gains-smart-money/,"A decade-old Ethereum whale has reawakened, boasting gains of up to 1,000,000%. But savvy investors, the true “ smart money ,” are now looking beyond Ethereum. Their sights are set on Lunex Network , a cutting-edge Web3 multi-chain bridge altcoin offering seamless blockchain interoperability. Like Ethereum in its early days, Lunex is generating excitement for its potential to deliver exponential returns. Could Lunex be the next chapter in crypto’s success story? Let’s find out. Why the smart money is betting big on Lunex Network’s $LNEX token for better gains Savvy investors are making waves in the crypto world, and this time, their target is Lunex Network’s $LNEX token. With its presale price at just $0.0052, Lunex has already raised over $5.7 million, selling more than $2.4 million worth of tokens. The buzz? A better jump than most altcoins , thanks to its unique utility and growing demand. The $LNEX token is the engine powering the Lunex ecosystem. Think of it as the fuel that keeps this blockchain network running. Access to premium services like liquidity mining (where users earn more tokens by supplying liquidity) and node leasing (where users rent network resources for incentives) are among the advantages that holders enjoy, in addition to reductions in transaction costs. A win for all involved. What sets Lunex apart is its rewards system. A portion of the revenue from the Lunex exchange is used to buy back tokens, redistributing them to those who stake (lock up) their $LNEX. It’s like earning passive income while helping stabilize the token’s value—a smart money move! On top of that, all merchant and token listing fees on the platform are paid in $LNEX, creating a constant demand for the token. With such deflationary mechanics, the Lunex Network is shaping up to be a game-changer for savvy crypto enthusiasts. Ethereum whale resurfaces with 1 million% gains, redefining altcoin success An Ethereum investor, often called a “whale” because they own a big amount of cryptocurrency, got attention recently by changing $2.4 million into nearly $1.34 billion in about eight years. This whale bought close to 398,889 ETH in the time between January and March of 2016. During that period, Ethereum was a new altcoin with a price of around $6 for each ETH. Moving forward to November 2024, Ethereum’s value has increased greatly – now, one ETH is worth more than $3,300. This dramatic increase transformed the initial investment into a billion-dollar fortune. In November 2024, the Whale started to sell some parts of their ETH holdings. First, they sold 73,356 ETH for $224 million. Even with these sales, they still hold more than 325,000 ETH, which is worth over $1 billion today. This action has attracted interest from the crypto community because big sales might affect market prices and show changes in how investors feel. This story shows how there can be big profits in the cryptocurrency market, especially for people who start early with altcoins such as Ethereum and Lunex. Conclusion While the Ethereum whale’s massive gains are impressive, Lunex Network is the one stealing the spotlight right now. With its unique features, potential for exponential growth, and smart money already jumping in, Lunex could be your next big win. Ethereum’s history shows what’s possible—Lunex just might take it to the next level!

The unit focuses on identifying and blocking suspicious transactions, targeting crimes such as money laundering, scams, and terrorism financing. Using blockchain intelligence tools provided by TRM Labs, the T3 unit analyzed over $3 billion in USDT transactions , spanning five continents. These efforts uncovered patterns of criminal behavior, including the use of dark web services for money laundering. Among the most notable findings was $3 million in USDT allegedly tied to North Korean actors, suspected of supporting the regime's fundraising operations through illicit crypto activities. Tron’s network holds around $60 billion in circulating USDT, making it the second-largest stablecoin network after Ethereum. This significant volume underscores the importance of monitoring and preventing criminal exploitation of the platform. Common illicit activities detected include investment fraud, drug trafficking, hacking incidents, and violent crime financing. Preventing financial crime remains a top priority for both regulators and the crypto industry. In 2024, Binance faced a $4.4 million penalty in Canada for violating anti-money laundering (AML) laws. Additionally, Binance’s former CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), is named in a class-action lawsuit in Seattle, which claims the exchange failed to prevent money laundering activities, causing significant losses for investors. Similarly, Alexey Pertsev, a Tornado Cash developer, received a 64-month prison sentence from a Dutch court after being found guilty of laundering $1.2 billion through the crypto-mixing platform. However, regulatory efforts remain complex. A US federal appeals court recently overturned sanctions against Tornado Cash, sparking renewed debates about balancing privacy and regulation in blockchain technology. In October, Tether also faced allegations from a Wall Street Journal report suggesting that its stablecoin was indirectly linked to illegal activities, including drug trafficking and hacking. However, Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, firmly denied these claims and insisted there was no ongoing investigation against the company. Despite these challenges, Tron’s T3 unit represents a proactive approach to combating financial crimes in the cryptocurrency space. Its work highlights the need for increased oversight, transparency, and global cooperation to address the misuse of digital assets. As regulatory frameworks continue to evolve, such initiatives will play a key role in building trust and accountability in the crypto industry.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|USDT|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-03 09:31:43

If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $1.6254, it will fuel a bullish rally to $2.0732. dydX price chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $1.2772, beginning a bearish trend to $1.0999. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX down today? Today, dYdX faced intense selling pressure as it failed to surge above $1.5. However, buyers are defending further declines and aiming for a quick recovery. Will dYdX price recover? If buyers hold the buying momentum of dYdX and send it past the $1.5 mark, we might see a significant recovery in the coming hours. The current low might be a good time to buy and this might create a strong support level for dYdX’s price. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiments, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX, and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future.

Bitcoin ETF Outflow Hits Record $332M,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-etf-outflow-hits-332m-blackrocks-ishares-trust-faces-largest-withdrawal-yet/,"The post BlockRock’s IBIT Under Pressure? Bitcoin ETF Outflow Hits Record $332M appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a surprising turn of events, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) experienced a massive $332.6 million outflow on January 2—its largest withdrawal since launching a year ago. This came right after U.S. markets reopened following the New Year holiday, continuing a three-day streak of redemptions. For the week, total outflows reached $392.6 million, surpassing the previous record of $188.7 million on December 24. But what does this mean for the future of crypto ETFs, especially with competition heating up and Bitcoin’s price in the spotlight? Let’s break down the latest trends and what experts predict for 2025. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Remains a Major Player Despite these outflows, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF remains a significant force in the U.S. market. In 2024, it ranked third for net inflows among all U.S.-listed ETFs, attracting $37.2 billion—only behind Vanguard’s 500 Index Fund and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF. Crypto expert Adam Back is optimistic about a Bitcoin ETF rebound by 2025, especially if Bitcoin prices rise as expected. However, he notes that some short-term corrections are likely before Bitcoin can reach a new all-time high (ATH). Competitors Report Gains as BlackRock Struggles The outflows from BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF have pushed the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market into the red. However, other funds like Bitwise, Fidelity, and Ark 21Shares saw inflows of $48.3 million, $36.2 million, and $16.5 million, respectively, on January 2. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust also gained $6.9 million, though its main GBTC fund had a $23.1 million outflow. The broader crypto ETF market saw $242 million in outflows that day, with BlackRock’s losses overshadowing other funds’ gains. While large outflows can signal negative sentiment, they may also indicate that investors are rebalancing their portfolios or cashing in profits. Ethereum ETFs Perform Well Amid Bitcoin’s Struggles While Bitcoin ETFs faced challenges, Ethereum ETFs performed well. BlackRock and Fidelity led inflows for Ether-focused funds, and Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust and Bitwise’s Ethereum ETF also contributed significantly. 2024: A Record Year for U.S. Crypto ETFs Despite recent setbacks, 2024 has been a record year for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, with over $35 billion in net inflows. BlackRock led with $37.31 billion, followed by Fidelity and ARK’s Bitcoin ETFs. These figures far exceeded initial industry projections, showing that crypto ETFs are growing in popularity among investors.

Only two days ago, the Montenegro authorities extradited him to the U.S. According to a Bloomberg report , the troubled co-founder faces nine financial-related charges, including money laundering conspiracy, commodities fraud, wire, and securities. Do Kwon Pleads Not Guilty The U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert Lehrburger presided over the court hearing, which was publicized on January 2nd. Although pleading not guilty through his lawyer, the South Korean fugitive agreed to be detained. Whether the court will consider Kwon’s plea deal or progress to a criminal trial remains uncertain. Notably, the U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan, which will prosecute the troubled Terraform Labs co-founder, was also behind the prosecution of FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) last year. SBF, on his part, is currently serving a 25-year jail term over the cataclysmic FTX crash in late 2022. As of March 2023, Kwon faced eight counts of financial-linked violations. However, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams stated in a court document that the Terraform Labs’ executive conspired with several entities to commit money laundering. As a result, Kwon currently faces nine charges, considerably higher than SBF’s seven counts. A Two-Year-Old Case Kwon’s legal troubles date back to May 2022, when Terraform Labs’ flagship products, TerraUST and Terra LUNA, crashed. It caused a $40 billion meltdown in the crypto market, triggering a chain of events that led to FTX’s crash later that year. Kwon has been on the run ever since. Last year, Montenegro authorities apprehended the Terraform Labs co-founder while he was trying to take a flight to Dubai using a fake passport. He spent four months in prison for using a false ID in the country. Around the same time, authorities in South Korea and the U.S. requested Kwon’s extradition. Both countries got into a back-and-forth extradition battle over Kwon. Eventually, the Montenegro government disclosed in late December 2024 that the troubled crypto figure had been extradited to the U.S. to face fraud charges.

New Year New Shiba (NEWSHIBA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to surge over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because NEWSHIBA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, New Year New Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and New Year New Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. New Year New Shiba launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy New Year New Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for New Year New Shiba by entering its contract address – 7DjEUoHG7Yr3LpaqNPcyc5DgNEYSLrnPV8zsjQBbAYfh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like NEWSHIBA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-03 09:52:00

The proposal, known as FIP-418, passed unanimously after six days of voting, the team said in an official press release . According to the approved proposal, the tokenized BUIDL fund will not only back the frxUSD stablecoin but also offer potential yield-bearing opportunities for its holders. The collaboration with BlackRock, which manages over $10.4 trillion in assets, also minimizes counterparty risk by collateralizing the stablecoin with a highly reputable and stable fund. Collaboration with BlackRock to Create a Stable and Transparent frxUSD Backing Frax Finance founder Sam Kazemian praised the decision, noted that the stability of BlackRock’s prime treasury offerings, combined with the blockchain transparency, would create a powerful and trustworthy foundation for the frxUSD stablecoin. “This collaboration is a significant step toward bridging traditional finance with decentralized systems,” Kazemian said in a statement. The decision to back frxUSD with BUIDL aligns with the growing trend of creating yield-bearing stablecoins, which offer holders financial rewards in addition to stability. The move also follows a similar initiative by Securitize, the brokerage firm for BUIDL, which proposed backing frxUSD with BUIDL on December 22, 2024. The frxUSD stablecoin will be pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar and collateralized by U.S. government securities. The proposal is part of a broader trend toward integrating traditional financial assets with DeFi solutions. ""Securitize’s proposal to add BlackRock’s BUIDL token as a backing for Frax’s USD stablecoin has been approved."" A bold step forward for tokenized finance. More from @Rt_Watson in @TheBlock__ https://t.co/noc190BAlt — Securitize (@Securitize) January 2, 2025 Earlier, Ethena Labs launched a BUIDL-backed stablecoin, USDtb, in December, with a market capitalization of approximately $70 million. Additionally, decentralized exchange Curve Finance announced that users would be able to mint Elixir’s deUSD yield-bearing stablecoin using BUIDL as collateral starting in November 2024. The growing interest in yield-bearing stablecoins reflects a shift in investor demand, as traditional stablecoins offering no interest face increasing competition from new DeFi solutions. Tokenization Market Could Reach $16T by 2030 McKinsey & Company recently reported that tokenized financial assets have had a “cold start” but are still expected to grow to a $2 trillion market by 2030. Meanwhile, a report by the Global Financial Markets Association (GFMA) and Boston Consulting Group estimates the global value of tokenized illiquid assets will reach $16 trillion by 2030 . Even more conservative estimates from Citigroup suggest that $4 trillion to $5 trillion worth of tokenized digital securities could be minted by 2030. Recognizing this potential, major companies are making significant moves in the tokenization space. Goldman Sachs, for instance, plans to launch three new tokenization products later this year, driven by growing client interest. Some protocols have played a significant role in driving this growth, particularly in terms of active users. Digital carbon market platforms like Toucan and KlimaDAO, as well as the real estate tokenization protocol Propy, have experienced substantial user growth. It is worth noting that both public and private blockchains are witnessing the inclusion of various assets.

They’re loud, polarizing, and influential beyond belief. Together, they’re changing politics, technology, and, of course, the crypto market. But unfortunately, cracks are already forming, and when this partnership crumbles, the fallout could hit crypto quite hard. You don’t need to be a “time traveler” like Drew Curtis to see it coming. Trump and Elon have been cozy for a while now, with Elon even securing a spot in Trump’s administration as co-leader of the Department of Government Efficiency, fittingly abbreviated as D.O.G.E. But their shared love for deregulation and cutting government fat isn’t enough to paper over their massive differences. Elon’s Tesla empire relies on China, while Trump’s economic game plan screams “tariffs and trade wars.” It’s a collision course, and crypto investors should buckle up for real. Drew Curtis, Tesla, and the Trump problem Curtis has called it: Trump will “throw Elon under the bus” in 2025. And as ridiculous as it sounds, Curtis has a track record. The guy accurately predicted COVID-19’s global chaos, so when he says Elon’s relationship with Trump is heading for disaster, some folks do listen. His reasoning is that Tesla’s Shanghai gigafactory is too critical to Elon’s operations to be sidelined, and Trump’s tariffs on Chinese imports are anything but negotiable. Curtis isn’t alone. Analysts are lining up to point out the obvious: this bromance is doomed. Trump’s “America First” policies are great for his base but terrible for Elon’s global empire. We’ve already seen him have like five different disagreements with Trump’s cabinet. Adding to the tension, there’s rumor about legislation that might allow non-native U.S. citizens to run for president. If that happens, we’re looking at a potential 2028 showdown between Elon and Trump, who has already attempted to shut the rumors down saying, “I’m not worried. Elon is not the president. He’s never gonna be the president. You know why? He wasn’t born here.” Crypto’s wild run So what happens to crypto when these two giants go head-to-head? Chaos. Pure chaos. The crypto market thrives on drama, and this would be drama of the highest order. Both Trump and Elon are market movers. A single tweet from Elon has sent Bitcoin soaring or crashing in the past. And the ‘crypto president,’ well, he did single handedly push Bitcoin past $100,000. Now the first thing to expect is volatility. Crypto prices already swing wildly on a good day, and this kind of news would send them into overdrive. Investors don’t like uncertainty, and a Trump-Elon split would create plenty of it. Expect Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin to feel the heat as traders scramble to make sense of the fallout. Investor confidence would take a hit, too. Elon, for all his faults, is a crypto darling. A hero, actually. If Trump sidelines him—or if Elon steps back from politics altogether—it would devastate investors who are expecting a monster run that can last four years. Oops. As of press time, markets are already jittery. Bitcoin’s price is fluctuating, altcoins are stealing the spotlight, and investors are keeping a close eye on Trump’s upcoming crypto inaugural ball . Though not everyone thinks the market will take that much of a hit. That’s because interestingly, Elon publicly distanced himself from promoting crypto last year, warning about scams and fake endorsements. “If you see me endorsing crypto, it’s probably a deepfake,” the eccentric billionaire said on a podcast. “Except perhaps as a joke, you know, like DOGE. It’s a funny meme.” The community didn’t take that very well, so his market influence isn’t what it once was. But come on, he’s still a massive force to be reckoned with.

Despite these recent outflows, Bitcoin ETFs hold over 5.7% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Analysts also predict that Bitcoin's price could reach $200,000 in 2025, driven by ETF adoption and institutional interest, though regulations and market dynamics are still critical factors. Meanwhile, South Korea's KOSDAQ is exploring crypto ETFs and security token offerings to revitalize its markets, while Russian experts tout Bitcoin’s potential as a “super currency” to counteract sanctions. Bitcoin ETFs Start 2025 with a Shakeup BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) experienced its largest daily outflow since its launch, as US markets resumed trading after the New Year’s Day holiday. On Jan. 2, the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) recorded an outflow of $332.6 million, surpassing the previous record of $188.7 million that was set on Dec. 24, 2024. Bitcoin ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) This was the third consecutive trading day of outflows for IBIT, bringing the total for the past week to $392.6 million. Despite this, BlackRock’s fund is still a dominant player in the ETF space, and ranks third in US ETF inflows for 2024 with $37.2 billion. This means it trails the Vanguard 500 Index Fund and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, which saw inflows of $116 billion and $89 billion, respectively. While the outflows from IBIT raised eyebrows, Bitcoin pioneer Adam Back suggested that the trend might reverse in 2025. Other Bitcoin ETFs, including those managed by Bitwise, Fidelity, and Ark 21Shares, bucked the trend on Jan. 2 by recording inflows of $48.3 million, $36.2 million, and $16.5 million, respectively. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust also saw a modest inflow of $6.9 million, though its larger GBTC fund experienced an outflow of $23.1 million. Overall, the day’s total outflows reached $242 million, largely attributed to BlackRock’s record withdrawal that overshadowed the inflows recorded by its competitors. ETF Store president Nate Geraci recently shared some predictions for 2025. The expects the launch of combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, as well as spot Ether ETF options trading. He also forecasted the introduction of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs featuring in-kind creation and redemption, staking mechanisms for Ether funds, and the approval of a spot Solana ETF. US Bitcoin ETFs Hold 5.7% of Supply Despite IBIT’s recent outlaws, US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs are on the verge of a major milestone after a year of record growth in 2024, driven by Bitcoin's surge past the $100,000 mark. The cumulative holdings of US spot Bitcoin ETFs are just over 2% or $2+ billion shy of reaching $110 billion, which represents more than 5.7% of the total Bitcoin supply. BlackRock is still the dominant player in the US Bitcoin ETF market, with its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF holding more than 542,000 BTC. This gives BlackRock a commanding 47.9% share of the market and makes its fund the 34th-largest ETF globally, including both cryptocurrency and traditional finance products, based on ETF Database data . The growth of Bitcoin ETFs was instrumental in Bitcoin’s rally toward $100,000 as US spot ETFs accounted for around 75% of new Bitcoin investment in 2024. This inflow helped propel Bitcoin past the $50,000 mark by mid-February of 2024 and played a key role in sustaining its upward trajectory. BTC's price action over the past year (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Looking ahead to 2025, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is expected to boost institutional adoption even more by simplifying access for large-scale investors. Ryan Lee , chief analyst at Bitget Research, predicts that this growing adoption, coupled with the ETF market’s expansion, could push Bitcoin’s price to $200,000 during 2025. However, he also warned that the price trajectory will depend on regulatory developments, market dynamics, and broader economic conditions. Bitcoin is currently still about $4,000 below the psychological $100,000 level, with major resistance at $97,600 and $99,000. A breakout above $99,000 could trigger the liquidation of more than $1 billion in leveraged short positions, according to CoinGlass data. Korea Exchange Eyes Crypto ETFs in 2025 The Korea Exchange (KOSDAQ) recently announced its exploration of approving crypto spot ETFs in 2025. The declaration was made by KOSDAQ Chairman Jeong Eun-bo during the 2025 Securities and Derivatives Market Opening Ceremony, where Financial Services Commission (FSC) Chairman Kim Byung-hwan also expressed plans to enable security token offerings (STOs) next year. The move comes after a turbulent end to 2024 for South Korea that was riddled by political instability, including an unsuccessful attempt by President Yoon Suk-yeol to declare martial law in December. This turmoil triggered a stock market sell-off, with both domestic and international investors exiting the market due to concerns about economic and political uncertainty. Prices on the Korea Exchange’s KOSPI index of common stocks over the past year. (Source: Google Finance) KOSDAQ’s Jeong believes that there is a strong need for innovation in the market, and pointed to crypto ETFs as a potential avenue for revitalization. Meanwhile, the FSC's Kim committed to advancing STO legislation, which is a long-awaited development for South Korean companies eager to issue security tokens. Although STO reforms were part of Yoon’s election manifesto, progress slowed down due to political challenges, including corruption allegations and setbacks in midterm elections. Traditional financial institutions and tech firms prepared STO platforms in anticipation of regulatory approval, but the government’s focus shifted away from crypto-related legislation because of the country’s political strife. Kim reassured stakeholders that the FSC is still very determined to institutionalize STOs and to diversify securities issuance Both Jeong and Kim asked for collaboration among lawmakers, corporations, and investors to restore market confidence and attract returning capital. Jeong also urged regulators to dismantle barriers to crypto adoption, and called for institutional frameworks to support the still-growing digital asset sector. With 2025 positioned as a potential turning point, the South Korean financial market could realistically see some renewed interest from both domestic and global investors. BTC: Russia’s 'Super Currency' Crypto could also do good in other countries. Russian expert Evgeny Shatov from Capital Lab suggested that Bitcoin could reach a price of $135,000 by the summer of 2025. Shatov shared his insights in a report that was published by the Russian newspaper Izvestia on Jan. 2. While he is optimistic about Bitcoin's short-term growth, he also warned of a potential slowdown and a consolidation phase later in the year. He explained that Bitcoin is gradually transitioning into the distribution zone, signaling a shift in market dynamics. Shatov projected that Bitcoin dominance, which currently stands at close to 57%, might begin to decline as the market witnesses an increase in altcoins and their overall market capitalization. Shatov also pointed out some historical patterns to support his claims, and compared the current scenario to 2017 when Bitcoin dominance was around 90%, and to 2021, when it fell from 60% to 40%. He predicted that the market is poised to enter a period of major altcoin growth that could potentially reshape the cryptocurrency landscape in 2025. Columnist Olga Samofalova from the state-run media outlet RIA Novosti called Bitcoin a ”super currency” in an opinion piece. She argued that Bitcoin offers unique advantages for Russia, particularly in bypassing US-led sanctions . According to Samofalova, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, lack of dependence on any central bank, and algorithmic issuance make it an unparalleled tool for cross-border transactions. Samofalova praised Bitcoin's ability to shield transactions from external scrutiny, and believes that it could provide Russian importers and exporters with a much-needed lifeline in conducting business discreetly under challenging global economic conditions. However, she also acknowledged the challenges Bitcoin poses for state oversight of trade operations, and called it a high-risk yet innovative solution for extraordinary times.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-03 09:56:16

Priced at just under $0.02, experts predict significant growth by early 2025 and up to 100x returns this year. Remittix could deliver unmatched gains for early investors as it transforms the $250 trillion cross-border payments market. Remittix Revolutionizes Cross-Border Payments with Blockchain-Powered Innovation With its unique technology, Remittix is disrupting the cross-border payment market, improving international crypto-to-fiat transactions. Projected to reach $250 trillion by 2027, Users can use Remittix’s PayFi platform to convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat and immediately send cash to any worldwide account. In contrast to standard platforms like Stripe or Wise, Remittix charges no hidden fees and provides cheaper and faster transactions. In addition, Remittix enhances transparency, speed, and dependability by blending blockchain and conventional payment methods, making it appealing to people and companies. Through the Remittix Pay API, businesses can accept crypto payments and settle them directly in fiat, streamlining operations and growing financial flexibility. At the heart of the Remittix ecosystem is the $RTX governance token, which has undergone thorough audits by SolidProof and BlockSAFU, ensuring security and reliability. The team has also locked the liquidity pool and team tokens for three years to foster trust and stability. With these robust features, Remittix is positioned to take charge of the evolving DeFi space, making its current presale price of $0.0172 a huge opportunity for investors. Solana Breaks Key Milestone as Game-Changing ETF Approval Looms Solana is presently trading at $206, up 12% over the last day. This milestone, formerly a tough barrier in December, now signals strong bullish momentum. Solana might top $500 by the end of Q1 2025, and all technicals point to now being the best time to acquire SOL. Additionally, the crypto ETF market will change considerably in 2025. Nate Geraci, President of ETF Store, is optimistic, and data from Polymarket puts the chances of a Solana ETF approval at 76%. This has fueled investor confidence, especially with the SEC becoming more open to crypto innovation. If approved, a Spot Solana ETF would be a game-changer, drawing institutional investors eager to tap into Solana’s scalable and efficient blockchain. This could firmly establish Solana as a top contender in the crypto space, driving its value even higher. Shiba Inu Whale Activity Signals Long-Term Confidence Investors’ heads are turning due to the massive withdrawal of 220 billion Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens from Binance within the last twenty-four hours. Instead of suggesting a quick sell-off, this indicates a turn toward self-custody, a method frequently associated with long-term holding. Whale activity like this typically occurs during uncertain market conditions. By pulling such a large amount off the exchange, the whale reduces selling pressure, signaling confidence in Shiba Inu’s future price potential and possibly guarding against volatility. While optimism grows, Shiba Inu must clear a critical resistance at $0.000029 to spark further gains. Analysts believe breaking this level is the key to reaching its ambitious target of $0.000080, making the next few weeks crucial for the token. Dogecoin’s Bullish Momentum Sparks Optimism Among Investors Dogecoin jumped 9% to $0.34 during the last 24 hours while its trading activity climbed 58% to $2.87 billion. The price and trading activity spiked because of Elon Musk and renewed whale interest in Dogecoin. As investors anticipate further gains, one factor boosting Dogecoin’s potential is its Futures Open Interest. The meme coin’s Futures Open Interest (OI) went up from $554 million in October 2024 to $2 billion by Jan 2, 2025. This bullish momentum has sparked optimism among DOGE investors. Looking at past price patterns, Dogecoin’s price soared 90x in the 2017 bull run and 306x in 2021. Analysts now anticipate a similar pattern, with a rally pushing Dogecoin above $20 as momentum builds. With increasing demand and firm support, Dogecoin may deliver another remarkable surge. Why $RTX Could Outperform Solana, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu in 2025 With $RTX priced at just $0.0172, experts predict massive growth of over 1,800% by early 2025 and a potential 50x return by year-end. As Remittix disrupts the $250 trillion cross-border payments market, early investors stand to benefit significantly before its value soars, making it a strong contender against Solana, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu.

Despite strong institutional participation, Coinbase's revenue heavily relies on volatile trading, especially in smaller altcoins. In my view, much of the recent upside price action in crypto is already priced into Coinbase's stock, with multiples of ~10x EV/FY25 revenue and ~20x EV/FY25 adjusted EBITDA. A pullback in crypto prices or trading volume will impact Coinbase sharply. I recommend staying on the sidelines here. 2025 is now upon us, and Bitcoin continues to flirt with the $100k threshold. Against this backdrop, shares of Coinbase ( COIN ) have soared over the past year (though it's ~25% off its high near ~$340), buoyed by the Trump re-election and the hope of a relaxed regulatory environment around crypto. But with Coinbase up ~65 over the past year (slightly below the performance of Bitcoin, up ~115% in the last 12 months, but outperforming Ethereum, up ~50%), we have to ask ourselves: can this rally really continue? Data by YCharts Higher crypto prices will help Coinbase in the short term, but can they last? I last wrote a bearish note on Coinbase in August , when the stock was hovering just below $200 per share, judging the stock's valuation to be too high amid revenue risks. While I admit that I missed out on ~30% gains since then, and didn't predict the Republican sweep in the November elections leading to a cryptocurrency bonanza, when I take a fresh look at Coinbase now near all-time highs, I find little to encourage me to invest in this name. However, we do note that higher coin prices are likely to benefit Coinbase: especially the surge in smaller-cap coins that make up a good chunk of Coinbase's revenue. With this in mind, I'm upgrading my viewpoint on Coinbase to neutral. At current share prices, I see more of a balanced bull-and-bear case for this company. On the positive side for Coinbase: Favorable regulatory environment for Coinbase. President Trump has publicly declared himself to be pro-crypto, which likely means that the regulatory environment will be more benign in a Republican administration. This may help move many more fearful investors off the sidelines and into crypto, especially if light regulation is introduced that can make casual investors feel more secure about the asset class. Growing institutional participation. Coinbase now generates the whopping share of its trading volume (though not revenue) from institutional clients. As crypto becomes more mainstream, the company may be able to draw more institutional participation and increase its revenue. Growing tax enforcement of crypto gains. The sting of tax may also eventually reduce short-term speculation and trading volumes and encourage more long-term investing. At the same time, however, we have to be watchful of the following risks: Coinbase is dependent on healthy crypto pricing, and more than half of the company's revenue is derived from very volatile trading activity. Though the company has more stable revenue streams coming from both subscriptions and blockchain mining rewards, more than half of its revenue is derived from trading, which varies widely from quarter to quarter as prices fluctuate. Most of Coinbase's trading revenue is derived from smaller altcoins. Moreover, not only does Coinbase rely on trading for its revenue, but the most lucrative spreads come from smaller coins, on which Coinbase benefits from larger bid-ask spreads. I'm of the belief that the crypto market will eventually converge to a few top coins, on which Coinbase makes a lower spread. Valuation checkup The tiebreaker for me, and the reason for my decision to remain on the sidelines, is Coinbase's already-hefty valuation. At current share prices near $310, Coinbase trades at a market cap of $64.43 billion. After we net off the $7.72 billion of cash and $0.871 billion of USDC on Coinbase's latest balance sheet against $4.32 billion of debt on Coinbase's latest balance sheet, the company's resulting enterprise value is $60.16 billion. This is the most conservative estimate of valuation: if we also give Coinbase credit for $1.26 billion of crypto assets held for investment on its balance sheet (marked as of the end of its September quarter; prices are likely higher now), the company's all-in enterprise value is $58.90 billion. For next year FY25, Wall Street analysts are expecting Coinbase to generate $6.12 billion in revenue, or 5% y/y growth (comping against a very volatile and successful trading year in FY24, alongside a sharp rise in crypto prices in the back half of FY24). If we assume the company can generate a 48% adjusted EBITDA margin against that revenue profile (equivalent to its YTD margins from Q1-Q3 of FY24), adjusted EBITDA would be $2.93 billion (+23% versus $2.38 billion in TTM EBITDA; the company has not guided to EBITDA in Q4 yet). This would put Coinbase's valuation multiples at: 9.6x EV/FY25 revenue 20.1x EV/FY25 adjusted EBITDA These are reasonable multiples for a growth stock. Yet, we also have to recognize that so much of Coinbase's performance depends on trading activity, and as we see in the recently released Q3 results (discussed in more detail in the next section), the company's financial health depends heavily on crypto prices and trading volumes, which nobody can predict. With this being said, I'm content to wait on the sidelines and adopt a watch-and-wait approach on Coinbase. Q3 download, and small-cap price jumps that will benefit Q4 Let's now go through Coinbase's latest quarterly results in greater detail. The Q3 trading trends are shown below: Coinbase trading volumes (Coinbase Q3 shareholder letter) Trading volumes more than doubled y/y, but declined -19% sequentially versus Q2. Importantly, it's in the institutional space (82% of the company's Q3 trading volume) that slowed down the most, down -20% sequentially (but still growing 132% y/y) likely due to both softer crypto prices as well as caution heading into the elections. Transaction revenue, meanwhile, declined -27% sequentially from Q2, a heavier hit than the sequential decline in trading volumes. To me, this exposes one of Coinbase's key risks: its reliance on alt coins for their higher spreads to generate revenue. We note that Bitcoin's share of trading volume jumped from 35% in Q2 to 37% in Q3, while USDT also gained 5 points of share, at the expense of altcoins, which shrunk to a 33% of trading volume. It's these assets that generate substantial revenue for Coinbase (38% of transaction revenue, versus just 33% of trading volume). Coinbase revenue (Coinbase Q3 shareholder letter) On the bright side, subscription and services revenue from staking rewards and interest didn't decline as drastically, down only 7% sequentially and highlighting the importance of this stable fee income. It also grew 66% y/y. Over time, Coinbase is hoping to roll out more of these value-added services to reduce its reliance on volatile trading revenue, which would be a strong upside driver for the stock. We note that Q4 should look a lot better for Coinbase. Bitcoin hovered in the $50-60k range throughout most of Q3, and has jumped to ~$100k in the wake of the election. Importantly, smaller-cap coins also gained, some with even sharper jumps than Bitcoin. Here's a look at price charts from XRP ($138 billion and #3 in size), BNB ($105 billion in market cap, #5 in size), and Dogecoin ($50 billion, #7), all taken from CoinMarketCap : XRP (Coinmarketcap.com) BNB (Coinmarketcap.com) DOGE (Coinmarketcap.com) The key question, and the primary reason behind my hesitancy on Coinbase, is the sustainability of this small-cap rally. The overall crypto market has reached ~$3.4 trillion in overall market cap (~$2 billion of which is BTC, and compared to ~$45 trillion for the S&P 500). Again, my long-term thesis here is that crypto market capitalization can continue to grow, but the market will consolidate into the largest coins like Bitcoin while altcoins stay flat or fade: and Coinbase generates smaller spreads on larger coins. On the profitability front, we note that Coinbase's adjusted EBITDA hit $449 million in the quarter, representing a 37% margin: down 4 points sequentially, but up 11 points y/y from 26% margins in the year-ago Q3. Coinbase adjusted EBITDA (Coinbase Q3 shareholder letter) Key takeaways All in all, I'm nervous that too much of crypto's recent surge has already been priced into Coinbase's stock, and that Coinbase is already priced for perfection amid all-time crypto and stock market highs. While I believe that the crypto market will continue to expand in the long term (particularly Bitcoin, at the expense of altcoins), I also believe volatility and speculation in the space will simmer down, especially as and when the new administration develops more clear policies around crypto regulation. Stay on the sidelines here and don't rush to buy Coinbase.",COIN,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-03 09:59:00

This move will give more flexibility, potentially saving taxpayers from paying higher tax bills. The change of heart could be the changing political scenario to make crypto less complicated for investors. The new change will give some time for crypto users to file their taxes with ease. Avoiding Higher Taxes with Flexible Rules Tax expert Shehan Chandrasekera shared on X that the IRS’s temporary tax relief for crypto users is great news for investors. 6/ Source: https://t.co/cMBdKYili0 — Shehan (@TheCryptoCPA) December 31, 2024 Starting January 1, 2025, new IRS regulations under Section 6045 will require crypto transactions to follow FIFO (First-In, First-Out) accounting unless an alternative method, like HIFO (Highest-In, First-Out) or Specific Identification (Spec ID), is selected. FIFO mandates selling the oldest assets first, which could lead to higher taxable gains since older purchases often have lower costs. The relief allows crypto holders to bypass this default rule in 2025. Instead of being locked into FIFO, taxpayers can use their own records or tax software to identify specific assets being sold. This flexibility is especially beneficial in a bull market, where FIFO could unintentionally maximize capital gains. What Does This Mean for You? This change means you can breathe a bit easier when it comes to tracking those disputable capital gains for the 2025 tax year. This could be a game-changer for many in the crypto community, making tax compliance less of a burden. For transactions between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2025, crypto holders can document their sales using personal records or software, avoiding forced FIFO accounting. However, starting January 1, 2026, users must formally choose an accounting method with their broker or default to FIFO. To simplify, tax experts recommend syncing your broker’s accounting settings with your tax software to make sure your records match. This step is crucial to avoid discrepancies during tax filing. No Immediate Action Required The good news is that taxpayers don’t need to file anything with the IRS to benefit from this relief—it’s automatically applied. However, come 2026, you’ll need to actively select your preferred accounting method on your centralized exchange to maintain control over your tax strategy. While the US is planning to simplify the crypto tax policies, Russia is also thinking of embracing crypto to sustain US sanctions. Keep your eyes peeled on crypto regulations to make a decisive action this year.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-03 09:59:30

SOL Price Rebounds Analysts are seeing that Solana is off to a good start as the virtual coin opened the new year with a price uptick, raising market optimism over the crypto. SOL experienced an 10% surge in its price on January 2, opening 2025 on a positive note. Market observers also noted that Solana continues its dominance over Ethereum on year-to-date performance. At the time of writing, SOL was trading 209.22, up 3.5% in the last 24 hours, and soaring 10% in weekly timeframe. Data shows the price hike happened after a brief consolidation for the altcoin. During the day, the crypto reached a high of $209.35, nearing the $210 mark, while recording a low of $188, which some analysts said was a reflection of the regaining investors’ confidence and optimism on the digital asset. What’s Next For Solana? Market observers explained that Solana hitting $208 per coin is a significant achievement for the virtual asset, saying that the price increase allowed the crypto to break the resistance level of $202. This milestone is seen by analysts as a crucial step for the ongoing recovery of the SOL crypto and in propelling it to attain further gains.

If Solana is triumphant in getting back to the $245 level, analysts believe it “would enable Solana to recover most of its recent losses, reinforcing its bullish outlook and boosting investor sentiment.” Excitement About SOL ETF The regained investors’ confidence in Solana is being attributed by some analysts to the growing excitement of a possible Solana exchange-traded fund. Many crypto investors are anticipating that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve the Solana exchange-traded fund this year, a milestone that some traders believe would drive the price of the coin up. Some traders are speculating that the SEC would give the green light to Solana exchange-traded fund as early as July 31, 2025, a rumor which is gaining traction. Even the Polymarket platform said that there is a 65% probability that the ETF would get the approval, up from the previous 50% approval likelihood prediction.

The recent Bitcoin price hike that triggered parabolic gains across the entire crypto market has begun to cool off. But this could be a blessing in disguise, allowing you to diversify your crypto portfolio to gain huge profits. While established cryptos like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA) are starting to slump, investors are turning to IntelMarkets due to its upside potential. Experts predict this coin could achieve 23,200% gains because of its unique characteristics. But what’s driving the hype? Let’s discover. IntelMarkets: Innovative AI-Powered Platform Catching Eyeballs Despite being a new player in the crypto market IntelMarkets (INTL) is becoming a hot choice for investors. Why? Because this coin introduces a revolutionary concept that could revolutionize the entire crypto market while coins like Shiba Inu and Cardano struggle to keep up. And that’s the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). IntelMarkets intends to launch a highly sophisticated exchange designed to overcome the limitations of traditional exchanges. This exchange will be the first to integrate artificial intelligence throughout all levels. Further, the exchange will support and be able to run on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains, giving it an edge over other exchanges. To top it off, the exchange does not require KYC verification, so you don’t have to take time-consuming steps that even ask for personal info. Also the fact that it is being developed by former experts from Renaissance Technologies, Google, OpenAI and Goldman Sachs makes it the platform of choice for traders with advanced needs. And the icing on the cake is that you get self-learning trading bots that improve your trading experience by learning and developing over time. This is all paired with the AI-powered super-fast engine that’s able to process 10,000 sources and give you spot-on signals. The INTL token is the heart of the platform and comes with amazing benefits. Holding the INTL token will give you governance rights and discounts on trading fees of up to 30%. Plus, the low entry point of just $0.07 makes this platform a no-brainer. Experts forecast a 23,200% price hike and a possible listing on Tier-1 CEX. So don’t miss out! Could Shiba Inu (SHIB) Touch $1 This Year? Shiba Inu (SHIB) is the second most loved meme currency that ended 2024 on a high note with triple-digit percentage growth. Right now, it is trading around $0.0000228 showing an decent intra-day increase. SHIB is testing resistance levels at $0.0000222 and $0.0000229, with support at $0.0000211 and $0.0000200. Many experts think if SHIB is able to break through these levels it could spark a bull run. Plus, popular analyst Javon Marks talks about SHIB’s potential. He forecasted a 234% gain to $0.000081, more than a 3.33x increase. While this shows there’s potential for SHIB, reaching $1 by 2025 is a long shot, requiring a staggering 4,500,000% growth. Analyst Shows Support for Cardano Despite Sluggish Progress Unlike Shiba Inu, Cardano started off 2025 a little less energetic dropping significantly from its previous highs. Right now it is trading around $0.9 which is down almost 24% from its December price. But despite this drop, crypto analyst Michaël Van de Poppe is still optimistic. In his recent post, he predicted that the correction is over and the market is about to enter a parabolic bullish phase. In his Van de Poppe believes ADA’s surge from $0.3260 to $1.3264 in December 2024 marked the start of the “first wave upwards.” He predicts it will surpass its all-time high of $3.09 by the end of 2025. Analysts assume the $1 level is a psychological barrier that needs to be broken before ADA can reach record levels of $1.24. Conclusion 2025 has started off with Cardano lagging behind and SHIB battling it out. While both have potential, IntelMarkets (INTL) stands out as the smarter choice. With AI-driven tools, self-learning trading bots, and a low entry price of $0.07, INTL offers innovation and massive upside potential that’s perfect for future-focused investors.

In 2028, the price of AMP will range between $0.0325 and $0.0371, with an average price of $0.0348. In 2031, AMP will range between $0.0557 and $0.0603, with an average price of $0.0580. Amp (AMP) is a decentralized collateral token facilitating fast and secure payment transactions on the Flexa network. Amp’s purpose is to enhance the adaptability of cryptocurrencies for day-to-day payments by addressing the issues of potential fraud and slow-speed transactions of typical cryptocurrencies. Amp also helps users stake tokens without physically transferring them to a smart contract. This function makes Amp suitable for any form of value exchange, including digital payments, traditional currency exchange, loan distributions, real estate transactions, and more. Will AMP reach new heights with more adoption as the network’s number of users increases? Let’s examine the Amp technical analysis and predictions.

Considering the decline in market volatility, there is a lower chance of a reversal. The distance between the Bollinger bands determines the market volatility.

Whereas, its lower limit, serving as the support band, has moved to $0.00676. AMP/USD 1-day price chart.

AMP/USD 4-hour price chart analysis The four-hour price analysis of AMP coin confirmed an uptrend for the cryptocurrency today.

AMP price analysis gives out a highly bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. Coin value has climbed up to a $0.00782 high over the past 24 hours. On the other side, the cryptocurrency lost 0.11% of its value as well. Despite the strong bearish tide in the earlier weeks, the bulls remained strong in the past few days. Technical indicators give out a neutral verdict, whereas the price charts continue to support the cryptocurrency buyers. Is AMP a good investment? AMP has been struggling with a bearish trend for the past few months. Despite this, its strong fundamentals suggest it could be a solid long-term investment. Crypto analysts suggest that the approaching weeks can steadily increase the cryptocurrency’s value. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the AMP above $0.015. Why is AMP up? AMP’s price has increased today. Additionally, the coin has experienced a loss of 0.11% if observed over the last 24 hours. The price is trading at $0.00782 as the coin is under a bullish spell for now, moreover, the bulls remained on the lead this week. Will AMP reach $0.010? AMP’s resistance level is at $0.008, yet a break above this level is possible if sufficient buying momentum builds. A break near or above $0.010 will require a more robust push but isn’t impossible, as the coin achieved this level on December 3, 2024. Will AMP reach $1? Amp has never spiked above the $0.12 level. Even this price mark was observed only once at the start of the token’s launch, and AMP has never seen this level again. It seems highly unlikely for AMP to achieve $1 soon. Will AMP reach $10? According to the price prediction, AMP will not achieve this level in the next 10 years until something unusual happens. Considering AMP’s current market cap of only $630.88 million, the scenario seems almost impossible. Does AMP have a good long-term Future? Amp is trading near its average price level if observed over the longest price period levels. It can be a good long-term investment, as its price is expected to double in 2025 and reach $0.0603 by 2031.

With that, the industry also saw major security breaches. The annual report by Certik is revealing; it shows 760 breaches the crypto industry lost over $2.36 billion in losses, a 31.61% increase from 2023. Escalating Threats It was the year that saw more frequent and intense cyber security threats. Hackers used more sophisticated techniques and the most common was phishing one. Phishing was again the biggest source of funds that were stolen and this ranged to $1.05 billion, 296 times with 3 occurrences of events with over $100 million. Marching next to it was private key compromises that involved $855 million in losses in 65 attacks. Most Affected Chains, Ethereum Dominates Again Ethereum was the most targeted case with 403 incidents within the period resulting in $748.6 million, with an average hack per Ethereum of $1.85 million. Two more blockchains that suffered were Bitcoin with $542.7 million and Tron with $133 million with an outflow within 24 hours of the attacks. The decentralized nature of mutli-chain affected it badly through 39 cases where exploits hit $435 million. Peak Activity May was the costliest for cyber attackers who made away with $444 million in 63 attacks. If we go by quarters, the third quarter was notable, as it had $753 million stolen in 157 cyberattacks. But the fourth quarter appears to have marked a turning point: The losses were much lower than those in the previous three quarters, as there was a 46.65% loss reduction. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Crypto Hacks of December 2024: $24.7 Million Lost as New Threats Emerge , Industry Successes in the Face of Adversities Though the year 2024 focused much on security, it was a year of production in the development of the cryptocurrency industry. Since the election of the U.S. president, Bitcoin traded over $100,000 , and through the endorsement by the SEC to take up the Bitcoin ETFs , the industry has been motivated even more. However, this takes place in the wake of having sufficient security frameworks that protect investors and the rest of the public. That, holds true even when traditional financial systems are integrated into cryptocurrencies. The main focus in the year 2025 will be on phishing attacks, defence of private keys and enhancements of the security mechanism of crypto platforms .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/do-kwon-appears-before-judge-after-extradition-to-the-us-how-did-he-respond-to-accusations-here-are-the-details/,"Do Kwon, the South Korean entrepreneur behind the disastrous collapse of cryptocurrencies TerraUSD and Luna, pleaded not guilty to fraud charges in the United States on Thursday following his extradition from Montenegro. Do Kwon Pleads Not Guilty to US Fraud Charges in $40 Billion Crypto Crash Kwon, co-founder of Singapore-based Terraform Labs, faces a nine-count indictment in Manhattan federal court that includes charges of securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Prosecutors allege that Kwon, 33, orchestrated a series of scams that led to an estimated $40 billion in losses through 2022 and destabilized the broader cryptocurrency market. At the hearing, Kwon appeared in court wearing an olive green shirt and black sweatpants. His attorney, Andrew Chesley, entered a not guilty plea on Kwon's behalf. U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert Lehrburger ruled that Kwon remain in custody because Chesley did not seek bail. Kwon is expected to return to court on Jan. 8, 2025. He left the courtroom with a copy of the 79-page indictment in hand. The indictment accuses Kwon of misleading investors about the stability of TerraUSD, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. Prosecutors allege that in May 2021, Kwon falsely stated that a computer algorithm, the “Terra Protocol,” restored TerraUSD’s $1 peg after it fell below the threshold. In reality, Kwon allegedly arranged for a high-frequency trading firm to purchase millions of dollars worth of TerraUSD, artificially inflating its price. Prosecutors say the scam led to significant investment in Terraform Labs products and boosted the value of Luna, TerraUSD’s companion token, to $50 billion by early 2022. “Much of this growth occurred following Kwon’s brazen deceptions about Terraform and its technology,” the indictment states. When TerraUSD began to lose value again in May 2022, attempts to stabilize it failed, leading to a crash that wiped out TerraUSD, Luna, and billions of other cryptocurrency assets. *This is not investment advice.

The coin surged past a $2 billion market cap recently, with its price soaring about 430% over the last 30 days. Besides, a crypto trader recorded a 1000% profit by strategically cashing out during the peak rally despite a sharp decline in its price today. Crypto Trader Nabs 1000% Profit With AI16Z Trading A recent Solscan report showed that a crypto trader recently sold their entire holding of 2.27 million AI16Z tokens for $4.77 million. This move helps the trader in booking an extraordinary profit of $4.47 million. The strategic sell-off, at a price of $2.1 per token, underscores the coin’s explosive growth in recent days and investor confidence. The Solana meme coin has been a hot topic among traders, primarily due to its consistent performance and growing market demand. However, the token’s value dipped sharply today as investors rushed to book profits, echoing the volatility commonly seen with top meme coins . However, the Solana meme coin’s remarkable rally has also stirred discussions about its potential to challenge leading players like Dogecoin . Besides, the recent whale transactions also highlight the growing confidence of the investors towards the coin. For context, a recent report showed that a crypto whale bets big on AI16Z with a $4 million purchase, signaling sustained interest in its growth potential despite current market turbulence. What’s Next For The Solana Meme Coin? AI16Z price today was down more than 15% with its price resting at $2.03. Its trading volume was up about 55% to $459 million, while its market cap stayed above the $2.21 billion mark. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour high of $2.46, suggesting the highly volatile trading of the token. AI16Z Price Despite the recent decline, the Futures Open Interest for the token was up over 42%, CoinGlass data showed. This on-chain data signals a potential recovery for the crypto. While the Solana meme coin has shown its ability to generate exponential gains, its future depends on sustaining market confidence. The token’s massive surge reflects its increasing traction among crypto traders, but the current profit-taking phase raises questions about its long-term stability. In other words, whale activity has been a significant driver of the crypto’s price movement. Having said that, investors remain curious about whether the meme coin can maintain its upward trajectory.

This strategic move, revealed on January 2, highlights the evolving collaboration between the two companies and BitFuFu’s ambitions to expand its global mining infrastructure. Next-Gen Mining Hardware Under the deal, BitFuFu will acquire Bitmain’s latest S-series models, including the high-performance S21 XP and S21 Pro miners . Flexible payment terms, including partial payment in BitFuFu shares, are part of the agreement, showcasing the deep partnership between the two firms. Leo Lu, Chairman and CEO of BitFuFu, explained the importance of the collaboration. “This agreement ensures a steady supply of the latest miners to rapidly scale our operations worldwide. We aim to add 1 gigawatt of capacity by the end of 2026, enhancing both self-mining and cloud-mining services,” Lu stated. Rapid Expansion of BitFuFu BitFuFu, a Nasdaq-listed company, has been making major strides in the Bitcoin mining industry. With 17 mining farms primarily in the United States and a hosting capacity of 556 megawatts, the firm manages 26.2 EH/s (exahashes per second) in hashrate. It boasts a robust user base of over 450,000 registered users. In October 2024, BitFuFu acquired its first physical mining facility—an 80-megawatt site in Ethiopia—marking its entry into owning and operating infrastructure. The purchase was a strategic effort to diversify its operations geographically and solidify its standing in the competitive mining sector. The latest deal is expected to further solidify BitFuFu’s position in the industry while enhancing its energy-efficient mining capabilities. The company’s treasury currently holds 1,664 BTC, worth approximately $161 million at current prices, reflecting its robust financial health. Meanwhile, Bitmain recently expanded its production line to the United States to address supply chain challenges. “This strategic move ensures faster service and response times for North American customers,” the company noted, signaling its commitment to global market leadership amid ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions. Following the announcement, BitFuFu’s shares surged 13%, reaching $5.60, signaling strong market confidence in the company’s growth trajectory.

Wainwright Predicts Bitcoin Price to Hit $225K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News This latest Bitcoin four-year cycle began two years ago. In 2023, the first year of the current cycle, Bitcoin showed a growth of +155.4%. Last year, it slightly declined to +121.1%. Historically, Bitcoin shows massive growth in the third year of a cycle. In 2013, BTC reported a growth of +5,435%, and in 2017, a surge of +1,369%. Interestingly, a New York Investment bank, H.C. Wainwright predicts that the Bitcoin price could reach as high as $225,000 this year. Let’s dive in for more details. Bitcoin Price Target Raised to $225,000 Earlier, the investment bank had a less optimistic view of the growth of Bitcoin; its initial BTC growth target was as low as $145,000. Reports say that factors like regulatory clarity, institutional adoption and increased demand have prompted the bank to reconsider its growth target. Now, the bank forecasts that the BTC price could touch a high of $225,000 in 2025. Crypto Regulatory Clarity Fuels Optimism The political scenario in the US shifted in favour of the cryptocurrency sector when pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump defeated Kamala Harris, who represented a crypto-skeptic regime. The favourable election result has influenced the entire crypto market immensely. Since November 5, the total market cap of the cryptocurrency sector has grown by at least 49.77%. It is expected that the Trump administration will implement policies and acts necessary to liberate the crypto sector from the clutches of excessive regulation. Reports say that acts like the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act may unlock sidelined institutional capital. Institutional Adoption and Bitcoin ETF Success In early 2024, the US approved Bitcoin ETFs. The ETF sector has gained tremendous attention, and accumulated significant assets under management. Several prominent hedge funds have entered the sector. Impact of Bitcoin Halving on Market Dynamics The 2024 Bitcoin halving event helped the asset to strengthen its deflationary value. BTC has even emerged as a strong competitor to Gold. Right now, the total market capitalisation of Bitcoin is $1,914,664,045,778. Reports say that the BTC market cap could grow as high as $4.5 trillion (about 25% of gold’s market cap). Broader Crypto Market Growth The cryptocurrency market capitalisation currently remains at $3.31T. Since November 5, it has surged by over 49.77%. At one point in December, 2024, it even touched a peak of $3.73T. Reports suggest that the market could grow to around $10 trillion by 2025.

Bitcoin Mining Firm Now Holds $91 Million in BTC: A Strong Signal for the Market appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin mining has seen a surge in operations recently, with companies like Cango Inc. making huge strides. The Chinese-based auto trading platform now holds 933.8 BTC, worth around $91 million, showcasing their growing trust in the asset. But what does this mean for Bitcoin’s future price? Cango’s Bitcoin Production Soars in December Cango, once primarily known for automotive financing and car trading has made a notable entry into the Bitcoin mining space, marking a daring yet calculated move towards the cryptocurrency market. In its recent release December 2024 Bitcoin mining production update, Cango revealed impressive figures. By the end of December, the company had accumulated 933.8 Bitcoin, valued at around $91 million. In December alone, Cango’s Bitcoin production reached 569.9 BTC, a 56% increase compared to November’s output of 363.9 BTC. This sharp rise in production suggests that the company is efficiently ramping up its mining operations. Meanwhile, Cango’s hashrate, or mining power, remained strong at 32 EH/s, with a slight improvement in average operating hashrate from 29.8 EH/s in November to 30.4 EH/s by December, a 2% increase quarter-on-quarter. Cango Holding All Mined Bitcoin What’s noteworthy is that Cango’s Bitcoin holdings now account for approximately 50% of its market capitalization. This move highlights how the company views Bitcoin not just as a digital asset, but as a long-term store of value. Given the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in April 2024, With a daily production rate of 18.4 BTC, Cango’s decision to hold its mined Bitcoin could pay off, as it is positioning itself as a key player among mid-tier Bitcoin miners globally. What’s Next for Cango and Bitcoin? As more companies like Cango invest in Bitcoin mining, we can expect to see a shift in the broader market, potentially influencing Bitcoin’s price soon. As of now, Bitcoin is trading steadily at $96,562 , showing a slight increase in price and maintaining a market capitalization of $1.9 trillion.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-03 10:12:29

Trump Loves Dancing (TRUMPDAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPDAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Dancing can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Dancing could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Dancing launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Dancing on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Dancing by entering its contract address – HVnG6NJCvVDa34VxqR1wmSo18EGtNVJhNR8CQwNwjgpi – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPDAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-03 11:21:00

In a post on X, Garlinghouse stated, “Momentum and increased focus on real-world utility continues to build,” signaling confidence in the future trajectory of XRP and its adoption and utility. XRP demonstrated remarkable performance in recent months, reaching its highest value since 2018 in early December. The cryptocurrency continued its upward trend into 2025, rising by 22% since the beginning of the year and now trading at $2.44. The asset’s sustained growth is attributed to its ability to overcome key resistance levels, reflecting increasing market confidence. Happy New Year to the XRP Family and the entire crypto community!!! Excited for the year ahead! Momentum and increased focus on real world utility continues to build — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 1, 2025 A Pivotal Month for the Crypto Market The ongoing momentum coincides with significant changes in U.S. regulatory and political landscapes. January 20, 2025, marks two important events: the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump and the resignation of Gary Gensler as Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Gensler is well-known for his war against crypto, using stringent policies and frivolous lawsuits to hold down the crypto market. However, Paul Atkins, Trump’s nominee to succeed Gensler, is said to be crypto-friendly. His confirmation will signal a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. The crypto community anticipates that the new administration will pursue an end to the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC and other similar lawsuits. This development could further bolster market confidence in XRP and its utility.

The company has maintained a strong focus on fostering global payment solutions, leveraging blockchain technology to enhance efficiency and reduce costs for cross-border transactions. Ripple’s partnerships with financial institutions and payment providers worldwide remain integral to this strategy. The growing adoption of XRP in financial ecosystems aligns with the broader market trend of integrating blockchain solutions for mainstream applications. Ripple’s launch of RLUSD in December is also an important part of its adoption strategy. The stablecoin is highly regulated, and a unique addition to the market that has already drawn many new eyes to the XRP ecosystem. As RLUSD grows, it could increase the adoption of XRP and the XRP Ledger (XRP) and help the digital asset grow significantly. Analysts and community members share Garlinghouse’s optimism about XRP’s potential as some experts projected it could attain a new all-time high this year.

Considering the market saturation and scalability concerns, traders have begun exercising options priced below $1 with greater potential for explosive growth. Some of the most recommended ones are Rexas Finance (RXS), Bonk (BONK), and Shiba Inu (SHIB)—all have solid performance records and appear to have a reasonable risk-to-reward ratio. Rexas Finance (RXS): Disrupting the Blockchain Industry Rexas Finance’s focus on tokenization, decentralized finance (DeFi), and access has positioned it as a potential disruptor in the blockchain space. The RXS token is selling for $0.175 in its stage 11 presale . At the same time, it has already garnered $33.8 million after selling over 338 million tokens, demonstrating investors’ strong confidence in the ecosystem. Given this momentum, Rexas Finance will likely substantially breach the $10 mark, creating enormous opportunities for early-stage investors. Rexas token builder, according to Rexas Finance, is a tool that allows users to create their own tokens easily without any coding experience. Additionally, Rexas Finance integrates tokenization into popular messaging apps like Telegram and Discord using the QuickMint bot, which makes it easy for token users. With the outlook that Rexas Finance provides, they claim the ecosystem is built in such a manner that makes cooperation and investment easier for all. To maximize crypto returns, Rexas Treasury offers a multi-chain yield optimization platform with Rexas GenAI using artificial intelligence. This allows creators to custom-generate NFT art and also provides them with legislative solutions. From developers to DeFi, these and other aspects help Rexas meet the diverse needs of users and build a solid, balanced ecosystem. Rexas has increased significance in relation to CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko listings. The announcement of the $1 million giveaway campaign further enables Rexas to strengthen the community vision while attracting new token investors. With an estimated strong investor interest, a low presale price, and a detailed growth roadmap, the RXS token might cross $10 in the next bull cycle. Bonk (BONK): A Meme Coin That’s Worth the Investment Bonk has a current price of $0.00003339 and a market cap of $2.53 billion. During its inception, Bonk was merely a meme coin, but because of a robust community and actual developments planned in the roadmap, it slowly started to mature within the crypto landscape. Unlike other meme token alter egos that are purely hyped up, it has a dApp development roadmap and staking features that give it an edge over its competitors. According to analysts, Bonk will reach $19, which sets the stage for it to surpass $10. This growth stems from its decentralized, community-driven nature and real-world applications. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Token That Might Be Considered a Meme Too The existing meme coin contender, Shiba Inu, at the price point of $0.00002287, has a market volume of $13.47 billion, and it continues to be a popular option among crypto users. SHIB, which initially was a meme token, has now evolved into its ecosystem with the likes of the layer-2 scaling solution Shibarium and ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. These enhancements aim to increase use cases for SHIB, making it more than a mere speculative asset. SHIB is expected to reach a price of $11.45, which is believable, especially considering the vast community and ecosystem that Shiba has built. An extended ecosystem that attracts more investors can help propel SHIB past $10 in the coming years. Strong bullishness could be the reason behind this projection. Its price and branding make it a valid alternative for those seeking passive income over time. Why These Alternatives Might Surpass Ethereum Ethereum’s high value and slow growth make it unattractive for investors seeking high returns. On the other hand, Rexas Finance , Bonk, and Shiba Inu have market prices below $1. Investing in such currencies has the potential to yield greater returns from smaller investments. Their ecosystems are primarily community-driven, making them excellent options for traders seeking to broaden their investment horizons. Rexas Finance is a unique presale token because it started by extending an innovative tool range it created. Bonk complements meme coins and is thus a speculative yet attractive option. While still developing, Shiba Inu has a complete ecosystem in place, keeping it competitive. Conclusion Today’s traders focus on Rexas Finance’s robust presale and innovative growth factors as Ethereum prices stagnate. This gives them high returns since Rexas can potentially cross the $10 mark. Bonk needs to gain traction as a community-centric currency, with speculations suggesting it will exceed $10 by 2025. Shiba Inu is also estimated to reach a price value of $6.45 by 2025, but it has a strong community, meaning it could surpass $10 over time. Traders can benefit more from investing in Rexas since it has much higher growth potential than the other two options. The scope of Rexas, Shiba, and Bonk in the market is immense, and due to that, they’ll likely grow and expand significantly without facing much difficulty.

This Token Will Beat That Performance in 60 Days, Or Less",https://timestabloid.com/missed-dogecoins-doge-0-004-to-0-74-run-in-2021-this-token/,"In 2021, Dogecoin (DOGE) captured the crypto market’s attention with an explosive rise from $0.004 to $0.74. Yet, for those who missed out on that rally, Rexas Finance (RXS) presents an opportunity that could outperform Dogecoin’s gains in just 60 days. With its unique approach to real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, Rexas Finance bridges the gap between blockchain and tangible assets, opening new doors for investors. As the current presale enters its 11th stage, RXS has already demonstrated a 6x price increase, growing from $0.03 to $0.175 per token. This project’s growth trajectory positions it as a contender for substantial returns in a short time frame. Rexas Finance Redefines Real-World Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance is transforming how people invest in tangible assets. Through its RXS token, the platform allows users to own fractions of high-value assets with minimal capital. This innovation makes investments in traditionally exclusive markets, such as real estate and gold, accessible to everyday investors. The real estate market, valued at trillions of dollars globally, is historically plagued by high entry barriers and illiquidity. Rexas Finance eliminates these hurdles by enabling fractional ownership. For instance, an investor in Asia can own a portion of a commercial property in Europe, earning passive income from rents and property appreciation—all managed digitally. This democratization of real estate opens up lucrative opportunities for millions. Beyond real estate, RXS facilitates investment in commodities like gold and oil, as well as high-value collectibles. Tokenizing these assets enhances liquidity and allows investors to trade them seamlessly. Whether it’s a fraction of a rare painting or a stake in a barrel of oil, the possibilities are vast and transformative. Innovative Tools Driving Adoption Rexas Finance provides robust tools to simplify the tokenization process: Rexas Token Builder : Empowers users to tokenize real-world assets efficiently, creating a new level of liquidity. QuickMint Bot : Accessible via Telegram and Discord, this tool streamlines token creation with ease, catering to both beginners and experienced users. Rexas Launchpad : A platform for token-based fundraising, connecting projects with investors globally. Rexas GenAI and AI Shield : Cutting-edge tools that enhance security and efficiency, ensuring seamless operations across blockchain networks. These features collectively bridge the gap between real-world assets and blockchain, establishing Rexas Finance as a comprehensive solution for investors and asset owners alike. Presale Momentum and Future Prospects Rexas Finance’s presale success reflects its strong market appeal. With $34,082,235 raised so far, stages 1–10 sold out swiftly, and the token price has increased sixfold. Currently, in stage 11, RXS is priced at $0.175, offering a compelling entry point for investors. Notably, the project has opted for a public presale rather than venture capital funding, ensuring broader participation in this revolutionary platform. RXS also offers additional incentives, such as its $1M giveaway campaign. Participants can win up to $50,000 in USDT by completing tasks, referring friends, and joining the RXS community. This initiative highlights the project’s focus on community engagement and inclusivity. CertiK auditing adds another layer of credibility, ensuring the platform’s security and stability. RXS’s listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko further enhance its visibility, reaching millions of potential investors worldwide. Moreover, plans to launch on three top-tier exchanges underline its commitment to expanding market reach. Final Thoughts: A Golden Opportunity in the Crypto Market For those who missed Dogecoin’s unprecedented rise, Rexas Finance presents a rare chance to participate in a project poised for extraordinary growth. With its innovative approach to real-world asset tokenization, the RXS token offers a blend of accessibility, utility, and investment potential. As the presale nears completion and the platform gears up for its full launch, Rexas Finance is well-positioned to achieve exponential returns. Joining the RXS revolution now could be the key to unlocking unparalleled opportunities in the evolving crypto market.

The meme token platform surpassed Ethereum based on weekly fees. The Solana meme token boom continues, as Pump.fun achieved $28.56M in weekly fees. The platform mostly retains the earnings and liquidates them toward the team’s treasury. As of December 2, Ethereum weekly revenues reached $25.36M after a few slow days at the end of the year. Revenues for Ethereum and other protocols vary by day, and the usual balance points toward higher fees. However, Pump.fun lines up among major protocols for last month’s fees, which exceeded $90M. At this stage, Pump.fun is close to LidoDAO and Uniswap, while producing more than double the fees of Aave and Sky Protocol (Maker). The token platform also completed another SOL deposit to Kraken, using the recent rally of SOL above $200. The site has not made any mentions of redistributing its profits. The last SOL sale is valued at $13.11M, while Pump.fun still holds 356.9K SOL. Pump.fun posts peak fees in December The past three months for Pump.fun established a higher baseline for daily active users. The platform remained successful despite removing the live streaming feature . The platform did not lose out active wallets, despite the warning and removal of service for UK-based users. During the summer boom of Pump.fun, a smaller number of wallets turned into token creators. Since then, more participants are launching tokens, with up to 26,000 daily users becoming token developers. Additionally, more tokens are graduating to Raydium , and users are also focusing on locked liquidity to avoid rug pulls. As a result, Raydium still produces over $132.58M in monthly fees, ending the year with a total of over $675M. Pump.fun remains as risky as ever, but meme users are becoming more discerning. The goal is to snipe early, while watching for memes that may gain traction. On highly active days, Pump.fun fees reached $13.99M or 72,506 SOL. The platform’s profile shifted in the last month of 2024, with fewer tokens launched, but a higher number of active wallets. The site got most of its visits from the USA, where it ranked at position #26 among financial sites. The meme token platform even flipped Nasdaq for its short-term visits spike. The Pump.fun phenomenon is mostly driven by Western investors, treating it like a risky source of high returns. Pump.fun expanded among finance and investment sites, with a crossover from news and contemporary events as a major source of memes. | Source: SimilarWeb While the UK initially decreased its share of visits, some of the users are returning, despite the risk warnings. In the past month, 8.29% of the traffic came from the UK, up more than 108% for the past month. Pump.fun draws its visitors from younger demographics, with up to 64% in the age brackets under 34 years old. The site is crossing over topics from finance and investing, with a mix of news and contemporary events. Pump.fun remains one of the most visited sites, along with other Solana resources like Solscan, DexScreener, DexTools and the Jupiter aggregator. The common usage of those sites shows Pump.fun is key to popularizing the entire Solana ecosystem, leading up to DEX trading on Raydium. Pump.fun competes with new AI agent tokens Pump.fun was the main tool for creating AI agent tokens. In the past weeks, Virtuals Protocol and other AI agent platforms started expanding their influence. However, Pump.fun retained its primacy and is still used to create new AI agent tokens. AI agent tokens are one of the growing sectors in the beginning of 2025. The collection of AI agents took months to grow to a valuation of $10B, but only a couple of days to rally to over $15B . The shift to AI tokens may become the main competitor of Pump.fun, while also helping to bring higher traffic to Solana. When it comes to memes, the early AI tokens are still going strong. FARTCOIN, one of the early creations of Truth Terminal, rallied to an all-time high of $1.45 , after being mentioned by CNBC. The rally showed that AI-generated tokens still behaved like memes, and the new wave of agents would face a steep competition.

38467376,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=670192,1735903858,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"Bitcoin To Hit $225,000 By End Of Year, Predicts Venerable US Investment Bank",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-225000-end-of-year-us-investment-bank/,"In a newly released investor note, one of the oldest US investment banks H.C. Wainwright & Co. —established in 1868—is projecting substantial upswing for the Bitcoin price. According to the note, the institution has revised its previous Bitcoin price target for the end of 2025 from $145,000 to $225,000, underpinned by a confluence of historical trends, macroeconomic indicators, and emerging regulatory and institutional factors. “We estimate BTC will reach a cycle high of $225,000 by YE2025,” stated the firm, referencing both market cycles and the potential for a more supportive digital-asset regulatory landscape in the United States in 2025 under a new administration. Why Bitcoin Could $225,000 By Year End H.C. Wainwright’s analysis highlights several pivotal forces propelling Bitcoin’s growth trajectory. One significant catalyst is the wider availability of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, a development that could unlock new waves of institutional capital. The firm also cites “accelerating institutional investor and corporate adoption” as a major contributor to its bullish outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Sinks To Lowest Since FTX Crash: Bottom In? On top of that, the investment bank’s models assume an overall market backdrop that improves in tandem with global liquidity and that any regulatory overhang will abate. H.C. Wainwright is careful to note that the forecast is sensitive to macroeconomic conditions, particularly measured by M2 money supply, which has trended downward since October. Though projecting a lofty six-figure price by 2025, H.C. Wainwright acknowledged that Bitcoin’s path toward $225,000 is unlikely to be a smooth ride. In the report, the bank cautioned: “~20-30% drawdowns during bull markets are not uncommon We estimate BTC could retrace back down to the mid-$70,000 range in early 1Q25 before resuming its uptrend.” They attribute these possible pullbacks to Bitcoin’s historical volatility and its correlation with global liquidity trends. Related Reading: 2025 Bitcoin Predictions: Top Fund Manager Shares His Outlook If Bitcoin reaches $225,000 per coin, H.C. Wainwright projects a total Bitcoin market capitalization of approximately $4.5 trillion—around 25% of gold’s current $18 trillion market cap. This scenario translates to a 113% increase over current levels. However, the note adds a striking scenario that is not yet factored into its core forecast: “Our new 2025 price target does not factor in the potential for the US government to officially adopt BTC as a treasury reserve asset at the federal level next year. If implemented, we believe it is plausible that BTC could significantly exceed our base case price target.” The institution’s analysis also extends to the broader crypto market. Historically, Bitcoin’s dominance (its share of total crypto market cap) tends to fall during market peaks, and it dipped into the low 40% range near the last bull cycle peak in November 2021. Looking forward, H.C. Wainwright expects Bitcoin’s dominance to decline to 45% by the end of 2025, down from around 56% currently. Under that assumption, the firm sees the total crypto market swelling from $3.6 trillion today to approximately $10 trillion by year’s end 2025. H.C. Wainwright’s coverage universe of publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies stands to benefit from the anticipated price surge. “If our predictions are correct, there is the potential for significant upward estimate revisions for our coverage universe over the course of next year.” At press time, BTC traded at $96,221.

33767162,[object Object],1735903887,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Ethereum Price Prediction: Will $ETH Break Above $3,500?",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-price-prediction-will-eth-break-above-3500/,"Ethereum ($ETH) began to recover after hovering below $3,420 the entire week. The December high of $4,077 remains out of reach, but there’s hope $ETH will clear resistance at $3,500. This uptick could result from the 16.29% spike in the 24-hour trading volume of Ethereum ecosystem tokens. The cumulative market cap of all projects on Ethereum now exceeds $495B. Will this bounce be enough for a comeback? Let’s take a closer look at $ETH’s price action. Mixed Signals for $ETH, But the Long-Term Trend Is Bullish The Average Directional Index (ADX) and Stochastic RSI suggest a weak trend for $ETH. This means that even if $ETH were to step on the path of recovery, returning to its peak will take time. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is assuredly bullish, and so are the moving averages. Yesterday, bulls briefly drove $ETH to $3,499, but the token bounced back to $3,440. Now, $3,500 is a critical psychological resistance level $ETH must clear to strengthen the bullish trajectory. If $ETH fails to break above the $3,500 zone, it may find support at $3,420. The next support line sits at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $3,310. Luckily for the Ethereum community, tokens on the network are thriving. Department Of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Hoppy ($HOPPY), Apu Apustaja ($APU), Neiro Ethereum ($NEIRO), and Pikaboss ($PIKA) are among the top meme coin gainers today. Ethereum’s popularity as a meme coin network drives consistent demand for $ETH. This means $ETH’s recovery is a matter of ‘when,’ not ‘if.’ Two Sides of the Same (Meme) Coin? In this bull run, meme coins are forming two distinct niches: pump-and-dump coins (shitcoins, if you will) and utility tokens under a meme facade. The likes of Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN), SPX6900 ($SPX), and Gigachad ($GIG) belong to the first category. They generated a lot of hype and rose to the top, but how long will they maintain their momentum? Shiba Inu ($SHIB), Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU), and Floki Inu ($FLOKI) now lead the second category. However, the top might soon change as the Ethereum-based project Meme Index introduces the world’s first meme coin index. Through one of the four Meme Index baskets, catered to different risk appetites, you can diversify your meme coin investments to spread risk. Whether you invest in titans like $DOGE or pump-and-dump tokens like $FARTCOIN, potential returns could be higher as you offset losses. The $MEMEX presale kicked off recently, with one token now worth $0.0148639.

Whale Wallets Reach Record Holdings Since 2018,https://zycrypto.com/ripples-xrp-to-hit-5-price-whale-wallets-reach-record-holdings-since-2018/,"Ripple Labs’ XRP has experienced an impressive rally driven by whales hoarding more coins and increased trader activity. The past 48 hours saw an incredible 13% increase in XRP price, which takes the 7-day increase to 29%. Such a rise has consecutively outperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum, making XRP the best-performing coin for the week within the crypto market. Santiment data shows whale wallets holding over 1 million XRP now control 45.61 billion tokens, the highest level since June 2018. Over two years, these wallets added 3.44 billion XRP, marking an 8.16% increase. This accumulation highlights rising confidence among large investors. The spike in whale activity also comes as the trading volume rose to $12.6 billion over a day. This trend is tied to Ripple’s partial victories in court, which improved overall market sentiment and increased XRP demand . Analysts Project Further Gains for XRP XRP’s breakout has drawn the attention of prominent traders. DonAlt, a veteran crypto analyst, calls XRP a “monthly breakout” opportunity. He identified key resistance levels at $1.50 and $3.60—two and four times its current price. Despite his critical view of XRP’s fundamentals, DonAlt also considers XRP a solid short-term trading opportunity. He expects traders who were around in 2017 to be more familiar with tokens like XRP and Dogecoin, which are popular among retail traders. Mikybull Crypto offers an even more optimistic outlook. He predicts XRP could reach new all-time highs by March 2025, driven by sustained momentum and increased adoption. The technical indicators of XRP demonstrate bullishness. The RSI still sits within the overbought range, suggesting a solid buying zone. This signals a continuation of the bull trend and is further confirmed by a Golden Cross in the daily chart where the 50-day EMA crosses over most recently at around 36,500 to 43,270. Testing critical resistance at the moment, XRP is trading at about $2.41. Analysts will even see XRP at $5 in the near future if this bullish trend continues. On the other hand, a correction might send the price to support at $1.5 or $0.9, respectively, XRP Path to $5 Whale activity and strong trading volumes indicate sustained interest in XRP. Coupled with positive market sentiment and technical signals, the coin is well-positioned to test $5 in the short term. Whether Ripple’s XRP can sustain this momentum depends on broader market trends and investor confidence. The rally reflects a renewed focus on XRP’s market potential. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.4, reflecting a sustained bullish trend as it approaches critical resistance levels.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-03 11:38:33

MicroStrategy is the most prominent name in this, with the company CEO, Michael Saylor, openly advocating Bitcoin buying. Interestingly, this is fueling the MicroStrategy stock price, but the question remains whether the MSTR price can hit $500, especially with the new $1 billion arbitrage earnings. MicroStrategy Stock Price Surged 10% Today With MicroStrategy Earnings MicroStrategy has been undergoing a massive transformation with its Bitcoin buying practices. Saylor even claims that Bitcoin will become the 7% of world capital. The firm now holds 446,000 BTC, worth $42 billion at the current Bitcoin price of $96,500. This institutional buying has also significantly impacted the MicroStrategy stock price, which trades at $300.01 after a 10% surge in the last 24 hours. This surge came with MicroStrategy’s $1B arbitrage earnings , fueling investor demand. Over the past two years, Bitcoin has leveraged bets on MicroStrategy stock price performance. Just recently, Michael Saylor announced MicroStrategy’s earnings, revealing that they have sold $1.5M worth of MSTR stocks and even reinvested $1.5B to buy more Bitcoin. This has resulted in almost $1 billion in arbitrage gains, earning applause from the experts. However, despite today’s recovery, the stock price is still down 44% from its prime of $543, set in November 2024. With that, there’s a lot for this company’s stock to recover, creating concerns about its future performance. Will MicroStrategy Stock Price Hit $500 After $1B Earning? MicroStrategy’s involvement in the Nasdaq 100 list is a pushing factor for the MSTR price. The recent MicroStrategy earnings report is an addition to that, as the stock benefits from its own valuations. In simple terms, the firm raises capital and buys Bitcoin, which increases Bitcoin demand and the company’s valuation. This helps the firm raise more capital, and the process continues. However, it’s not all just games, as there are certain risks around the leverage strategy. Additionally, other factors like the company’s rising debt, S&P 500, and much more impact its performance and will continue to do so, as the firm plans to raise the authorized share count by 10 billion. Regardless Bitcoin still remains the wildcard, as the BTC price rally could help the MicroStrategy stock price achieve the $500 mark. However, as the Bitcoin price struggles to reach around $96,500, it is limiting the stock growth as well. Major analysts believe that the Bitcoin price rally to $120,000 and higher could push the MSTR price moving past the $500k barriers with the wave of traders’ enthusiasm. Bitcoin Buying Has Turned MicroStrategy Stock Into a Volatile Asset Not only has Saylor been advocating for Bitcoin, but he has suggested other corporations to reserve a significant part of their portfolio for this digital asset. However, his beliefs are not limited to that, as he recently drafted the plan to make $81 trillion with Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . However, it is not all praise and appreciation for Saylor’s enthusiasm. Multiple analysts claim that Saylor’s aggressive Bitcoin buying strategy has turned the MSTR stock into a volatile asset, where the MSTR price mirrors the Bitcoin price. More importantly, critics believe that Saylor leveraging the stocks and using debts to buy more Bitcoin is risky, as this could all crash with the Bitcoin price crash. Interestingly, Hartmann Capital founder Felix Hartmann’s MicroStrategy earning prediction has created serious concerns about the firm’s future. He believes that Saylor’s Bitcoin buying strategy could propel the MSTR price to new heights, even making it among the top five biggest organizations (based on market capitalization). However, this could lead to bankruptcy with the Bitcoin price crash. Bottom Line MicroStrategy stock price has decreased from its peak, achieved around two months ago with a Bitcoin price rally. However, ever since then, it has been struggling on the market with broader market concerns. Additionally, the BTC itself has moved past the rally, currently trading around $96.5k. With that, analysts have concluded the direct relation between Bitcoin and MSTR price. Eventually, this is the wildcard for the MSTR stock, so the stock price could hit $500, with the BTC price hitting $120k or higher. However, the recent MicroStrategy earnings could definitely help in this path, as the stock price is already up 10% today.

BlackRock-backed stablecoin receives approval for Frax Finance’s FRX USD. The crypto market shows early signs of recovery in 2025, with Bitcoin and altcoins soaring. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has announced a delay in enforcing new crypto cost-basis reporting rules, pushing the start date to December 31, 2026. This gives brokers more time to adapt to the new regulations. In a recent Thinking Crypto podcast, host Tony Edward analyzed how the rules would have required centralized crypto platforms to provide detailed tax accounting for cryptocurrency transactions. The delay comes after brokers and platforms requested additional time to adjust to the complex regulatory changes. These changes were initially set to begin at the end of 2024. This decision offers temporary relief to crypto investors and platforms, many of whom were rushing to meet the original deadline.

In 2025, it’s planning a game-changing interest rate cut from its current 1.5%. Officials are reportedly embracing orthodox monetary policy like that used by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank. This will prioritize interest rate adjustments as the primary economic lever. The PBoC has confirmed that its new strategy will revolve around the seven-day reverse repo rate. Interest rates to lead China’s transformation The PBoC’s reliance on multiple interest rates and direct instructions to banks on loan expansion has been its signature style. This allowed Beijing to direct loans to booming sectors like manufacturing, technology, and real estate. But internal pressure is mounting for reform. Officials argue that the old methods have overstayed their welcome. A PBoC official reportedly said the bank would transition away from “quantitative objectives” for loan growth, moving to a cleaner and more efficient interest-rate-focused system. “An appropriate time” for the first cut is expected in 2025. It’s a direct response to years of ballooning debt and overcapacity in sectors like steel, which have not only dragged down the domestic economy but also caused disruptions in global markets. The changes won’t come easy. The clash of goals is already creating friction as China’s economy faces a rough patch. In 2024, the PBoC went all out with its most aggressive stimulus package since the pandemic. It cut the seven-day reverse repo rate twice and slashed the five-year mortgage-linked rate three times. These were meant to stabilize the property market and hit President Xi Jinping’s 5% growth target. Whether this gamble will pay off remains to be seen. The yuan takes a hit as markets wobble China’s currency is also under intense pressure. The onshore yuan slipped past the critical 7.3-per-dollar mark for the first time since late 2023. For months, Beijing fought to defend the yuan, with the central bank setting daily reference rates above 7.2 and state banks selling U.S. dollars in bulk. But the effort hasn’t held up against mounting economic troubles. Market watchers say the yuan’s decline was inevitable. The gap between China’s government bond yields and those in the U.S. continues to widen, making the yuan less attractive. The currency fell as low as 7.3174 in onshore trading before stabilizing slightly, while offshore trading saw a similar decline. China’s property crisis, coupled with trade tensions with the U.S., has dampened growth. Meanwhile, Trump’s tariff threats and the lack of a year-end rally in markets have added to the pressure. The absence of a traditional seasonal rebound only amplified concerns. Stock markets stumble, bond yields hit rock bottom China’s equity markets are taking a beating too. The CSI 300 index dropped 1.18% to close at 3,775.16, extending a 2.9% decline from the previous session. Investors are jittery, struggling to decipher Beijing’s signals amid volatile trading. While Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gained a modest 0.42%, the general sentiment remains bleak. Yields are hitting record lows, with the 10-year government bond yield dropping to 1.598% and the 30-year yield falling to 1.819%. Across Asia , markets are reacting to local and global pressures. South Korea’s Kospi index rose 1.79% despite ongoing political drama, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.60%. Meanwhile, U.S. markets opened 2025 on the wrong foot. The Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 all posted losses, leaving investors without the much-anticipated “Santa Claus rally.” And Bitcoin, which also tumbled before, is holding steady above $96k.

The latest SOL price has witnessed a significant surge, reaching $211 as bullish momentum builds in the cryptocurrency market. The top altcoin continues to recover from previous dips, bolstered by strong technical indicators suggesting further upside potential. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) highlights increasing positive momentum, with green bars consistently forming above the zero line. This bullish signal indicates that buyers are regaining control, potentially paving the way for further gains in Solana’s value. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has climbed to 0.25, signaling substantial inflows of capital into SOL. The $200 level has proven to be a critical support zone, maintaining Solana’s recent price gains. Analysts are now watching the $263.83 resistance level, which represents the ATH, as the next significant hurdle. If this level is surpassed, the Solana price forecast could aim for the psychological $280 and $300 targets. However, traders should remain cautious as short-term corrections are possible. This may break below $200 level. Solana Price Chart: TradingView Bitcoin nears the $100K mark , igniting optimism across the cryptocurrency market for potential altcoin rallies.

A pseudonymous security researcher identified a critical vulnerability in the project audited contract, prompting an urgent fix. The company has also relaunched its bug bounty program to prevent future vulnerabilities. Virtuals Protocol Vulnerability Could Block Token Launches: Is This A Smart Contract Bug Or Feature? On December 3, 2024, pseudonymous security researcher Jinu discovered a critical vulnerability in one of Virtuals Protocol’s audited smart contracts. The researcher promptly reported the issue to Virtuals Protocol, but the company did not have an active bug bounty program. Consequently, despite its potential impact on the protocol’s ecosystem, the discovery did not qualify for a reward. After posting on X, I got in touch with the @virtuals_io team. They patched it very quickly. https://t.co/VywvsdFcxV https://t.co/jd3Mmcxq43 — jinu (@lj1nu) January 3, 2025 The vulnerability stemmed from the platform token-launching mechanism on Uniswap V2 has been exposed. The flaw lies in how Virtuals creates token pairs, a process similar to Pump.fun’s method of launching tokens through price thresholds and bonding mechanisms. Security researcher Jinu identified a critical issue that could block Virtuals from launching new tokens. He pointed out that the AgentToken creation process uses the Clones library, which makes future token addresses predictable based on the AgentFactoryV3 contract’s nonce. Additionally, the initialize function in the AgentToken contract calls Uniswap V2’s createPair function without verifying if a pair already exists. If one does, Uniswap V2’s factory reverts the transaction. This flaw also enables the creation of pairs with non-existent contracts. An attacker could exploit this by preemptively creating a Uniswap pair with the predicted nonce, preventing Virtuals from launching its tokens. Jinu demonstrated this exploit using a proof of concept on Tenderly. Jinu recommended modifying the AgentToken.sol contract to check for existing pairs in Uniswap V2 before attempting creation, skipping the process if a pair already exists. Despite the severity of the issue, Virtuals did not respond, even closing its dedicated Discord group meant for reporting vulnerabilities. Jinu expressed frustration at the oversight, remarking, “I’m surprised that a project as big and hot as Virtuals doesn’t care about security.” Virtuals Protocol Appreciate Jinu for Highlighting Flaw: What’s Next for Bug Bounties? Following Jinu’s public disclosure of the issue on X (formerly Twitter), Virtuals Protocol contacted Jinu and implemented a rapid fix. The company acknowledged the bug’s severity and apologized for the initial miscommunication. In a message to Jinu, Virtuals Protocol said: “We have verified the vulnerability and applied a patch. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We apologize for the miscommunication and will review the severity of the issue to determine a bug bounty.” They patched the vulnerability by updating the contract to include the necessary validation steps. For transparency, the new contract and fix details were published on BaseScan and GitHub . However, Virtuals Protocol has yet to confirm the reward amount for Jinu’s discovery. The company stated that it internally assesses the impact of the vulnerability before issuing a bounty.

Seasonality data suggests that ETH could have a great quarter with double or triple-digit gains. However, Ether will need to overcome several important barriers for this to happen. Seasonality Shows Ethereum Price Rises In Q1 Historical data shows that ETH price tends to experience strong gains in the first quarter. According to CoinGlass , since 2017, Ethereum price dropped just in 2018 and 2022. Its best first quarter happened in 2017 when it jumped by 518%. It was then followed by a 160% increase in 2021 and 59% jump in 2024. Notably, the coin’s best first quarters happened when a new president was inaugurated in the United States. Ethereum Seasonality While January has been a good month for Ethereum, February has been better as the coin has averaged 17% gains since 2017. Its only February in the red was in 2018 when it dropped by 24%. Therefore, this historical trend signals potential gains for Ethereum price. Some potential catalysts will be regulations, potential dovish twist by the Federal Reserve, and the upcoming FTX distributions . However, as described below, Ethereum will need to overcome major technical challenges to have a strong performance in Q1. ETH Price Forms A Risky Pattern On Weekly Chart The weekly chart paints a mixed picture for Ethereum price. On the positive side, it has remained above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest levels since May 2022. It has also formed a series of higher highs in the past few years. Ethereum also remains above the Ichimoku cloud and the 50-day moving average. However, it has also formed a risky chart pattern known as a triple-top pattern around the $4,000 level. This pattern is made up of three peaks and a neckline, which in this case, is at $2,145, the lowest point in September last year. As a result, this pattern means that the value of ETH will have a strong bearish breakout in Q1. If this happens, the first target would be the neckline at $2,145, which is about 40% below the current level. On the flip side, a move above the triple-top pattern at $4,000 will increase the odds of ETH soaring to its all-time high at $4,800, followed by $5,000. Ethereum Price Weekly Chart Ether Price Forms A Bearish Pennant on The Daily Chart The daily chart is also sending red alerts for Ethereum price. It initially formed a double-top chart pattern at $4,096 whose neckline was at $3,535. This pattern worked out well as the coin dropped to $3,100 in December. Now, Ethereum has retested the neckline. A break and retest is usually a sign of a continuation. The coin has then slowly formed a bearish pennant pattern. Its flag pole started at $4,100 and the triangle has been forming and is nearing the confluence level. That is a sign that the coin may make a bearish breakout soon, with the initial target being at $3,100. Ethereum Price Daily Chart Ethereum Price Targets ETH has numerous bullish catalysts for Q1. If bulls win, and invalidate the triple-top, it means that the coin will surge and possibly reach the all-time high at $4,800 followed by $5,000. The alternative ETH price prediction is where the triple-top pattern works well and the coin falls to below $3,000.

With the global real estate market valued at around $300 trillion offering exceptional investment opportunities, PropiChain aims to become a transformative player by leveraging its unique combination of AI-powered insights and blockchain technology. Crypto whales, the affluent investors who usually influence market movements, are now converging on PropiChain, keen to access the future of real estate investment. The $300 Trillion Real Estate Sector: A Treasure Trove for Crypto Whales Investors The real estate sector has historically been among the most valuable on a global scale, with an estimated worth of $300 trillion. Although this market is very massive, its innovation has been slow. Conventional real estate investments tend to be burdensome, featuring significant entry hurdles, limited transparency, and dependence on middlemen. Nevertheless, PropiChain is revolutionizing the field by utilizing blockchain technology to establish a transparent, efficient, and accessible real estate ecosystem. This innovation is especially attractive to crypto whales seeking to expand their portfolios into a concrete, asset-supported market that utilizes blockchain technology for improved security and decentralization The Crypto Whale Migration: From Established Blockchains to PropiChain The waves of cryptocurrency investing are changing, and numerous whales are seeking fresh opportunities. As leading blockchain networks flourish, PropiChain’s unique strategy for real estate tokenization is attracting growing interest. This isn’t about losing trust in traditional entities but instead an acknowledgment of the distinct benefits that the platform provides through AI-driven, real-world asset tokenization. For ages now, the real estate market has been dominated by wealthy people, preventing average investors from entering the market. Nonetheless, PropiChain’s model of fractional ownership expands the market to a wider range of investors. By utilizing blockchain technology, the RWA platform converts physical assets into NFTs (non-fungible tokens), allowing users to acquire shares of valuable real estate, thus diversifying their portfolios without requiring substantial capital. Crypto whales find this model appealing because it combines the benefits of blockchain—openness, protection, and decentralization, and asset-backed investment. This investment targets one of the world’s most profitable markets. PropiChain’s Technological Edge: AI, Blockchain, and Real-World Asset Tokenization PropiChain thrives due to its capacity to smoothly merge AI with blockchain technologies, establishing a strong ecosystem for real estate dealings. The platform employs AI to examine large quantities of data, delivering insights into market trends, property valuations, and economic signals. This analytical method allows investors to make knowledgeable choices and enhance their investment strategies. Furthermore, AI streamlines transaction processes, minimizing human mistakes and guaranteeing that all transactions are efficient and economical. A notable aspect of PropiChain is its NFT-driven tokenization mechanism, enabling the transformation of physical properties into digital assets. This innovation not only allows for fractional ownership but also offers liquidity in a market that is usually illiquid. Through PropiChain, investors have the ability to buy and sell ownership stakes in real estate assets on a decentralized blockchain, creating fresh opportunities for growth and diversification. Additionally, the platform’s utilization of the Metaverse—via the immersive “Propiverse”—offers a novel dimension for property exploration. Purchasers and vendors can experience virtual property tours, removing location constraints and enabling better-informed buying choices. The Propiverse introduces an innovative method to real estate that improves the user experience and adds a new level of market transparency. Smart Contracts and Blockchain Transparency PropiChain’s incorporation of smart contracts elevates real estate transactions significantly. Lease contracts, rental fees, and property exchanges are all handled electronically, removing intermediaries and guaranteeing that agreements remain secure from tampering. These smart contracts undergo audits by BlockAudit, introducing a trust layer and guaranteeing accountability for all involved parties. PropiChain’s blockchain framework guarantees that all transactions are logged on a decentralized ledger referred to as the “Title Contract.” This system enhances transparency while also minimizing the likelihood of fraud or disagreements regarding property ownership. PropiChain provides investors with assurance that their transactions are secure and can be verified. A Unique Investment Opportunity: The PCHAIN Token Presale For cryptocurrency investors aiming to enter early, PropiChain’s ongoing token presale presents a thrilling chance. The PCHAIN token is available at a mere $0.011 each during the presale, making it a very appealing investment choice for crypto whales. Having raised more than $2 million thus far, PropiChain’s presale is attracting notable attention, and forecasts indicate that the token might experience an increase of up to 25,000% by 2025, positioning it as one of the most profitable investment prospects in the cryptocurrency market. PropiChain has a total supply limit of 1.5 billion tokens, with a significant share designated for the presale, indicating that initial investors can reap considerable rewards as the platform develops and attracts attention. With its distinctive blend of AI, blockchain, and practical asset utility, PropiChain is set to transform the real estate industry and draw in more crypto whales looking for valuable, cutting-edge investment options. The token continues gaining traction, evidenced by its recent listing on CoinMarketCap . Final Thoughts: PropiChain’s Future in the $300 Trillion Real Estate Market PropiChain is gaining popularity as a distinctive platform for cryptocurrency investors by integrating cutting-edge blockchain technology with the immense $300 trillion real estate sector. It seeks to transform real estate investment, drawing in crypto whales interested in novel, asset-backed prospects utilizing blockchain and AI. With its reliable, clear, and effective framework, PropiChain is set to transform the industry. The current token presale offers a unique opportunity for early participants to get involved in this thrilling new project at the crossroads of cryptocurrency and real estate.

What defines Yeti Ouro is its focus on the community and the long term. Tokens are limited to 1 billion, combined with a presale that has already accumulated a large amount of capital, Yeti Ouro is looking to be a high-potential asset for initial adopters. Ethereum Price Prediction: The Backbone Of Decentralized Applications The Ethereum ecosystem continues to be an essential part of the crypto realm, powering 1000’s DApps, DeFi protocols, NFTs, and more. Ethereum’s switch to proof-of-stake as a consensus mechanism has enhanced scalability and eco-friendliness, and analysts are bullish. 1-month Ethereum price chart- source: CoinMarketCap The key drivers behind Ethereum’s expected $10,000 milestone are: Layer 2 Scaling Solutions: Arbitrum and Optimism are scaling Ethereum, allowing for faster transactions at a lower cost. Institutional Adoption: Large financial institutions are investigating Ethereum for tokenized assets and blockchain solutions. Developer Activity: Thousands of developers are building on Ethereum, and its ecosystem keeps growing. While Ethereum has proven its worth with Ethereum price trading currently at $3463 , the slower transactions and higher fees can sometimes be looked at as hurdles, creating a space that aspirations like Yeti Ouro can use to create their path. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Targeting $27 By 2025 XRP is another leading contender in the news. It has been gaining attention from financial institutions around the world for its use as a bridge currency for cross-border payments. Ripple’s recent wins against the SEC have only cemented investors’ confidence, with some speculating for XRP price to reach $27 in 2025. 1-month XRP price chart- source: CoinMarketCap Here are some of the reasons behind XRP’s growth: International Alliances: Ripple has formed partnerships with various banks and payment service providers from different parts of the world. Regulatory clarity: Positive developments in the legal battle have boosted market sentiment Network Effectiveness: The speed and cost-effectiveness of XRP transactions have made it a go-to for remittance services. Whereas XRP is more bank-focused, Yeti Ouro has cast a wider net with a more compelling gaming platform that is more retail and gaming-focused. Conclusion: Yeti Ouro’s Unique Position In The Market As Ethereum and XRP have positioned themselves at the forefront of the industry, Yeti Ouro is climbing the ranks of the crypto landscape rapidly. This unique strategy, along with its deflationary tokenomics aspect and community-led expansion, makes it a high-potential altcoin.

But this retracement and rangebound movement is reminiscent of the 2017 consolidation. If history repeats then XRP price could hit $20 in before January 31, 2025, and how Ripple ETF affects the short-term outlook. Can XRP Price Hit $20 Before January 31? In the second quarter of 2017, XRP price rose 1,200% and slipped into consolidation for the next 24 days. This price action is similar to what’s happening now. Ripple bulls triggered a 600% rally, which was followed by a 28-day consolidation that ended with a 12% rally on January 1. Due to the similarity of these moves, one can assume that even if history rhymes, it could lead to another parabolic ascent for XRP token. The chart below shows that Ripple price repeats 2017’s move, it could roughly hit a peak of $20 after a 711% rally in less than three weeks, aka, before the end of January 31. XRP Fractal 2017 vs. 2025 While history does provide a good framework, the XRP ETF could be the proper catalyst required to trigger such an exponential rally. Spot Ripple ETF: A Bullish Catalyst for Ripple According to Polymarket data, there are two polls regarding a spot Ripple ETF approval. The first one speculates on an XRP ETF approval by July 31, 2025 and the other with the same speculation but by the end of 2025. The latter shows there’s a 70% chance that a spot Ripple ETF will be approved by the end of 2025. Ripple ETF Approval Odds Regardless of whether an ETF is approved, let’s look at the short-term outlook of XRP price using technical analysis and forecast key support, resistance levels & potential targets for January 2025. XRP Technical Analysis & Price Targets XRP price action over the past five weeks has shown the formation of a bull flag. This technical formation is a bullish continuation setup that has a massive parabolic rally termed as flag pole and the consolidation in a parallel channel that ensues termed as flag. The target for this setup is obtained by adding the flag’s height to the breakout point. In this case, the flag’s height is 108%, adding this to the breakout point reveals an optimistic target of roughly $4. But adding this measure to the bottom of the flag shows a conservative target of $3.42. XRP/USDT 1-day chart Despite XRP showing strength in the past few weeks, if Bitcoin loses key support level of $90,000, it could trigger a sell-off for crypto markets. Hence, investors must keep a close eye on BTC’s price action. A breakdown of $2 support level for XRP could spell disaster and catalyze a 25% correction to roughly $1.47.

Many speculate that Tether’s compliance with Europe’s MiCA regulations could trigger a market crash. However, the narrative may be overblown according to Michael Van de Poppe. Revisiting Tether’s History and Profitability Tether, often a target of skepticism, has faced allegations of being a “bubble” or engaging in opaque practices. Despite the criticism, Van de Poppe noted that Tether reported over $5 billion in net profits in the first half of 2024, highlighting its robust financial health. The company claims to be fully backed and over-collateralized, but critics point to its lack of transparency as a persistent issue. MiCA (Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation) introduces strict rules for stablecoins operating in Europe, emphasizing investor protection and financial stability. While Tether has chosen not to comply with MiCA, it has invested in the euro-pegged stablecoin issuer Stably, which meets regulatory requirements. This move allows Tether to maintain its presence in the U.S. and MENA regions while avoiding European regulatory hurdles. Market Sentiment Around Tether As exchanges in Europe adapt to MiCA, many have proactively delisted USDT in favor of USDC or euro pairs. While competitors like Circle’s USDC have gained market share, some experts argue that fears about USDT’s future are exaggerated. Analysts suggest that while this transition may cause temporary liquidity issues, a market crash is unlikely. Instead, the fear-driven selling could present buying opportunities for altcoins at discounted prices. Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, urged supporters to ignore misinformation, labeling competitors’ claims as baseless. Tether has been preparing for MiCA, even halting its EURT stablecoin to comply with future regulations while investing in other EU operations. Crypto lawyer Jonathan Galea clarified that not meeting MiCA compliance doesn’t make Tether illegal, but the rules could limit market liquidity if enforced too strictly. Importantly, Tether’s focus on Asia, where most of its trading occurs, means the European market’s impact is limited. Altcoin Predictions 2025 Van de Poppe’s on altcoin predictions for 2025 suggests that the current market negativity presents a unique opportunity to accumulate altcoins at cycle lows. He notes that Bitcoin’s correction and outflows from its ETFs are typical year-end portfolio rebalancing by asset managers, with inflows expected in January. Ethereum, however, is holding strong against Bitcoin, showing signs of upward momentum, and yet it remains undervalued. Van de Poppe highlights Optimism and SEI as promising altcoins, with potential rebounds early in the year, and emphasizes that XRP’s correction is a natural retracement. He dismisses the bearish sentiment around Tether as overblown, suggesting the market is primed for a reversal in January, offering a favorable entry point for long-term gains.",News|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|USDT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-03 12:01:13

Ripple (XRP) is now making some waves in this environment. Its value is rising on the charts. Even some market analysts like XRP Whale have made a bullish price prediction for this altcoin. But simultaneously, a new coin is starting to steal the attention. That coin is Remittix (RTX) – an altcoin that could become the “Next XRP” as it aims to revolutionize the cross-border payments market. Many early buyers of this presale star think that RTX could be set for 5,800% gains in 2025, making it a promising project. XRP Whale: The Price of Ripple (XRP) Could Reach $2.90 Ripple (XRP) is one of the top 10 altcoins. CoinMarketCap shows its value has jumped over 10% in the past week alone. In other words, the Ripple price moved from around $2.10 to over $2.40 in just a few short days. Crypto analyst and Ripple (XRP) enthusiast, XRP Whale also excited the community recently. According to his X post , this altcoin may see a price surge to $2.90 soon. This Ripple price prediction has made waves in the market as this token has not reached this level since 2018. The technical analysis of the Ripple coin supports this statement. TradingView shows that this crypto coin is currently valued above its 10-day EMA ($2.22). Furthermore, its weekly momentum indicator sits at 1.86, which is in the buy zone and suggests an upswing ahead. Remittix (RTX) Gets the “Next XRP” Tag Amid Price Surge As Ripple (XRP) rides a bullish wave right now, Remittix (RTX) is also making a lot of noise in the crypto space. This altcoin has already given early buyers nearly a 15% return while raising over $1M in its ongoing presale. Since the presale is still in its early stages, this percentage is bound to increase. Interest in Remittix is rising as it plans to redefine the cross-border payments market. Statista predicts that this market will be worth $290T by 2030. Remittix will launch a crypto-to-fiat platform where people will swap over 40 crypto currencies into fiat currencies to capture a piece of this profit. Some of these currencies will include EUR and GBP. Afterward, these payments could be sent to any global bank account without indicating they started as crypto coins. The RTX token will power this platform. Holding it will allow users to vote on important decisions for the future of Remittix while getting staking rewards (ranging from 4% to 8%). Due to these benefits, investors are now rushing to buy this altcoin while its price is low. RTX costs just $0.0172, but the next batch of tokens will cost $0.0177. Furthermore, investors are waiting for a top-tier crypto exchange like Uniswap to list RTX, which may lead to a massive spike. Ripple (XRP) vs. Remittix (RTX) – Which Altcoin May See Higher Price Growth? Ripple (XRP) and Remittix (XRP) are altcoins to watch as they could soon see big price gains. However, one of them may stand out – Remittix. This project will have a smaller market cap than XRP while bringing groundbreaking technology to this sector. As a result, RTX will need less money for its price to grow while potentially seeing more adoption. Due to all these factors, RTX could be one of the best altcoins to buy this cycle, as a 5,800% spike could come.

Should you be buying them? An honest evaluation of two of the strongest community altcoins. When one looks at the fundamentals for $ADA and $XRP, one of the biggest plusses for the teams behind them, as well as investors and traders looking to buy, is the massive size and fervent support of their communities. However, is this enough to push these cryptocurrencies higher? $ADA breaks out - up 12% on Friday Source: TradingView Following a long period of downward price action throughout almost the entirety of 2024, the price of $ADA (ADA/USDT) experienced a large bounce from the support at $0.00000470, which took it 193% higher in the period of just a month. A correction followed, where the price retraced a healthy 40%. Over the last three days, the price has broken out again and is currently heading higher, up 12% so far on Friday. Is $ADA a zombie? Source: TradingView However, it’s in the weekly time frame that prospective investors ought to be looking. If this was a stock company, the term ‘zombie company’ might spring to mind. When seen on this scale, the recent bounce did not even make a higher high in the series of lower highs and lows that have been evidenced since 2021. If one looks at the Stochastic RSI (momentum indicator), all the short term time frames have topped out, and the weekly and 2-weekly are both coming down. Potential short time frame rejection for $XRP Source: TradingView $XRP (XRP/USDT) in the short-term chart looks as though it might be about to be rejected from the descending trendline that began at the last local high. As can be seen by the Fibonacci levels, the descending trendline also coincides with the 0.618 level, which is a standard level for a retracement to take place. Limited upside for $XRP? Source: TradingView The weekly view for $XRP shows a hugely better picture than that for $ADA. However, the vast bulk of market structure is at much lower levels, and $XRP is spiking in the bull markets instead of climbing steadily, which is not a healthy look. The price looks as though it might have topped out now, with candle bodies closing just at the 0.786 Fibonacci. That said, the 0.618 has been successfully retested. If Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market continue to go up, then why not $XRP? Much better buys out there In summary, $ADA looks to be in a nasty downtrend. Only a higher high above $0.00001570 could start a turn around. On the other hand, $XRP is still riding high. That said, is it really worth buying given that upside is probably now a lot more limited? There are much better options in the crypto market.

The sudden bearish reversal happens as a blockchain security researcher exposed a reported security vulnerability that the Virtuals team ignored. Namely, jinu (@lj1nu) went to X between January 2 and 3 to publicly report a security vulnerability he found while “quickly looking” at the Virtuals Protocol code. The public report, however, was only necessary after jinu’s private reporting being ignored by the team in their Discord server. “They [Virtuals] seem to have been audited, but when I contacted them, the team replied that they were not running a bug bounty. And they closed the discord channel I created to report the vulnerability.” This is not ideal nor the open-source software standard way to deal with a reported threat, raising alerts and concerns. “I’m surprised that a project as big and hot as @virtuals_io doesn’t care about security,” concluded the researcher. Leading AI crypto Virtuals Protocol’s security vulnerability explained Interestingly, another security expert, 33Audits (@solidityauditor) revealed that he and “a few others” tried to report the same issue before, just to get “booted” from both the Discord and Telegram official servers. tried to report this along with a few others and they booted me from the discord and stopped answering on tg. they don’t give af — 33Audits (@solidityauditor) January 3, 2025 Yet, in a follow-up comment , jinu explained that Virtuals team quickly fixed the reported security vulnerability after his post’s success. The expert shared the now repaired source code and also the new contract address, now allegedly secured. “They patched it very quickly,” he said. In summary, the vulnerability allowed attackers to predict and create a Uniswap V2 token pair before Virtuals did. This could prevent the protocol from properly launching new tokens. If someone else creates the pair first, Virtuals can’t proceed with the launch after reaching a certain price-threshold in the platform. Essentially, the token creation uses a predictable method, allowing attackers to act first. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) price crash As of this writing, VIRTUAL is trading at $4.29, crashing 7.19% in the last 24 hours. The token traded as low as $4.10 while the problem remained, now slightly recovering after the apparent fix. According to a Finbold report Yesterday, the AI crypto scene is experiencing a massive surge , surpassing the $10 billion total market cap. In the last seven days, VIRTUAL accumulates 30% gains, but investors and traders are now dealing with fear, uncertainty, and doubt ( FUD ), regarding the recent events.

The realized price is the average value of all bitcoin calculated at the price at which the tokens last moved on-chain. While that value is around $41,000 for BTC since its inception in 2009, for coins bought last year it was around $65,901 by Dec. 31. With the market price closing around $93,000, 2024's buyers were, on average, looking at unrealized profit of around 40%. Monitoring the realized price is important to understanding individual participants' overall profit or loss and cost basis. It means bitcoin would have to slump some 31% for last year's investors to return to break-even price levels. The U.S. spot-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) debuted on Jan. 11, close enough to the start of the year that this is a good approximation of their cost basis. There's another reason to monitor the level. When the bitcoin price dropped below the 2024 realized price, it has tended to mark a local bottom in bitcoin price. That occurred once in January, after the launch of the ETFs, and several times in the middle of the year. Monitoring the cost basis of the 2024 cohort would have been a profitable trading strategy.As we enter 2025, the average cost basis is around $95,500, which puts the buyer at a slight profit as we start the year. As of press time, bitcoin is trading at over $96,000. In addition, historically, the realized price offers a great support level for bitcoin in bear markets and rarely trades below it.",Markets|realized price|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-03 12:12:06

Still in its ICO phase, $FXG has provoked comments from analysts and experts due to this strategic rotation, some of which include predictions of a potential 200% surge in the token’s value by quarter two of 2025. Read to find out if the presale token, $FXG, can soar 200% by the projected time frame. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE ERC 7683 To Catalyze Ethereum L2 Unification In 2025 The Ethereum network is on the verge of a significant upgrade with the imminent launch of the ERC 7683 in 2025. This cross-chain standard will unify Ethereum-based layer-2 networks, making them interoperable beyond Superchain and other solutions. FigoETH, an X user, disclosed this update in an X post on December 26, 2024, noting that with the ERC 7683, a hard fork won’t be required for Ethereum to achieve L2 unification and interoperability. Currently, L2 networks like Optimism, Arbitrum, Taiko, Unichain, and Polygon are on board. The ERC 7683 will improve ETH network users’ experiences tenfold. Users can transfer non-fungible tokens (NFTs) from Arbitrum to Optimism and swap tokens on Polygon for those on Base. All operations on the Ethereum network will be routinized among these chains, creating a unified framework for cross-chain interactions. Despite this announcement, ETH has barely moved, with a 0.38% gain this week at $3,393 , causing investors to turn to $FXG. Ripple Set To Release 1 Billion Coins Into Circulation On January 1, 2025 Ripple, the mother company to XRP, is preparing to release a fresh batch of XRP into circulation on January 1, 2025. This imminent iteration will see Ripple dole out 1 billion XRP into the market. Based on the asset’s current valuation, that is $2 billion of the Ripple-owned coin entering the market. Per schedule, these XRP coins will be released in three batches: 200 million XRP, 300 million XRP, and 500 million XRP. These tokens comprise 1.74% of XRP’s 57.25 billion circulating supply and 2.63% of the remaining 36 billion XRP sitting in Ripple’s escrow accounts. Ripple will use the XRP Ledger escrow mechanism to manage this unlock. While it is certain this unlock will impact XRP’s market price, it remains to be seen how. Due to this uncertainty, whales are shifting to $FXG. In the meantime, XRP trades at $2.08 , down 4.61% this week. FXGuys Prop Firm Introduces Trader Development Programs FXGuys is one of the new DeFi launches making rounds in the crypto space by offering solutions that address long-standing problems in the financial market. However, its trader development programs, which will be accessible after its official launch, have called significant attention to the prop firm. These include a funding program, a trade2earn initiative, and a staking mechanism. They will help traders realize their financial goals through trading. The FX Guys trader funding program is an initiative that offers traders capital to trade any financial instrument they want. First, they need to pass specific trading challenges. Afterward, they will receive up to $500,000 as capital, with an allowance to keep 80% of the profits. The FX Guys Trade2Earn program will incentivize them for every trade to ensure their continuous market participation. For this, $FXG tokens will be sent to their wallets after executing a trade, adding to the presale token’s utility. Another thing FXGuys users can do with their $FXG tokens is stake them in the prop firm’s liquidity pool for passive rewards. $FXG holders can earn double-digit APYs by simply staking their tokens. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG Eyes 200% Surge By Q2 2025 As Presale Token Gains Adoption A 200% rally is on the horizon for $FXG as whale investors increase their stakes in the presale token. A recent report shows that $FXG has generated over $3.2 million in its ongoing presale. This presale is in Stage 2, with $FXG selling for $0.04. With the next stage right around the corner, investors can make a quick 25% profit when $FXG hits $0.05. Meanwhile, $FXG is projected to launch at $0.10, which could see investors realize 150% of their capital and more after its exchange debut. However, the secret is to buy the presale token now to cash in on this opportunity.

The price of BTC reached a new all-time high (ATH) on December 16 — the leading digital asset briefly traded above $106,000, before receding below the $100,000 mark. On the whole, 2024 saw BTC prices increase by 119.03% in 2024. Since that high, Bitcoin has found a strong level of support at $92,600 and is currently struggling to stay above $95,000 consistently. At press time, the digital asset was changing hands at a price of $96,800 — having marked a modest 2.53% uptick since January 1. BTC price 1-year and year-to-date (YTD) charts. Source: Finbold Up to now, overall sentiment has been rather bullish — but an increasing number of investors are deciding to lock in their gains. While that would not necessarily constitute a bearish signal on its own, the asset’s short-interest ratio has also seen a remarkable surge since the start of 2025. Are Bitcoin investors preparing for another pullback? On the last day of 2024, some 67.1% of Bitcoin positions were long — with a still notable minority of positions, 32.9%, to be exact being, short bets, per data retrieved by Finbold from Binance . By press time on January 3, the situation had changed significantly — at present, only 53.4% of open positions are long — while Bitcoin short interest had risen to 46.6%. While the market hasn’t turned entirely bearish, the long/short ratio has dropped from 2.04 to 1.15 in a matter of days — and at this pace, short positions could outweigh long positions in a very short timeframe. Bitcoin short interest chart. Source: Binance Readers should note, however, that even an indicator as clear as the long/short ratio never provides the full picture. In comparison to previous market cycles, Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) has yet to peak, per noted technical analyst Ali Martinez , who also noted the recent increase in short interest in a January 3 X post . Institutional investors like BlackRock (NYSE: BLK ) have retained their bullish outlook on the pioneering cryptocurrency — and so have popular investors such as Robert Kiyosaki. While the long-term prospects of Bitcoin might be intact, further short-term moves are not out of the question. The market could be shifting into alt season — so investors and traders should consider looking into smaller digital assets — at least until Bitcoin’s uptrend resumes.

Following the acquisition, the entity has been rebranded as Coinbase Financial Services Europe. This move expands Coinbase’s presence in Europe and aligns with its strategy to enhance its offerings and regulatory compliance across the region. Yorick Naeff, the CEO of BUX, also confirmed the deal, saying: “We are pleased with the sale of our MiFID licensed entity, BUX Europe Limited (BEU) to Coinbase, a globally recognised leader in the crypto industry.” With the latest acquisition, Coinbase now holds a Cyprus Investment Firm (CIF) license, which authorizes it to offer contracts for differences (CFDs) products. Furthermore, the crypto exchange can passport this Cyprus license to provide financial products across other European Economic Area (EEA) member states. The Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) registry has confirmed that the domain “coinbase.com/international-exchange/europe” has been approved by the regulator, although it is not yet operational. Notably, Coinbase appears to be targeting professional and institutional clients with its offerings under the Cyprus license. Coinbase’s interest in BUX’s Cyprus entity seems to center on acquiring the license and operational infrastructure rather than maintaining the previous client base. BUX had previously transferred its CySEC clients over to AvaTrade, another provider of CFDs. The acquisition was concluded in October 2024.

The lawsuit, submitted to a California district court on December 31, 2024, alleges that the banks failed to perform basic compliance checks, enabling fraudsters to exploit their systems. The case stems from what Liem’s attorneys describe as a “ pig butchering scam,” a sophisticated fraud where victims are groomed over time before being coerced into fraudulent investments. According to the lawsuit, Liem was contacted via LinkedIn in June 2023 and persuaded to transfer funds to accounts at Hong Kong’s Fubon Bank and Chong Hing Bank, as well as Singapore’s DBS Bank . These funds were then funneled into third-party accounts controlled by the scammers. Liem’s legal team argues that the banks neglected their duties under Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations, failing to identify red flags that could have prevented the fraud. Banks Allegedly Complicit in Crypto Scam Activities The lawsuit further accuses the banks of violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, which mandates financial institutions to maintain detailed transaction records and report suspicious activity. Liem’s attorneys claim the banks “turned a blind eye” to the illicit transfer of funds from the United States to Asian entities, facilitating the crypto scam. Specific Hong Kong-based entities—Richou Trade, FFQI Trade, Xibing, and Weidel—are also named in the lawsuit. These entities allegedly misrepresented the purpose of the funds, claiming they were for cryptocurrency investments while diverting them to unauthorized accounts. The lawsuit contends that DBS Bank’s California branch and the involvement of U.S. bank Wells Fargo in processing the transactions establish jurisdiction under U.S. law. Liem’s legal team is seeking a jury trial and a minimum of $3 million in damages. Call for Accountability The case underscores growing concerns about the role of financial institutions in combating cryptocurrency fraud. Liem’s attorneys have criticized the banks for their apparent lack of due diligence, arguing that even basic checks would have exposed the accounts’ suspicious nature. As of now, the accused banks—Fubon Bank, Chong Hing Bank, and DBS Bank—have not responded to the lawsuit.

It’s the largest withdrawal the fund has seen since its blockbuster launch earlier this year. This wasn’t a one-off either—Thursday was actually the third straight day of outflows, the longest losing streak for a fund that started 2024 as the darling of institutional investors. IBIT has brought in $37 billion in new cash since its January debut. It even helped push Bitcoin to a historic all-time high of $108,315 in mid-December. But just a few weeks later, the ETF is bleeding money as Bitcoin’s rally takes a breather. Source: Bloomberg The apex crypto now trades at $96,421 (an 11% drop from its ATH) and the broader group of U.S. based Bitcoin ETFs has seen $2 billion in net outflows since December 19. Adding to the pressure, Bitcoin futures contracts on the CME Group—a key indicator of institutional demand—have dropped 20% since their December peak. BlackRock’s long road to Bitcoin domination Larry Fink, BlackRock’s CEO, once dismissed Bitcoin as a tool for money laundering. In 2017, during an infamous interview with CNBC, he compared Bitcoin’s frenzy to the Dutch tulip mania. By 2018, he doubled down, saying that BlackRock’s clients “had zero interest in crypto,” calling for more regulation in the industry. But things started to change a bit in 2019. BlackRock quietly began building its digital asset strategy, bringing on Robbie Mitchnick, a former Ripple exec, to head the division. A year later, the company made its first big crypto play, investing in Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin. By 2022, BlackRock was all in. It partnered with Coinbase, allowing institutional clients to trade crypto through its Aladdin platform, and later announced a spot Bitcoin trust designed specifically for institutional investors. Then came 2024 when the SEC approved IBIT. Within weeks of its debut, the ETF became the first spot Bitcoin fund to hit $1 billion in trading volume. By October, it managed $30 billion in assets, holding over 417,000 Bitcoin—roughly 2% of the total supply.

Nevertheless, a rival has appeared in the crypto landscape, Rexas Finance (RXS). Rexas can make crypto investors turn their heads because of its features and successful presale. Under the price of $0.2, RXS has already started viral trends and is on its way to overtaking Dogecoin. Let's take a closer look at why Rexas Finance might be able to overtake Dogecoin and if the former will even compete with the latter. Dogecoin (DOGE): The First in the Family of Meme Coins Trading actively at $0.3103 and boasting a market cap of 45.73 billion dollars, Dogecoin has been both one of the oldest and one of the biggest coins ever to do it. The completeness and scope of cultural context shifts have enabled it to become a popular cryptocurrency brand with retail capital. The DOGE price chart on the weekly time frame shows a rounding bottom, an indicator of bullish reversal patterns. In most instances, this pattern is regarded as the signal marking the end of the downtrend, the start of a renewed interest in buying, and the chances of a rise in price. Analysts believe DOGE may seek to target the $1 region. Although Dogecoin is a fundamental player in the ecosystem today, doubts about its future usefulness and value are mainly concentrated on its overreliance on social media and celebrities. Here, Rexas Finance comes into play with a more straightforward and novel expansion solution. Rexas Finance (RXS): The New Viral Contender Rexas Finance has quickly grabbed the interest of the crypto community owing to its presale achievements and distinctive characteristics. The presale of RXS began at $0.03 and has now endured up to $0.175, enabling it to accumulate over $34 million with the sale of more than 385 million tokens. This remarkable performance underlines the readily available demand for RXS and investors' readiness towards its future prospects. While meekly by its meme origins, Rexas Finance encompasses a standout message with its extensive tokenomics and the project's utility. The project allocates 42.5% of its total supply to presale as a technique to create opportunities for early investors to purchase the tokens. Furthermore, 22.5% of the supply has been set aside for staking purposes, thereby assisting in long-term holding and curbing excesses in the market. Rexas Finance also commits 15% of tokens to liquidity, ensuring ease of trading on the exchanges. The credibility of Rexas Finance is integrally linked to the projects. The project possesses a CertiK audit clearance, meaning the project is secure and the most reliable on the market. The project got listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, which increased the visibility of the project, making it plausible in anticipation of RXS values in the market. In addition, what makes Rexas Finance different from a wide range of assets that rely on speculation, such as Dogecoin, is the token's functionality, thanks to Rexas Finance’s unique experience of asset tokenization. The Case for Rexas Finance as a Competitor to Dogecoin While Dogecoin is a product with a cheap appeal and self-propagating hype, Rexas Finance complements it with much-needed functionalities and advantages. Such characteristics of focus on transparency, security, and innovation make it a project that can be relevant over a longer period of time. That single aspect of converting real-world problems through asset tokenization facilitates Rexas Finance in transcending the meme coin realm by adding real value for its consumers. Rexas Finance generates hype early in the project while also creating demand in the later stages of implementation. One of the project's major giveaways is a one-million-dollar giveaway, where 20 people receive RXS worth $50,000 each. This culture encourages the community to stick with and grow the project, making it easier to convince early adopters. Westi's announcement of projects involving RXS makes Rexas Finance a good competitor against Dogecoin. Consistent social media tides or support from well-known public figures have been the main drivers of Dogecoin’s popularity since its inception. Being better structured with an understanding of its key utility and offering value can help Rexas Finance maintain its prospects. Conclusion For a long time, Dogecoin has been in the crypto space, offering its investors availability and standalone amusement. However, with the change in market dynamics, new competitors like Rexas Finance are starting to challenge that. Thanks to its unique tokenomics and selling strategy, particularly during presale and utility focus, Rexas Finance seems like a believable substitute for the meme coin behemoth. Analysts predict that Dogecoin will improve by a small margin in 2025. On the other hand, Rexas Finance's social commencement and systematic tactics could set it up for unfettered increases, which will be favorable for investors looking for good returns. In the interesting duel of the two coins, what is very clear is that Rexas Finance provides a new wave of rivalry in the industry, complete with fresh opportunities that could change the outlook for tokens selling below 20 cents. Switching to Rexas Finance or sticking with Dogecoin will be largely determined by an investor's targets, portfolio, and preferences. For those that value culture with a community interest, Dogecoin still seems to be a good option; while Rexas Finance supports taking a vision-oriented approach, either of these choices is made; it clearly explains the wide range of opportunities the crypto space is full of.

Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart On the daily chart, the asset has been struggling to climb back above the $100K resistance level after dropping below it earlier in December. Yet, the price has been supported from the $92K support level several times, which could indicate that the market is making a bottom to rally toward a new high above the $100K resistance level. In this case, the $110K mark could be the next potential target for the largest cryptocurrency. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart clearly shows the BTC price action over the past few weeks. The market has broken an ascending channel to the downside and retested the pattern’s lower boundary a couple of times. However, the $92K support zone has prevented a deeper drop. With the RSi also rising above the 50% threshold again, market momentum can be considered bullish, and the price could soon break the $100K resistance level to the upside and begin a new rally higher. On-Chain Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Short-Term Holder SOPR While Bitcoin’s price has been consolidating around the $100K level, investors have debated whether the bull run is over. This uncertainty can be observed by looking at holders’ behavior during the recent week. This chart presents the short-term holder SOPR metric, which measures the ratio of profits realized by short-term holders. As the chart shows, the STH SOPR has been on a decline after a rapid rise during the market’s last rally. This indicates that a wave of profit realization has occurred recently, as Bitcoin hit the key $100K level. The resulting selling pressure by short-term holders has probably been one of the primary reasons Bitcoin failed to continue its rally higher. Yet, as the price is still holding above the $90K mark, it is evident that there is still sufficient demand to hold the market and even push it higher in the coming weeks.

Daily Crypto News Digest,https://cryptonews.com/news/whats-happening-in-crypto-today-daily-crypto-news-digest/,"In crypto news today: Crypto market is green today Bitcoin Hitting $225,000 in 2025? Non-Crypto Companies Find Stablecoins ‘Attractive’ US Leads in Bitcoin Mining __________ Crypto market is green today The crypto market has shifted slightly over the past day but still remains in the green territory. The global cryptocurrency market capitalization fell 1% over the past 24 hours to $3.53 trillion. At the time of writing, the daily crypto trading volume is $145 billion. Approximately a third of the top 100 coins per market cap is down today – compared to yesterday’s one. Additionally, five of the top 10 coins are down today. Binance Coin (BNB) fell the most: 1.8% to $698.39. At the same time, Cardano (ADA) saw the highest rise: 11.2% to $1.05. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) remain unchanged at the prices of $96,188 and $3,430, respectively. Read more below. You might also like Why Is Crypto Up Today? Bitcoin Hitting $225,000 in 2025? In crypto news today, Bitcoin may see its current price more than double this year thanks to the rising institutional adoption and regulatory clarity, according to investment firm H.C. Wainwright , as reported by CNBC. In a note to investors on 2 January, the company raised the price target from $145,000, a 130% increase. This implies a total market capitalization of $4.5 trillion, which would be about 25% of gold’s total market cap. “Based on our analysis of historical price cycles and recent price action, along with the widely-held expectation for a more favorable regulatory environment for the digital assets industry in the US in 2025 under the new administration, the availability of spot ETF products in the US, and accelerating institutional investor and corporate adoption, we now estimate that BTC will reach $225,000 per coin by the end of 2025,” H.C. Wainwright analyst Mike Colonnese said. Historically, BTC’s price has been correlated to global liquidity, which has been on a downtrend since October. Therefore, Colonnese argued, “BTC could retrace back down to the mid-$70,000 range in early 1Q25 before resuming its uptrend.” The company also said that there is a 60% chance that the US would establish a national strategic BTC reserve in 2025, which would certainly push the price higher. Bitcoin’s price could “significantly exceed” even the new target if the US implements Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset this year, the analyst added. Non-Crypto Companies Find Stablecoins ‘Attractive’ 2025 is set to see an increase in stablecoin users, as well as in the competition between the issuers, insiders argued. Stablecoin market capitalization currently stands at $204.697 billion, according to DeFiLlama . The Tether (USDT) dominance is 67. 24%. Per industry veterans, stablecoins are a more attractive vehicle into digital assets for non-crypto companies. Stablecoins allow these companies to “get into crypto without touching the risky aspects of securities and scammy parts,” Anna Yuan, founder of stablecoin project Perena , told Bloomberg. Johann Kerbrat, crypto general manager at Robinhood , added that it’s clear that stablecoins have “tons of value” from the fact that the platform sees “a lot” of money moving between Robinhood and market makers or other entities. Source: DeFiLlama Rob Hadick, a general partner at digital-asset venture firm Dragonfly , said that the team saw “significant growth in demand” from some of the largest global companies that are active in under-served payment verticals, such as global contractor and employee payouts, trade finance, and remittance.” “There is both significant demand from end users in receiving US dollars, which can be near impossible using non-stablecoin rails, but also from senders who want to bypass the correspondent banking system, which can be slow, costly, and have high failure rates,” Hadick said. Furthermore, Augustus Ilag, investment partner and head of Asia at CMT Digital , described these coins as an attractive business model. Companies launching stablecoins gain a new revenue stream and an addition for businesses looking to diversify their offerings. US Leads in Bitcoin Mining In other crypto news today, analysts noted that the Bitcoin mining ecosystem “shifted dramatically” in 2024. According to the latest Miner Weekly report by BlocksBridge Consulting , the US has taken the lead in this space. The report pointed out that the mainstream media reports used to promote FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) about five Chinese pools controlling more than 50% of Bitcoin’s hashrate. However, China banned mining in 2021, leaving an enormous empty space for the US to fill. By December 2024, Foundry and MARA Pool – both US pools – accounted for 38.5% of all Bitcoin blocks mined. Source: Miner Weekly This is an increase from 32.4% seen at the start of the year and 18% in January 2022. “This percentage doesn’t even account for U.S.-based hashrate connected to smaller pools like Luxor, which mines about 1.5% of bitcoin blocks with 60-80% of its hashrate from U.S. customers,” the report said. Also, some international pools are contributing several percent to the US-based total. Meanwhile, Foundry’s hashrate grew exponentially over 2024, widening its lead over Antpool by nearly 100%, said the researchers. __________ Bookmark this page and subscribe to our newsletter for the latest crypto news updates!

This development comes as the SEC faces a potential major overhaul following Donald Trump’s election victory. Elon Musk, who has had his clashes with the SEC, recently described the agency as a “weaponized institution doing political dirty work.” This statement resonated strongly with Garlinghouse and the broader crypto community, particularly as Ripple fights accusations of selling XRP as an unregulated security. Notably, Musk’s comments came just after last month’s Fifth Circuit Court ruling, which criticized the SEC for overstepping its mandate in approving Nasdaq’s diversity quota policy. The court ruled that the SEC acted unlawfully by endorsing a policy requiring corporate boards to meet identity-based diversity quotas or explain why they didn’t. The decision emphasizes that the SEC’s role is to ensure a fair marketplace, not to impose politically motivated standards. While the decision focuses on stock markets, it carries significant implications for the crypto industry. It bolsters Ripple’s argument that the SEC is exceeding its authority through “regulation by enforcement,” a stance shared by industry leaders like Garlinghouse, Coinbase, and Binance, all of whom have found themselves in legal battles or under the SEC’s scrutiny in recent years. Since 2020, Ripple’s legal battle has drawn attention across the crypto space. Last year’s partial court victory, where XRP was ruled not to be a security when sold to the general public, marked a significant milestone. However, with the case still unresolved, Ripple remains cautious, as its outcome will have far-reaching implications for XRP and the wider crypto market. Meanwhile, Musk’s alignment with Garlinghouse is critical, particularly as Ripple continues to expand internationally. Despite regulatory challenges in the United States that have limited XRP’s growth over the past seven years, the third-largest cryptocurrency has experienced a significant surge, especially following Trump’s recent election victory. This win has sparked hope for more crypto-friendly regulations, signaling a potential turning point for XRP and the broader cryptocurrency market. Over the past two months, XRP has seen a remarkable surge, increasing by more than three times its price and peaking at $2.61 earlier this month. Its market capitalization has also risen sharply, jumping from $106 billion to $160 billion in just the past month, underscoring the increasing interest in the asset and signaling continued expansion. At press time, XRP was trading at $2.41, reflecting a 1.51% increase in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-03 13:41:41

China has introduced stricter regulations to limit cryptocurrency-related activities, local news agency South China Morning Post reported. Accordingly, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of China (SAFE), which is responsible for foreign exchange movements, sent a series of warnings to banks, including cryptocurrencies. According to these warnings, banks are required to monitor and report “risky forex trading behaviors.” In this context, banks in China are required to identify high-risk transactions by examining the identities of individuals and institutions, sources of funds and transaction frequency. Experts say the new rules are also expected to reduce underground banking transactions and illegal cross-border payments involving cryptocurrencies. “The new rules will provide another legal basis to curb cryptocurrency trading,” said Liu Zhengyao, a lawyer at law firm ZhiHeng. Zhengyao said that these new rules mirror China's ban on cryptocurrencies, saying the government sees cryptocurrencies as a potential threat to financial stability. *This is not investment advice.

According to Certik’s Hack3d report, this represents 40% of the Crypto stolen so far last year, demonstrating that phishing remains the most effective cyber attack tool yet. Overall, on average, each phishing attack cost $2.8 million and the median was $207,556. In reality, despite the hacker’s decision to refund $213 million to victims, the adjusted loss approximated a depleting $836 million. The largest number of attacks, 248, were directed at the Ethereum network , with the loss amounting to $297.5 million overall. Binance Smart Chain (BSC) was used in the attacks and was another common target of the phishers. And from a year-to-year basis, the losses through Phishing attacks have gone up drastically. The actual losses were rising as well, especially in 2023-2024 when they jumped to 328%, which proves that such attacks escalated not only in frequency but also in the level of sophistication. Why Do Phishing Attacks Work? Phishing does not attempt to breach technical safeguards, instead it exploits the weaknesses of the users to provide the perpetrator with things like a private key or wallet password. Phishing emails, fake websites, and spoofing messages are the options that have remained most popular among scammers. In the context of cryptocurrencies, its one unique feature is that once a transaction is signed, it cannot be stopped or reversed, this is where phishing gets especially dangerous. How can one stay safe from Phishing attacks?? When coming to protecting ourselves against falling prey to phishing attacks, a few easy precautions and measures can go a long way in safeguarding our crypto.

However, many analysts believe that one altcoin will lead the charge as we enter 2025. Rollblock is positioned to show bigger and more sustainable gains than established tokens like Chainlink and Ethereum. Here’s why. Rollblock Set To 50x In 2025 Rollblock aims to completely change the $450 billion gambling industry. As a pioneer in GambleFi, Rollblock has already amassed over $1.3 million in wagers placed in December, forecasting to double that figure in January. Unlike traditional casino platforms, the protocol offers a more secure and transparent way of gambling, integrating blockchain technology with traditional gambling games and practices. Rollblock features an impressive selection of over 7,000 games from more than 10 gaming providers. Additionally, the platform has broadened its scope to include sports betting which became a big hit in December. All these options are backed by a full license from Gaming Anjouan and a SolidProof audit, ensuring a secure environment for both investors and gamers. The Rollblock ecosystem is driven by its utility token, RBLK. Now in its ninth presale stage, RBLK is anticipated to deliver a 100x return once it enters the open market with tokens currently selling for just $0.0445. A standout feature of RBLK is the project’s innovative revenue-sharing model. The GambleFi platform intends to allocate up to 30% of its revenue to repurchase RBLK from the market. Of these tokens, 40% will be distributed as staking rewards, while the remaining 60% will be burned to reduce supply and enhance scarcity as the project continues to gain traction. Is $15,000 a Realistic Goal for Ethereum in 2025? Ethereum is set for a landmark year in 2025, celebrating its 10th anniversary with transformative developments. Anthony Sassano, founder of The Daily Gwei, predicts ETH will reach $15,000 by year-end, driven by over $50 billion in institutional inflows into ETH ETFs and the approval of staked ETH ETFs. Furthermore, major TradFi players like BlackRock are expected to launch platforms for tokenized RWAs on Ethereum’s layer 2. Sassano foresees multiple nations revealing ETH as a treasury asset, highlighting government adoption. On the technical front, the Pectra upgrade in early 2025 will boost scalability, with gas limits rising to 50 million, while the Fusaka upgrade in 2026 will be Ethereum’s biggest yet. Additionally, Coinbase’s Base rollup may announce token and decentralization plans. Sassano confidently declares 2025 as Ethereum’s most bullish year, solidifying its role as “the world computer” and ETH as digital money. Chainlink Set To Become A Top Crypto In 2025 Chainlink saw significant activity as 2024 ended, driven by whale accumulation and promising technical patterns. The LINK price currently hovers at $20.61, within a critical support zone of $18.70–$22.90, following a breakout to $30.80 earlier this year. Technical indicators like the MACD and RSI suggest a possible rebound, although a dip toward $18.70 remains possible before recovery. Whales have shown renewed confidence, with 11 wallets recently withdrawing 241,360 LINK (worth $4.92M), now holding $13.83M collectively. Analysts view this accumulation as a signal of long-term confidence in Chainlink, even amid market corrections. Chainlink’s expanding role in DeFi and TradFi, with integrations across key financial and blockchain platforms, bolsters its growth potential. While short-term price movement depends on maintaining support, analysts project Chainlink could reach $80 in 2025, driven by adoption and innovation within its decentralized oracle network. Rollblock Eyes 100x Returns Analysts predict that if Rollblock continues its dominance in the gambling industry, RBLK could deliver a 100x return by the close of 2025. Unlike projects such as Chainlink and Ethereum which operate in highly saturated markets, Rollblock gives its holders direct access to the $450 billion gambling market, which is expected to expand to $750 billion by 2028.

Meanwhile, ADA is seemingly bound even to outperform BTC in the short term, as technical analysis suggests. By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The USDT Paired Chart The BTC/USDT chart demonstrates a precise period of consolidation during December, as the market has also created a short-term bearish trendline. However, a rebound from the $0.75 support zone has led to a breakout above the bearish trendline, which is likely to pave the way for the price to rally toward the $1.3 resistance level and even higher in the coming weeks. The BTC Paired Chart Looking at the ADA/BTC pair, it is evident that the market has climbed back above the 1,000 SAT zone after consolidating below it for a couple of weeks. This makes the 1,000 SAT area a support zone again, which could push the price higher toward the 1,500 SAT resistance level in the coming days. With the 200-day moving average also following the higher price, ADA will likely begin a new rally soon against BTC.

Several fundamentals, like the upcoming Trump inauguration, falling SHIB coin balances on exchanges, seasonality, and rising open interest points to a potential rebound. So, will the Shiba Inu coin rise and retest its December highs? Shiba Inu Price Could Rise Amid Fundamental Tailwinds SHIB price is facing numerous tailwinds that could help it resume its uptrend. As we wrote earlier, the SHIB burn rate has continued to rise, reducing the number of tokens in circulation. More data shows that more SHIB tokens are leaving exchanges, a sign that investors are holding it for longer. Shiba Inu coins in exchanges dropped by about 0.6% to 258.7 trillion from 260.3 trillion a week before. The total supply in exchanges stands at just 25.87, which is positive figure for the coin. Shiba Inu Exchange Balances Shiba Inu price is also seeing more tailwinds in the futures market, where the open interest has constantly risen in the last few days. After bottoming at $50 million in December, the interest has risen each day, reaching a high of $65.4 million, the highest point since December 20. Like other cryptocurrencies, SHIB coin price will see the benefits of the upcoming Trump administration and its emphasis on deregulation. It may also benefit from the upcoming Gary Gensler resignation and FTX distributions . SHIB Coin Price Technical Analysis Points To An Uphill Battle To December Highs So, will the Shiba Inu price jump by 45% and retest its highest level in January? Technicals are sending mixed signals about this. On the positive side, there are signs that the SHIB price has remained above the 200-day moving average, which has offered an important support. Shiba Inu has also remained above the rising trendline that links the lowest points since September last year. Additionally, the MVRV indicator, which compares the market value and relative value is at 2.7, a sign that SHIB is a cheap coin. It also formed a cup and handle-like pattern. These indicators mean that the coin has found a strong support and that it may rebound in the coming weeks. A strong rebound could see it rise and retest its December highs. However, there is also a risk that the SHIB coin has formed a bearish pennant pattern, which may lead to a bullish breakout. Shiba Inu Price Chart Shiba Inu Coin Price Targets A bullish move will see Shiba Inu coin rise and retest the resistance at $0.00003270, which is about 45% above the current level. A drop below the support at $0.00001857, its lowest point on December 20 will invalidate the bullish SHIB forecast and point to a drop to the ultimate support at $0.00001192.

Kwon, a South Korean national, was apprehended in Montenegro after attempting to flee using a fraudulent passport and was transferred to the U.S. to stand trial in Manhattan. The Department of Justice (DOJ) alleges that between 2018 and 2022, Kwon orchestrated one of the most elaborate schemes ever seen. This scheme involves false claims, market manipulation, and misappropriation of funds, which resulted in over $40 billion in investor losses following the collapse of Terraform’s stablecoin, UST, and its sister cryptocurrency, Luna. Do Kwon’s Scheme: Is He Getting 130 Years Of Prison Time? Terraform Labs, co-founded by Do Kwon in 2018, was marketed as a revolutionary blockchain platform that aimed to create a decentralized financial ecosystem through stablecoins and decentralized applications ( dApps ). At the center of Terraform’s ecosystem was TerraUSD (UST), an algorithmic stablecoin that maintained its peg to the U.S. dollar through a mechanism involving Luna, another native token. Investors were drawn to the promise of a stable, decentralized financial system that could rival traditional banking. However, cracks in the facade began to show in May 2021 when UST briefly lost its peg. According to a DOJ press release , Kwon conspired with high-frequency trading firms to artificially stabilize UST during this period, masking the systemic flaws in Terraform’s protocol. Do Kwon Extradited to the United States from Montenegro to Face Charges Relating to Fraud Resulting in $40B in Losses https://t.co/W94cxMFRyO — U.S. Department of Justice (@TheJusticeDept) January 2, 2025 Despite these interventions, by May 2022, UST’s peg broke again, triggering a catastrophic collapse of both UST and Luna. This collapse erased more than $40 billion in market value and devastated countless investors globally. In the aftermath, Kwon allegedly attempted to cover up his involvement by laundering proceeds through various blockchains, exchanges, and Swiss bank accounts. The DOJ’s indictment lists multiple misrepresentations made by Kwon, including false claims about the governance of the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), the utility of the Mirror Protocol, and the purported use of the Terra blockchain by Korean payment-processing application Chai. These misrepresentations depicted stability and real-world application, convincing investors of Terraform’s ecosystem’s viability. However, the DOJ contends that Kwon knew these claims were false and that he manipulated market metrics to sustain investor confidence. Legal Ramifications and Potential Sentencing Upon his arrival in the United States, Do Kwon appeared in a Manhattan court before Magistrate Judge Robert W. Lehrburger. His case has been assigned to U.S. District Court Judge John P. Cronan. The initial conference is scheduled for January 8, 2025. The charges against Kwon include two counts of commodities fraud, two counts of securities fraud, two counts of wire fraud, and two counts of conspiracy to commit fraud and market manipulation. If convicted on all counts, Kwon faces a maximum cumulative sentence of 130 years in prison. Notably, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland emphasized the importance of Kwon’s extradition in the press release, stating: “We secured this extradition despite Kwon’s alleged attempt to cover his tracks by laundering proceeds of his schemes and trying to use a fraudulent passport to travel to a country that did not have an extradition treaty with the United States.” Garland also mentioned that financial crimes of this scale would not go unpunished, regardless of their global whereabouts. The DOJ statement also described Terraform’s collapse as one of the most significant financial losses in the cryptocurrency sector.

38471572,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/2025-bitcoin-outlook-insights-backed-by-metrics-and-market-data,1735912200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/6/38471572.jpeg,2025 Bitcoin Outlook: Insights Backed by Metrics and Market Data,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/2025-bitcoin-outlook-insights-backed-by-metrics-and-market-data,"As we step into 2025, it’s time to take a measured and analytical approach to what the year might hold for Bitcoin. Taking into account on-chain, market cycle, macroeconomic data, and more for confluence, we can go beyond pure speculation to paint a data-driven picture for the coming months. MVRV Z-Score: Plenty of Upside Potential The MVRV Z-Score measures the ratio between Bitcoin's realized price (the average acquisition price of all BTC on the network) and its market cap. Standardizing this ratio for volatility gives us the Z-Score, which historically provides a clear picture of market cycles. Figure 1: MVRV-Z Score shows we’re still a long way from a market cycle peak. View Live Chart 🔍 Currently, the MVRV Z-Score suggests we still have significant upside potential. While previous cycles have seen the Z-Score reach values above 7, I believe anything above 6 indicates overextension, prompting a closer look at other metrics to identify a market peak. Presently, we’re hovering at levels comparable to May 2017—when Bitcoin was valued at only a few thousand dollars. Given the historical context, there’s room for multiple hundreds of percent in potential gains from current levels. The Pi Cycle Oscillator: Bullish Momentum Resumes Another essential metric is the Pi Cycle Top and Bottom indicato r, which tracks the 111-day and 350-day moving averages (the latter multiplied by 2). Historically, when these averages cross, it often signals a Bitcoin price peak within days. Figure 2: Macro trend remains bullish. View Live Chart 🔍 The distance between these two moving averages has started to trend upward again, suggesting renewed bullish momentum. While 2024 saw periods of sideways consolidation, the breakout we’re seeing now indicates that Bitcoin is entering a stronger growth phase, potentially lasting several months. The Exponential Phase of the Cycle Looking at Bitcoin’s historical price action, cycles often feature a ""post-halving cooldown"" lasting 6–12 months before entering an exponential growth phase. Based on previous cycles , we’re nearing this breakout point. While diminishing returns are expected compared to earlier cycles, we could still see substantial gains. Figure 3: We’re approaching the most bullish stage of the cycle when compared to previous bull runs. View Live Chart 🔍 For context, breaking the previous all-time high of $20,000 in the 2020 cycle led to a peak near $70,000—a 3.5x increase. If we see even a conservative 2x or 3x from the last peak of $70,000, Bitcoin could realistically reach $140,000–$210,000 in this cycle. Macro Factors Supporting BTC in 2025 Despite headwinds in 2024, Bitcoin performed strongly, even in the face of a strengthening U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) . Historically, Bitcoin and the DXY move inversely, so any reversal in the DXY’s strength could further fuel Bitcoin’s upside. Figure 4: BTC has rallied even as the DXY has increased substantially. View Live Chart 🔍 Other macroeconomic indicators, such as high-yield credit cycles and the global M2 money supply, suggest improving conditions for Bitcoin. The contraction in the money supply seen in 2024 is expected to reverse in 2025, setting the stage for an even more favorable environment. Cycle Master Chart: A Long Way to Go The Bitcoin Cycle Master Chart, which aggregates multiple on-chain valuation metrics, shows that Bitcoin still has considerable room to grow before reaching overvaluation. The upper boundary, currently around $190,000, continues to rise, reinforcing the outlook for sustained upward momentum. Figure 5: Cycle Master ‘Over Valued’ level has surpassed $190,000. View Live Chart 🔍 Conclusion Currently, almost all data points are aligned for a bullish 2025. As always, past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, however the data strongly suggests that Bitcoin’s best days may still lie ahead, even after an incredibly positive 2024.

Solaxy’s presale has already garnered significant attention, raising close to $8 million and attracting a growing community of supporters. The project’s roadmap highlights ambitious goals, including continued marketing campaigns, exchange listings, and staking functionality. With these plans in motion, the project is poised to expand its reach and utility. Tokenomics further bolster SOLX’s potential. A considerable portion of the token supply is allocated to product development, community rewards, and marketing, ensuring long-term growth and sustained engagement. With aggressive marketing strategies and a clear focus on addressing real blockchain challenges, Solaxy has established itself as a strong contender in the memecoin market. In one of its recent videos, 99Bitcoins has called it the next SOL 100x meme coin. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQ_hkxKxFS8 The momentum seen during the presale phase reflects investor confidence in the project’s ability to solve pressing issues in the crypto space. Addressing critical pain points like congestion and failed transactions positions Solaxy as a practical investment choice. With its utility-driven appeal and active community engagement, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the SOLX token experience a price surge after its official launch.

Recently, Jaime Rogozinski, the founder of WallStreetBets, posted on X (formerly Twitter) that XRP continues to dominate South Korean crypto exchanges compared to other major assets. XRP Outshines BTC and ETH in South Korea However, Rogozinski’s post comes as XRP’s price hints at a potential reversal following a breakout of bullish price action, a prolonged consolidation phase, and a surge in XRP trading volume across exchanges in South Korea over the past 24 hours. https://twitter.com/wallstreetbets/status/1874841147908166142 He further added that the rush and interest from traders and investors don’t appear to be slowing down, especially in South Korea, resulting in the altcoin outshining BTC and DOGE in the East Asian country. Data from CoinMarketCap reveals that XRP’s trading volume on Upbit is three times that of Bitcoin , with over $620 million compared to $276 million over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE) recorded a trading volume of approximately $221 million. This trend was not limited to Upbit, but similar patterns were observed on other leading exchanges such as Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit. XRP Price Prediction for 2025 Analyzing these trends in South Korea, the analyst made a bold prediction that XRP could soon reach $4.11 and $5.85 in the coming days and projected a price of $8 by 2025 if the crypto market reaches a $5 trillion market cap. At press time, XRP is trading near $2.41, having experienced a price surge of 1.25% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, overall trading volume dropped by 43%, indicating lower participation compared to previous days.

This is considered a big drop from a year that’s mostly characterized by higher losses at $63.8 million in November and $115.8 million in October. Data from blockchain security firms CertiK and PeckShield show that December was mostly quiet for crypto, even though the space remains vulnerable. Key Takeaways of December Losses: CertiK Reports on Exploits According to CertiK, exploits accounted for the majority of December’s losses, with $26.7 million stolen. The most prominent incident was the $2.1 million theft that happened on the DeFi platform GemPad , wherein hackers attacked its smart contracts. Other prominent attacks include the theft of $1 million from the FEG token bridge, which, upon investigation, CertiK found was caused by an error in the verification of cross-chain messages, enabling attackers to withdraw tokens without depositing them first. PeckShield’s Findings Data from PeckShield showed hack-related losses of $24.7 million last December, which is 71% lower than November. Among the 25 incidents that it tracked, the most notable was the $12.3 million exploit that hit LastPass users. This was linked to a 2022 data breach wherein hackers stole encrypted customer vault backups that would later allow them to gain access to sensitive crypto assets. Another incident was the $2.2 million breach of the Yei Finance protocol on Dec. 2, further showing how much vulnerability a DeFi platform carries with it. Annual Trends in Crypto Security While December was a relatively slow month in terms of losses, a total of 2024 had seen $2.3 billion of crypto thefts across 165 incidents so far, per Cyvers. The cumulative total is up 40% over the $1.69 billion stolen in 2023 but is significantly lower than the $3.78 billion lost in 2022. The CEO of Cyvers, Deddy Lavid, attributed this increase in 2024 to access control breaches, especially at centralized exchanges and custodians. These breaches are one of the main issues that the industry faces and prove that security should be enhanced not only on decentralized but also on centralized platforms. Looking Ahead Although the decline in December brought some relief, the crypto industry still needs to work harder in closing security gaps that make losses possible. In 2025, stronger protocols, better auditing, and increased user awareness will be key in reducing vulnerabilities.",Blockchain|Regulation|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-01-03 13:57:32

Interestingly, its impact is clearly visible in the Ulbricht-inspired cryptocurrency, resulting in the ROSS token price jumping 22% today. Let’s discuss the speculations and their impact on the Ross Ulbricht token. ROSS Token Price Surged 22% Amid Ross Ulbricht’s Release Speculation ROSS token was launched in the middle of 2024, and months had passed before any significant progress on the charts was made. However, with Trump’s inauguration day getting closer, the Ross Ulbricht token price began pumping, gaining a 19064.67% surge in the last six months. Out of this, the biggest gains were during November-December, creating a new ATH at $0.02767. At the same time, Bitcoin’s price hit ATH , but it is currently consolidating at $96.5k, disappointing investors. Interestingly, the Ross Ulbricht release speculation is fueling the ROSS token price performance, showing a 236% surge over the month and 22% over the last 24 hours. With that, it trades at $0.02541 and is just 8% away from the ATH. It also has a market capitalization and trading volume of $25.34M and $978.05K after a 90% surge, indicating investor interest. Donald Trump’s election win is supposed to free the Silk Road creator per his presidential campaign promises, but is that happening for real? Will Ross Ulbricht Receive Donald Trump’s Presidential Pardon? There is significant buzz around Ross Ulbricht’s release from 11 years of imprisonment this month. He created the Silk Road to allow investors to trade Bitcoin anonymously. However, the same platform became a conduit for illegal trades and even money laundering, resulting in a lifetime imprisonment. Despite that, hundreds of prominent people and thousands of supporters supported the Silk Road creator. The buzz around his possible release through Donald Trump is helping the ROSS token price rally. People have begun anticipating Trump’s presidential pardon on social media, which he promised during his campaigns. Even the impact is visible in the Polymarket presidential pardon data , as the investor’s confidence has increased to 71%. Interestingly, the same hit 80% back in November. However, critics believe that Trump promised the release to win over thousands of people. At the same time, they question whether the soon-to-be 47th US president will fulfill his promises, as he failed to complete many of them during his last presidency. Since it was last mentioned during the campaigns, Donald Trump has not spoken on the subject, but people await the inauguration day, as Trump said, “Ross will be coming home in January.” What’s Coming Next For ROSS Token Price? With the building speculation around Ross Ulbricht’s release, the ROSS token price has continuously risen for weeks. The increased hype is clearly presented in the Ross Ulbricht token’s trading volume and Polymarket bets. Now, the current price is just 8% away from hitting the ATH and could continue to surge if the trend remains the same. However, a few critics fear Donald Trump’s change of heart, as he overlooked many promises during his previous presidency.

This resurgence comes amidst heightened whale activity and a brightening outlook for the cryptocurrency in 2025. Notably, the top meme coin has faced significant volatility over the past month. DOGE experienced a remarkable 400% rally from October to November, climbing to $0.50 as investor sentiment surged. However, a subsequent market correction in early December led to a steady decline, highlighting the asset’s susceptibility to broader market trends. Despite these fluctuations, whale activity has remained a critical factor influencing Dogecoin’s price movements, particularly this week’s surge. On Friday, January 3, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez reported that whales accumulated over 1.08 billion DOGE within 24 hours. This follows the pundit’s earlier observation of significant accumulation by these entities earlier in the week. After a sharp price drop in mid-December and subsequent stabilization toward the end of the month, the pundit highlighted on Tuesday that “ Whales bought over 300 million DOGE in the past 24 hours.” This activity suggests that large-scale investors might strategically position themselves for anticipated price movements in 2025. That said, the outlook for Dogecoin in 2025 appears increasingly optimistic, driven by multiple factors. The growing adoption of DOGE for real-world transactions has solidified its utility, moving beyond its origins as a meme coin. Additionally, the cryptocurrency market is expected to benefit from regulatory clarity, mainstream institutional adoption, and improved macroeconomic conditions. Fueling the bullish outlook, speculation about Elon Musk’s continued support for Dogecoin remains a driving force behind the excitement. Musk has previously teased the possibility of enabling DOGE payments for Tesla products, which could significantly boost the token’s adoption. Notably, Tesla updated its payment methods last May to include Dogecoin, marking a step toward the asset’s growing mainstream acceptance. Adding to the optimism, Musk’s social media platform, X, is expected to launch its payment system, X Money, in 2025. Earlier this week, X CEO Linda Yaccarino confirmed this development, noting that the feature is slated for release this year, sparking speculation that X Money could potentially include DOGE. Elsewhere, technical analysts have shared bullish predictions for Dogecoin’s future performance. In a recent tweet, an analyst known as Trader Tardigrade highlighted a “double bottom” pattern on DOGE’s daily chart, signaling a potential breakout. “Dogecoin hit a local bottom and is set to reach new highs soon,” the analyst noted. Similarly, recently, Martinez expressed optimism, predicting that DOGE could surpass $12.00 by late 2025, a scenario reminiscent of its explosive 14,500% rally in 2021, when the token surged from $0.005 to $0.73. At press time, DOGE was trading at $0.34, reflecting a 2.36% increase in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|Doge|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-03 14:01:30

New Year New Shiba (NEWSHIBA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to surge over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because NEWSHIBA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, New Year New Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and New Year New Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. New Year New Shiba launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy New Year New Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for New Year New Shiba by entering its contract address – 7DjEUoHG7Yr3LpaqNPcyc5DgNEYSLrnPV8zsjQBbAYfh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like NEWSHIBA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-03 14:02:00

Why is Pepe’s new momentum surge occurring, and could it create conditions for yet another spectacular rally? Can Algorand’s resilience result in a positive comeback, therefore bringing it near to it’s all-time high? With Remittix’s innovative approach to worldwide payments, this rapidly growing initiative project offers one of the best crypto investment prospects available right now. Read on to discover why these altcoins are ones to keep an eye on in 2025. Pepe (PEPE) Prepares For a Bullish Reversal Rising significantly from the $0.000017 support zone, the Pepe price has shown its resilience with a 10% increase in the last week. This increase in upward momentum sent the Pepe price above the $0.000021 resistance level, therefore inspiring hope among the memecoin’s community once more. Driven by rising investor confidence, the Pepe price chart shows a hopeful future for more increases even though the price of the meme coin dropped 4% over last month. Pepe coin, one of the top altcoins to hold, is still attracting investor interest since its all-time high (ATH) of $0.000028 is now only about 30% away from current levels. The Pepe price chart shows a conflicting picture: the Momentum Oscillator points to residual bearish pressure while Moving Averages indicate purchase chances. Pepe coin offers a promising prospect for investors looking for high-potential memecoins as analysts anticipate exponential rallies this year. Algorand (ALGO) Shows Sign of a Bullish Comeback Recent resilience of the Algorand price has demonstrated a more than 8% rise over the last week before a minor retreat to the $0.31 support level. Notwithstanding this fall, the Algorand price has recovered upward momentum and crossed the $0.40 resistance. The Algorand price chart, however, shows a bearish month as the altcoin declined about 30%. ALGO has been ranging within the $0.62 and $0.27 levels during this bearish phase. Algorand is still much below its all-time high (ATH) of $3.28 despite recent losses; yet, the community is still hopeful that the altcoin will shortly retest this level in the ongoing bull run. Technical indicators point to a bullish Algorand’s future. Signing purchase possibilities, the Awesome Oscillator, Momentum Oscillator, MACD, and Moving Averages point to a likely strong bullish trend on the Algorand price chart. Meanwhile, Algorand is still among the top altcoins to hold in the coming months given the optimistic investor sentiment and bullish technicals. Remittix (RTX) Offers Seamless Global Transactions Remittix is a unique platform that combines the daily comfort of fiat payments with the speed and security of blockchain technology. Moreover, Remittix provides a special crypto-to-fiat conversion technology that lets users send and receive money quickly anywhere in the world, unlike rivals including Stripe, Wise, and Coinbase. Furthermore, this platform provides unparalleled value for companies and individuals with flat rates, free of hidden fees, and expenses below those of larger banks. Its innovative Remittix Pay API and Checkout technologies enable businesses to provide easy crypto payment choices, enabling users to settle transactions in fiat without complication. Meanwhile, Remittix is the best crypto investment prospect available since analysts estimate a possible 50x price gain this year from its ongoing RTX presale pricing of about $0.0172 per token. Supported by strong security policies and advanced encryption techniques, Remittix assures personal data protection as well as transaction safety. Remittix Is Poised To Outshine Pepe and Algorand Although Pepe (PEPE) and Algorand (ALGO) are still attracting interest with their price swings, Remittix (RTX) is not only redefining financial transactions but also positioned for explosive expansion by providing flawless, low-cost, safe worldwide payments by linking crypto with fiat. Growing acceptance and a creative approach make this groundbreaking project one of the greatest crypto investments of 2025! Moreover, analysts estimate up to 50x returns this year as the Remittix platform grows, thus smart investors wishing to profit from the future of cross-border payments would not want to miss this opportunity.

Guided by the vision of “Ideas Transcending Millennia,” Xenea focuses on long-term token and data storage solutions while enabling new capabilities for AI and decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN). To strengthen the protocol’s reliability, Xenea follows a peer-review approach. Core architecture papers are submitted to the IEEE, a prominent academic society in telecommunications, for validation. Code implementation begins only after these papers undergo rigorous academic peer review. The validated papers are accessible on IEEE Xplore . Xenea incorporates two key technological architectures: Proof of Democracy (PoD): Xenea’s proprietary consensus algorithm allows user wallets to determine transaction authenticity. Unlike Proof of Work, which demands significant energy consumption, or Proof of Stake, which relies on token price for security, PoD facilitates secure value transfer over exceptionally long periods. Participation in PoD requires holding a Mining Passport NFT. Decentralized Autonomous Storage (DACS): DACS serves as the foundation of Xenea’s decentralized storage system, enabling seamless integration between the blockchain and various file systems. SGM ensures the preservation of data over the long term. Initially integrating with IPFS, DACS is set to incorporate Xenea’s own hash file system by 2025, supporting real-time editing of dynamic data. Through DACS, AI-generated data handled by any blockchain ecosystem in the AI era can be directly managed and stored on the Xenea blockchain. This enables the provision of highly reliable data storage infrastructure for various products. Background of Recruiting Ecosystem Partners Xenea features its own distributed storage system and operates as an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain, enabling businesses to handle a broader range of data on the blockchain. In the emerging era of the distributed web—integrated with advancements in AI, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMI), and virtual technologies—secure and permanent data storage infrastructure is becoming increasingly essential. Xenea aims to meet this need by offering its storage solutions to a broader range of Web3 projects. Xenea’s public mainnet and Token Generation Event (TGE) are scheduled for launch in Q1 2025. As part of the preparation, a download campaign for the XENEA Wallet is underway as of December 2024. This campaign serves as a critical step toward ensuring the robustness of the Proof of Democracy (PoD) security at the mainnet launch. Participants who contribute significantly during the campaign will be prioritized for token airdrops and Mining Passport NFTs. Wallets with these NFTs will play an active role in consensus and supporting the Xenea network structure. The XENEA Wallet download campaign has achieved over 1.2 million downloads to date. This growing user base presents a significant opportunity for ecosystem partners, offering high visibility and user acquisition potential. By leveraging the XENEA Wallet for exposure and engaging in collaborative cross-marketing initiatives, Xenea aims to foster mutual growth and strengthen the ecosystem. In a pilot cross-marketing initiative with Chat3 , an early adopter of the Xenea blockchain, over 250,000 users were successfully directed to their service, resulting in notable activity levels. Xenea is actively engaging in business development with local economic organizations and government bodies across the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Future expansion into these regions is also being explored in collaboration with ecosystem partners.

Among them, BONK and PEPE have caught attention, recording gains of 2.71% and 2.41%, respectively, in the last 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap. However, market optimism in these tokens is low in comparison to the buzz surrounding 1Fuel (OFT), which experts and institutional investors are praising as one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy. Over $940,000 has already poured into 1Fuel’s presale in just a few weeks. In fact, there’s more. BONK gains appear sluggish for investors BONK’s performance in the past 24 hours, rising 2.71%, isn’t sufficient for investors looking to generate significant yields in the market. At press time, BONK is yet to fully recover from its 29.46% loss over the past month. On the weekly time frame, the BONK/USDT chart on Binance shows the asset has re-entered a consolidation phase, trading within a range of $0.00003300 and $0.00003026. BONK is currently hovering near the center of this channel, around $0.00003202, reflecting its steady performance in recent sessions. However, if BONK breaches the lower range of this consolidation at $0.00003026, it could trigger a significant downward move. Based on the price range in the chart, such a drop could result in a potential loss of up to 50.32%, underscoring the importance of holding this critical support level. Smart BONK and PEPE investors are trying to avoid this potential drop by finding a safe haven that would preserve their gains. However, they are faced with limited options. PEPE provides a minor shield but isn’t enough PEPE has demonstrated resilience, showing gains of 2.59% on the daily timeframe and 2.73% over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. These figures suggest steady interest from buyers entering the market. On the chart, PEPE is forming an ascending triangle, a bullish pattern, and is trading near a key support level at $0.00001845. This setup signals the potential for further upward movement if the support holds strong. Should this bullish pattern play out, PEPE could target its recent highs, possibly approaching its all-time high of $0.00002836, representing a potential gain of over 53% from current levels, depending on market momentum and broader sentiment. While PEPE is set to perform better amid BONK’s trading challenges, 1Fuel presents a superior opportunity for investors to gain over 500% during its presale phases and achieve over a 100X return when the market rally materializes. 1Fuel set to return 100x for early buyers According to analysts, 1Fuel is among the best cryptocurrencies to buy, especially given its low price of $0.012 and the current community sentiment driven by large investors. So far, investor interest has brought a total of $940,000 to the asset, selling 69% of its current presale stage 2. With this buying pressure, 1Fuel could close this phase within a few days. What sets 1Fuel apart is its clear utility. The token will power a next-generation cryptocurrency wallet designed to simplify multichain transactions, addressing a critical pain point for many crypto users. According to its roadmap, the wallet launch is expected soon, positioning 1Fuel as a game-changer in the space. This combination of practical use cases and strong investor interest has created the perfect storm for a potential 100X return once the token launches and gains traction in the market. Conclusion For investors who have profited from memecoins like PEPE and BONK, 1Fuel offers a chance to ride the next big wave. With its presale phase 2 nearing completion and its proposed cryptocurrency wallet unique value proposition, 1Fuel could deliver extraordinary returns for those who get in early.

As things develop, trading experts and analysts already have their strategy ready and price predictions for this cycle’s top, especially for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), the market leaders. In particular, the X account who goes by a smiling emoji using the handle @smileycapital shared his prediction for BTC and ETH price tops, marking the end of the ongoing bull cycle . Smiley Capital predicts Bitcoin will top between $140,000 and $160,000, and Ethereum between $9,000 and $11,000. The analyst also considers an extraordinary scenario of possible overperformance in case cryptocurrencies see a massive adoption event . Thus, the “cycle top forecasts,” in his words, are at $190,000 and $15,000 for BTC and ETH, respectively. Cycle top forecasts; BTC 140-160k ETH 9-11k If we do overperform due to impressive adoption, 190k/15k should be upper bounds. I give that scenario 25% chance. Financial disclaimer in the next post. — 🙂 (@smileycapital) January 2, 2025 However, Smiley Capital warns that he only does predictions “for fun” and is not necessarily locked in with these forecasts. “I do not trade my predictions, I’m a reactionary trader and I’ll exit markets in the moments when I deem the top is in – not because certain numbers were hit” Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) price analysis and prediction As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $97,050 and Ethereum at $3,510, both surging year-over-year. On that note, BTC is up 119.6% and ETH 54.46% since last year’s January 3. Bitcoin displays a more consistent uptrend while Ethereum’s volatility has hit hard in the last 12 months, with ups and downs. From the current prices, the analyst’s most-bullish predictions would mean a 99% and 327% gains for BTC and ETH, respectively. It is notable that Ethereum has a higher growth potential, considering it is still lagging behind Bitcoin like most altcoins. Bitcoin (BTC) & Ethereum (ETH) one-year price charts.

Yet, even this highly optimistic scenario requires traders and investors to have a well-thought exit strategy and realize profits frequently . For example, Wolf has been looking at Smiley Capital ’s recently disclosed Bitcoin range since May last year. In this occasion, which we also reported, the trader explained he plans to start exiting once BTC crosses $130,000 . Nevertheless, cryptocurrency traders building their exit strategies must consider the possibility that their bullish expectations could be part of somebody else’s exit strategy and act accordingly with proper risk management and caution.

This is a key milestone for creditors waiting to recover their assets. The FTX estate, which manages the bankruptcy proceedings of the collapsed crypto exchange, had stated in December that it plans to begin repayments within 60 days of the effective date. Focus On Convenience Classes Although the estate estimates that total distribution will range between $14.7 billion and $16.5 billion, the first payout will be lower, focusing on convenience classes with allowed claims of $50,000 or less. These creditors are expected to receive approximately 119% of their allowed claim amount, including principal and accrued interest, within 60 days. As per the plan, this amounts to roughly $1.2 billion in total. Sunil Kavuri, a prominent advocate for FTX creditors shared in an X post that creditors with claims exceeding $50,000 will receive a share of a separate $10.5 billion pool. The distribution timeline for this group will take longer.

To be eligible to receive a distribution on the initial distribution date, customers and other creditors are required to complete the above-mentioned steps, prior to the distribution record date. Notably, analysts estimate that $2.4 billion may flow back into crypto markets following the plan’s execution. The analysts note that $3.9 billion of total claims were acquired by credit funds, which are unlikely to reinvest in crypto assets.

This is a calculated step toward dominating the European Economic Area (EEA). The acquisition isn’t about poaching customers though, reportedly . BUX had already moved its Cyprus-based clients over to AvaTrade, a separate CFD broker. This deal is all about the license—specifically, the Cyprus Investment Firm (CIF) license. Coinbase targets institutional players with its new Cyprus license Let’s talk about why this license matters. CFDs are a big deal in financial markets. They let traders speculate on the price movement of assets without actually owning them. But here’s the thing. Coinbase isn’t gunning for your average retail trader with this setup. The Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) has already approved the domain “coinbase.com/international-exchange/europe,” but it’s not live yet. Industry rumor is that Coinbase is planning to target professional and institutional clients. Think hedge funds, big-money players, and trading firms—not the average guy holding a few Bitcoins. This deal also lines up perfectly with Coinbase’s playbook. The company has been systematically tackling Europe’s regulatory minefield since 2018 when they launched localized platforms in multiple countries. By 2020, the company ramped up compliance efforts. Though this wasn’t optional. Europe’s regulators were breathing down crypto firms’ necks. In 2021, Coinbase Pro, their advanced trading platform, launched in Europe. Fast forward to 2022, and the company began offering staking and crypto rewards to European users. They even threw in educational tools for investors who wanted to up their game. By 2023, Coinbase was fully engaged with European regulators, prepping itself for MiCA’s new standards. Late 2024 was a turning point. In November, Coinbase shut down its USDC yield program in Europe, citing MiCA regulations. Then, in December, they axed unauthorized stablecoins to stay compliant.

The tournament awarded $500 to the first-place winner, $250 to the second-place winner, and decreasing amounts for third and fourth places. However, what stood out was the reward for fifth to eighth place: 25 bitcoins. At the time, bitcoin was a little-known cryptocurrency with negligible value, making the reward a novelty rather than a treasure. In hindsight, the value of those 25 bitcoins has become astonishing. With bitcoin trading at $94,600 per coin as of January 2025, the 25 bitcoin prize would now amount to $2,365,000, making this one of the most striking examples of missed financial opportunities. pic.twitter.com/skgOkYrGsC — internet hall of fame (@InternetH0F) January 1, 2025 Winners’ Decisions and Missed Potential The post attracted several comments, shedding light on how the prize was perceived at the time. One commenter, Space Man, reflected on his own experience with bitcoin in its early days: “In college, I was mining bitcoin out of interest while studying computer networking. I don’t remember how much it was, but I spent all my coin on 2 mp3s it was at least 15 bitcoin at that time.” Another commenter, Clover Lavender, shared insight into the tournament winners’ choices: “There was a follow-up of all the bitcoin winners, and they all opted for a lesser cash compensation. Apparently none of them took the bitcoin prize.” This suggests that the winners, understandably, prioritized immediate, tangible rewards over an unfamiliar and experimental currency. At the time, Bitcoin was trading for mere cents, and its utility was largely theoretical. In hindsight, this decision appears to be a significant missed opportunity, but it underscores how little was known about Bitcoin’s potential.

BTC was introduced in 2009, and primarily used by tech enthusiasts and a small online community. Its value rose gradually, reaching $1 per coin in 2011 and gaining traction throughout the next decade. By the 2020s, Bitcoin became synonymous with the cryptocurrency revolution, regularly trading at five-figure prices. This tournament is a fascinating piece of history, reflecting how early adopters of technology often grapple with uncertainty about its future. StarCraft, a popular competitive strategy game at the time, was frequently associated with innovative prize structures. The inclusion of Bitcoin in its rewards demonstrates how niche communities experimented with new ideas, even if their significance was not immediately apparent. Today, this moment is both a humorous and sobering reminder of the unpredictable nature of technological progress.

Trump Loves Dancing (TRUMPDAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPDAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Dancing can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Dancing could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Dancing launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Dancing on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Dancing by entering its contract address – HVnG6NJCvVDa34VxqR1wmSo18EGtNVJhNR8CQwNwjgpi – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPDAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-03 15:22:40

On January 2, 2025, the popular IBIT ETF witnessed the biggest outflows in its history, selling 3,510, equivalent to $3.3B. However, there are mixed sentiments about this news, so let us discuss the impact of these outflows on the Bitcoin price. BlackRock Sells Amid Increased Market Uncertaining & Global ETF Ouftflows Although the IBIT has witnessed the biggest outflows since its inception, it is not the only ETF facing outflows recently. The Coingalss data reveals that the US Spot Bitcoin ETFs are facing massive outflows, bringing the total to $247.8 million. In this, BlackRock contributed to the 3,510 Bitcoin sales concerning the investors. This is because the same exchange-traded fund was poured with inflows and even contributed to the Bitcoin price reaching as high as $108.2k in December 2024. The crypto market sentiments clearly represent the investors losing their greed, as the Bitcoin and global Bitcoin ETFs witnessed significant drops in the past few weeks. Regardless of the current situation, it is still prominent that IBIT is the biggest spot Bitcoin ETF , as it created multiple records throughout the year, including reaching $51B (548,505 BTC) in AUM. With that, a recovery in the net inflows is clear, but the recent selling could influence the Bitcoin price. How Bitcoin Price Will React With This Massive BlackRock Sell? Looking at the broader picture, these IBIT ETF outflows would not impact the Bitcoin price. However, this could sweep the December lows in the short term, especially considering all the major ETFs witnessing outflows. Furthermore, Donald Trump’s inauguration could bring further uncertainty. However, such a setback often leads to further rallies. Many crypto analysts have predicted that the BTC price could hit $225k in 2025. Interestingly, a recent CoinGape report revealed that Bitcoin could hit a new ATH of $114k even before Trump’s inauguration on January 20. So, a lot is at stake, keeping the investors hooked on this digital asset. Where To Go From Here? Since its launch, Bitcoin has been growing exponentially, and 2024 brought it to new levels of success. However, the expectation for 2025 is no less, despite the spot Bitcoin ETF outflows and the current BTC price consolidation. Major crypto analysts see this digital asset moving higher and higher, bringing the world of finances to a different level. However, the road is not entirely smooth; even the recent BlackRock sale of 3,510 BTC could create a short-term negative impact but could recover pretty much soon if any major macroeconomic event did not interfere.

Based in Shanghai and valued at $363 million on the stock market, Cango is in the process of acquiring 50 exahashes per second (EH/s) worth of mining power, meaning that the auto lending platform will become one of the largest bitcoin miners in the world once its entire fleet goes online. “I guess it’s surprising for people in the [bitcoin mining] industry because nobody has ever heard of Cango before,” Juliet Ye, the company’s senior director of communications, told CoinDesk in an interview. “But the history of Cango is a history of adaptation. We’ve diversified into different areas at least two or three times [since the firm was established in 2010].” Getting such a large bitcoin mining fleet isn’t cheap. Cango paid $256 million in cash for the first 32 EH/s worth of computing power, which it purchased from bitcoin mining machine manufacturer Bitmain. It will be issuing $144 million worth of shares for the remaining 18 EH/s, which it is acquiring from Golden TechGen — a firm owned by former Bitmain Chief Financial Officer Max Hua — as well as other undisclosed mining machine sellers. Once the transaction is settled, Golden TechGen and these other sellers will end up owning approximately 37.8% of Cango. The diversification into bitcoin mining is already bearing fruit. Cango’s stock finished 2024 at $4.56, up more than 362% from the start of that year. Even better, Ye said, this new bitcoin mining strategy has catapulted Cango into the spotlight. “It’s been really hard for us to gain traction around the company, as a small- to mid-cap listed Chinese firm in the U.S.,” Ye said. “All of a sudden, a lot of people are very much interested in Cango. The buzz around the company — we’ve never seen this before in the past.” 50 EH/s Cango is more used to helping Chinese banks issue loans for people looking to buy cars. But the firm, which went public in 2018, was already diversifying its operations years before acquiring its bitcoin fleet. Cango started facilitating car exports from China to other parts of the world and has invested in Li Auto, a Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer. Following that investment, Cango explored business opportunities in the renewable energy sector, including high-compute power projects related to AI, before venturing into on bitcoin mining. “Bitcoin mining is a very good way to rebalance energy grids,” Ye said, referring to the fact that bitcoin miners can easily switch their rigs off and on again. Some jurisdictions, like Texas, take advantage of that ability by encouraging miners to operate in periods of low energy consumption, and paying them to shut down their machines when local demand surges, like during heatwaves or blizzards. With Bitcoin’s hashrate now hovering at 823 EH/s, Cango will be providing roughly 6% of the total computing power behind Bitcoin once the firm’s 50 EH/s fully come online. For reference, MARA Holdings (MARA), the largest publicly traded miner in the world, owned a little over 47 EH/s worth of computing power as of November, per TheMinerMag data. CleanSpark (CLSK) and Riot Platforms (RIOT), the two next largest, stood at 32 EH/s and 26 EH/s respectively. “The Bitcoin mining sector's imperative for scaled operations was a pivotal consideration in our decision to enter this domain,” Cango’s management team told CoinDesk in an email. “The current landscape is marked by industry consolidation, with larger-scale operations becoming increasingly dominant due to escalating mining difficulty and the necessity for state-of-the-art hardware.” One major difference between Cango and other mining heavyweights is that Cango isn’t operating its own mining fleet right now. With machines spread out around the world — including in the U.S., Canada, Paraguay and Ethiopia — Cango is still relying heavily on Bitmain for facilities and infrastructure, and to make sure the sites run smoothly. “Even though we enter the industry with a significant amount of computing power, we are still new here, and we need time to adapt to the norms, and get a better understanding of the tax situation and the rest of the market,” Ye said. “So at the beginning, we chose to work together with Bitmain and to use its operations teams.” That situation is likely to change over time, Ye said, as Cango gains experience in the sector and seeks to make its bitcoin mining operations more economically efficient. Nurturing an in-house mining team would likely be cheaper than relying on Bitmain’s expertise in the long run. As for what Cango plans to do with its growing bitcoin stash, that will depend on how the year unfolds, Ye said. “We don’t rule out the possibility of making some tactical reductions [to the bitcoin holdings] based on market conditions,” she said. Cango mined 363.9 BTC in November alone, a sum worth roughly $35 million at the time of writing.",Markets|Cango|Bitcoin Mining|China,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-03 15:25:31

Krüger tells his 196,700 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin will have a bullish year in 2025. “My prediction for 2025 is simple: higher. Nothing has fundamentally changed since November 5th [of 2024 US election]. Bitcoin will have another good year. February will be the best performing month, with the recent Fed hawkishness still holding broader markets back short-term.” Bitcoin is trading at $96,065 at time of writing, around 11% below the all-time high of around $108,135 reached on December 17th, 2024. According to the economist and trader, there will be varying results recorded across the various crypto sectors. “Performance dispersion across crypto assets will be larger than ever. The crypto meets AI category will evolve and continue to outperform. Altcoins will pump and dump as usual, an expression of how illiquid most are.” While predicting that US stock indices will “also have a good year,” Kruger says that the major risks for 2025 include President-elect Donald Trump “going too hard on immigration.” Such an action, it is believed, could increase inflation as reduced labor supply could raise hiring costs and consequently force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. The trader and economist also says that the top for the current cycle could come later than expected due to the Federal Reserve’s actions. “The timing of the Fed going back dovish could easily derail the widely held view that crypto tops around the end of Q1. If equities ramp up hard in March or April, what do you think crypto will do? Macro trumps both seasonality and the Bitcoin four-year cycle.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Our Bonk price prediction for 2028 anticipates a price range of $0.000135 to $0.000154. In 2031, we expect Bonk price to record a maximum price of $0.00025 with an average price of $0.00024. Bonk is one of the most successful crypto projects in 2025. The dog-themed Solana-based coin has become one of the most recognized meme coins, with its market capitalization reaching $2.4 billion in May. Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 93 trillion. It is important to note that 66 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 20254 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk ecosystem.

Despite the continuous price fluctuations in the previous weeks, currently the market trend is highly bullish. Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain triggered a huge surge in SOL’s price, attributed to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has many side projects that contribute to its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will reach $0.00025, which is approximately 7.9 times its current price, making it a good investment to consider. Why is Bonk up? Bonk gained a substantial portion of its value over the last 24 hours. In the last few hours, its value increased by $0.000003415. Today’s increasing pressure triggered a massive ascent in the coin’s value. Will Bonk Recover? Bonk is currently trading in its middle price range. Considering the current situation, the coin’s price has initiated a recovery as the crypto pair has secured support at the $0.00002912 level. The recovery can continue as long as buyers remain consistent. Will Bonk reach $0.000055? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.000035. However, just a few days ago, Bonk saw some price action above this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.000055 by the end of 2026. Will Bonk reach $0.000100? Bonk price prediction suggests that the coin can reach $0.000100 and surpass it by 2027. When Bonk reaches this price level, its market capitalization will increase 4.5-fold. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. According to The Cryptopolitan’s review of the cryptocurrency, it is expected that Bonk will reach a maximum value of $0.00025 by the end of 2031, which is quite a bit above its current price.

Bonk historic price sentiment Bonk price history In December 2022, Bonk was launched with a price of $0.0000001487 and made history by making a surge of more than 30% in SOL tokens. Bonk cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 100 by market cap, reaching $0.0000034 per coin on January 5, 2023, according to crypto market records. However, by March 2023, the price of the Bonk token had fallen from $0.0000004134, losing substantial value. In June 2023, Bonk’s price did not experience much action, and it gradually decreased to $0.0000001927 in September 2023. In October 2023, Bonk started to see bullish sentiment, with the price reaching $0.0000005518, which eventually reached $0.00002445 on December 15, 2023. Bonk closed 2023 with a price tag of $0.00001407, significantly higher than the price at the start of the year but almost 50% down from the highest price point of 2023. Bonk hit key highs in 2024, including $0.00003771 in March and an all-time high of $0.00004115 in May, before dipping to $0.0000223 in August. A late-year rally peaked at $0.00005825 in November, with the token closing 2024 at $0.00003043. At the start of January 2025, Bonk is trading near $0.00003170.",Crypto Price Predictions|Bonk,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|ICO|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|BONK,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-03 15:33:00

With this move, Ethena may add an extra layer of security to its synthetic asset, USDe. Ethena Labs released its roadmap for 2025, with goals of partnering with TradFi companies. In the past year, Ethena distributed its stablecoin to decentralized protocols, showing it was a reliable asset for lending and collaterals. Ethena survived 2024 despite doubts about the stability of USDe, boosted by the overall bullish trend. For the whole of 2024, Ethena achieved $276.47M, with peak earnings of $7.21M for November. The protocol managed to follow its roadmap of varied ETH scenarios, curbing the supply of USDe during slower market months. Toward the end of 2024, USDe expanded again above 6B tokens by December 20. Since then, the supply of USDe slid slightly to 5.9B, though still near peak supply. Currently, 4.2B of those tokens are locked in staking, with a premium price of $1.14. Staked USDe has a protective mechanism against mass withdrawals, thus protecting the $1 price for USDe. Ethena plans to offer sUSDe to traditional companies After testing sUSDe for months with other DeFi protocols, Ethena will build a new product, iUSDe. The product will spread the stablecoin to traditional financial companies by parking the assets in a special smart contract. All TradFi partners will have access to the token’s yield without having to handle any on-chain transfers. By the end of January, Ethena plans to announce all partners who have accepted USDe exposure. The new use case will add legitimacy to USDe, which still suffers from doubts linked to the 2022 bear market and the risks for synthetic stablecoins. Ethena will seek out new partners throughout Q1, contacting asset managers, private funds, ETF product issuers, private trusts, and brokers. The goal is to offer direct exposure to passive income, including long-term holding of sUSDe. The end goal is to attract as much as $10B flowing into iUSDe products, balancing token issuance through both traditional and on-chain finance. If successful, the mission to target TradFi organizations may bring significant inflows into Ethena. Since Ethena taps the most active crypto markets, its stablecoin potential works at the scale of billions, already suitable for some forms of traditional investments. At the same time, the returns will be produced purely out of crypto assets, as Ethena has done in the first year of expanding its activity. Ethena’s success hinges on expectations of a more active bull market in 2025 The decision to offer passive income to TradFi clients comes after the basis trade in the crypto market turned into a reliable source of income. By far, Ethena has tapped one of the largest reliable sources of real cash flow in the entire space. The 2024 bull market expanded the basis trade profitability by 300% while producing one of the favorable scenarios for Ethena. The basis trade for $110B in open interest may bring in $10B, based on the bullish scenario predictions. Ethena also presupposes a scenario where BTC rises to $200K in the coming year, further boosting the cash flows of the basis trade. However, the potential for earnings may be limited by the inherent unpredictability of the crypto market. Ethena’s involvement with the basis trade taps around 7% of the crypto market open interest. The supply of USDe is correlated to the mix of open interest shares and the price performance of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). In the case of an even more active bull market in 2025, USDe will grow, leaving space for traditional institutions to join. The size of the basis within the crypto markets is not well understood. It is by far the largest potential source of real cash flow in the entire space and has increased more than 3x in the year since Ethena launched. Importantly, this is a sufficient scale to interest traditional finance as an opportunity. In 2025, Ethena envisions falling interest rates, which will have a double effect on the crypto market. Increased liquidity and monetary easing will boost the crypto market, and Ethena’s products will offer more appealing returns.

The recent record-high outflow beats its previous record of roughly $189 million posted on Christmas Eve. Despite the hiccups in the new year, IBIT had a blockbuster run in 2024. BlackRock’s IBIT Kicks Off 2025 With Jaw-Dropping $332 Million Outflow As U.S. trading resumed following the New Year’s Day closure, BlackRock’s Nasdaq-listed IBIT reported net outflows of over $332.6 million, data from Farside Investors shows. The huge IBIT outflows drove U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds overall flows into the negative territory on Thursday, even as several other BTC ETFs recorded moderate inflows. In total, the dozen Bitcoin ETFs reported net outflows of $242 million. Bitwise’s BITB led daily inflows with $48.3 million, followed by Fidelity FBTC’s $36.2 million. ARK Invest and 21Shares’ ARKB, Grayscale mini Bitcoin Trust, and VanEck’s HODL also posted net inflows on Dec. 2. The only other fund that saw a net outflow was Grayscale’s GBTC, totaling $23.13 million. IBIT has experienced a series of net outflows since Dec. 20. While massive outflows can be seen as a sign of a lack of confidence in the ETF, BlackRock’s ETF still ranks third for inflows among all ETFs in the US in 2024 with $37 billion, as per data shared by Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas. The Vanguard 500 Index Fund, with $116 billion in inflows for the year, leads the charge. The iShares Core S&P 500 ETF ranks second with $89 billion in inflows. “So maybe in 2025, Bitcoin ETFs take top spot via more inflows and higher prices,” posited Bitcoin pioneer Adam Back. Bitcoin Price Languishes Below $100,000 Meanwhile, the price of Bitcoin has been struggling below the $100K mark amid the record outflows from the largest public fund tracking BTC and an increasingly hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve. As of press time, CoinGecko data indicates that Bitcoin is changing hands for roughly $97,156 after gaining 0.1% over the last 24 hours and 1.9% in the past seven days. The current price is nearly 10.3% below the alpha crypto’s current all-time high of $108,135 posted on Dec. 17.

The suspension, announced on January 2, 2025, is aimed at protecting users from risks associated with the token on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network. Following the news, TROY dropped 40%, currently trading at $0.0047 with a trading volume of $522. According to Binance, TROY’s project team has not given any clarification on the glitch which makes it unstable. This is also a serious security glitch giving a bad reputation to the firm. Why the Suspension? The decision stems from Binance’s concerns about the collateral backing the minted tokens on BSC. The exchange is actively working with the TROY project team to resolve the issue. However, the project has yet to provide enough clarity about the situation. Binance has stated that deposits for TROY (BSC) will only resume if the token is deemed safe. It also clarified that no further announcement will be made if deposits are reopened. While deposits on BSC are paused, other services for TROY, such as deposits and withdrawals via the Ethereum network, are not affected. This ensures users can still manage their TROY assets on Ethereum without disruption. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinbase Expands in Europe with BUX Cyprus Acquisition , TROY Responds to Rumors Amid the suspension, TROY addressed rumors about its acquisition. The project denied claims of being taken over, labeling the rumors as false. Instead, TROY revealed that it is in the process of acquiring another AI Agent project. In a statement shared on X, TROY said , “The rumors circulating in the market about TROY being acquired are inauthentic and not supported by any evidence. Currently, TROY is in the process of acquiring another AI Agent project. The acquisition is still ongoing.” What’s Next? Binance continues to work closely with the TROY team to ensure the safety of its users. Until the issue is resolved, users are encouraged to stay informed through official updates from Binance and TROY. This situation highlights the importance of security and transparency in the crypto industry, as Binance takes steps to maintain trust and protect its community. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

By press time on January 3, 2025, the most interesting and suspicious example came in the form of a series of meme coin purchases executed by Representative Mike Collins, Georgia’s 10th congressional district. Since December 1, 2024, Collins has bought up to $45,000 of a token called Ski Mask Dog (SKI), arguably helping the minor digital asset skyrocket in value.

At press time, just one month later, Ski Mask Dog was changing hands at $0.2491, meaning the Representative made up to $58,000 as his original investment – worth up to $45,000 – could have appreciated to about $108,000. SKI 12-month price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap The final SKI batch is particularly suspicious as, unlike the first two trades that were filed by December 2, it remained undisclosed until New Year’s Day, raising the question of why there was such a long waiting period and of how many additional trades the politician made. Furthermore, the entire trade demonstrates the possibility that Congressional trading has become a tool of price manipulation – either intentional or accidental. The fact that SKI rallied from about $0.09 before the initial purchase was disclosed to a short-lived peak above $0.35 just days later, and by the fact the meme coin is up more than 20% in the last 24 hours – shortly after the January 1 filing was made – lends additional credence to the notion. Is Congressional trading destabilizing the markets? The reputation many Congresspeople have as savvy traders created a phenomenon in which many regular investors seek to mimic their strategies , generating substantial buying pressure as soon as the filings are made public. A similar trend is seen with some other public figures, such as Elon Musk as his statements, X posts, and other actions are known to cause significant market shifts. A meme coin called KEKIUS MAXIMUS (KEKIUS) exploded in value around the New Year after the South African-Canadian-American billionaire changed his name and profile picture on social media to Kekius Maximus, enabling at least one trader to turn a $66 investment into more than $3 million in profit .

Historical Trends Suggest It’s Possible,https://zycrypto.com/can-pepe-hit-2500-growth-again-historical-trends-suggest-its-possible/,"PEPE, the third-largest meme coin by market capitalization, has faced challenges recently, extending its price decline from the previous week. After reaching a local high of $0.000028 on December 9, fueled by a broader market resurgence led by Bitcoin, the frog-themed token has entered a retracement phase. However, despite this pullback, PEPE remains a standout performer among meme coins. With an impressive year-to-date gain of over 1600%, it continues to outpace its primary rivals, SHIB and DOGE, which have posted more modest increases of 100% and 323%, respectively. Meanwhile, as the market cools off, analysts are speculating that PEPE could be gearing up for a major upward movement. On Wednesday, Chandler Bing, a prominent analyst in the memecoin community, described PEPE’s current pullback as “just noise” in a tweet. He emphasized that PEPE could be on the brink of a massive price surge, projecting a potential 2,500% rally reminiscent of its explosive 2021 growth. Bing further suggested that PEPE’s market cap could potentially rival SHIB’s 2021 all-time high, marking a significant milestone for the frog-themed coin. “ Historically, from one range low to the next range high, there was always around a 2500% growth. Will the next range high match SHIB 2021 ATH market cap? PEPE.” He noted, adding in another tweet , “ In October 2021, SHIB briefly surpassed DOGE in market capitalization, becoming the most valuable meme coin. Now think about what PEPE is capable of.” To evaluate this possibility, it’s essential to consider PEPE’s current market environment. Like other successful meme coins, PEPE’s potential for exponential growth depends on a combination of community enthusiasm, market momentum, and virality. Notably, SHIB’s meteoric rise in 2021 established a benchmark for meme coins, and PEPE’s performance suggests it could follow a similar trajectory if these factors align. Notably, a 2,500% surge by PEPE from current prices would place its value around $0.00056. Adding to the optimism is the recent activity by whales. This month alone, whales have accumulated hundreds of billions of PEPE holdings, indicating confidence in the token’s future. Interestingly, earlier this month, PEPE’s market cap even reached an impressive $11 billion, surpassing Ethereum’s DeFi cornerstone Uniswap and briefly breaking into the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Over the past few days, PEPE has re-entered the top 10 most-traded cryptocurrencies, as per data from CoinGecko, signaling heightened interest and activity. PEPE was trading at $0.00002119 at press time, reflecting a 3.65% surge in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|PEPE,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|PEPE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-03 15:50:50

This Data Reached a Record Level!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/the-balance-between-bitcoin-and-ethereum-is-changing-this-data-reached-a-record-level/,"While Bitcoin (BTC) is leaving behind a successful 2024, the same cannot be said for Ethereum (ETH). Despite receiving ETF approval, ETH did not perform as expected and closed 2024 with a modest increase of 54%. But things are starting to change for Ethereum. According to CryptoQuant data, Ethereum leverage has reached a record high. It was stated that this situation is a sign that Ethereum has emerged as the preferred main currency for investors doing leveraged trading, compared to BTC. According to CryptoQuant data, ETH leverage has risen to a record high of 0.57, reflecting increased risk-taking. According to analysts, this marks a sharp rise from 0.37 at the beginning of Q4 2024. The rising leverage ratio in Ethereum shows that investors are increasingly using more leverage and taking more risk. Compared to Ethereum’s high leverage, Bitcoin’s leverage is at 0.269, the highest since early 2023 and still below its ATH. As a result, analysts warned investors that ETH's high leverage could lead to 2x higher volatility compared to BTC. *This is not investment advice.

On the other hand, they have both experienced exponential growth in past cycles, but there are questions surrounding the future outlook for the Cardano and Ethereum prices. In this climate of uncertainty, a new player has risen on the scene. Can ETH ETFs Help the Ethereum Price Bounce Back? As a market mover, the Ethereum price is no stranger to market volatility. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,456, which is still a far cry from ETH’s ATH of $4,878 in November of 2021. As with any market, the performance of the Ethereum price has been influenced by the macro and away from investor sentiment. On the downside, its recent ETH ETF inflows helped the price rebound. ETH ETFs are actively trading as of January 2, 2025, allowing investors to gain regulated exposure to Ethereum price movements. ETH continued to get inflows during the final quarter of 2024. At the beginning of 2025, the ETH ETFs saw inflows — a sharp reversal from the outflow seen on December 30. This is a change that exhibits growing confidence on behalf of the crypto market for the Ethereum price. The approval and trading of ETH ETFs are ultimately great feats for Ethereum and the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem as it brings more opportunity for investors to be able to buy and sell Ethereum in a regulated manner. Yet, the market is still somewhat volatile, and investors should stay up to date regarding what influences the Ethereum price performance and latest ETH ETF news. Cardano’s ADA: Down 30% on Monthly Charts A bearish sentiment has been consistently hampering Cardano’s ADA. Its price has dropped more than 30% over the past months market concerns continue to brew. While these worries linger for Cardano, the project is certainly pushing ahead on the dApps and DeFi side which is a glimmer of hope for ADA investors. Cardano has historically provided tremendous returns for early investors, although it is constrained by a large market cap of $33 billion and its appreciated existing value. The analysts indicated that the ADA markets might recover to $1. The increase of Cardano could lead to a positive shift to IntelMarkets (INTL), a $0.07 altcoin that’s gone viral. IntelMarkets (INTL): A Game-Changer in the Making Introducing its revolutionary artificial intelligence and decentralized finance (AI-DeFi) platform, IntelMarkets brings together blockchain technology and artificial intelligence to build a trading ecosystem designed for retail investors. Operating on both Ethereum and Solana, the dual chains of the platform enable seamless and fast operation. According to industry experts, IntelMarkets differentiates itself by focusing on transforming the $36 billion global crypto trading market. INTL is in a unique position as it has a lower valuation than Ethereum and Cardano, which have mature market caps. Led by a team of MIT and Open AI alumni, early backers have shown significant confidence in the project by pledging over $5 million in presale funding. IntelMarkets has a unique AI DeFi narrative, low entry point and has the potential to disrupt the crypto trading realm. While ETH and ADA try to recover, INTL’s presale is a no-brainer for savvy investors. Use the promo code INTL20 for 20% extra on your deposit!

Pepe (PEPE) Pepe (PEPE) is the latest buzz in the cryptocurrency world. Launched on Ethereum, this deflationary memecoin is a tribute to Matt Furie’s Pepe the Frog, an internet meme that charmed the early 2000s. PEPE embraces its role as a pure meme token with no utility claims, attracting fans with its no-tax policy and straightforward approach. It’s riding the wave created by other meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, aiming to leap into the top ranks of meme-based cryptocurrencies. In a surprising turn between April and May 2023, PEPE’s market cap soared to a staggering $1.6 billion. Early holders became millionaires overnight, and a community of enthusiasts quickly formed. This surge ignited a “memecoin season,” with new meme coins popping up and experiencing wild price swings. With a roadmap that includes listings on major exchanges and a planned “meme takeover,” PEPE has significant momentum. As the crypto community awaits the next Bitcoin halving and a potential Bull Run, many are watching to see if PEPE can reach new heights. Its blend of internet culture and crypto simplicity makes it a standout contender in the current market cycle. Moo Deng (MOODENG) Moo Deng, a pygmy hippopotamus from Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand, has captured hearts worldwide. At just two months old in September 2024, her adorable photos and videos exploded across the internet. With her cute, chubby cheeks and playful antics, Moo Deng became an instant meme sensation. People couldn’t get enough of her energetic personality and charming presence, making her a symbol of joy and fun. Now, Moo Deng’s legacy lives on the Solana blockchain with the launch of Moon Deng. This new coin embodies her spirit, aiming to create waves in the crypto world. Built on Solana’s fast and efficient technology, Moon Deng offers potential for growth in the current market cycle. Compared to other coins, it stands out with its unique backstory and the enthusiastic community rallying behind it. Joining Moon Deng isn’t just an investment; it’s an invitation to be part of a delightful journey. So why not hop on and join her on the moon? Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) There’s a new token scampering around the Solana blockchain, and it’s called PNUT. Inspired by the world of memes, PNUT is a cryptocurrency designed for those who love a good laugh and the thrill of crypto. With a playful squirrel mascot named Pnut—imagine a cheeky, Pepe-like character—the token embodies a lighthearted and community-driven spirit. PNUT has a total supply of 100 million tokens, zero transaction taxes, a revoked contract, and a burnt liquidity pool, all of which aim to ensure the security and safety of holders’ assets. You can get your hands on some PNUT through platforms like Jupiter Aggregator. In the current market, PNUT stands out as a fresh and fun addition. Its meme-inspired nature taps into the growing trend of community-driven tokens that prioritize engagement and enjoyment. Unlike some coins bogged down by complex mechanics or high fees, PNUT’s simplicity and zero transaction taxes make it accessible to everyone. As the crypto community continues to embrace meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, PNUT could ride the wave of popularity. Its presence on the Solana blockchain also offers the benefits of speed and low transaction costs. If you’re looking for a new coin that combines fun and potential, PNUT might just be the next nut to crack. Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat (WIF) is the latest dog-themed meme coin gaining attention in the crypto world. Inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme, this new token runs on the Solana blockchain. Meme coins like WIF are known for their fun and community-driven nature. They often start as internet jokes but can grow popular quickly. Dog-themed tokens have a special place in the crypto space, with coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu leading the way. WIF aims to create a sense of community and enjoyment among its users. Running on Solana means it can offer fast transactions and low fees. In the current market, meme coins continue to attract interest, especially from those looking for the next big thing. While WIF is making waves, it’s important to remember that meme coins can be very volatile. Compared to established coins, they carry higher risks but also the potential for high rewards. As the crypto market evolves, WIF might catch the eye of those exploring new opportunities in the meme coin arena. Conclusion As the bull run of 2024 unfolds, PEPE, MOODENG, PNUT, and WIF are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out as the pioneering all-sport memecoin aiming for unprecedented growth.

This rally comes as market sentiment shifts positively, fueling a broader resurgence in altcoins. With Solana now gaining significant traction, many are asking whether this marks the beginning of a massive rally for the high-performance blockchain. Related Reading: Chainlink Tunrns Resistance Into Support – ATH Next? Top analyst Jelle recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting a critical development in Solana’s price action. According to Jelle, SOL has successfully broken a daily downtrend that originated after it reached its all-time high. This breakout is viewed as a bullish signal, suggesting that Solana may be gearing up for a more extended upward move in the coming weeks. The $210 mark is crucial for Solana, as flipping it into support could pave the way for a sustained rally. With altcoins showing strength across the board, investors will be closely watching Solana’s ability to capitalize on this momentum. As the new year unfolds, the question remains: can Solana leverage this bullish start to achieve new highs and solidify its position as a leading force in the crypto market? Price Action Suggests An Upcoming Move As the crypto market rebounds from local lows, Solana is riding the wave with impressive momentum. The altcoin giant has continued to rise after holding a critical demand level above the $180 mark. This has sparked optimism among investors, who increasingly view Solana as a resilient and promising asset in the current market environment. Top analyst Jelle recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, highlighting several bullish developments for Solana. According to Jelle, SOL has not only broken out of its prolonged downtrend but has also reclaimed crucial monthly and weekly support levels. Additionally, Solana is now trading back above its 50-day exponential moving average (EMA), signaling a renewed bullish structure and growing strength in its price action. These technical signals suggest Solana is preparing for a significant move, potentially driving the price to new all-time highs. However, such a breakout will require strong market participation and favorable sentiment in the coming weeks to sustain the rally. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Testing A Significant Support Zone – Bullish Breakout Ahead? For now, Solana’s performance is a testament to its resilience, positioning it as a top contender for those seeking growth opportunities in the altcoin market. Solana Testing Technical Levels The Solana (SOL) daily chart is showing promising signs of strength after a sharp bounce from the critical $175 level, which coincided perfectly with the 200-day EMA. This technical rebound has propelled the price to a key supply zone at $210, a significant milestone as SOL continues to push higher. For bulls, the immediate target must be the $230 level. Reclaiming this area as support would likely trigger a fast and aggressive rally. Driving Solana into uncharted territory with new all-time highs. The confluence of technical indicators and recent bullish momentum suggests this scenario is achievable if the broader market continues to support the trend.

If Solana fails to reclaim the $230 mark in the coming weeks, the momentum could weaken, leading to sideways consolidation.

38475851,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99763,1735920162,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Analyst Predicts Ethereum’s “Big Move Still Ahead” As Whale Holdings Hit Record Highs,https://zycrypto.com/analyst-predicts-ethereums-big-move-still-ahead-as-whale-holdings-hit-record-highs/,"Despite a spirited effort to maintain its position above the critical $4,000 level, having breached it twice this month, Ethereum bulls ultimately lost control, with the price pulling back since. Notably, unlike other major altcoins, Ethereum has shown relatively low volatility in recent days, climbing only about 20% in the past 30 days, a modest gain compared to its peers. However, behind the scenes, whale activity has surged, indicating preparation for a possible bull run. In a tweet on Tuesday, crypto analytics firm Santiment spotlighted the increasing concentration of Ethereum in whale wallets, offering insights into how the asset is distributed among various investor groups. Wallets holding at least 100,000 ETH now account for 57.35% of the total Ethereum supply, marking their highest-ever share, with a combined value of approximately $333.1 billion. Meanwhile, mid-sized wallets holding between 100 and 100,000 ETH have hit their lowest supply share in history. Similarly, smaller wallets with less than 100 ETH are at a near four-year low in holdings. Santiment emphasized that this level of whale accumulation is typically a bullish signal for Ethereum’s long-term outlook, reflecting confidence among major investors . “It is still generally a bullish long-term signal when a coin’s most prominent key stakeholders continue accumulating, especially when it’s a 9-year-old asset with whales holding their highest-ever portion of coins.” The analysts noted. Notably, while such whale concentration could raise concerns about centralization, analysts argue it reflects confidence in Ethereum’s long-term prospects. Historically, Ethereum has experienced explosive price increases during bull markets when whales transition to the “belief phase” and begin accumulating. Supporting this narrative, analysts from IntoTheBlock also noted a significant net outflow of Ethereum from exchanges. “Since the beginning of December, the $ETH netflow from exchanges has predominantly been negative. Over 400K ETH have flowed out since December 1st, suggesting a trend of accumulation.” They tweeted . This accumulation aligns with Ethereum’s growing importance in decentralized finance (DeFi) and staking. Following the Merge, stakers now earn yields for locking up their ETH, reducing its circulating supply. As staking activity grows, more investors see Ethereum as a price appreciation asset and a tool to generate passive income. Elsewhere, analysts are increasingly optimistic about Ethereum’s price trajectory. A pseudonymous analyst, VentureFounder, recently highlighted a bullish cup-and-handle pattern in Ethereum’s chart, predicting potential growth to $7,238 within four months. Moreover, firms like VanEck and Bitwise have recently forecasted Ethereum prices of $6,000 to $7,000, reinforcing the bullish outlook. Similarly, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared a shorter-term projection on Wednesday, noting that “Once Ethereum ETH clears the $4,100 resistance, $6,000 will become a magnet.” At press time, ETH was trading at $3,562, reflecting a 3.33% increase in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|News|Cryptocurrency News|Ethereum News|ETHUSD|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-03 16:02:42

That’s because $WEPE has been flying into investors’ hands far quicker than expected. The presale comes hot off the back of another unprecedentedly large Pepe-themed ICO, Pepe Unchained, which raised a sweltering $74 million and brough 5X returns on launch. We have learned two things from this sudden spate of end-of-year activity. Firstly, the best meme coin projects are no longer just for speculation. Like Wall Street Pepe, they’re now rallying whole communities to their cause by helping bring about the democratization of wealth envisioned by crypto’s inventors. Wall Street Pepe’s USP is that token holders go from naive meme coin fans to Wall Street-savvy traders with the help of unique trading insights not shared with anyone that doesn’t hold $WEPE. $WEPE is currently priced at $0.00036641, but with less than 48 hours before the next stage kicks in, prospective token buyers will need to expedite their decision-making in order to grab the lowest available price. $40M raised. Frogs strong together. The future is green. pic.twitter.com/ijSnXJq9x9 — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) January 3, 2025 How Wall Street Pepe Raised Millions In a Few Weeks Wall Street Pepe is the biggest presale to straddle both 2024 and 2025. It launched back in December and quickly raised an army that, like Dogecoin’s self-styled “Doge Army” before it, rallied around its favorite coin to take it to new heights. That’s because Wall Street Pepe makes the secret world of alpha calls accessible to everybody. The hidden below-the-radar market-moving news flow will no longer be for whales only. Wall Street Pepe is building its own alpha group for little fish who want to beat the whales. With its community-driven approach, Wall Street Pepe could easily have a leviathan impact in the market, leveraging the collective strength of its community to offer $WEPE holders more than just an investment – indeed, $WEPE catalyzes a new movement to give the little guys a leg up. Now, some $40 million into its ICO, $WEPE could beat $PEPE to become the hottest Boy’s Club coin, as its ‘frogs strong together’ rallying cry of the $WEPE Army attracts legions of new followers every day. In just a few weeks, the project has amassed around 30,000 followers on its X account and 13,100 on its Telegram channel . Influencers Eye a Potential 10X Investment at Launch YouTube Web3 Influencer Cilinix Crypto told his 90,000 followers that he thinks $WEPE could be 10x at launch because of its community-building vision, which incentivizes the little fish to trade alpha and think collectively to become big fish. The “$WEPE Army” trading group will be exclusive to Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) token holders. It will be populated with experienced, sophisticated, expert traders who will share their strategies as they keep the community on course to increase profitability. Ultimately projects like $WEPE mean that retail investors will no longer be the ones left holding the bag when the whales dump on a coin. The $WEPE Army will have the collective eyes, ears, and market muscle to splash away the whales. After Pepe and Pepe Unchained, $WEPE is Pepe’s Next Biggest Web3 Outing Pepe is the name behind some of crypto’s biggest runaway successes. Whether he’s powering the $8.75 billion Pepe, the third largest meme coin and the biggest non-canine coin, or whether he’s the face of a Layer 2 ecosystem that recently raised an eye-popping $74 million at presale, you don’t want to miss the next big frog play. To join the $WEPE Army , visit the Wall Street Pepe website, connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ), and purchase $WEPE using ETH or USDT. You can also pay by bank card. You gain instant access to real-time data and updates about Wall Street Pepe by using Best Wallet. Additionally, you can view your $WEPE token in your wallet before the official claim date, allowing you to track the progress of your investment. Download the Best Wallet app from Google Play or the Apple App Store to start.

Pro XRP lawyer John Deaton has issued a stern warning about evolving crypto scams. Deaton urged users to exercise caution and vigilance in safeguarding their digital assets. Crypto Scam Alert: John Deaton Warns Users Against Evolving Tactics In a detailed post on social media, John Deaton highlighted the dangers of sophisticated crypto scams targeting new and experienced users. Deaton stressed the importance of never sharing sensitive information like seed phrases or passwords. These details act as the key to accessing a user’s crypto wallet and can lead to the complete loss of funds. Deaton shared a personal story about a near-miss incident where scammers hijacked his home WiFi and attempted to trick him into revealing his login credentials. The attackers used fake emails and calls posing as customer support representatives. John Deaton described the moment as a critical learning experience. He emphasized that scammers often create a sense of urgency to manipulate their targets. The Pro XRP Lawyer added, “What people need to understand is that, not only do the emails look official, but it creates a sense of urgency and fear. The email states that your funds are at risk and you need to take immediate steps to protect your funds or they could be lost forever.” Amid the increasing wave of crypto scams, Pudgy Penguins NFT holders have become the latest target. Coingape recently reported that scammers are using deceptive Google ads to lure users to fake websites designed to steal wallet credentials. This incident highlights the growing sophistication of attacks in the Web3 space and the urgent need for heightened security measures. Sophisticated YouTube Scams Target Crypto Enthusiasts A recent cybersecurity report from Kaspersky uncovered a new scam involving the use of YouTube comments. Scammers post crypto wallet seed phrases, claiming to seek assistance in transferring funds. These comments appear under finance-related videos and often portray the scammers as naïve beginners. When an unscrupulous individual attempts to access the wallet using the shared seed phrase, they find it contains cryptocurrency, often USDT. However, to withdraw these funds, a small fee in TRX tokens is required. Victims transferring TRX to the wallet for fees soon discover their tokens are automatically redirected to the scammer’s account. Multi-Signature Wallets: The New Tool in Crypto Scams The wallet used in these scams is typically a multi-signature wallet , which requires multiple approvals to authorize transactions. This setup makes it impossible for the would-be thief to move the funds, even after sending TRX for fees. Instead, their TRX tokens are immediately drained, leaving them empty-handed. More so, John Deaton pointed out that these scams exploit human greed, turning opportunistic individuals into victims.

Whether you’re an experienced investor or a curious newcomer, picking the best altcoins to join in January 2025 could be your ticket to riding this financial revolution. Three coins—Qubetics, Bitcoin, and Binance—are standing out this month, each for their unique approach to blockchain innovation. Now, before you dismiss this as just another list, let’s dive deeper. Each of these projects is tackling real-world challenges, offering features that go beyond hype and speculation.

If you’re ready to learn why these altcoins deserve a place in your portfolio, let’s get started.

Enter Qubetics, a blockchain platform designed for those who crave freedom and security in managing their digital finances. At the heart of Qubetics is its non-custodial wallet, giving you full control over your assets.

BNB has seen consistent growth, fuelled by its use cases within the Binance ecosystem. Whether it’s reducing trading fees, participating in token sales, or staking for rewards, BNB is a versatile asset that continues to provide value to its holders.

According to a blog post , this upgrade is set to happen on January 7, 2025, at block height 2,201,472. This change is important for DASH, a cryptocurrency focused on privacy. Binance has Everything Under Control To upgrade the DASH token, Binance will pause deposits and withdrawals starting at 19:00 (UTC) on January 7, 2025. To avoid interruptions, the exchange asked users to ensure the completion of any deposits or withdrawals before this time. Binance will handle all technical parts of the upgrade, making the transition smooth and easy. Importantly, users can still buy, sell, and trade DASH even though deposits and withdrawals are temporarily suspended. Once the DASH network is stable after the upgrade, Binance will reopen deposits and withdrawals. The exchange will update users on the network’s status and tell them when to resume regular transactions. Binance’s Unstoppable Dominance Interestingly, Binance has supported lots of upgrades in the past. The exchange facilitated smooth trading and handled technical processes in the BCH hard fork some years ago. Just recently, Binance led other exchanges with over $75 trillion . This is less than a quarter of Binance’s volume, highlighting its huge influence on the ecosystem. Despite the exchange’s numerous legal issues, market analysts have lauded Binance’s performance. Last year, the exchange co-founder Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao pleaded guilty and had to reign as chief executive officer. The exchange has continued striving for the best in the cryptocurrency industry. A New Era of On-Chain Governance Recall that Cardano, the Layer-1 blockchain, has finally executed the Chang hard fork , ushering in the “Voltaire Era.” The execution of the hard fork at block 10,764,778 introduces a new on-chain governance system using Cardano’s native token, ADA. As reported by TheCoinRise, the Voltaire era signals true decentralization using the infrastructure introduced during the Shelley era. It will also facilitate Cardano’s network becoming self-sustaining. As for the Chang hard fork , the first phase has gone live and ushered in the constitutional committee, overseeing the governance transition process. The next step involves introducing DReps. In this phase, ADA holders can delegate their voting power to an on-chain voting system in 2025, when full implementation will take off.

Related Reading: Shiba Inu 260% Rally: Analyst Sees Classic Bullish Patterns Emerging This projection isn’t just speculative; Steno’s analysis cites a number of positive economic variables, rising institutional interest, and the growing presence of cryptocurrency ETFs. However, the question remains: can these digital assets genuinely reach such amazing milestones? The Crypto ETF Boom: A Game Changer? Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are likely to play a significant role. Bitcoin, in particular, is expected to profit from nearly $50 billion in net inflows as institutional investors become more interested in these products. Ethereum is still a big player, but it’s expected to get $28 billion, thanks to similar trends in usage. These funds could bring a lot of cash into the cryptocurrency market, which would cause prices to rise even more. Similar to 2024, we expect the U.S. crypto ETFs to take center stage once again in 2025, partly due to the direct buying pressure they generate and partly because they serve as a proxy for non-native crypto retail and institutional interest in the asset class.

As governments throughout the world shift their sentiment on digital assets, cryptocurrencies’ prospects improve. Bitcoin’s solid price performance in particular appears to be linked to the rising acceptance of cryptocurrency as a viable asset class. This, paired with good macroeconomic conditions, prepares Bitcoin and Ethereum for tremendous growth over the next coming months. Bitcoin And Long-Term Strategy The research believes 2025 macroeconomic conditions will support the growth of cryptocurrencies. The popularity of cryptocurrencies as an inflation hedge and store of wealth boosts investor confidence. This implies that mainstream investors are more likely to use Bitcoin for long-term portfolio diversification, while Ethereum’s potential for decentralized finance and smart contracts makes it an attractive alternative. Some analysts believe Bitcoin’s price will rise as consumer and institutional demand grows. Ethereum’s adoption in DeFi and NFT marketplaces suggests a price hike.

In a post on X, Consorti explained that USD is at its strongest level in twenty-six months, which has historically been challenging for BTC. He said : “Incidentally, the last time USD had strengthened from this level on its way to the top, $BTC dropped 25% — $BTC has corrected 15% so far. Dollar strength may spill more $BTC blood before it gets better.” His view is not surprising, given that many in the crypto community have also noted the rising strength of the USD with concern. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the value of the USD relative to a basket of other fiat currencies, including the Euros, Pounds Sterling, and Yen, has been increasing since Donald Trump was elected president, reaching a two-year high on Thursday. With over 3% gains relative to other fiat currencies in the past three months, there are concerns that Bitcoin could suffer if the USD continues to strengthen. Historically, risk assets such as BTC and stocks perform poorly when the USD is strong. Besides that, there are concerns that a stronger dollar will affect Bitcoin demand. Timothy Peterson noted that a stronger dollar makes Bitcoin more expensive for non-dollar investors since it is usually priced and traded in USD. Thus, it can make it less affordable and put downward pressure on the BTC price. What’s driving DXY performance Several factors have caused the DXY to increase, including Trump’s threat of imposing tariffs on trading partners, which could lead to market turbulence and attract demand for dollars. With the threat of tariffs from the incoming Trump administration, Euros and other currencies have been struggling against USD, causing the DXY index to increase. Beyond that, the US economy has also performed better compared to its trading partners. It has achieved the much-desired soft landing, keeping inflation minimal and seeing sizable growth in gross domestic product (GDP). The country saw an unexpected eight-month low in weekly jobless claims this week, with around 9,000 declining to 211,000. Nevertheless, not everyone is convinced that the DXY will continue increasing. Steno Research CEO Andreas Steno noted that the USD might have peaked against the Euro if the previous performance in 2016/17 is anything to go by. Thus, investors need to be cautious about their positions. Bank of America believes USD is overvalued (Source: Barchart ) However, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen believes DXY still has more room to run. He predicted that DXY would reach a local top by 2025 Q1 and might stay at that level for a while. Experts believe Bitcoin will thrive even with a strong USD While the USD’s strengthening raises concerns, everyone agrees that a strengthened dollar will not affect BTC’s performance much. Bitcoin Writer Mitchell Askew believes that the USD’s strength is only in relation to other fiat currencies and not relative to commodities such as Bitcoin. To buttress this point, financial analyst John Kicklighter user noted that US Crude performance. He said: “The US dollar is strong when compared to other major currencies, but not necessarily when leveled up to commodities. US crude has charged higher for a fourth consecutive session and cleared a zone that has played both support and resistance.” Thus, Askew believes the same applies to BTC because the DXY has been rising since September but did not stop BTC from hitting its all-time high in December. Onchain metrics also show that BTC is still in the middle of a bull run despite the almost 10% decline from its peak. CryptoQuant analyst Avocadoonchain observed that metrics such as Adjusted SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio), Miner Position Index (MPI), and Total network fees over 7-day SMA support this thesis. They wrote: “On-chain data suggests the bull market is still intact, and the current phase appears to be a cooling-off period rather than a cycle peak.” However, data also shows that Coinbase Premium has fallen to a 12-month low, which analysts believe signals US investors’ lack of institutional demand and cautious approach.

Pepecoin (PEPE): Meme Coin Mania Continues A beloved meme coin, Pepecoin (PEPE), has gathered a loyal community and continuous press flurry. It jumped 11% recently, with PEPE trading at $0.00002064. Pepecoin has risen considerably since its launch this year. December saw PEPE hit an all-time high of $0.00002825, which has decreased by 30% since then. While recent price pumps have been exciting, Pepecoin had very sharp corrections as it shed a lot of its previous gains. The large market capitalization of PEPE and reliance on speculation interest, given its growth, have led many experts to argue that its upside potential is now limited. However, if your trade horizon is short-term, then Pepecoin still serves its purpose. For investors seeking long-term, game-changing growth, however, the focus has shifted elsewhere. Litecoin (LTC): Bitcoin’s Silver Litecoin (LTC) is called the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold” and is still an agile blockchain network with low transaction fees and high speed processing. LTC has seen a recent 10% spike, reaching $108.32. With half a billion worth of trading volume, and a market capitalization of over $8 billion, recent times have seen Litecoin on the up and up. Litecoin is a trusted asset, but it hasn’t been able to replicate the explosive exponential growth we’re seeing with newer projects. The last time LTC rallied that strongly was back in late 2021, when it briefly hit $410. This 75% decrease in Litecoin’s price is a worrying signal for investors. Since then, it has traded in a narrower range, compounding moderately when other assets fogged around it. Conservative investors tend to be attracted to Litecoin’s maturity and presence. However, clearly, its growth potential is decidedly less than that of emerging players such as IntelMarkets, which also boast innovation and untapped market potential. Conclusion Pepecoin (PEPE) and Litecoin (LTC) have been showing recent strength but have limited potential to grow compared with the new and high-growth IntelMarkets (INTL). IntelMarkets is poised to take the $264 billion crypto trading market by storm with its AI-powered trading platform and make historic returns available to early adopters. Investors looking for the next big thing to buy to make profits should consider IntelMarkets as the best crypto to invest in for both outstanding.

The king of cryptos just reclaimed $98,000 for the first time in weeks after a weak year-end performance, with intraday prices ranging from a low of $96,016.63 to a high of $98,539.00. The correction was triggered by a hawkish interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve, along with a diss against Bitcoin itself. Fed chair Jerome Powell said he wanted nothing to do with crypto, and Bitcoin took that quite personally. Still, last year was one for the history books. Bitcoin came out as the best investment asset by far, outperforming quite literally everything else after making an all-time high of $108,011. It’s hard to find an analyst who isn’t bullish on Bitcoin right now. Most expect it to double and hit $200,000 by mid-year. Some pegged theirs at $150,000 at least. The biggest catalyst to this bullish sentiment, of course, is that Washington just turned into Bitcoin’s best friend. Donald Trump’s new administration is stacked with crypto supporters. Howard Lutnick at Commerce, Paul Atkins at the SEC, and David Sacks as AI and crypto czar – they are all in.

The analyst predicts that ADA could rally to as high as $7 based on historical trends from the last bull cycle. Cardano Price Could Rally To $7 If History Repeats Itself In an X post, Javon Marks predicted that the Cardano price could rally to $7 if history repeats itself. This came as the crypto analyst noted that Cardano has recovered much of its recent pullback in a “significantly positive candle.” Marks further remarked that there could be an uptrend continuation ready, which can lead to the target of $2.7709. Following a potential rally to this target, the crypto analyst then raised the possibility of another parabolic rally to $7. He stated that the rally to $2 could only be the start, with the $7.8 level being possible in a full run similar to the last bull cycle. A run to $7.8 would represent a price gain of over 618% for Cardano from its current price level. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez’s analysis also made reference to the 2021 bull run as he predicted that the Cardano price could rally to $4 in a few weeks. The analyst drew parallels between the ADA’s current price action and its performance between November 2020 and August 2021, around when the crypto reached its current all-time high (ATH). In line with this, Martinez predicts that a surge to $4 could happen in the coming weeks. A Rally To $2 Could Happen This January In an X post , crypto analyst Sebastian predicted that the Cardano price could rally to $2 this January. This came as he noted that the ADA price has surged 12% today and is one of the leading gainers in the crypto market. The analyst opined that the Cardano is about to record a new local high very soon and added that a rally to $2 by the end of January sounds achievable at this point. Crypto analyst Satoshi Stacker also provided a bullish outlook for the ADA price . He stated that Cardano is easily pushing through resistance levels. The analyst added that this momentum is truly explosive and that the crypto wants to rally higher.

This is a 31.61% increase compared to 2023. A whopping $1.05 billion was lost to phishing attacks alone over the past year – nearly half of the total amount, according to the latest report by blockchain security firm CertiK . The attackers committed the thefts over 296 separate incidents, which is 39% of the total number of attacks. Additionally, only three of the nearly 300 incidents resulted in a $100 million loss. Source: CertiK Per the report, the number suggest that phishing attacks, on average, “typically lead to larger amounts stolen per incident than other vulnerabilities.” All four quarters of last year recorded high activity levels related to phishing attacks and private key theft. Still, Q2 saw the highest loss of $433.7 million in 67 phishing attacks. Phishing is popular due to its simplicity and effectiveness, the report says. It is not so much about technological defenses as it is about human vulnerability. Blockchain transactions make phishing “particularly devastating” as these are irreversible. In 2024, hackers returned less than $213.33 million. The numbers from 2024 are in, and the Web3 ecosystem faces significant challenges. Over $2.36B was stolen across 760 incidents, marking a 31.61% increase from the previous year.

These compromises took the second place on the most-costly attack vectors list. In total, thieves stole $855,385,570 across 65 incidents of this sort.

In 2024, Ethereum saw the most security incidents overall, with 403 of the total 760 hacks, scams, and exploits. The losses amounted to $748,688,677. Therefore, Ethereum was also the most popular chain for phishing attacks. This type of attack led to more than $297.5 million loss on Ethereum across 248 incidents. Binance Smart Chain (BSC) was the second-most targeted chain when it comes to phishing scams. Source: CertiK Overall, across all attack vectors, attackers also “heavily targeted” Bitcoin and Tron. These two chains lost $542.7 million and $133 million, respectively. Meanwhile, 39 security breaches that affected multiple chains led to $435 million in losses. The third quarter of 2024 – similarly to the third quarter of 2023 – was hit the hardest. It recorded 157 incidents and lost $753.3 million. However, observing the losses on the monthly basis, May was “the most costly month of the year.” It lost $444.4 million across 63 incidents.

Once known as the go-to launchpad for meme coins, Memepad lived through a harsh setback, and now is coming back with ambitious plans for a fresh start. The fuel for this transformation is quite explosive: strategic decisions, a strong connection with the community, and forward-thinking ideas on how to shake up the meme coin space again. With the $MPAD token launch on PumpFun just around the corner, Memepad is ready to reclaim its place as a key player in the ecosystem. A Snapshot of the Past Memepad was once a promising platform, giving early-stage meme coin projects the tools and exposure they needed to shine. But like many projects in the fast-moving crypto world, it hit some bumps in the road, leading to a period of dormancy. The platform’s journey took a sharp turn on June 21, 2024, when a breach in the raise smart contract led to the theft of 2,000 Solana, just one week after a successful public raise. This devastating event shook the team and community alike, with the stolen funds traced across blockchains and linked to the actions of a developer named Oleksandr Liutko. Despite the setback, Memepad’s team chose resilience over defeat. After exhausting all legal avenues and recovery efforts, they committed to transparency, sharing the breach details with the community and refocusing on rebuilding the platform at the time. And this pause became a chance for the team to reflect and plan a stronger comeback. The Revival Begins The turning point for Memepad came with a series of bold initiatives from an energized team determined to bring the platform back to life. Central to this effort was a community vote, where supporters had a chance to shape the platform’s future. And the overwhelming support for the relaunch showed just how much faith the community still has in Memepad’s vision. Key steps to this revival are: Enhanced Governance New systems ensure token holders have a real say in how the platform evolves. Community votes are now a foundational part of Memepad’s decision-making process. Revised Tokenomics The redesigned $MPAD token brings better rewards for holders and participants. Under the new tokenomics, investors benefit from reduced vesting schedules and a focus on long-term sustainability. What’s Next for Memepad? The roadmap ahead for Memepad is both ambitious and achievable. Here’s what’s coming: The $MPAD Launch on PumpFun Happening on Friday, 3rd January 2025 , this launch is set to breathe new life into the token. PumpFun’s dynamic platform is expected to boost $MPAD’s visibility, drawing in fresh investors and enthusiasts. This strategy includes leveraging PumpFun’s active user base, supported by a strong PR and KOL campaign. The post-launch strategy will also allocate 50% of fees generated on the Degen Zone platform to buy back $MPAD. Products and Partnerships Memepad plans to launch new products in the next 4 weeks: Degen zone, Memequest partner quests, and Redeploy of smart contracts for partner projects. Also, the team aims to collaborate with established projects and rising stars to strengthen its ecosystem and give launching projects even more resources to succeed. User Experience A sleek new interface and simplified processes will make Memepad a welcoming platform for both crypto veterans and newcomers. As highlighted in recent community messages, the redesigned platform prioritizes speed, transparency, and user empowerment. Expanding Ecosystem Tools Beyond token launches, Memepad is exploring additional tools to support meme coin creators, such as analytics dashboards and marketing assistance. Community’s Contribution One of Memepad’s most impactful moves was allowing the community to vote on key decisions. This hands-on approach ensures that Memepad’s future reflects the goals and aspirations of its core supporters. Over 86% of participants voted in favor of this revival strategy, which highlighted the community’s enthusiasm and alignment with the team’s vision. Memepad’s open communication style, including regular AMA sessions and detailed announcements, has helped build trust and foster a sense of shared ownership among users. The platform’s collaborative spirit extends beyond its operations, with the team inviting the global crypto community to join the effort of tracking stolen funds and reclaiming assets. Final Thoughts Learning from the past and focusing on meaningful improvements, Memepad plans no less but to lead the meme coin space once again. The upcoming $MPAD launch this Friday on PumpFun marks the first step in this exciting new chapter – a chapter powered by passionate users and a visionary team. As the plans take shape and momentum builds, one thing is clear: Memepad is back. With a renewed focus on community-driven developments, sustainability, and transparency, Memepad is setting the stage for a new era of success in the meme coin ecosystem.",Information,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-03 17:49:20

Top contenders include Cardano (ADA), Rollblock (RBLK), and Dogecoin (DOGE). All these projects are unique in the features they offer, though what they share is strong growth prospects and the potential for long term returns. So why are these three projects looking so promising? Rollblock Gains Popularity As GambleFi’s Rising Star Rollblock (RBLK) is making waves in the GambleFi sector pairing together the benefits of blockchain technology with iGaming to create a transparent and rewarding ecosystem for those who are enthusiastic about both iGaming and DeFi. It offers users an engaging casino with a powerful play-to-earn token at its center. With its unique revenue-sharing model and deflationary approach, Rollblock is seeing lots of attention from across the space during its presale. Key Features of Rollblock: Revenue Sharing Model Rollblock allocates a portion of its weekly profits to buy back and burn $RBLK tokens, reducing supply and increasing scarcity. Token holders benefit directly from these buybacks, while staking rewards provide additional passive income opportunities. This dual mechanism ensures long-term engagement and profitability for investors. Effortless Accessibility The platform’s design eliminates the need for complicated downloads or installations, allowing users to access games instantly. This user-friendly approach lowers barriers to entry, attracting a broader audience and fostering a thriving gaming community. Security and Scalability Rollblock’s infrastructure is built with future growth in mind, capable of handling an increasing number of users without compromising on performance. Advanced encryption protocols safeguard all transactions and user data, ensuring a secure environment for gaming and investment. Regulatory Compliance Rollblock operates as a fully licensed entity, adhering to strict regulatory standards that protect users and enhance its credibility. This legal compliance allows the platform to operate in multiple regions, expanding its global reach and user base. Cardano Gears Up For Growth In 2025 Cardano (ADA) had a relatively slow year with a 50% gain overall, and a slight dip in December. Despite this, Cardano (ADA) has been preparing for big gains in the long haul by building a solid foundation and resilient blockchain infrastructure. With the Hydra Scaling solution, Cardano (ADA) has boosted its transaction throughput far beyond many other major blockchains in terms of transaction capabilities. Cardano also extended its Plutus-based smart contracts, improving Cardano’s overall efficiency. These changes have given Cardano (ADA) good standing as a reliable blockchain, and the protocol is now ready to grow in 2025. Dogecoin Set To Thrive Under New U.S. Administration Dogecoin (DOGE) had an impressive 2024, posting an impressive 256% yearly return. On the monthly time frame, however, Dogecoin saw a 23% dip in December as the market-wide downturn intensified. Dogecoin (DOGE) now has the potential for huge growth in 2025 as a perfect storm is shaping up for Dogecoin’s growth. Most notably, many speculate that once Donald Trump takes office, the price of Dogecoin will react with a sudden upward move, as the newly created Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE) becomes operational with Elon Musk at the helm. At the time of writing, Dogecoin continues to move within a narrow trading channel around the $0.31 mark.

According to crypto research platform SoSo Value , the total inflow for Ethereum spot ETF reached $2.10344 billion last month. The number represents 81.5% of the $2.58 billion of the cumulative total net inflow since the financial product launched. The monthly net inflow into Ethereum spot ETFs in December is also nearly twice the $1.07776 billion recorded in November. The data also shows that the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) currently has the highest net inflow since its listing, with $1.58 billion.

Apart from this, Solana's market value reached $103.9 billion, leaving BNB, which has a market value of $101 billion, behind.

Shares are up almost 6% just two trading days into January, with the stock sitting at $143.78 as of press time. That’s a sharp turn from the rough end to 2024, where Nvidia lost 4% in the last week of December. But no one seems to care about that now. Let’s talk numbers. Nvidia ended 2024 up 170%, which came right after an absurd 240% gain in 2023. Those are the kinds of returns that make Wall Street stop what it’s doing to pay attention. Risk appetite seems to be alive and well, especially for investors still betting on Nvidia’s AI dominance. Recent trading shows solid recovery January 2 was a big day. Nvidia surged over 3% during early trading. Sure, the end of December was disappointing—blame the lack of a “Santa Claus rally,” which usually pumps the markets around Christmas. But Nvidia’s performance has been nothing short of a masterclass in recovery. At its current price, Nvidia’s stock isn’t far from its 52-week high of $152.89. Its market cap? A casual $3.52 trillion—no big deal. Investors traded over 112 million shares just today. If this keeps up, Nvidia could crush new records this year. Analysts are already making bold predictions, some putting a $173 target on NVDA by year’s end. Why? Simple: AI demand, upcoming chip releases, and partnerships with tech giants like Microsoft and Google. Meanwhile, January 8 is circled on every Nvidia investor’s calendar. CEO Jensen Huang will take the stage at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. He’s expected to unveil the highly anticipated Blackwell chips, which could set the bar even higher for AI computing. If these chips perform as expected, Nvidia might tighten its stranglehold on the AI sector. The excitement around Nvidia mirrors a broader surge in market optimism. U.S. stock futures are ticking up, with the Dow adding 79 points, the S&P 500 climbing 0.25%, and the Nasdaq gaining 0.34%. And Bitcoin is flexing early in 2025, climbing 6% to $98,000 as of press time. That puts its new year gains near 4%, following a wild postelection rally that briefly pushed Bitcoin past $100,000. Investors are counting on President Donald Trump to deliver on his pro-crypto promises and create a friendly environment. Congress might even pass its first-ever crypto-focused legislation, which could bring some much-needed structure to the market.

They show a coordinated effort to stop a wide variety of crypto activity- everything from basic BTC transactions to more complex offerings,” he noted. He remarked that the documents prove the FDIC oversaw a coordinated effort to cripple crypto transactions. Grewal expressed skepticism about the FDIC’s actions as he noted that while the FDIC previously claimed it had fully complied with a court order, now, after further review, it “magically” found two more pause letters. Credibility In Question He noted that it is hard to believe in their ‘good faith’ as their actions seem inconsistent and their credibility is undermined with each new discovery. He underscored that the new Congress should launch hearings on all this without delay, suggesting a thorough investigation into the matter. Previously, in December, the FDIC released a set of documents related to Coinbase’s investigation into Operation Chokepoint 2.0, but they were redacted, with key details removed. Shortly after, a judge ruled that the FDIC must release the unredacted versions of these documents, which was a significant victory for Coinbase in the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) case.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-03 17:57:53

Their success highlights the lucrative potential that still abounds for investors betting on altcoins . According to whale tracker Lookonchain, the whale invested $10 million USDC to purchase 4.25 million $VIRTUAL tokens on December 14 during a price dip. A whale spent 10M $USDC to buy 4.25M $VIRTUAL 19 days ago, which is now worth $21.5M, with an unrealized profit of $11.5M! The whale dared to bet big—and it paid off! https://t.co/GGh9CJsOFb pic.twitter.com/MxSjNorEpE — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 2, 2025 By January 2, the token’s price had surged, pushing the value of the whale’s holdings to $21.5 million. VIRTUAL’s impressive 23% advance over the last seven days reflects the tail-end of that strong momentum, with prices having since cooled off about 10% overnight. Much of this growth is driven by VIRTUAL’s AI agents, which offer innovative tools for traders leveraging artificial intelligence in the crypto landscape. These advanced solutions have spurred market interest, drawing both high rollers and everyday investors into the ecosystem. The token hit an all-time high of $5.07 on January 2. It now appears to be consolidating its price after an intense but brief sell-off sank its relative strength index (RSI) down to about 30. Investors are buying back in at lower prices as $VIRTUAL prepares for the next leg of its rally. Source: TradingView With AI-driven solutions becoming a cornerstone of the digital asset market, $VIRTUAL’s growth showcases the opportunities available to investors who think outside the box. The involvement of large holders, seeking both innovation and profit, has bolstered market sentiment, driving interest in this emerging token. While Virtuals Protocol Surges, Flockerz takes flight In spite of broadly falling crypto prices across the market, savvy investors are still bundling into the presale market, where they can buy in to new projects at potentially all-time-low (ATL) prices. One offering capturing their imaginations right now is the new vote-to-earn (V2E) Flockerz ($FLOCK) , a presale which started in early Autumn and has raised $8.6 million. Touting itself as “The People’s Meme Coin,” Flockerz offers crypto fans unrivaled community-building incentives and staking rewards. Holders of Flockerz (known as “ The $FLOCK ”) are members of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called Flocktopia, where they can draft and vote on governance and improvement proposals. This structure ensures community consensus dictates the decisions rather than an opaque centralized authority.

The Clash of Pepe Clones in the Best Presale to Buy,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/wall-street-pepe-or-pepeto-the-clash-of-pepe-clones-in-the-best-presale-to-buy/,"The post Wall Street Pepe or Pepeto? The Clash of Pepe Clones in the Best Presale to Buy appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the 2025 crypto market heats up, two frog-themed contenders are drawing significant attention in the memecoin space: Pepeto and Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE). Both projects bring unique offerings to the table, but which presale presents the better opportunity? Let’s take a closer look at their value, potential, and the unique advantages they offer. Wall Street Pepe: A Focus on Trading Insights and Rewards Wall Street Pepe stands out for its focus on empowering smaller traders with exclusive trading signals and alpha calls. Designed to mimic whale-like strategies, $WEPE provides holders with advanced trading insights, presale recommendations, and community-driven tools. With a staking reward of 32% APY and a current price of $0.00036641, Wall Street Pepe appeals to those looking for strategic guidance and short-term gains in the evolving memecoin market. Its innovative approach has garnered attention from traders eager to capitalize on its unique trading-focused ecosystem. Pepeto: A Vision for Long-Term Growth and Revolutionary Utility While Wall Street Pepe shines with trading utilities, Pepeto, the God of Frogs, offers a broader vision with its utility-driven ecosystem. Pepeto integrates a zero-fee exchange, a cross-chain bridge for seamless token swaps, and staking rewards currently set at an impressive +400%. This positions Pepeto as a project built for both immediate utility and long-term growth. ` At just $0.000000101 in its presale phase, Pepeto provides an unparalleled entry point for investors. The project’s compelling narrative, tied to the collection of the six legendary documents : P, E, P, E, T, and O ; adds to its unique appeal. With the upcoming beta launches of its exchange, bridge, and swap functionalities, as well as major announcements on the horizon, Pepeto is poised to become a cornerstone of the 2025 memecoin market. Why Pepeto Stands Out Pepeto’s potential lies in its ability to adopt and support future memecoins through its robust platform. By offering tools to empower the next wave of tokens, it ensures a dynamic and sustainable ecosystem. The project’s alignment with community-driven growth and its emphasis on interoperability make it a standout choice for investors seeking long-term value. Moreover, rumors of an ex-cofounder of Pepe being involved in Pepeto’s development have added intrigue and speculation, further fueling its hype. With its presale already surpassing $3 million, Pepeto’s momentum is undeniable. The Verdict Both Pepeto and Wall Street Pepe offer valuable opportunities in their own right, but for those looking to combine a low entry price, innovative utilities, and massive growth potential, Pepeto emerges as the more compelling choice. Its unique story, revolutionary ecosystem, and dedicated community position it as a frontrunner in the memecoin race. To learn more about Pepeto and join the presale, visit https://pepeto.io/ . Don’t miss the chance to be part of what could be the biggest memecoin success story of 2025. ABOUT PEPETO : Pepeto is an innovative cryptocurrency project that merges the world of memecoins with a robust utility-driven ecosystem.

Pepe Price Pumps After Elon Musk’s X Name Change,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/time-to-buy-frog-meme-coins-pepe-price-pumps-after-elon-musks-x-name-change,"Frog meme coins are back in the spotlight, sparked by Elon Musk’s recent moniker change on X. The world’s richest man changed his name to Kekius Maximus, a gladiator version of Pepe The Frog. The Pepe price rallied in the aftermath, trading as high as $0.000021. Low-cap meme coin Kekius Maximus (KEKIUS) rallied nearly 900% as well. However, KEKIUS erased all its gains after Musk went back to his original moniker while PEPE has remained largely resilient. Another low-cap token Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) has surpassed the $40 million mark in its presale, with experts viewing it as one of the best meme coins to buy in 2025. Pepe Coin All-Time High Imminent - Should Investors Rotate Capital To Frog Meme Tokens? Tesla and X owner Elon Musk has surprisingly emerged as one of the biggest Pepe supporters. The world’s richest man has been posting a plethora of frog memes, even liking a post calling him “the Pepefather”. For the uninitiated, Musk assumed the title of “the Dogefather”, which resulted in a massive spike in the DOGE price. In the latest development of this saga, Musk changed his moniker on X , calling himself Kekius Maximum. He also changed his profile picture to a frog gladiator playing a video game. The Pepe price rallied nearly 18% following Musk’s X transformation, trading as high as $0.000021, while also flipping Dogecoin’s trading volume on Wednesday. Even as Elon went back to his original profile picture and image, the Pepe price has remained largely resilient, hitting the $0.000021 mark again on Thursday before a marginal correction. All eyes are now on the token’s 50-day Simple Moving Average indicator, which is currently hovering at $0.0000207. A weekly close above this level would pave the way for new all-time highs. The meme coin is trading 28% below its current all-time high of $0.000028. $PEPE looks stronger than ever, about to break the 50 days moving average. pic.twitter.com/7g3GkKhyo4 — Plazma (@Plazma0x) January 2, 2025 However, long-term projections from experts suggest that it could be time to go all in on frog meme coins. There is a growing consensus that the Pepe coin could reach $50 billion market capitalization in 2025, nearly 6x growth from its current $8.5 billion valuation. Is Wall Street Pepe The Best Meme Coin To Buy Now? Pepe’s rosy prospects are bullish for other low-cap frog meme coins. For instance, Wall Street Pepe is seeing heavy whale bidding during its ongoing presale. At the time of writing, WEPE has crossed the $40 million mark. This project combines Pepe The Frog and The Wolf of the Wall Street to enrich investors’ experience. However, its key selling point is its VIP “alpha calls” group, which will include all WEPE holders. The project’s core mission is to challenge the hegemony of whales and insiders in the meme coin sector and offer a fair playing ground to small-scale investors. All group members will receive cutting-edge alpha, market insights, trading strategies and even the best meme coins to invest in, everything they need to reap maximum profits in the upcoming bull market. Meanwhile, early WEPE buyers are already benefiting from the token’s native staking pool, which is offering passive yields at a reward rate of over 30%. With Elon Musk showing public support for frog meme coins, experts believe that WEPE could be one of the biggest winners of the 2025 meme coin supercycle. A few experts are even calling it the next 10x meme coin. Visit Wall Street Pepe Presale Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

New altcoins ready for a break-out are a favourite due to their massive room for returns. With another bull run approaching, investors have their eyes on SpacePay (SPY) . The upcoming cryptocurrency has already raised over $820,000 in its ongoing presale, and is on the verge of an explosive surge. Why? SpacePay changes the way we use digital money. https://twitter.com/SpacePayLtd/status/1870523701932032498 Making Crypto Payments Practical Here’s a closer look at why investors are rallying behind this new crypto payment solution. A persistent challenge for cryptocurrencies is adoption. Most cryptos focus on generating hype that they fail to solve real-world problems. SpacePay sets out to change that. It brings utility to top cryptos through its payment solution that supports over 325 wallets. What does this mean? Cryptocurrencies can now be used for everyday purchases. And it is not just an idea––SpacePay’s functional system is ready for deployment. The SpacePay team has already developed a working prototype (MVP) that integrates into both physical and online stores. Why Businesses Love SpacePay Crypto payments are often seen as a hassle by businesses. Not without reason. There are high setup costs, volatility concerns, and complex systems to factor in, and they keep merchants away. SpacePay offers a more reliable solution to bring crypto to retail. Seamless setup: SpacePay offers an Android-compatible APK for businesses. It works directly with existing Point-of-Sale (POS) systems. Low transaction fees: Businesses can accept crypto payments for just a 0.5% fee using SpacePay, much lower than traditional credit card processing fees. Volatility protection: Instant settlement in local fiat currencies makes SpacePay a feasible solution for businesses. While customers can pay using their favourite cryptocurrencies, merchants receive the payment in their local currency. They don’t have to worry about the volatility of the payment crypto. Security and speed: SpacePay ensures fast and secure transactions using NFC technology. SpacePay supports over 325 wallets and top cryptocurrencies. Growth-oriented Tokenomics The $SPY tokenomics focuses on sustainable growth. Most of the supply is divided between community building and project development. 20% of the total supply is allocated to the public presale, giving everyone a chance to be early backers for low costs. The remaining tokens are set aside, as follows. Early adopters of $SPY tokens are in for exciting perks like governance rights and revenue-sharing opportunities. They also get early access to product upgrades and quarterly webinars. Although SpacePay is a project rooted in technology, it doesn’t compromise community building. SpacePay’s growing community includes over 60,000 followers on X (Twitter) and an active Telegram group; the project is clearly making its presence felt. There are also plans to launch a referral program and a staking system as part of fuelling engagement. Utility Matters SpacePay’s focus on utility makes it stand out. As a crypto payment solution, the project contributes to the broader adoption of the market. With $750,000 raised during the private presale and an additional $820,000 pouring in during the public phase, investors have shown confidence in the project. Unlike most cryptocurrencies that shy away from launching a project, months (and sometimes years) after the token launch, SpacePay’s MVP is ready with tangible use cases. Although many projects have attempted crypto-retail integration in the past, SpacePay maintains an edge with its focus on user experience and practicality. It is convenient for both businesses and shoppers. The Next Crypto to Watch SPY shows the potential to break into the spotlight in the first quarter of 2025, with the presale moving ahead rapidly.

Experts Bullish on Meme Index as Presale Crosses $1.5 Million,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/experts-bullish-on-meme-index-as-presale-crosses-1-5-million/,"The post Best Crypto to Buy? Experts Bullish on Meme Index as Presale Crosses $1.5 Million appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Meme Index ($MEMEX) has surpassed $1.5 million in its presale phase, attracting significant attention from investors. This isn’t surprising, as the project offers a novel approach to meme coin investment by providing access to multiple meme coin indexes through its native token, $MEMEX. The meme coin market reached a valuation of $137 billion in 2024 and started the new year with over $100 billion in combined market cap. By redefining meme coin investing, Meme Index could be one of the hottest tokens to watch this year. What makes Meme Index unique? Cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE) showcase the resilience of the meme coin sector. Nonetheless, the overwhelming number of projects can make selecting the appropriate investment challenging. The Meme Index addresses this challenge by offering curated indexes that provide broad exposure to the meme coin market by simplifying the investment process and spreading risk. It also saves investors money, as with a single transaction, they can get exposure to multiple meme coins, which would otherwise require many transactions to purchase individually. However, investors will need to buy $MEMEX tokens to use the Meme Index. Meme Index offers investors access to four indexes with different investment strategies and risk levels: Titan, Moonshot, Midcap, and Frenzy. The Meme Titan Index includes the top 10 meme coins, such as DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, BONK, and WIF. These tokens boast a market cap of over $1 billion, strong historical performance, and stable growth potential. This index offers the lowest risk but also the lowest potential for significant gains. The Moonshot Index focuses on tokens with market caps below $1 billion, targeting projects with high upside potential but higher risk, such as POPCAT and MEW. Midcap Index targets tokens with market caps between $50 million and $250 million, offering high growth opportunities ranging from 4x to 20x if these tokens reach a $1 billion market cap. The Meme Frenzy Index targets high-risk investors, incorporating volatile tokens with significant growth potential. This index may not suit all investors, as many of the meme coins it includes could fail. Nonetheless, all it takes is a single meme coin to explode, making the investment in this index rewarding. $MEMEX token – the gateway to meme indexes and high-yield staking The $MEMEX token is central to accessing the Meme Index ecosystem. Token holders can invest in the curated indexes, and they can earn through the platform’s staking protocol, which currently offers an impressive annual percentage yield (APY) of 1,500%. This can be an excellent way to increase token holdings without making additional purchases, which can later be used to invest in the meme indexes. However, the staking yields are dynamic and will decrease as more tokens are staked, so early adopters stand to benefit the most. Another use case for the $MEMEX token is governance. Token holders can vote on which tokens to be added or removed from the indexes. They can also submit proposals for voting, which makes this project highly decentralized. Crypto analysts are excited about this project. For example, Crypto Gains, a YouTube commentator with over 140k subscribers, believes this is an excellent opportunity to get in early on a high potential project. MEME Index! This Is LAUNCHING SOON! (GET IN EARLY) Limited time to buy $MEMEX at the current presale price Investors have less than 24 hours to purchase $MEMEX at its current presale price of $0.0148639 before the price increases in the next stage. Early investors can buy the token with USDT, ETH, BNB, or a bank card through the Meme Index website . Follow Meme Index on X and join their Telegram group for the latest updates.

However, as the industry evolves, 1Fuel (OFT) is set to redefine the DeFi landscape in 2025. Going beyond smart contracts, 1Fuel brings a holistic blockchain ecosystem with advanced features. These include its DEX wallet, AI-driven tools and real-world financial utilities, making it a strong contender to take the next leap in decentralized finance. ADA Achieves Growth in Smart Contract Infrastructure Cardano (ADA) has gained a reputation as a leading blockchain platform in 2024, with significant strides in smart contract infrastructure. Its Plutus-based system has become a benchmark for efficiency and usability, attracting developers seeking innovative solutions. The proof of Cardano’s growth is its milestone achievement of deploying 100,000 new smart contracts in 2024. Upgrades through Plutus V2 and V3 fueled this expansion, offering more flexibility for decentralized applications. This infrastructure sets ADA as a leading smart contract cryptocurrency for long-term investors. ADA’s price also saw a steady 40% increase over the year, reaffirming its status as a preferred choice for investors. Analysts expect that with sustained growth and technical innovation, ADA could reach a value of $4 by the end of 2025. Platforms like Core Wallet and Trust Wallet are widely used to store ADA, reflecting its strong position in the ecosystem. 1Fuel Set to Redefine Smart Contracts 1Fuel, an altcoin poised for public listing in Q2 2025, is redefining the role of smart contracts within the DeFi ecosystem. Backed by a comprehensive decentralized financial framework, 1Fuel’s advanced smart contracts power its peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange, offering functionality and security to traders. This positions 1Fuel as a leading smart contract cryptocurrency ahead of 2025. At the heart of 1Fuel’s P2P exchange is a decentralized order-matching engine powered by smart contracts. Key features include an escrow mechanism where smart contracts securely hold assets until trade conditions are met. When compared to Core Wallet and Trust Wallet, which provide storage and basic transactional features, 1Fuel’s smart contract-enabled trading is more dynamic, making OFT a top DeFi token to watch. Cross-chain trading is another standout feature of 1Fuel, supported by atomic swaps and cross-chain bridges. Utilizing Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs), 1Fuel ensures that all cross-chain transactions are secure. Unlike Trust Wallet and Core Wallet, which often rely on third-party solutions for interacting with multiple blockchains, 1Fuel integrates this feature directly into its ecosystem. 1Fuel Emerges with Complete DeFi Ecosystem in 2025 Aside from its P2P exchange and cross-chain transactions powered by smart contracts, 1Fuel features a robust DeFi ecosystem that provides solutions for privacy, security, and seamless transactions. It is fitted with privacy features like an integrated mixer for anonymizing transactions, a feature that is not present in Trust Wallet and Core Wallet. 1Fuel also integrates innovative functionalities such as a crypto debit and credit card, allowing users to make real-life payments directly from their crypto balances. Additionally, its AI-driven tools help users optimize portfolio management and execute strategic trades. Investor confidence in 1Fuel is evident in its presale success. The OFT presale has sold over 100 million tokens, showcasing strong demand for this altcoin. With the growing momentum backed by innovative features, 1Fuel is positioning itself as a top DeFi token ahead of 2025. Investors Accumulate OFT Token Ahead of 2025 With its cutting-edge architecture, 1Fuel is paving the way for advanced DeFi features in 2025. Investors have recognized its potential to transform the way they use cryptocurrencies, which has caused many whales to rush the presale token at the lowest possible price. Learn more about 1FUEL.

The team previously alerted users to stay away from people claiming premature access to the asset. The Wait is Over In the past few years, Shiba Inu (SHIB) evolved from a simple meme coin to a broader ecosystem. One asset associated with the project is Treat (TREAT). It is specifically designed to serve as a reward token within the ecosystem and provide incentives for users engaging with Shiba Inu’s protocols, including the layer-2 scaling solution Shibarium. Most recently, the team behind Treat said the meme coin will officially see the light of day this month. The new year begins with TREAT! Wait is OVER, $TREAT is launching this January.

Shibarium Trustwatch (an X account that aims to provide security) has warned people multiple times to stay away from dubious individuals who offer services with TREAT and claim that it is live . Reaction From the Community The news about TREAT’s launch caused huge enthusiasm, with numerous X users commenting on the post. One person who chipped in was Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama: “Our capstone and key to full and perpetual decentralization. Stay tuned for this epic launch, and remember to listen to my podcast to fully understand why Treat is vital to our success .” Earlier this week, Kusama revealed their intentions to launch a podcast in 2025. It will consist of 44 episodes and touch upon various aspects of the meme coin’s ecosystem. The team will focus on different topics each day of the week , with Tuesdays dedicated to TREAT. Mondays will center on meme coins, Thursdays on tech discussions, Fridays on “shoutouts and follows ,” and Saturdays will be “all about spirituality.” There will be no streaming on Wednesdays or Sundays.

This upward movement follows a notable price decline of 33% in the last month of 2024. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis and Upcoming Levels Today, January 3, 2024, SOL has experienced a price surge of over 6.25% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $217.60. This recent price surge has caused a breakout of the trendline that SOL formed during its price decline last month. Following this breakout, sentiment for the altcoin appears to be shifting, gaining attention from both investors and traders, which has led to a 15% increase in trading volume. Source: Trading View According to expert technical analysis, if SOL maintains itself above the $210 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 22% to reach its all-time high in the future. Are Long-Term Holders Selling-Off? Besides SOL’s bullish outlook, one thing that traders and investors need to know is the continuous dumping by long-term holders, despite the price witnessing upside momentum, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data shows that SOL has witnessed a price surge of over 15% in the past three days. During the same period, spot inflow/outflow metrics reveal that exchanges have experienced an outflow of a significant $201.69 million worth of SOL, indicating a potential dump by long-term holders. Source: Coinglass According to experts and analysts, massive outflows have the potential to create selling pressure and a price decline. However, the market has not reacted to these activities, as it seems to be experiencing upside momentum. The potential reason for this dump is the continuous discussion regarding the new health crisis in China, which has recently been compared to Covid-19.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-03 18:11:43
