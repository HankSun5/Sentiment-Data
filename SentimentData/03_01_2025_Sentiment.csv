Here’s how,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-half-pump-could-send-xrp-to-27-heres-how/,"Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto recently shared a detailed update on XRP’s price trajectory, focusing on pivotal technical indicators and potential price targets. The analysis highlights both bullish and bearish scenarios, emphasizing the importance of key levels and formations in determining the asset’s next move. #XRP – Half Pump Could Lead to $27 (UPDATE): For a deeper understanding, check out my post from December 18, 2024: [Full Details Here] https://t.co/Nbpn96U2OW What’s Next for #XRP : 1️⃣ Fib Channel Break: #XRP has broken the 0.236 Fib Channel, but we still have 6 hours left for… https://t.co/SLTvnaV79E pic.twitter.com/b09i95BuDH — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 30, 2024 Current Analysis and Short-Term Outlook Egrag’s latest update highlights the following critical elements for XRP’s price movement: Fibonacci Channel Break: XRP has recently broken the 0.236 Fibonacci (Fib) Channel, a significant development. However, Egrag notes that the close of the daily candle will be crucial in determining whether this break is sustainable. The next six hours will clarify whether XRP can maintain this level or if a retracement is likely. Critical Bounce at $2.12: A bounce above $2.12 is essential for XRP to sustain bullish momentum. Closing the daily candle above this level would reinforce positive sentiment and mitigate risks of crashing further. Triangle Formation Breakdown: The systematic triangle formation observed on the chart has broken to the downside. The measured move of this breakdown points to a potential target of $1.67, suggesting caution in the near term. Equilibrium Levels: The equilibrium zone between $1.75 and $1.64 is a critical area to watch. Price consolidation within this range could provide clues about the next significant move. SRSI Accumulation: The Stochastic Relative Strength Index (SRSI) accumulates and signals preparation for a significant price move. While the exact direction remains uncertain, this setup warrants close attention. Long-Term Perspective Egrag’s December 18 analysis offers a broader view of XRP’s potential trajectory across multiple time frames, including monthly, weekly, and daily charts: Monthly Time Frame: The $0.75 zone was identified as a key price expansion target. XRP’s penetration of the 0.236 Fib Channel on the monthly chart is a bullish signal. A monthly candle close above this level would pave the way for targeting the 0.382 Fib Channel, potentially unlocking a rally toward $27 in the long term. Weekly Time Frame: Key weekly candle close levels are critical to XRP’s trajectory . If the price closes below $2.44, the chances of revisiting $2.05 increase significantly. Conversely, a close above $2.60 would enhance the likelihood of testing all-time highs (ATH) and could mark the beginning of a sustained bullish rally. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Daily and 3-Day Time Frames: On shorter time frames, XRP appears to be forming patterns with mixed implications. While the daily chart shows the potential for bullish and bearish outcomes, the 3-day chart hints at a bullish ascending triangle that could break out between December 25 and December 28, targeting $3.288. Implications for XRP Egrag’s analysis underscores the importance of monitoring critical price levels and technical formations. A close above $2.12 in the short term could mitigate bearish risks and restore bullish momentum. However, failure to hold key levels, such as $1.75-$1.64, may lead to further downside. For long-term investors, the monthly and weekly time frames suggest significant upside potential if key resistance levels are breached. The possibility of reaching $27 hinges on sustained momentum and favorable market conditions. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

38446464,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=636373,1735856843,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38446464.jpeg,Could PEPE become the next Dogecoin?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/could-pepe-become-the-next-dogecoin/,"PEPE is following the path of Dogecoin, which it might replace at some level. With Elon Musk’s endorsement and the community’s support, PEPE is ready for the 2025 rally, which looks eerily similar to Dogecoin in 2021. Dogecoin was initiated in 2013 as a joke based on the “Doge” meme, which had a picture of a Shiba Inu dog. For many years it was niche cryptocurrency with no serious backing or purpose, but this all changed with Elon Musk’s involvement. In 2021, Musk began to tweet about Dogecoin, calling it the “people’s crypto” and even gave himself the title of “DogeFather.” Instantly, the price of Dogecoin increased. However, Musk didn’t stop at social media instead, he stepped forward to make Dogecoin useful in real life. Tesla, his electric car company, began to accept Dogecoin as a payment for its merchandise. The space exploration company also did the same. All these developments took Dogecoin from just being a meme into an actual currency which people can use to settle transactions. After Dogecoin, Musk’s influence is now on PEPE. The inspiration for this new meme coin is the “Pepe the Frog” meme, which has been an internet icon for many years. The PEPE token is newer and has a smaller market cap than Dogecoin. He shared a meme of Pepe the Frog, where he stated, “ Explaining Constitutional Amendments.” After that PEPE coin had quickly gained popularity after launching in April. Can PEPE Reach Dogecoin’s Heights? The big question now is whether PEPE can rise to the same level of success as Dogecoin. While PEPE’s market cap is currently much smaller, the coin has been able to show very rapid growth because of Musk’s involvement. In fact, if Musk were to officially back PEPE, this coin would easily be catapulted into astronomical levels of popularity and price, which is a thing that happened to Dogecoin. Some continue to speculate t hat Tesla would accept PEPE as a way to pay for services, bu t until now, there is nothing concrete, although this happening would significantly increase PEPE’s credibility and visibility. However, in all probability, it might require more than the influence of Musk to sustain PEPE. Once again, the hype surrounding the coin is what will make or break PEPE, as in the case of Dogecoin. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that because of the gaffe, PEPE climbed 54.7%. The official PEPE Twitter account even quoted Musk’s tweet, adding a comment about “seizing the memes of production.” Elon Musk’s influence is deemed as crucial since his tweets can cause tremendous price movements in the crypto market. For instance, another meme coin, Milady Meme Coin (LADYS), surged 12,056% in price after Musk’s tweet about it. Another meme coin that shot up due to the influence of Musk was the Kekius Maximus abbreviated as KEKIUS, which rocketed by more than 3,000% since Musk put that name on his Twitter. However, the price of KEKIUS has decreased significantly since Musk changed his profile name. In short, Elon Musk’s tweets and actions frequently send meme coins soaring in price, but can drop just as quickly when the billionaire’s focus turns elsewhere. That Pepe is up 34% since its low in mid-December, with a big boost coming after Elon Musk changed his X profile picture to Pepe the Frog in gladiator attire. This shift from Dogecoin to Pepe increased the coin’s price, from $0.0000144 on December 24 to a high of $0.00002828. It’s now trading around $0.00002025 Analyst comparing it to Dogecoin and predicting it could grow a lot in the 2025 bull market, possibly reaching $40 to $125 billion in value. The coin is even now trading more than Dogecoin in terms of volume, with $3.8 billion in 24-hour trading, compared to Dogecoin’s $1.9 billion. As Pepe’s popularity rises, other Pepe-themed coins are also emerging, like Pepe Unchained, which is launching tools for creating memecoins without coding, and Wall Street Pepe, which is building a platform for memecoin trading and offering rewards. Wall Street Pepe’s presale raised $38.5 million in its first month, benefiting from the hype around Pepe. Analysts are very bullish on PEPE coin, comparing it to Dogecoin’s price action during the 2021 bull run. They believe PEPE is following a similar pattern, with its price rising while Bitcoin breaks its all-time high, and predict that PEPE will continue to climb higher, just like Dogecoin did in 2021. Last year, PEPE’s price movement was similar to Dogecoin’s in 2020, and since then, PEPE’s market cap has skyrocketed from $600 million to over $8 billion. With a year-to-date gain of 1,400%, the rally is just getting started. Crypto analysts are also optimistic, with some pointing out that PEPE is forming a “bull flag” or “bullish pennant” on its chart. These patterns suggest PEPE could keep rising, possibly reaching up to $0.000038 in the near future. Currently, PEPE is cooling off a bit but still trading at around $0.00002017.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD gaining 1.5% on the day, recovering from earlier dips to monthly lows. “Christmas Range has swept both sides for liquidity now,” trader Daan Crypto Trades observed, adding that the $95.8K mid-range level had acted as resistance during recent tests. Accompanying charts highlighted increased trading volume at the range lows, which some traders saw as a bullish signal. Daan Crypto Trades advised keeping an eye on range breakouts to anticipate Bitcoin’s movement over the next couple of weeks. Similarly, trader Jelle noted parallels between this year’s price action and last year’s, suggesting a potential upside resolution. “The similarities are there, with or without another sweep of the lows,” Jelle commented, forecasting a breakout to $130,000–$150,000. Entrepreneur Jason Williams shared a comparable outlook, describing the current price range as an accumulation zone. “$BTC has re-entered the accumulation zone,” Williams posted on X, predicting, “$131.5K+ by Q1 2025 feels inevitable. See you there.” His chart compared the current range to Bitcoin’s behavior after reaching all-time highs in March last year, which eventually led to a significant breakout after several months of consolidation. Market sentiment has turned bullish amid optimism about the return of traditional finance traders. Cole Kennelly, founder of crypto volatility index service Volmex, forecasted a renewed push for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. “My gut tells me the market goes full risk-on and a lot of money piles into crypto, now that end-of-year logistics/rebalancing/etc. is over,” Kennelly stated, anticipating a strong start to the year.

Per our technical indicators, ALGO’s price trend is bullish and the fear and greed index shows greed among investors. Data analysis, however, shows rising activity in decentralized finance applications and stablecoin demand. Why is ALGO up? ALGO is trading at previous highs set in 2022, the recovery could be attributed to the crypto market’s general bullish sentiment which saw its market cap rise above $3.2 trillion. Will ALGO reach $1? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, ALGO will break above $1 in the period ending 2028. Will ALGO reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $10 in the period ending 2030. Will ALGO reach $100? At $100, Algorand market capitalization has to rise above $700 billion from the current $1.2 billion. In comparison, Ethereum’s market capitalization is at $400 billion. Per our price prediction, Algorancd is highly unlikely to reach $100. Does ALGO have a good long-term future? Like most mega-altcoins, Algorand is trading at its lowest level this year. A break below 30 RSI will be crucial to sending it to previous highs. Looking ahead, ALGO will register new all-time highs in the coming years. Is ALGO a good investment? Analysis by Intotheblock shows that 97% of holders are at a loss at the current price. The figure will likely drop lower in the short term. However, as our Cryptopolitan price prediction shows, this will change over the long term. Recent news The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) now offers blockchain education training to 24,000 personnel worldwide, including UNDP, UN Volunteers, and the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF).

Algorand historic price sentiment Algorand price history: Coinstats Algorand held its token sale in June 2019 at $2.4 each. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to Coinmarketcap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.637 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. So, in 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.3 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It now trades at $0.13. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.61 in December. It then corrected into 2025 dropping to the $0.4 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-02 23:06:08

Trump 2025 (TRUM2025), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUM2025 is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump 2025 can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump 2025 could become the next viral memecoin. Trump 2025 launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump 2025 on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump 2025 by entering its contract address – 5K2ESM1q2SjZFybttofLFpbbW8yF3isBRW3ZxDPUVfVY – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUM2025. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-02 23:19:00

On this premise, Circle’s Policy Head Patrick Hansen took to X to clear a few of the misconstrued takes. Crypto Exchanges, Travel Rule and MiCA The Circle executive admitted to seeing several post from people who were mixing up EU’s Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR) Travel Rule and the newly implemented MiCA . The former mandates financial service providers to gather and exchange customers data amongst others. The Travel Rule also came into force on December 30, 2024, the same day as MiCA. As a result of its implementation, Hansen said Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) like custodian and brokers are now required to request for more information from users. This applies to both sender and receiver in any transactions. In addition, he added that CASPs are at liberty to exchange this information within themselves. The Circle Policy Head said this info exchange might take place through encrypted channels or travel rule networks like Trust or Notabene. The aim is to ensure that customers are not exposed to scams while trying to complete their crypto transactions. CASPs can also take some more delicate steps, depending on the amount of funds involved. Quick addition since I am seeing a ton of people mixing up EU crypto regulations (MiCA & TFR): Yes, since end of last year, the EU implementation of the travel rule (TFR) is in force as well. The application date (December 30th) was the same as for MICA. Exchanges and other… https://t.co/FYn2RN8Ei7 — Patrick Hansen (@paddi_hansen) January 2, 2025 Specifically, Hansen said CASPs would request that a customer verify ownership of his self-custody wallet once the transaction tops €1,000. Noteworthy, TFR or Travel Rule, like MiCA is designed to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. However, Hansen stated clearly that both rules are entirely unrelated, the major miscommunication among users. MoonPay Secures Approval Under New Regime Several crypto asset service providers are making efforts to ensure that they are not left out of the new crypto regulation dispensation in the EU. Renowned crypto infrastructure service provider MoonPay is one of firms that has taken a monumental stride by securing MiCA approval . By all means, the move aligns with the firm’s expansion plans in Europe. Meanwhile it has also positioned MoonPay as a crypto regulation-compliant entity in Europe. In the past, it has gained significant traction while empowering crypto payments across the region. With this achievement and the continuous bull cycle in 2025, MoonPay is likely to capture more EU market share.

Table of Contents Dogecoin whales acquire 270 million DOGE Why whales are flocking to PCHAIN’s presale PCHAIN for massive gains in 2025 Dogecoin whales are taking advantage of the recent dip to accumulate DOGE at low prices. They are splashing millions on DOGE and PropiChain (PCHAIN), a real estate tokenization platform. PropiChain’s ongoing presale has attracted smart money and retail investors. After raising over $1 million, PropiChain is set to transform the $300 trillion real estate industry. As whales prepare for 2025, DOGE and PCHAIN have emerged as the best altcoins to invest in. Dogecoin whales acquire 270 million DOGE Dogecoin whales spent nearly $90 million buying 270 million DOGE in 96 hours. Large acquisitions typically occur during market consolidation or price dips, allowing major investors to capitalize. Dogecoin dipped below $0.3, offering whales the opportunity to accumulate. DOGE has since risen to $0.3198, marking a 12.4% increase in the past week. Analysts are optimistic Dogecoin could reclaim the $0.35 mark in Q1 2025. However, others have sounded the alarm, claiming that DOGE has reached its local top and could see further selling pressure. Why whales are flocking to PCHAIN’s presale Dogecoin whales have joined smart money and retail traders in investing in PropiChain during its ongoing presale. The real estate altcoin is on course to surge 30,000% in 2025, making it a top crypto to invest in. At only $0.011, PCHAIN has an attractive point as it is near its possible lowest-ever price. This makes it easy for early investors to earn substantial gains after listing on exchanges. Yet, PCHAIN’s appeal lies in its value proposition. As a real estate tokenization platform, PropiChain will support fractional ownership of properties. This will allow multiple investors to own a single property, opening the industry to many investors. PropiChain’s users can also sell portions of their properties to raise capital. Investors are also impressed by PCHAIN’s use of AI to simplify property investing and management. The platform will use AI to conduct predictive market analysis, enabling users to identify patterns and predict future market behaviors. This will give them an edge over their peers as they can easily make data-driven, smart decisions. The platform will also take property valuations to the next level using automated valuation models (AVMs). AVMs will provide accurate valuations of properties, enabling buyers and sellers to get fair deals.

This process will remove manual work and third-party intermediaries, making transactions cheaper and faster. The project has had its smart contract audited by BlockAudit to make it safe for investors and users. Another important feature that investors appreciate is remote property tours using the metaverse. This allows investors to view and stage properties virtually, making it easier for them to make buying decisions. Dogecoin whales are betting on PCHAIN because they expect the real estate altcoin to be the biggest winner in 2025. Its growing community of investors highlights its strong potential for long-term growth. On the other hand, Dogecoin has already experienced significant upside, meaning it has limited room for an explosive rally. PCHAIN for massive gains in 2025 In the past week, whales have accumulated PCHAIN during its ongoing token presale. The real estate altcoin has already progressed to the second round, earning early investors a 200% gain. The project is on course to surge 30,000% in 2025 thanks to its tokenomics, incentives, and value proposition. The project secured a CoinMarketCap listing , adding layers of transparency and credibility. With over $1 million raised during the presale, PropiChain is expected to bring more investors on board.

But they have found themselves frustrated as Yoon’s government ran into trouble with a disastrous showing in last year’s midterm elections and corruption allegations. The FSC appears ready to take up the mantle, however, with lawmakers “pausing” crypto legislation talks until the political turmoil abates . “We will institutionalize STOs to diversify the securities issuance and distribution system. […] We will reorganize the entire system. That will let comprehensive financial investment businesses perform their original role of providing corporate finance and venture capital.” Financial Services Commission Chairman Kim Byung-hwan “Last year, our capital market experienced considerable difficulties. The growth potential of our companies weakened due to the contraction of the domestic economy and an export slowdown. The market showed considerably sluggishness compared to major countries due to global conflicts and domestic political events.” Korea Exchange Chairman Jeong Eun-bo The FSC chief appealed to lawmakers, the ruling People’s Power Party, and corporate stock market investors to work together toward a common goal. He urged: “Although we are starting this year in difficult circumstances, the government, the National Assembly, and corporate investors should all work together. As one, we can make 2025 the year when both the overseas and South Korean investors who have exited our market make their return.” Late last year, Jeong said it was time for regulators to remove obstacles to adoption and called for South Korea to “institutionalize” crypto .

Toncoin’s December performance and future TON is showing promise this December, with analysts suggesting it could break resistance at $7.198 and push toward $8. Investor confidence is rising as TON’s exchange supply has dropped from 1.91 million to 1.85 million, indicating lower selling pressure. Technically, TON has recovered well, with its RSI bouncing back to 47 from a low of 18 earlier in the month. Analysts point to TON’s rising social and market activity as a key driver of its bullish momentum. Topping engagement charts in December, this surge reflects increased interest within the crypto community. Such heightened activity often precedes strong price action, suggesting TON could maintain its upward trajectory into 2025. Conclusion LINK and TON show potential but face mixed prospects. Lunex Network, with its token buybacks and burns, actively reduces LNEX supply, boosting long-term value for investors. Its innovative features make it a standout choice. Lunex is worth exploring and can transform each investor’s crypto trading journey.

Here Are The Major Support And Resistances To Watch Out For,https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-to-0-000045/,"Technical analysis shows that Shiba Inu is currently at a critical juncture where it could either rebound to new multi-year highs or face declines to retest a few support levels. In light of this, a recent analysis on TradingView has highlighted crucial support and resistance levels that could dictate SHIB’s short-term movements. This analysis was made on the daily candlestick timeframe chart of SHIB against Tether (USDT), which reveals the potential for a substantial rally toward $0.000045 if key resistance levels are broken. Major Support And Resistance Levels For Shiba Inu According to the analysis, two significant resistance levels are important in SHIB’s path to the upside. The first is at $0.00003239 and represents an immediate hurdle that could attract sellers or trigger profit-taking. This is more revealing, considering it acted as resistance in December 2024. A decisive move above this level would signal bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Flag Pattern Says Crash Is Far From Over Despite Crash To $91,000 The second resistance level is at $0.00004563 and is considered a psychologically significant barrier that might test the strength of market optimism. This is because this price level serves as the peak of Shiba Inu’s price movement in early 2024. If the bulls were to complete a successful move above $0.00004563, it could signal a move that would push Shiba Inu to challenge its current all-time high. On the downside, there are also two critical support levels that could prevent further SHIB price declines. The first notable support is at $0.00001035. Shiba Inu rebounded quite a few times on the upper end of this support zone in 2024, with the most notable bounce taking place on August 5. Historically, this level has demonstrated strong buy interest, making it a potential floor for the current trend. However, if the price fails to hold above this critical support level, the situation could shift significantly. A break below $0.00001035 would likely diminish buyer confidence, paving the way for SHIB to test even lower levels of support. Technical Indicators And SHIB Trading Strategy The analysis notes that key indicators, such as the MACD and RSI, currently suggest a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment for Shiba Inu. The MACD is flat with minimal momentum, while the RSI hovers near 40, slightly below the midpoint. These indicators, coupled with subdued trading volume, suggest that traders are awaiting a decisive breakout or break below the Shiba Inu price.

Conversely, a break below $0.00001035 could reinforce a bearish scenario. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00002239 and is up by 8% in the past 24 hours. According to a similar support level analysis by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the $0.0000215 to $0.0000193 support zone must hold in order for Shiba Inu to stay bullish.

This includes securities fraud and money laundering conspiracy, all brought upon him by federal prosecutors in Manhattan. Since the crypto firm plunged in 2022, Kwon has been accused of playing a major role in misleading investors. Do Kwon Misled Crypto Investors He failed to reveal the true state, stability, and security of the US dollar-pegged stablecoin TerraUSD. Instead, he informed unsuspecting investors that TerraUSD’s price slip could be addressed by an algorithm known as the “Terra Protocol.” To cover up for his deceit, Kwon allegedly allied with a high-frequency trading firm to inject millions into the ecosystem to sustain TerraUSD’s value artificially. Unfortunately, it did not turn out as he expected. TerraUSD crashed intensely and left the broader cryptocurrency industry in a huge deficit. In other words, it rippled over and led to the devaluation of Luna and widespread disruptions across the cryptocurrency market. Do Kwon’s Extradition Causes a Ruckus So far, the Terraform Labs executive has been faced with a series of legal proceedings. A few back and forth have occurred in the past few months concerning his extradition. While he committed fraud in South Korea, Kwon was arrested in Montenegro for traveling on a fake passport. Hence, many discussions have been held about his extradition. Last week, Montenegro’s Constitutional Court reportedly dismissed his appeal , citing some legal inconsistencies. For background, Do Kwon appealed his extradition to Montenegro and accused the court of procedural unfairness and violations of his rights. Montenegro Court Rules in Favour of US In the following days, Montenegro’s Justice Minister, Bojan Božović, signed off on Kwon’s extradition in favor of the US. The authorities have devoted time and resources to evaluating requests from both the United States and South Korea. As part of this review, factors like the seriousness of the crimes and the order of requests were considered. Do Kwon’s extradition add to the growing list of legal actions levied on top crypto leaders? Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is serving his 25-year jail term at a federal prison in Mendota, California. Though he pleaded “not guilty,” his conviction could lead to an extension of his prison sentence.

Both platforms have been making significant progress—Render by incorporating AI cryptocurrency technologies in decentralized GPU rendering and Injective by pioneering new DeFi scalability solutions. The rising price of Injective is a clear barometer of its increasing acceptance in finance-related applications. Yet, amidst these technological strides, Web3Bay shines as a high ROI cryptocurrency with vast potential for the long haul. Positioned to revolutionize Web3 commerce, Web3Bay melds decentralized e-commerce with groundbreaking payment options and user governance. Its strategy to integrate DeFi, NFTs, and cross-chain functionalities provides a utility that may surpass other contenders. For investors hunting for both profitability and practicality, Web3Bay’s blueprint for decentralized shopping distinguishes it as an exceptional choice. Web3Bay: The High ROI Crypto Transforming Web3 Commerce Web3Bay is laying the groundwork for a revolutionary shift in e-commerce by harmonizing blockchain technology with the simplicity of online shopping. Tailored for both cryptocurrency enthusiasts and mainstream consumers, it seeks to remove intermediaries, reduce fees, and secure transactions. Its versatile dual payment system, accepting both crypto and traditional methods like PayPal, broadens its appeal. For those keen on enriching their portfolio with a high ROI crypto, Web3Bay promises enduring value through a dynamic mix of functionality and forward-looking design. The active presale of Web3Bay’s 3BAY token aims to offer exponential returns for early investors. Launching at $0.003 per token, the price is set to climb by 15% in each successive stage, targeting $0.1959 in the final round. This pricing model has captured significant attention, with early participants potentially reaping returns exceeding 6430%. So far, the presale has sold over 56 million tokens and has raised more than $183,000, with the tokens now priced at $0.00345. As a governance token, 3BAY not only powers transactions but also empowers owners to influence the platform’s evolution, boosting its attractiveness as a high ROI crypto. Looking ahead, Web3Bay plans to incorporate NFTs, DeFi staking, and cross-chain functionalities. These enhancements aim to cement its status in the decentralized commerce arena. By marrying long-term utility with immediate financial upside, Web3Bay is gaining notice among both investors and crypto aficionados. Render Network: Leading AI Crypto Innovations Render Network is spearheading decentralized GPU rendering, offering a cost-effective platform for creators across film, gaming, and virtual reality sectors. By integrating AI cryptocurrency technologies, it efficiently utilizes dormant GPU power, making intricate rendering tasks more manageable and economical. Its Burn and Mint Equilibrium (BME) model ensures economic stability by balancing token supply with demand, facilitating predictable pricing for rendering and AI operations. The network is broadening its ecosystem, having recently partnered with major players like Stability AI and incorporating tools such as Blender’s Cycles. Users now benefit from the convenience of downloading completed projects directly to storage services like AWS. Priced at $6.88, the RNDR token reflects Render’s commitment to scalability and AI cryptocurrency applications, positioning it as a versatile choice for content creators and developers. Injective Price Grows with DeFi Expansion Injective is bolstering its position within the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, providing a scalable layer-1 blockchain suited for derivatives, prediction markets, and broad financial services. Priced at $20.61, the Injective token reflects its rising adoption, fueled by innovations like the inEVM layer-2 solution, which integrates Ethereum-based applications seamlessly. The introduction of tokenized real-world assets and yield-generating stablecoins like USDM expands its user base. Recent developments, including the Helix Institutional platform, target financial entities by offering secure environments for trading derivatives, indices, and more. Injective’s strategy to blend DeFi with AI cryptocurrency ventures opens avenues for automated, intelligent trading systems, indicating strong potential for enduring growth. In Conclusion Render and Injective are blazing trails in blockchain innovation with their respective focuses on AI cryptocurrency and DeFi. Render’s commitment to decentralized GPU rendering and Injective’s scalable financial solutions underscore their respective strengths. However, Web3Bay offers a distinctive advantage with its practical applications in Web3 commerce. As a high ROI cryptocurrency , it merges potential profitability with sustainable growth through initiatives like its 3BAY token presale and forthcoming DeFi and NFT integrations. For those seeking utility and robust returns, Web3Bay’s approach to decentralized commerce presents it as the superior option over its peers.

SUI’s trading volume surged to $10.45 billion in December, marking its seventh consecutive all-time high and showcasing a strong trend in decentralised trading. Meanwhile, anticipation builds for the potential approval of a Solana ETF in 2025, signaling a pivotal moment for alternative cryptocurrency investment tools. Lastly, BlockDAG (BDAG) is redefining engagement with its TG Tap Miner game and X1 Miner app, which together boast 405K active users. Named the best crypto miner app, the X1 Miner enables users to earn BDAG effortlessly. This coin has already risen by 2240% and shows immense potential for growth in 2025. SUI Trading Volume Reaches New Heights in December SUI trading volume reached an impressive $10.45 billion in December, setting a new all-time high for the seventh consecutive month. This achievement reflects sustained activity in decentralised trading, bolstered by a 21% price increase during a challenging market period. With key resistance at $4.80 and support at $3.00, traders are closely monitoring potential breakout opportunities. This surge in SUI’s trading volume highlights a strong trend in investor engagement, with 77% of dYdX traders taking long positions. While technical indicators suggest short-term adjustments, the consistent growth in trading volume points to the potential for continued upward movement in SUI’s valuation. Insiders Anticipate Solana ETF Approval in 2025 The approval of a Solana ETF is widely anticipated for 2025, as industry experts, including ETF Store President Nate Geraci , cite potential regulatory shifts in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While applications for a Solana ETF were submitted earlier this year, no launch occurred in 2024. This delay positions 2025 as a pivotal year for the introduction of this financial product. The demand for crypto ETFs remains robust, evidenced by eight of the top ETF launches in 2024 being crypto-related. A Solana ETF could further establish its ecosystem, which has already seen increased activity and competitive trading volumes. Earning Made Easy with BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner & X1 App BlockDAG combines engaging gameplay and accessible mobile mining to create a vibrant ecosystem for its users. The TG Tap Miner fosters community participation, with over 105,000 active players earning Tap Points through a fun and straightforward Telegram game. Players burst different types of balls, with rarer balls offering higher points, creating a competitive and rewarding experience. These points hold real value, as they can be converted into BDAG coins once the BlockDAG blockchain goes live. Taking a step beyond gaming, the BlockDAG X1 Miner app provides a simple way to earn BDAG coins daily. With over 300,000 active users using the app, it is widely regarded as the best crypto miner app—available on iOS and Android. The app allows users to mine up to 20 BDAG coins per day through a user-friendly interface. Its innovative Proof-of-Engagement algorithm rewards daily activity with features like a lightning button to boost mining rates. Unlike traditional mining setups requiring extensive hardware, the X1 Miner is lightweight and energy-efficient, making crypto mining accessible to anyone. Together, these apps create a seamless link between user activity and coin accumulation. The coins earned through these platforms represent a significant opportunity, as BDAG’s presale has raised $174.5 million. With a 2240% increase in value since its first batch, BDAG has grown from $0.001 to $0.0234, supported by a passionate community. Over 17.6 billion coins have been sold, making this the largest presale in the market. As the blockchain launch nears, the TG Tap Miner game and X1 Miner promote adoption and position BlockDAG as a leader in the decentralized movement. Final Thoughts As the SUI trading volume continues its record-breaking streak, its growing decentralised activity signals a promising upward trajectory for the token. The anticipated approval of the Solana ETF in 2025 could open new doors for alternative crypto investments, solidifying its market presence. However, BlockDAG shines brightest with its TG Tap Miner game on Telegram and X1 Miner app on iOS and Android, widely regarded as the best crypto mining app in the market. With BDAG’s value skyrocketing by 2240% and its presale already the largest in the market, these mining tools provide early access to the BDAG coin, which is poised for significant growth in 2025.

Dogecoin’s strength lies in its dedicated community and widespread recognition, making it one of the most well-known altcoins in the market. Its appeal fluctuates with market trends, but its growing popularity highlights the power of online communities to shape the crypto landscape. As a result, Dogecoin continues to be a notable player in the evolving world of alternative cryptocurrencies. Conclusion While coins like DOGE show less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out.

Catzilla isn’t just a token; it’s a rebellion against outdated systems. This meme coin champions the warriors of the crypto world, inviting them to rise, conquer, and claim their share of the market.

The coin gained popularity after a tweet by Elon Musk featuring BabyDoge as an adorable icon. Its primary utility is building a fun community and promoting animal welfare. The BabyDoge AI image generator allows users to create AI-generated BabyDoge characters, memes, and images without design experience; users can pay in BabyDoge to mint these images into NFTs. The project has donated over 81,000 pounds of dog food, holding an official world record for helping save dogs. BabyDogeSwap.com offers features like AMM, farms, token locker, burn portal, card, AI image generator, NFTs, and more. The coin’s focus on community and technology may attract interest in the current market cycle. CATSLAP: Challenging the market CATSLAP introduces the SLAP token as an aggressive entrant in the meme coin sector. Aiming to surpass established meme coins symbolized by frogs and dogs, SLAP seeks to capture attention with its unique approach. The platform encourages users, known as “Slappers,” to compete for high scores and elevate their country’s ranking on the “Slapometer.” This gamified aspect engages the community and adds a competitive edge. In the current market cycle, CATSLAP’s strategy to differentiate itself may appeal to those interested in emerging technologies within the crypto space. Conclusion While BabyDoge and SLAP may have less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to all. Offering a 700% ROI during its presale and triple utility features — governance, rewards, and staking — Catzilla invites enthusiasts to join the battle against crypto villains and reach new heights together.

Table of Contents Rollblock: Revolutionizing the $450B gambling sector through crypto Analyzing Dogecoin as a buy for 2025 Rollblock going strong into 2025 Trump’s presidency has positioned the crypto market for a major rally at the close of 2024. One decision, however, gave Dogecoin an edge over other coins: the establishment of the D.O.G.E. department in collaboration with Elon Musk. This department ignited Dogecoin’s surge, making it one of the top performers of 2024. Despite this, analysts predict that Rollblock is set to outshine Dogecoin in 2025. Rollblock: Revolutionizing the $450B gambling sector through crypto Rollblock’s main goal is to bring blockchain technology into the $450 billion gambling industry, removing issues that have plagued the industry for decades. Instead of dealing with hacks, the misuse of funds and fixed bets, Rollblock uses blockchain’s transparency and security to enhance the gaming experience. The project is already succeeding, raising over $8 million during its presale. Unlike other Web3 casinos, Rollblock takes security and compliance to a whole other level. With a Gaming Anjouan and a SolidProof audit, Rollblock can assure maximum security for both regular players and investors. The GambleFi protocol offers more than 7,000 games from more than 10 gaming providers, as well as newly introduced sports betting on major markets such as soccer, golf, and MMA. RBLK powers Rollblock’s ecosystem. The GambleFi protocol will use up to 30% of its revenue to buy tokens from the open market. From those tokens, 40% will be used as rewards for staking, and the rest will be burned to make RBLK deflationary. Currently in its ninth presale stage, analysts predict a bright future for the token. Some say that once RBLK hits the market, early investors will see a 100x return from its current price of $0.044. This prediction is fueled by Rollblock’s focus on utility. You might also like: 3 cryptos set to make new ATHs in January: XRP, RBLK and HBAR Analyzing Dogecoin as a buy for 2025 Dogecoin has seen a turbulent few weeks with recent challenges, including a vulnerability that caused a significant crash on its network. Despite this, the token has remained resilient, and many analysts maintain a bullish outlook for its future. Currently trading at $0.30930, Dogecoin has experienced a remarkable 245% gain in 2024, with hopes for further growth heading into the new year. A prominent market commentator, Ali Martinez, has consistently reiterated his ambitious price target for Dogecoin, forecasting a potential rally to as high as $18. While such a projection seems extraordinary, it’s grounded in the token’s previous price action. DOGE saw massive gains in the past, rallying 5,000% in 2017 and 12,000% in 2021. However, reactions from the market have been mixed, with critics arguing that an $18 price point would require a market capitalization of $2.65 trillion, far exceeding the market cap of Bitcoin. Nevertheless, even more conservative predictions of $4 still represent substantial upside and reflect the growing optimism for Dogecoin’s future. Rollblock going strong into 2025 Compared to Dogecoin, which lacks fundamental value and relies solely on capital gains, Rollblock is integrated into a robust ecosystem that leverages a market expected to reach $750 billion by 2028. This makes Rollblock a stronger contender for the 2025 altcoin season, offering far greater utility and significantly increasing the potential for a 100x return. With tokens currently priced at $0.044, this could be the perfect time to seize this opportunity before prices rise in the coming weeks.

Table of Contents Shiba Inu set for massive surge, analysts eye $0.000081 with rising burn rate Rexas Finance to yield 26,050% returns through real-world asset tokenization momentum Conclusion As 2024 comes to a close, there has been significant excitement in the crypto community. A leading analyst has made a bold prediction for 2025, suggesting that two tokens — Shiba Inu and a SHIB alternative focused on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization — could experience a surge of up to 26,050%. The new token in question is Rexas Finance , currently in its presale stage 11. Each token is priced at $0.175; in the next stage, the price will increase to $0.20. Shiba Inu set for massive surge, analysts eye $0.000081 with rising burn rate While trading at around $0.00002313, Shiba Inu still has room to push higher, and analysts have their hopes up. According to the analysis, SHIB can surge 234%, with a target price of $0.000081. This optimism comes with increased trading volume and a massive spike in the token’s burn rate. #ShibaInu Rebounds Strongly, Analysts Predict 234% Surge Toward $0.000081 $SHIB https://t.co/cvX6q1Mrmq — ChainAffairs ⚡ (@ChainAffairs) December 25, 2024 Rexas Finance to yield 26,050% returns through real-world asset tokenization momentum From the world of asset tokenization, Rexas Finance is carving out its niche in crypto. Currently, in Stage 11 of its presale, RXS is at $0.175, with the next stage bumping the price to $0.200. This presale has gained broad interest, already making $33,569,339 out of its $41 million goal. Platforms like Rexas Finance can fully meet the needs of investors looking to diversify their crypto portfolio further and enter the sphere of real estate or art. However, RWA tokenization has a market opportunity of one trillion dollars so that RXS could be at the confluence of this change. The exciting thing about RXS is the innovation and the huge potential gain. Since RXS is valued at $0.175 right now and historical data from other similar projects indicates that with rising adoption and changing market dynamics, projects of this nature could yield profits greater than 26050%, several experts believe this is a highly likely outcome. As blockchain technology breakthroughs continue to evolve, Rexas Finance is committed to helping improve liquidity and accessibility within the crypto ecosystem. If more and more investors understand that real-world assets can now be tokenized and tradable, demand for RXS may skyrocket. Additionally, RXS recently had an audit carried out by Certik and is now listed on leading trading platforms such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, making it increasingly visible to potential investors. Conclusion Analysts are coming out with predictions that SHIB could surge by 234% ROI and Rexas Finance a whooping 26,050%. It is clear that RXS investors stand to gain more than Shiba Inu. With its presale making alot of momentum, completing stages before its schedule, buying the presale at stage 11 could be a great addition to crypto portfolios.

Among the sea of LOL-worthy tokens, a few stand out as the best meme coins to buy today: BTFD Coin, Popcat, and Moo Deng. Trust me, you don’t want to sleep on these. Let’s start with the headliner, BTFD Coin . This one’s not just about memes — it’s about a lifestyle. As of now, BTFD Coin is in its 13th presale stage, priced at $0.000142. The project has raised over $4.8 million, smashing the $1 million milestone in under 10 days and the $2.5 million mark in just 14 days. With over 61 billion coins sold and 7,300+ holders, the Bulls Squad community is growing faster than your favourite TikTok trend. But what’s a meme coin article without some variety? Enter Popcat and Moo Deng, two coins that bring their own flavour to the mix. Stick around as we break down why these three projects are stealing the spotlight. BTFD Coin: Owning the Meme Coin Scene BTFD Coin isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s a rallying cry. BTFD Coin’s P2E game, in its entirety, is live, enabling players to experience the game and receive rewards. The name stands for “Buy The Dip,” and it’s here to remind you to seize the moment in market downturns.

The Bulls Squad: More Than Just a Meme At the heart of BTFD Coin is its vibrant community, the Bulls Squad, featuring characters like Baby Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Raging Bull. These quirky mascots embody the spirit of the coin — bold, strategic, and always ready to charge ahead.

Popcat: A Meme Coin That’s Purr-fectly Unique Next up, we have Popcat. If you’ve ever wasted hours on the viral Popcat game, you already know the drill. This token takes inspiration from the meme-famous feline with its signature wide-mouthed “pop.” But don’t let the silliness fool you — there’s more to this coin than adorable nostalgia. Popcat’s entire ecosystem revolves around fun. The developers have integrated mini-games and leaderboards into their platform, rewarding active players with tokens. Think of it as the Pokemon Go of crypto — except instead of catching Pikachu, you’re stacking Popcat tokens. What sets Popcat apart is its community.

The project’s roadmap includes partnerships with influencers and limited-edition NFT drops, keeping the excitement purring along. If you’re into playful vibes but still want a project with serious potential, Popcat is the one to watch. Moo Deng: The Bull Market’s New Bestie Lastly, let’s talk about Moo Deng, a meme coin with a name that’s a cheeky nod to farming and finance. This cow-themed crypto isn’t just about cute bovines; it’s also packed with features that make it a top-tier contender. Moo Deng integrates farming-inspired terminology with real-world decentralised finance (DeFi) applications. Users can “graze” their coins in liquidity pools, earning passive rewards while the tokenomics do their magic. The team behind Moo Deng knows how to milk (pun intended) the meme potential. From hilarious Twitter campaigns to viral TikToks, they’ve turned their marketing strategy into an art form. One thing that sets Moo Deng apart is its commitment to sustainability. The project donates a portion of its proceeds to environmental causes, making it a feel-good investment for eco-conscious crypto fans. Moo Deng proves that even in the world of memes, there’s room for meaningful impact. Final Words: Why These Three Are the Best Meme Coins to Buy Today When it comes to meme coins, it’s all about finding the balance between fun and functionality. BTFD Coin, with its robust rewards program and skyrocketing presale stats, is the clear leader. Popcat brings a playful twist with its gamified ecosystem, while Moo Deng combines humour with heart through its DeFi features and eco-friendly initiatives. Together, these three coins represent the best meme coins to buy today. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto pro or just dipping your toes into the market, these projects offer something for everyone.

Table of Contents Pepe and DOGS: Promising meme coins for January 2025 Lightchain AI: A low-cap gem with high potential Why these altcoins could be the top picks for early 2025 January presents a golden opportunity for investors looking to diversify their portfolios with high-potential altcoins. Leading the pack are meme favorites Pepe and DOGS, which continue to gain momentum with their strong community backing and robust market performance. Adding to the excitement is the low-cap gem Lightchain AI , a platform looking to merge blockchain and AI. With its Lightchain AI presale offering discounted tokens, the project is set to disrupt decentralized AI with unique features and scalability. These altcoins combine hype, utility, and early adoption potential, making them standout picks this month. Pepe and DOGS: Promising meme coins for January 2025 As of December 2024, both PEPE and DOGE have demonstrated significant growth, positioning them as promising meme coins for January 2025. PEPE coin Launched in April 2023, PEPE is an ERC-20 token inspired by the popular “Pepe the Frog” meme. Despite its humorous origins, PEPE has garnered substantial attention, reaching a market capitalization exceeding $11 billion by December 2024. This surge is attributed to its strong community support and viral appeal. Analysts predict that PEPE could experience further appreciation, potentially reaching $0.00002 in the first quarter of 2025 and $0.00005 by year’s end. DOGE Originally created as a joke, Dogecoin has evolved into a widely recognized cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of approximately $23.3 billion as of November 2024. Its enduring popularity is largely due to its active community and endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. DOGE’s low transaction fees and fast processing times have also contributed to its adoption as a payment method by various businesses. Investment considerations While PEPE and DOGE have shown impressive growth, it’s important to recognize that meme coins are highly speculative and volatile. Their value is often driven by market sentiment and social media trends rather than fundamental utility. Investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before considering investments in these cryptocurrencies.

These changes hope to make Lightchain AI a top name in AI and blockchain. Investors must see that while Lightchain AI shows big growth potential it is still an unsure buy. Doing deep research and checking risk levels are key before putting money in. Why these altcoins could be the top picks for early 2025 As the crypto market evolves, certain altcoins are emerging as standout investments for early 2025 due to their unique propositions and growth potential. Pepe and DOGS continue to thrive in the meme coin space, leveraging strong communities and consistent market activity. However, the real disruptor is Lightchain AI, a next-gen platform combining blockchain and artificial intelligence. Its presale has drawn significant attention, offering discounted access to LCAI tokens.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. 1Fuel’s vision sets a new standard, challenging the dominance of PEPE and XRP. Table of Contents Why 1Fuel is a game changer in the crypto world PEPE’s viral appeal XRP’s institutional use cases vs. 1Fuel’s vision Conclusion The story of meme coins in 2024 would not be complete without mentioning the viral rise of PEPE, which hit its all-time high in December. In other news, the institutional use cases Ripple (XRP) offers have maintained the demand for the coin as one of the best cryptocurrencies. However, there is a new sheriff in town, 1Fuel. The presale for 1Fuel is already gathering steam as analysts predict the new token to grow up to 100x in 2025. Investors are paying attention because of its multi-chain technology and attractive presale prices which position it among the best cryptocurrencies to buy. Why 1Fuel is a game changer in the crypto world 1FUEL aims to simplify cryptocurrency access by eliminating technical barriers and providing a wallet that automates complex processes, ensuring top-tier security and privacy. It is designed to enhance the cryptocurrency experience for both novice and experienced traders. 1FUEL’s one-click solution will allow users to select the coin they wish to buy or transact with, eliminating the need to hold multiple cryptocurrencies for transactions on different networks. The unique features, advanced security protocols, privacy enhancements, peer-to-peer exchange, and seamless integration with traditional financial systems make it a transformative and accessible wallet on the market. Interested investors can secure 1Fuel tokens via presale. PEPE’s viral appeal As a deflationary meme coin, PEPE was launched on Ethereum. By enacting a tax-free policy and being transparent about its lack of utility, PEPE appeals to the cryptocurrency community and maintains its meme coin simplicity. On November 13th, the 24-hour trade volume of PEPE reached a massive $15.69 billion. The institutional utility that 1Fuel is expected to provide is absent with PEPE. The project is based on strong utility and a distinct cross-chain transaction vision. It distinguishes itself from the meme currency craze with its creative privacy mixer, cold storage options, and P2P exchange, providing investors with actual benefits. XRP’s institutional use cases vs. 1Fuel’s vision Ripple, a blockchain-based digital payment project, has developed a network and protocol using the cryptocurrency XRP and the XRP Ledger. XRP’s institutional collaborations and contribution to the easing of cross-border payments have long been acknowledged. In 2025, Japanese banks are expected to adopt XRP, which would simplify cross-border payments and remittances while lowering consumer expenses. Approximately 80% of all Japanese institutions will adopt Ripple’s XRP for cross-border payments and remittances. However, a strong alternative is provided by 1Fuel’s multi-chain technology with staking incentives of up to 30% APR. Individual investors are given full ownership over their assets by 1Fuel, whereas XRP concentrates on financial institutions. 1Fuel’s smart contracts, which have been independently verified for security, will provide a smooth and reliable experience. Conclusion 1Fuel’s virality in 2025 has been predicted by analysts. This, coupled with its multi-chain vision, makes it among the best cryptocurrency to buy in 2025.

This development marks a collaboration between traditional financial institutions and decentralized blockchain ecosystems, offering users a stable and yield-bearing digital asset option. BlackRock BUIDL Fund Becomes Backing Asset for frxUSD The Frax community has passed FIP-418, a governance proposal that enables BlackRock’s United States Dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) as collateral for the frxUSD stablecoin. The vote which took six days garnered full support from the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). To this end, Frax Finance stated that BUIDL will function as the ‘custodian asset’ for the creation and creation of frxUSD. The Fund, however, invests in fairly liquid instruments including cash, U.S Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. Frax founder Sam Kazemian said; “frxUSD is a bridge between the blockchain world with its openness and programmability and BlackRock’s prime treasury products with their credibility.” BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, which has as of now more than $648 million in AUM, expects to minimize counterparty risk while maximizing frxUSD holders’ yield opportunities. This decision is in line with the recent development in the stablecoin market that has seen the adoption of real-world asset (RWA) backing. Features of the Frax Finance’s frxUSD Stablecoin The newly launched frxUSD stablecoin is pegged to the U.S. dollar on a 1:1 ratio which forms a good condition for price stability for the users. Frax Finance has integrated with Paxos in order to allow the conversion of frxUSD directly into fiat currency. Furthermore, the frxUSD holders shall receive distribution from the yield generated from the underlying assets within the tokenized fund. The initiative comes as part of the Frax Finance’s strategy to bring traditional finance products into the world of decentralized finance. The company also unveiled its intention to apply for access to the US Federal Reserve Master Account that would make frxUSD useful in the regulated markets. Growing Adoption of BUIDL-Backed Stablecoins Frax’s frxUSD is the newest in a line of stablecoins whose value is anchored to BlackRock’s BUIDL token. Ethena Labs has introduced its own asset-backed stablecoin, USDtb, in December 2024 to be backed by BUIDL. The stablecoin has a market capitalization of $70 million and is intended to mitigate the volatility associated with synthetic dollar offerings in volatile market conditions. Similarly, in the decentralized exchange, Curve Finance, users have been able to mint Elixir’s deUSD stablecoin using BUIDL as collateral. Such advancements suggest that more tokenized funds are being used, particularly for the collateral of stablecoins such as BUIDL. On the same note, the introduction of frxUSD is timely given that the stablecoin market is in the process of transformation following shifts in the regulatory environment. The Markets in Crypto-Assets ( MiCA ) regulation of the European Union came into force in its entirety on December 30, 2024, and has set new standards for stablecoin issuers. At the same time, BlackRock’s participation in the tokenized assets market proves that traditional financial institutions are gradually stepping in to connect Web3 and traditional finance. With $10.4 trillion in assets under management, BlackRock’s participation in the digital asset space inclusive of Bitcoin ETF record achievements is viewed as a step toward broader institutional acceptance of blockchain-based financial products.

New Year New Shiba (NEWSHIBA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to surge over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because NEWSHIBA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, New Year New Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and New Year New Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. New Year New Shiba launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy New Year New Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for New Year New Shiba by entering its contract address – 7DjEUoHG7Yr3LpaqNPcyc5DgNEYSLrnPV8zsjQBbAYfh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like NEWSHIBA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-03 00:50:00

As Bitcoin approaches this key level, data shows that the top crypto has shown mixed signals across key market indicators, reflecting a subtle yet significant shift in investor sentiment. Particularly, analysts have identified specific patterns in funding rates and premium metrics, which serve as vital tools for interpreting market sentiment and predicting potential price movements. Related Reading: Bitcoin Decline Continues: Is $86,800 The Level To Watch? Bitcoin Current Funding Rates And What It Signals A notable observation by CryptoQuant analyst Mignolet highlights how funding rate movements reflect retail investor sentiment. According to Mignolet analysis, funding rates, which represent the cost of holding long or short positions in perpetual futures contracts, are exhibiting nuanced movements. Historically, during moments of strong resistance, funding rates tend to decline, signaling subdued sentiment and caution among investors. In late October 2024, when Bitcoin was approaching its all-time high, funding rates showed similar behavior, reflecting investor hesitation despite rising prices. However, the current scenario presents a contrasting sentiment. The analyst disclosed that while corrective price movements have emerged, investors are viewing these pullbacks as buying opportunities rather than reasons for fear or contraction. This subtle psychological difference could influence market dynamics significantly, potentially paving the way for sustained upward momentum. Mignolet wrote: Similar corrective candles have appeared, and from a technical perspective, this position might seem even more precarious. However, the sentiment is different. People now view this as an opportunity and believe it’s a reasonable position to buy. I believe this subtle difference in sentiment has the potential to produce very significant results. Coinbase Premium Indicator Reaches Historic Low Another key observation comes from the Coinbase Premium Indicator, a metric that measures the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase (a US-based exchange) and other global exchanges.

The pseudonymous trader known as Altcoin Sherpa says that he thinks the Solana ( SOL )-based memecoin Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) will still go up, but he notes that he has some concerns. “I decided to lower my size on this one yesterday and am going to be patient with Fartcoin from here on out. I still think it’s an amazing meme and it’s going to go much higher but I would like to see it chop around more and make sure it doesn’t suffer the same fate as the other big memes that just had perpetual futures on Binance. Virtual and aixbt are promising but I feel like that’s a bit different than this. Going to watch but will consider adding more later.” Fartcoin is trading at $0.954 at time of writing. The 122nd-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down nearly 9% in the past 24 hours but up more than 3,750% since it launched in late October. Altcoin Sherpa also outlines his strategy for investing in artificial intelligence (AI) tokens. “Most all crypto AI is going to do pretty well this cycle; you just have to choose your horses.

Its data center sales are expected to rise from $110 billion to $200 billion by 2025, with dominance in AI technology. Nvidia was among the greatest Wall Street successes of 2024 as its market valued more than $2 trillion, which is $3.28 trillion at year-end. This made Nvidia the world’s second most valuable company, ranking after Apple with a value of nearly US$4 trillion. Nvidia largely deserves its exponential increase in demand because it’s playing a big role by driving AI-related technology through their chips. Nvidia’s AI dominance Nvidia’s market growth has been rapid, mainly driven by the rising demand for AI. Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) have become essential for creating and running AI technologies, like ChatGPT. These GPUs are the core of AI models, making Nvidia’s hardware crucial to the AI revolution. With the rise of generative AI technologies, companies like Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, and Cohere turned to Nvidia for its specialized chips to train and run complex AI models. This surge in demand for AI-powered technologies boosted Nvidia’s revenue and market value. From $1.2 trillion at the end of 2023, Nvidia’s market value more than doubled to $3.28 trillion by the end of 2024 with strong investors. This made Nvidia to have competitors like Microsoft and Google. Its stock price soared as investors sought to profit from the booming AI market. As Apple continued to lead in market value, approaching a $4 trillion valuation, driven by its planned AI improvements to boost iPhone sales. By the end of 2024, Microsoft was in third place with a $3.1 trillion market value, while Alphabet and Amazon were valued at about $2.3 trillion each. These major tech companies helped raise global stock indexes in 2024, with the S&P 500 up by 23.3% and the Nasdaq rising by 28.6%. Nvidia stands out from its competitors because of its combination of advanced hardware, software capabilities, and strong business partnerships. Other companies, like Amazon and Google, are making progress in AI, but they lack the complete ecosystem Nvidia has built. Nvidia’s data center sales are expected to rise significantly, from $110 billion in 2024 to $200 billion in 2025, while competitors like Broadcom and Marvell are projected to generate much smaller sales. Strategic investments and Acquisitions strengthen Nvidia However, Nvidia’s success in 2024 wasn’t just about responding to demand it also made strategic investments and acquisitions to solidify its leadership in AI technology. By 2024, Nvidia had allocated more than $1 billion in strategic investments to AI start-ups and corporate deals, growing 15 percent year over year. The company put money into 50 start-ups, including xAI (Elon Musk’s AI venture) and OpenAI and made a few key acquisitions, such as Run.ai, specializing in AI, as well as CoreWeave, an AI cloud computing provider. This involvement of Nvidia with AI is not just about investment in start-ups. CoreWeave was valued at $7 billion a year ago; it is now estimated at $35 billion. This, of course, was mainly because of the investment by Nvidia. Besides that, Nvidia bought companies like Deci, Shoreline.io, and Brev.dev. These purchased companies enhance Nvidia’s portfolio in medical technology, gaming, drones, and even humanoid robots. Nvidia’s growth was fueled not just by the high demand for GPUs, but also by its strong presence in various industries that rely on AI. By supporting AI start-ups through its Inception program and investing in new technologies, Nvidia became a key player in the AI revolution. However competitors like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, are working on creating their own alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs, which could hurt Nvidia’s business. The company also faces scrutiny from regulators in the U.S., Europe, and China. Despite the challenges and competitions, Nvidia stays on top with its AI and semiconductors, where it leverages hardware, software, and strategic partnerships.

As of the time of this writing, Bitcoin has made a sharp recovery: from the low of $94,280, the cryptocurrency has managed to rise above $96,900. The price increase represents a 2.72% gain within the last 24 hours, with trading volumes spiking by 87.07% to $45.93 billion. This rally shows a rising market sentiment as Bitcoin price nears the $97k mark and increasing the market capitalization near $2T. Similarly, in December, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author warned of an impending global economic depression, highlighting downturns in Europe, China, and the U.S. Robert Kiyosaki advised individuals to protect their wealth by investing in assets such as Bitcoin, gold, and silver. Therefore, he stressed the need for self-custody of Bitcoin and discouraged investors from focusing on the institutional investment products such as ETFs. Interestingly, Kiyosaki did not change his stand that Bitcoin price could reach $350,000 by 2025. Bitcoin Price Actions and Other Analysts’ Predictions Other market experts have echoed Robert Kiyosaki bullish sentiments for Bitcoin. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee has projected a target of $250,000 for Bitcoin in 2025, while Galaxy Digital anticipates the cryptocurrency could surpass $150,000 within the first half of the year. Analysts point to growing institutional interest and macroeconomic conditions as drivers for these projections. Additionally, an economist, Alex Krüger, suggests that a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve in 2025 could act as a catalyst for BTC price rally. He explains that reduced interest rates may create a risk-on environment, boosting assets like Bitcoin. Krüger also notes that a strong equities performance in March or April could further amplify Bitcoin’s upward momentum. Moreover, Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise, suggested that Bitcoin could reach $1 million in 2025. However, he cautioned that this would depend on the implementation of a U.S. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, which he estimated has less than a 10% chance of occurring. Market optimism remains high, fueled by Robert Kiyosaki’s predictions and prospect of enhanced adoption and regulatory clarity.

Canada appears to be taking notes as its own crypto industry seeks greater recognition. While Canadian politicians still sideline crypto discussions, the country’s crypto industry hopes this will shift with the federal election just months away. Canada’s crypto sector wants to emulate the US’s industry During campaigns, Donald Trump painted himself as the “crypto candidate,” claiming his administration would implement favorable policies for the industry. He even hinted at the possibility of a national Bitcoin reserve, currying favor with crypto supporters and investors. After his election victory, Trump made an effort to nominate digital asset supporters to his administration, and even more so, BTC prices have surged by more than 40%, crossing the $100,000 mark for the first time. In addition to Trump’s active role in boosting crypto’s influence, political contributions from key industry figures further amplified the movement. The crypto sector contributed about $135 million to support candidates, with Crypto’s Fairshake PAC and affiliated super-PACs receiving funding from giants like Coinbase, Ripple Labs, and Andreessen Horowitz. In Canada, however, crypto has yet to stir much controversy in the political arena, especially given the many restrictions on candidate donations. Nonetheless, Dean Skurka, CEO of WonderFi Technologies Inc., believes it is much easier to have crypto discussions now than a month ago. He expects the current momentum to continue even if crypto players can’t make that many donations to political groups or candidates. He added : We’re hopeful, but it hasn’t quite played out that way in Canada historically, and obviously in the US, this is the first time that it’s really become an election issue. Hopefully, the positive response that it has seen will be a signal to Canadian politicians to take it seriously. ~ Dean Skurka Not to mention, Canada’s crypto industry hopes that crypto will have a larger wave and impact on its elections, similar to the United States. Some of Canada’s crypto regulations have discouraged crypto exchanges from operating there Canada has been keen to institute policies that efficiently govern and manage the crypto industry. However, some crypto institutions felt they could not meet the regulatory requirements, shying away from the Canadian market. Binance , Bybit , dYdX, Paxos , and OKX are just some of the institutions that closed their operations in the country in 2023. The Canadian government is still adding regulations to the crypto space, but only time will tell whether or not those rules will be favorable for the crypto industry. The Crypto Asset Framework, for starters, will take effect in 2026. The framework obligates all digital asset brokers, exchanges, and ATM operators to reveal their full transaction data annually. It also requires service providers to disclose client-specific information, such as names, residential addresses, and taxpayer identification numbers. Moreover, according to Sophia Cote, head of public policy at Montreal-based crypto trading platform Shakepay Inc., the Canadian government is still looking for ways to regulate stablecoins.

The token’s price surged 200%, driven by whale activity and increased trading volume. With plans for a new Layer 1 network, Ai16z and other AI-driven tokens are to play a significant role in the 2025 crypto bull run.

This decline has triggered a wave of sell-offs by Dogecoin millionaires seeking to hedge their funds in the rapidly growing AI altcoin market. One notable beneficiary of this shift is PropiChain (PCHAIN) , an AI-powered altcoin making waves with its innovative approach to real estate investment. Market analysts are forecasting an impressive 45,309% ROI after the AI altcoin listing, which is anticipated to end soon. Dogecoin Price Activity Amid Whale Movements Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to capture attention as whales remain active despite the market’s current downtrend. On December 30, over 816 million DOGE were shuffled across two massive transactions, totaling a staggering $260 million. These whale activities have raised speculation about potential market shifts as the meme coin struggles to regain bullish momentum. The first transaction involved a transfer of 466.89 million DOGE ($150 million) to a new wallet, while another whale moved 350 million DOGE ($109.9 million) shortly after. Despite these shifts, Dogecoin’s price continues its descent, trading near $0.3103, a 2% drop in 24 hours. This price decline has not deterred optimistic analysts, who point to Dogecoin’s historical fractal patterns as a sign of potential explosive growth, with some predicting a climb to $23 this cycle. With its continued bearish movement, whales have moved significant amounts to RCO FInance (RCOF) as a hedging option. PropiChain (PCHAIN): Improving Real Estate Investments with AI and Blockchain PropiChain (PCHAIN) is more than just another altcoin; it represents a leap for the global real estate market. Designed as a decentralized platform, PropiChain uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), NFTs, and blockchain to address the inefficiencies and barriers in the real estate markets. PropiChain tokenizes physical real estate assets into digital NFTs, enabling secure and transparent ownership transfers. This approach eliminates the need for physical documents, third-party intermediaries, and cumbersome processes, streamlining property transactions. The NFT-based system also allows fractional ownership, making high-value properties accessible to a broader audience. Investors can seamlessly diversify their portfolios across multiple assets and trade ownership shares, bringing liquidity to a traditionally illiquid market. PropiChain stands out by integrating AI to simplify and enhance real estate investment strategies. Its AI-driven tools analyze market trends, predict property valuations, and provide actionable insights for investors. For example, the platform’s Automated Valuation Models (AVMs) use historical data and economic indicators to deliver real-time property valuations, ensuring accurate and transparent pricing. These features empower investors to make data-driven decisions, reducing risks and maximizing returns. PropiChain takes property investment further by integrating the metaverse into its ecosystem. Through the “Propiverse,” users can explore properties in immersive 3D environments, eliminating the need for physical site visits. This feature allows buyers to interact with properties more engagingly and in a more detailed way, providing a comprehensive understanding of their value. Sellers, in turn, can use the metaverse to enhance their marketing strategies, connecting with a global audience like never before. PropiChain transactions are recorded on a decentralized ledger called the “Title Contract,” which provides unparalleled transparency and security. This system eliminates risks such as fraud and corruption, common in traditional real estate markets. PropiChain significantly reduces transaction costs and accelerates the buying and selling process by removing intermediaries like brokers and government officials. Smart contracts, audited by BlockAudit, simplify operations by automating lease agreements, rental payments, and renewals, providing tamper-proof transactions. The PropiChain ecosystem is powered by its native altcoin, the PCHAIN AI altcoin, which is the foundation for all platform functionalities. AI altcoin holders gain access to features such as purchasing property NFTs, using AI-driven market tools, and participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Current PCHAIN AI Altcoin Presale The ongoing PropiChain (PCHAIN) presale is the perfect chance for Dogecoin millionaires to participate in the ecosystem at a low price. With AI altcoins priced at just $0.011 each during this presale phase, current investors anticipate a listing of $0.032, which translates to over 890% ROI. Currently listed on CoinMarketCap , experts anticipate that those who invest now could see returns as high as 450x once the PCHAIN AI altcoin is fully listed on trading platforms. For instance, if growth projections hold true, an investment of $100 could yield an astonishing return of approximately $450,000 by Q2 2025. As more investors flock to this promising altcoin amid Dogecoin’s decline, PropiChain stands out as an alternative and a revolutionary AI altcoin poised to reshape how we think about property ownership and investment. With the presale running fast, now is the perfect time to visit the platform and stake your position in the future of real estate with the PCHAIN AI altcoin.

XRP is reinventing global transactions with unmatched speed and affordability, while Solana pioneers in rapid blockchain transactions. In contrast, Web3Bay is redefining e-commerce by leveraging blockchain’s transparency and decentralization, focusing on user-centric benefits, making it a formidable rival to conventional platforms. The 3BAY token presale is a cornerstone of this transformation, promising substantial returns and vibrant community involvement, setting Web3Bay apart by focusing on tangible user benefits. Web3Bay’s 3BAY Token: A Promise of 6430% ROI Web3Bay is transforming e-commerce by marrying the convenience of cryptocurrencies with the spirit of blockchain’s community ethos. Picture a marketplace where the power lies in the hands of the users, free from intermediaries and exorbitant fees, positioning Web3Bay to disrupt giants like eBay. This platform is more than just a marketplace; it’s a movement rewarding users financially and functionally. At the core of this ecosystem is the 3BAY token, serving as both currency and a voice for the community. With tokens priced at just $0.00345 in the presale’s second stage, early adopters are on the brink of a potential windfall. Each presale stage sees a 15% price increase, peaking at $0.1959, offering an impressive potential return of 6000% for early participants. The presale has so raised more than $183,000, underlining its strength in the long-term. This opportunity is not just an investment but a chance to actively shape the platform’s governance and future growth. With cryptocurrency adoption for online purchases increasing by 34% in 2023, the user base has expanded to 580 million. Young adults, especially those aged 26-35, are keen on using crypto for their digital transactions, with 39% planning to boost their spending in this area. Web3Bay seamlessly integrates crypto payments with conventional methods, bridging user enthusiasm with practicality, thus offering a promising hybrid shopping and investment platform ensuring security, transparency, and data ownership. XRP’s Potential Leap to $50 by 2025: Grounded Optimism? XRP, Ripple’s flagship, is under scrutiny with forecasts suggesting a surge to $50 by 2025, thanks to its utility in enhancing global payments efficiently and affordably. With capabilities like processing transactions in seconds and handling thousands per second at minimal costs, XRP is a favorite among financial bodies worldwide. Nevertheless, XRP’s trajectory is heavily influenced by its legal entanglements with the SEC, which has dampened its potential. Yet, a hopeful outlook persists that regulatory clarity, possibly under a pro-crypto SEC chair in 2025, could catalyze substantial institutional adoption and boost XRP’s valuation. Can Solana Hit the $1,000 Mark by 2030? Known for its swift transaction capabilities and low costs, Solana has made significant strides in the blockchain arena with its unique Proof-of-History consensus. Despite market fluctuations, Solana’s role in DeFi has seen its Total Value Locked grow significantly, signaling strong adoption and trust in its technology. Analysts are pondering whether SOL can achieve the ambitious $1,000 target by 2030. Factors like continued technological advancements, ecosystem expansion, and increasing blockchain integration will play crucial roles. Despite challenges in scalability and market competition, Solana’s active developer community and strategic innovations could thrust it towards this significant milestone. Concluding Insights As blockchain technology permeates various sectors, entities like XRP, Solana, and Web3Bay provide fresh insights into its capabilities. XRP excels in enhancing global payments, Solana in scaling DeFi solutions, and Web3Bay in innovating e-commerce through a user-driven approach. Together, they exemplify the transformative potential of blockchain, merging technical innovation with practical applications to reshape how industries operate.

This price weakness in the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has caused concern among investors and market enthusiasts. Despite its robust ecosystem and dominance in decentralized applications, the Ethereum price struggles have left the door open for competing altcoins to capture the spotlight. This downturn has fueled skepticism about ETH’s near-term performance and sparked a renewed interest in an emerging AI altcoin, PCHAIN . According to leading market analysts, this AI altcoin is poised to outrun Dogecoin as we head into the 2025 bull run. The token’s unique value proposition and growing real-world utility in the $600 trillion global real estate market has set it miles ahead of other digital assets. In a market heavily influenced by speculative trends and shifting sentiment, this emerging AI altcoin stands out by addressing critical gaps that Dogecoin and similar tokens often fail to fill. Analysts project the token will capitalize on the Ethereum price slump and capture the attention of both retail and institutional investors. The Ethereum Price Struggles The Ethereum price has faced downward pressure recently due to macroeconomic factors, network congestion, and competition from rival blockchains. While the ETH blockchain remains the dominant ecosystem for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), its high transaction fees and scalability challenges have left room for alternatives to gain traction. Investors have grown increasingly concerned about the Ethereum price movement. This perceived weakness in the Ethereum price has led to a rotation of capital into an emerging AI altcoin, PCHAIN, which promises faster growth potential than the legendary Dogecoin. The Rise of the AI Altcoin, PCHAIN, Amid Ethereum Price Struggles The AI altcoin sparking interest amid the Ethereum price struggle is PCHAIN, an RWA altcoin and the utility token of PropiChain, a blockchain-powered real estate platform. Unlike Dogecoin, which relies on its community and celebrity endorsements for value, this altcoin uses cutting-edge technology and a unique value proposition to carve out a niche in the market. This AI altcoin combines the appeal of memecoins with tangible utility, making it a hybrid asset that bridges the gap between speculation and functionality. As an RWA altcoin, PCHAIN bridges the gap between the traditional real estate market and the blockchain. Why PCHAIN Could Outpace Dogecoin Leading market analysts project this AI altcoin will outrun Dogecoin based on its solid fundamentals and value proposition in the multi-trillion-dollar global real estate market. Initially created as a joke, Dogecoin has defied expectations to become one of the most well-known crypto assets. However, over-reliance on market hype leaves it vulnerable to market cycles. While Dogecoin has benefited from the support of notable figures like Elon Musk, this reliance on external factors could hinder its long-term sustainability. In contrast, PCHAIN’s focus on utility and innovation provides a more robust foundation for growth. The token’s integration with the world’s number one asset class, real estate, makes it an attractive option for investors seeking assets with intrinsic value, especially now that the Ethereum price is witnessing downward pressure. PropiChain, PCHAIN’s parent project, is primed to take at least 1% of the $600 trillion global real estate market. The platform is on course to become a $6 trillion ecosystem, potentially driving the value of the AI altcoin even higher. Additionally, the RWA tokenization market is projected to hit $16 trillion , with real estate the biggest beneficiary. As an RWA altcoin that bridges the gap between the real estate market and the blockchain, the demand for PCHAIN is set to witness an unprecedented surge beyond the 2021 legendary Dogecoin rally of over 12,000%. PropiChain Powering the Future of Global Real Estate With Cutting-Edge Technologies PropiChain is transforming the global real estate market by integrating cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), smart contracts, the Metaverse, and Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization. Using smart contracts, PCHAIN optimizes key processes such as property leasing and lease renewals, significantly simplifying property management operations. These automated workflows eliminate the need for intermediaries, lower transaction costs, and enhance transparency and efficiency in managing real estate assets. Real estate investors can take advantage of 24/7 support from AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots. These assistants and chatbots provide personalized guidance at every stage of the real estate investment process, ensuring a seamless and informed user experience. Moreover, the platform’s advanced AI-driven predictive algorithms deliver detailed market insights and future trend analysis, enabling investors to identify and capitalize on profitable opportunities in the real estate sector. Another standout feature of PropiChain is its integration of the Metaverse to facilitate immersive virtual property tours. Using virtual reality and 3D visualization, investors can explore properties from anywhere in the world, eliminating the need for physical site visits and offering an engaging, interactive way to evaluate potential investments. Additionally, PropiChain is also revolutionizing the investment landscape through property tokenization. The platform enables fractional ownership by converting real estate assets into digital tokens, allowing investors with smaller budgets to invest in high-value properties. This innovation opens real estate investment opportunities to a broader audience, democratizing access to lucrative markets. Conclusion The Ethereum price weakness has created an opportunity for investors to explore new horizons in the crypto space, and the AI altcoin, PCHAIN, presents the ideal opportunity for massive gains. With analysts projecting it will outrun Dogecoin, PCHAIN’s growth potential could become one of the best in the crypto space. While the Ethereum price struggles, analysts strongly project that your $1000 investment in the ongoing PCHAIN presale would yield a massive $236,000 profit within Q1 of 2025. The first presale round raised over $1.3 million, and the ongoing second presale round has crossed the $590,000 mark. Join the PCHAIN presale now to enjoy unprecedented returns on your investment. After the second presale round, the token price will increase from $0.011 to $0.023. PCHAIN is listed on CoinMarketCap , reiterating the Project’s readiness to do bigger things in the crypto space. BlockAudit , a top blockchain security firm, audited the Project’s smart contract and found zero vulnerabilities.

Showing signs of strength daily, the asset looks poised for a leg up but is currently facing a resistance line. Last month’s correction seriously reduced XRP’s price, as it lost roughly 10% of its valuation in three weeks. This led to a small bearish phase, and the crypto ended the year 2024 on a weak note. However, it started the new year on a recovery note and is now showing signs of strength on the daily chart. The asset is still facing small hurdles under $0.25, but we may see a breakup in the coming days. The latest positive actions suggest a potential bullish move for XRP following a noticeable increase in the buying volume level since yesterday. Although the bullish signal is yet to be confirmed until the price breaks out of the previous monthly high. A continuous rejection at the falling resistance line could subject the market to a brief consolidation phase before rallying hard. Otherwise, it may roll back to a nearby support before activating bullish at full speed. That said, the overall market structure remains bullish on a macro level. The price must dip below the $0.4 level before we can start to consider a bearish move. XRP’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Now that has reacted positively to the latest surge across the market, it is facing resistance at $0.25. Scaling through this resistance could bring a full recovery to $2.9 with a potential breakout to $3.3. If the price plunges through $2.15 to the holding $1.9 support, the lower level to consider for a breakdown is $1.63, followed by $1.28.

Musk’s Tesla Fire (MUSKFIRE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFIRE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk’s Tesla Fire can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk’s Tesla Fire could become the next viral memecoin. Musk’s Tesla Fire launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk’s Tesla Fire on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk’s Tesla Fire by entering its contract address – HuyxQUYCfoVCBpNoS1LxC1kbQuajYW9EqEcKoJqtdS1C – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFIRE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-03 02:10:00

The pressure is currently low but we can expect a big price movement when volume increases. The past week’s trading was uninteresting for many traders as Avax entered a serious but brief consolidation mode due to volatility shrink. But things have turned out a bit positive amid rising volume in the past 48 hours, and as we can see on the daily chart, the crypto is slowly climbing back with a surge to the $40 level – which is currently rejected. This surge came after mounting support above the $33 level during last month’s correction. Looking at the market from a technical standpoint, the correction appears to have ended on the daily chart. A full recovery to the top should bring the bulls back in control. But for now, the demand level appears low. If the asset loses grip again, Avax may resume correction until it finds a solid ground. Currently, it shows no signs of weakness on a daily scale as the bulls commit strongly to the price. While volume is slowly flowing back in the market, a break above the previous high could feature a bigger upward rally in the coming days. Avax’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The $42 level is an immediate resistance to watch in the latest surge. An increase above this level could bring more recovery to the $48.1 and $55.5 levels with a potential break out. Aside from the $33.6 level that acted as support during last month’s drops, Avax currently trades above $39. If the mentioned support level fails to hold, lower levels to consider for drops would be $29.9 and $23.9.

The market is flooded with options, but few projects stand out with the substance to match their hype. Qubetics, Ethereum, and Monero represent a trio of innovative projects redefining what blockchain technology can achieve, both now and in the future. Qubetics ($TICS) is taking real-world asset tokenization to new heights, allowing access to investments that were previously out of reach for many. Ethereum’s powerful ecosystem continues to serve as the backbone for decentralised applications, while Monero leads the charge in privacy-focused transactions. These three cryptos bring unique strengths that make them the best cryptos to invest in for long term success. Qubetics Reshapes Investments Through Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics is pushing boundaries in the world of blockchain by turning physical and digital assets into tokenized investments. Imagine owning a share of a valuable property, a rare commodity, or even intellectual property—all via fractional ownership enabled by Qubetics’ tokenization technology. This groundbreaking approach democratises access to wealth-building opportunities that were once reserved for the elite. For example, consider a small business owner looking to invest in real estate but lacking the capital to purchase a property outright. Through Qubetics’ marketplace, they can buy a fraction of a commercial property and earn proportional returns. Similarly, a creative entrepreneur could tokenize their intellectual property, like music or patents, and trade them efficiently on the platform. Beyond access, Qubetics also addresses long-standing challenges like limited liquidity and market inefficiency. Its secondary market simplifies the trading process, ensuring that investors can buy, sell, and manage assets with ease. The Qubetics presale has already captured attention, with over 395 million $TICS tokens sold, raising $8.5 million and counting. The current presale stage offers $TICS tokens at $0.0414, with a 10% price increase every Sunday at midnight. Each presale stage lasts seven days, creating urgency for those looking to join early. If you’re curious about the potential of real-world asset tokenization, watch this video to learn how Qubetics is reshaping the investment landscape. Ethereum Powers Innovation in Decentralised Applications Ethereum is widely regarded as the foundation of decentralised finance and smart contract technology. From DeFi platforms to NFTs and beyond, its ecosystem supports thousands of applications that have revolutionised the blockchain space. With its unparalleled versatility, Ethereum remains a cornerstone for long-term investors seeking reliable and innovative projects. One of Ethereum’s standout features is its adaptability. Developers can build and deploy decentralised applications (DApps) across a range of industries, from gaming to finance. Imagine a digital marketplace where you can purchase items with cryptocurrency or a financial application that lets you earn interest without needing a traditional bank. These are just a few of the many possibilities Ethereum enables. Its transition to Ethereum 2.0 further enhances its appeal. With the move to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, Ethereum has become more energy-efficient, scalable, and secure. These upgrades not only strengthen its network but also make it an attractive option for developers and users alike. Ethereum’s ecosystem continues to expand, proving its resilience and adaptability in an ever-changing market. For investors looking for a blockchain that supports endless innovation and real-world applications, Ethereum remains a strong contender for the best cryptos to invest in for long term growth. Monero Pioneers Privacy in Blockchain Transactions Monero has carved a niche for itself as the go-to cryptocurrency for privacy. Unlike most other cryptos, Monero’s blockchain is designed to be untraceable, providing users with unparalleled confidentiality in their transactions. This makes it a favourite among individuals and businesses who value financial privacy in an increasingly transparent digital world. For example, consider an individual who wants to send funds without exposing sensitive personal details, or a business that needs to safeguard its transaction history from competitors. Monero’s technology ensures that all transactions are private by default, using advanced cryptographic techniques to obscure sender and receiver identities as well as transaction amounts. Despite its focus on privacy, Monero is also highly practical. Its network processes transactions quickly and securely, making it a viable option for everyday use. Moreover, its community-driven development ensures that the blockchain remains robust and secure over time. Monero’s dedication to privacy and usability has earned it a loyal following, positioning it as a top choice for those who prioritise confidentiality. In a world where data breaches and financial surveillance are becoming more common, Monero’s privacy features make it one of the best cryptos to invest in for long term potential. Why These Cryptos Offer Exceptional Long-Term Value When it comes to the best cryptos to invest in for long term success, Qubetics, Ethereum, and Monero each bring something unique to the table. Qubetics’ focus on real-world asset tokenization opens up new avenues for accessible and transparent investing. Ethereum continues to serve as a foundational layer for decentralised applications, while Monero’s privacy-first approach addresses the growing demand for confidential transactions. The structured growth of the Qubetics presale, in particular, offers an enticing opportunity for early adopters.

33767162,[object Object],1735871429,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Fewer But Bigger: How Bitcoin Transactions Changed in 2024,https://bitcoinist.com/fewer-but-bigger-bitcoin-transactions-changed-2024/,"Here’s what on-chain data says regarding how the composition of the transaction activity on the Bitcoin network changed during 2024. 2024 Saw Growth In Some Bitcoin On-Chain Metrics, But Decline In Others In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has discussed about how the key indicators related to Bitcoin changed over the course of 2024. Below is the infographic shared by the analytics firm that breaks the data down: The first metric listed in the infographic is the “Number of Addresses,” which keeps track of the total number of wallets that exist on the Bitcoin blockchain. In December 2023, the indicator stood at 51.67 million, while in December 2024, its value was 53.16 million, suggesting the cryptocurrency’s user base grew during the year. Interestingly, though, despite this growth, network activity has actually gone down, as the data for the second metric, the Daily Transactions, would show. BTC’s monthly average transfers amounted to 550,000 at the end of 2023, but the metric only registered a value of 515,000 to close off 2024. This represents a decrease of more than 6% in Daily Transactions for the blockchain. Another metric related to transfers, the Daily Large Transactions, has curiously gone up in the same period. This indicator tracks the transfers that are valued at more than $100,000. 2024 saw the metric grow by over 44%. Transactions that are this large usually correlate to activity from the key investor groups of the market, like the whales . Thus, it would seem that it’s the smaller investors that have been making fewer trades this year, while large holders have only upped their interest in the cryptocurrency. HODLing behavior on the network also appears to have strengthened during 2024 as the Number of Long-Term Holders has gone up from 35 million in 2023 to 38.5 million in 2024. Long-term holders (LTHs) refer to Bitcoin investors who have been holding onto their coins for more than a year. This could perhaps be an optimistic development for the asset, as it suggests the holders are willing to be in it for the long run, despite the sharp increase the asset’s price has already observed during the past year. What may not be so positive, though, is the fact that the miners have participated in distribution. In total, these chain validators have decreased their total holdings by around 60,000 BTC, worth $5.8 billion at the current exchange rate, and corresponding to a decline of 3%. BTC Price Bitcoin is currently attempting another recovery run as its price has reclaimed the $96,800 mark. It only remains to be seen, however, if this rally would actually amount to anything, or if it would fail just like the other ones BTC showed during the last couple of weeks.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Retail|Bitcoin Transactions|bitcoin whales|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-03 02:30:29

This marks Aave’s new all-time high (ATH) in net deposits since 2021. Aave Hits $35 Billion In Net Deposits – What’s Ahead? In an announcement made yesterday, the leading DeFi lending protocol Aave revealed that it had reached a new ATH in net deposits since 2021. With $35 billion in net deposits, Aave has solidified its position as the largest DeFi protocol at the time of writing. Related Reading: AAVE Price Soars 26% In A Single Week — Will Rising FOMO Lead To A Bust? To put this into perspective, Aave’s net deposits were $5.5 billion at the end of 2022, increasing to $10 billion by the close of 2023. The current figure of $35 billion at the end of 2024 reflects an astounding surge of over 535% in just two years. The year 2024 proved to be transformative for Aave, with the protocol experiencing heightened user adoption across multiple blockchains. Throughout the year, Aave added support for five new markets, including BNB Chain, Scroll, ZKsync Era, and Ether.fi. According to the announcement, Aave is poised to expand further by potentially adding support for six additional blockchains. These include Mantle, Sonic, Linea, BOB, Spider Chain, and Aptos, pending approval by the Aave decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). For the uninitiated, a DAO is a blockchain-based entity governed by smart contracts and decentralized voting, where decisions are made collectively by token holders without any central authority. DAOs enable transparent, democratic management of protocols in a trustless environment. In addition to expanding to new blockchain markets, Aave launched its latest protocol upgrade, Aave V4. This upgrade introduces significant improvements, such as enhanced modularity, reduced governance overhead, optimized capital efficiency, and innovative features like the Hub and Spoke liquidity architecture. Moreover, Aave’s decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin GHO is set to witness increased adoption. Plans are in motion to expand its cross-chain support across various smart contract platforms, including Coinbase’s Base and Avalanche (AVAX), by early 2025. DeFi To Make A Comeback In 2025? Following Donald Trump’s victory in the November 2024 U.S. presidential election, DeFi tokens have experienced a significant surge, driven by optimism surrounding favorable cryptocurrency regulations under the new administration. Related Reading: Chainlink And AAVE Surge After Trump’s Crypto Project Invests In Both Additionally, DeFi protocols have become increasingly secure, fostering greater user trust and leading to higher deposit volumes and a larger total value locked (TVL). A recent report highlighted that DeFi exploits decreased by 40% in 2024 compared to 2023, signaling improved security across the ecosystem. In addition, Q1 2025 is expected to be bullish for Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and home to the largest DeFi ecosystem. A positive price action for ETH is expected to benefit major DeFi tokens such as AAVE, Curve (CRV), Compound (COMP), and others. That said, the Solana (SOL) DeFi ecosystem is rapidly gaining traction and catching up with Ethereum in terms of adoption. This development could propel Solana-based DeFi tokens, such as Orca (ORCA) and Raydium (RAY), to reach new highs. At press time, ETH is trading at $3,461, up 4% in the past 24 hours.
