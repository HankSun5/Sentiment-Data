Citing an article published by Axios on Wednesday, the report detailed Trump's comments during a meeting with representatives of an unnamed company. Trump allegedly said, “You made this much money last year and you're going to make a lot more now because of me… But where were you when I needed you? You weren't with me and maybe you were with Kamala Harris.” Two sources told Unchained that the company Trump was referring to was Ripple. While the Axios report did not mention Ripple by name or specify when the alleged conversation took place, it noted that Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen had previously donated millions of dollars to political action committees (PACs) supporting Harris. Related News: What's the Latest on the XRP Big Bull? Why Has XRP Price Increased? Ripple Labs has not released a statement in response to the allegations, and a spokesperson for the company declined to comment on whether Ripple is indeed the firm not mentioned in the Axios report. Similarly, Trump’s transition team did not respond to questions on the matter. This development highlights Trump’s continued scrutiny of companies and individuals he believes do not support him politically. Whether this will impact Ripple’s position in the crypto space or the ongoing regulatory battles remains to be seen. *This is not investment advice.

Toncoin whale activity has significantly increased, with transactions above $100,000 growing steadily in the last 24 hours. In parallel, Chainlink (LINK) continues to turn heads with a promising forecast, potentially reaching up to $366.22 by 2031. For those seeking the best long-term crypto, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out. The project is on a strong path toward reaching its $600 million goal, driven by its exciting partnership with Inter Milan, one of the most recognized football clubs in the world. The popularity of BlockDAG is growing rapidly, and the platform is getting ready to launch on 10 major centralized exchanges. These moves position BlockDAG as one of the most exciting prospects in the crypto space today. Toncoin Whale Activity Signals Strategic Moves While many cryptocurrencies face pressure from the market, Toncoin (TON) has displayed remarkable strength. A significant increase in whale activity partly drives this resilience. Over the past 24 hours, Toncoin’s whale transactions have surged by 94%, totalling an impressive $8.21 billion. These high-value transactions, often exceeding $100,000, indicate that TON whales might be accumulating or redistributing their holdings, possibly preparing for future gains. Despite the market’s fluctuations, Toncoin remains sensitive to larger economic factors such as investor sentiment and regulatory shifts, which could influence its future growth. Chainlink Price Prediction Points to Long-Term Potential Chainlink’s potential remains strong as decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology continue to grow. The platform’s integrations with major networks like Ethereum, Avalanche, and Arbitrum only add to its utility and relevance in the market. Chainlink’s price prediction shows a promising future, with the coin potentially reaching $37.83 by 2025, $116.57 by 2028, and up to $366.22 by 2031. While the current market is experiencing some volatility, recent whale activity points to a continued belief in Chainlink’s long-term growth. Still, short-term fluctuations and broader market pressures require careful attention. BlockDAG’s Road to $600M: Big Listings & Power Partnerships Ahead! Toncoin and Chainlink are drawing attention for their potential, but BlockDAG is swiftly becoming a top contender for those seeking a long-term crypto asset. So, what’s driving this momentum? BlockDAG combines cutting-edge technology with consistent growth and strategic partnerships, with one of the most notable being its collaboration with Inter Milan. This partnership has significantly raised BlockDAG’s global profile, introducing the project to millions of new potential buyers through high-profile events and social media campaigns. The influence of Inter Milan has not only enhanced BlockDAG’s visibility but also directly contributed to the success of its presale. To date, BlockDAG has raised over $181 million, with more than 17.9 billion BDAG coins sold. The current price for BDAG has surged to $0.0248, a dramatic increase from its initial offering of $0.001. Additionally, the presale has raised $6.2 million through miner sales, with over 15,400 miners now part of the community. With this strong momentum, BlockDAG is well on its way to meeting its $600 million presale target. This exciting trajectory will continue, especially with the planned launch of 10 major centralized exchanges. For anyone looking to get involved in a promising crypto project, now is an excellent time to jump in, as prices are expected to rise rapidly with growing demand. Achieve Financial Success with Top Long-Term Crypto With all the activity in the market, it’s clear that now is a critical time for crypto enthusiasts. Toncoin’s whale activity hints at a strong future, while Chainlink’s price forecast indicates long-term value. Yet, the real story may be BlockDAG. Thanks to its solid growth and partnership with Inter Milan, BlockDAG is becoming one of the most attractive options for long-term crypto buyers. As it nears its $600 million target, the opportunity to secure BDAG coins at today’s prices is closing quickly.

This success reflects substantial interest and has given participants a return potential of over 2380% since the first batch. BlockDAG’s collaboration with HackerEarth is part of a larger plan. This partnership aims to position BlockDAG as a central platform for developers, creators, and blockchain fans by conducting global hackathons that develop real-world uses and ensure lasting growth. Global Hackathons: A Key Move for BlockDAG These upcoming hackathons are crucial to BlockDAG’s plan to build a strong and active ecosystem. Through its partnership with HackerEarth, BlockDAG will organize four major global hackathons involving 10,000 to 15,000 developers. The focus is on attracting skilled teams to create decentralized applications on the network, targeting sectors such as DeFi, governance, and infrastructure.

This approach helps maintain a continuous flow of new ideas, providing developers the resources and motivation to implement their projects on BlockDAG’s scalable, decentralized platform. For those involved in the presale, these hackathons represent a commitment to building a robust ecosystem, not merely selling coins. Why Developer Engagement is Crucial for BlockDAG BlockDAG recognizes the importance of a dynamic developer community for the adoption of blockchain technology. The hackathons aim to draw developers by offering them the necessary resources to excel. With HackerEarth’s platform, which boasts a 7.6 million-strong community, BlockDAG connects with top-tier talent. For developers, these hackathons are more than just coding events; they are gateways to becoming integral parts of a blockchain network with significant real-world impact. For presale participants, the hackathons provide reassurance that BlockDAG values creation over mere speculation. The applications and projects developed are expected to increase the practical utility of BDAG coins, benefiting early backers. Record-Breaking Presale: Jump in Before it Ends! The BlockDAG presale offers a unique chance for individuals to be part of a project with a proactive future vision. Coins are reasonably priced at $0.0248 during the ongoing 27th batch, with significant growth potential. By the time results from the hackathons materialize early backers could see their stakes appreciate as BDAG coin demand rises. With over $181 million raised and presale incentives like the LAUNCH300, which provides a 300% bonus on purchases, the timing is ideal. Participants get to solidify their roles not just as observers but as active contributors to the ecosystem’s development. Looking Forward BlockDAG’s strategy to merge a successful presale with developer-centered innovations is unique in the blockchain sphere. The project does more than just offer coins—it builds a community where developers and early backers can prosper together. The presale is an entry point for enthusiasts, and the hackathons are set to deliver applications that will boost the network’s worth.

After dropping to a low of $168, SOL surged over 22% to reach $207, signaling renewed strength and bullish momentum. This impressive recovery has reignited optimism among investors and analysts alike, many of whom now anticipate a swift recovery and a potential bullish rally. Related Reading: Cardano Whales Go On A Shopping Spree – 100 Million ADA in 48 Hours Top analyst Jelle has shared a compelling technical analysis, highlighting that the “Solana season” may be on the verge of a major comeback. According to Jelle, Solana’s recent price movements indicate a significant shift in market structure. The downtrend appears to have flipped, with key resistance levels now acting as support. This critical development could pave the way for further upside in the coming days. As Solana continues to lead the charge among altcoins, its ability to maintain and build upon this momentum will be closely watched. With analysts predicting a strong recovery and investors eyeing new opportunities, all eyes are on SOL to see if it can sustain this bullish trajectory and reclaim its status as a top-performing asset in the market. Bullish Breakout And Sentiment Shifts Solana has shown remarkable strength in recent days, pushing above critical supply levels after enduring weeks of selling pressure. While the broader market remains volatile, Solana has managed to inspire confidence among investors and analysts, thanks to its steady climb. However, the asset still faces a significant challenge: reclaiming the local high around $220. Achieving this milestone could set the stage for a bullish rally into uncharted price territory. Top analyst Jelle recently shared an optimistic technical analysis on X, emphasizing the dramatic shift in Solana’s market structure. According to Jelle, the downtrend that defined Solana’s recent performance has officially flipped, with key resistance levels now acting as solid support. This critical development is a bullish signal for Solana’s prospects, reinforcing the idea that the asset is nearing the end of its consolidation phase. Jelle highlighted that one final hurdle remains before Solana can enter price discovery: breaking decisively above the $220 mark. If bulls can overcome this obstacle, the potential for a massive rally becomes highly likely. The sentiment surrounding Solana is increasingly positive, with many investors echoing Jelle’s sentiment that “Solana season” is on the horizon.

With bullish momentum picking up, Solana is positioned to challenge higher resistance levels in the coming days. The immediate target for bulls is reclaiming the $222 mark, a significant level that could determine the trajectory of Solana’s next move. Successfully breaking above this price and converting it into support would confirm the continuation of the bullish trend. This would also set the stage for Solana to target its all-time high (ATH), a psychological milestone for both traders and long-term investors. Related Reading: Chainlink Weekly Chart Looks Promising – If Bulls Reclaim $30 ‘ATH Are Next’ Analysts suggest that once Solana crosses the $222 level, the surge to ATH could happen rapidly. Market sentiment remains optimistic, with many participants expecting Solana to lead a new wave of upward momentum in the altcoin space. If the price continues to hold key support levels and bulls maintain control, Solana is poised to regain its status as one of the market’s top-performing assets. For now, all eyes are on $222 as the next critical step in Solana’s bullish journey.

Musk Saves California (MUSKCALI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKCALI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Saves California can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Saves California could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Saves California launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Saves California on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Saves California by entering its contract address – 2mtzeaYqDPLtCemX5jNPuuq8jw65cbgNUXuT3fBra2M2 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCALI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-16 23:03:00

The price of XRP surged to $3.20 on Jan. 15, marking a seven-year high, before retreating slightly to $3.09 as of 8:45 a.m. UTC on Jan. 16. CoinMarketCap data shows XRP gained over 32% in the past week. This rally occurred despite the SEC’s appeal filed on Jan. 15. The agency seeks to overturn a July 2023 decision by District Judge Analisa Torres, which ruled that XRP sales to retail investors were not unregistered securities. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, noted that XRP’s price momentum is largely due to Ripple Labs’ partial legal victories and growing investor optimism about regulatory clarity. “XRP’s surge can be attributed to favorable outcomes in Ripple’s SEC lawsuit and a more crypto-friendly political climate in the US. If regulatory uncertainties are resolved, the influx of institutional investors could further solidify XRP’s position in the crypto market,” Lee told Cointelegraph . RippleNet’s expanding adoption has also strengthened XRP’s appeal in the market, Lee added. Investor confidence is rising ahead of US President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20. His administration is expected to provide greater regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies and consider the Bitcoin Act, aimed at establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the US economy. Looking ahead, an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) could serve as a major price catalyst in 2025. JPMorgan estimates that an approved XRP ETF could attract $3 billion to $6 billion in net new investments, similar to Ether ETFs. Some analysts predict XRP could surpass $14, supported by technical indicators like a bullish pennant formation.

But while this could see BTC prices swell to $120,000, a “correction” could also see Bitcoin dip back to the $80,000 mark.

Dudchenko said there was “still a possibility that the price of Bitcoin will rise again” in the near future.

The only question is this: Will the wave be sparked by a deeper correction in BTC/USD, or will it begin in the very near future?” Nikolai Dudchenko, analyst at Russian financial/media group Finam Cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX has been fined $100 million for violating the federal Bank Secrecy Act by failing to adequately police money laundering, the DOJ said https://t.co/9hUmB2w2TD pic.twitter.com/nwZpcLD9gD — Reuters Legal (@ReutersLegal) January 15, 2025 The Trump Factor Dudchenko added that if a “correction” does take place, this could see the price of Bitcoin drop to $80,000. But should the price instead rise again in the short term, the expert said that the “nearest target for possible growth” was the $120,000 mark. Dudchenko suggested that a range of factors could affect Bitcoin prices’ imminent “sharp” growth or fall.

Dudchenko said that Bitcoin is currently “consolidating in the range of $90,000 to $100,000.” However, he warned that “volatility” was likely during Trump’s inauguration period, with the market braced for developments. Source: Dune/@21co Dudchenko said that market watchers would be wise to recall that “the reason for the fall in the price of Bitcoin at the end of December 2024” was a speech from the head of the US Federal Reserve System Jerome Powell. Powell argued against the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve. However, on January 16, the New York Post said that Trump was “receptive” to the idea of building strategic reserves.

XRP surged to $3.33 on Thursday after a New York Post report that President-elect Donald Trump is receptive to the idea of a US-based crypto reserve, comprising assets like XRP and Solana. 🇺🇸 BREAKING: Trump considers US-based crypto reserve, potentially prioritizing coins like Solana and $XRP . pic.twitter.com/Lwix7XGrHx — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) January 16, 2025 This comes on the heels of other reports stating that Donald Trump’s SEC could pause all crypto enforcement actions, essentially confirming that the agency could drop or settle its lawsuit against XRP’s parent company, Ripple. Is It Too Late To Buy XRP? XRP is undoubtedly the strongest large-cap cryptocurrency on the market. It is not without any reason the XRP/BTC ratio is up by 33% over the past week and 42% over the past month, despite the Bitcoin price trading at $100,000. With Donald Trump set to take oath on January 20th, experts are wondering whether there could be any mention of Ripple or a US crypto reserve in his inaugural speech. It is dubious whether the US Congress will approve a crypto reserve including volatile altcoins like Solana and XRP. Experts aren’t even convinced about the possibility of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, with Polymarket betters giving it only a 48% chance. This level of support from an incoming President could position XRP as a top choice for institutional investors. Moreover, the incoming SEC — led by pro-crypto Paul Atkins — has already benefitted Ripple. The XRP price breached the crucial $2.90 resistance level after reports that the agency could pause all crypto enforcement actions, hinting that the Ripple-SEC lawsuit is all but over. Basically, $XRP no longer a security! https://t.co/aZDtQdR8hp — Ali (@ali_charts) January 15, 2025 The new Commission could also approve a spot XRP ETF, which JPMorgan analysts believe could add up to $8 billion to XRP’s market cap in the first year alone. However, a few bulls have started to take profits, suggesting that it may now be too late to buy XRP. For instance, prominent trader Crypto Tony reveals he secured some profits at $3.1, even as he expects the token to rally to $3.84. $XRP / $USD - Update Played out perfect. I have shed some profit here. pic.twitter.com/JuUWqRPLul — Crypto Tony (@CryptoTony__) January 16, 2025 Another prominent analyst Crypto Prime reveals that he will close his current long position at $3.40. It would now be prudent for sidelined investors to wait for an XRP dip before scaling into long positions. Nevertheless, it does remain an excellent long-term investment, with many now expecting it to peak at $10 in 2025. Are AI Agent Coins The Best Crypto To Buy Now? While XRP’s current bull rally may be reaching a point of exhaustion, AI agent coins don’t appear to be running out of steam any time soon. VIRTUAL, AI16Z and AIXBT continue to extend their gains, while a new AI agent crypto Moby reached a $100 million market cap in 3 days. Another new AI meme coin — Mind of Pepe (MIND) — has raised over $1.5 million on day one of its ICO, signalling high upside potential. Mind of Pepe is a self-evolving, self-sovereign AI agent, with self-managed X and Telegram accounts as well as a crypto wallet. $MIND holders will soon receive real-time market intelligence, alpha trading strategies and sentiment and technical analysis, thanks to cutting-edge AI tech and community intelligence. They may even receive discounted access to new crypto coins that Mind of Pepe launches. MIND also has its own staking pool, a feature missing in many AI meme coins.

Is Now the Right Time to Invest in XRP? XRP stands out as the most robust among large-cap cryptocurrencies. It's no surprise that the XRP/BTC ratio has increased by 33% this past week and 42% over the last month, even as Bitcoin's price sits at $100,000. As Donald Trump prepares to be sworn in on January 20th, analysts are speculating whether Ripple or a US crypto reserve might be mentioned in his inaugural address. It's uncertain if the US Congress would endorse a crypto reserve that includes volatile altcoins like Solana and XRP. Many experts remain skeptical about a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, with bets from Polymarket giving it just a 48% likelihood. Such support from a new President could make XRP an attractive option for institutional investors.

This activity is a precursor to potential price increases, as whales tend to accumulate assets when they expect upward momentum. Whales Accumulate 200M DOGE as Dogecoin Price Targets $3 According to analyst Ali Martinez, whales have added 200 million DOGE to their holdings within 48 hours, signaling strong bullish sentiment. Whale accumulation often reflects confidence in the asset’s potential, particularly in anticipation of market movements. This activity has fueled optimism for Dogecoin potential to break past key resistance levels. Source: X Dogecoin price currently holds above the critical $0.36 resistance, indicating a possible upward trajectory. If the bullish trend continues, analysts suggest the price may rise to $0.40 or higher, backed by growing market interest and whale activity. Similarly, a recent DOGE price prediction suggested the possibility of a rally to $3 as early as January, citing Fibonacci retracement patterns and historical trends. With Dogecoin currently trading around $0.37, this projection suggests an 8x rally fueled by growing market momentum. Analysts highlight the January 20 inauguration and meme coin activity as potential catalysts for a breakout. Key Resistance Levels and Path to $3 Dogecoin price must overcome immediate resistance at $0.4007 to sustain its bullish momentum. Analysts believe breaking this level could open the path to $0.45, with potential gains beyond this mark driven by leveraged long positions. However, failure to hold above $0.35 may lead to profit-taking or the liquidation of leveraged positions. Historical patterns also support the bullish outlook. The current 46% correction in Dogecoin price mirrors its January 2021 setup, which preceded a significant bull run. If the pattern repeats, Dogecoin may be gearing up for a similar breakout, with a rally targeting $3. Source: X Bullish Sentiment Fueled by Broader Market Recovery The broader crypto market recovery has further strengthened bullish sentiment for Dogecoin. Rising daily trading volumes, which have increased by 18% to surpass $4 billion, suggest growing retail and institutional interest. Other market analysts have also supported the bullish outlook for Dogecoin , highlighting the double bottom pattern as a key reversal signal. Technical indicators like Chaikin Money Flow and RSI suggest further upward potential, provided DOGE holds critical support levels. At press time, Dogecoin is trading at $0.3769, reflecting a 17% gain over the past week. The market cap stands at $55.64 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $4.19 billion, up by 7%.

At the meeting, the ETH developers finalized the timeline for the upgrade launch following months of active deliberations. A Galaxy Research executive, Christine Kim, shared the call summary with the community. Ethereum Pectra Upgrade: When Launch? The developers agreed to launch the upgrade early to mid-March. They also agreed on a new set of schedules, including January 20 or 30 for the next ACDE calls. At this meeting, the block number for the upgrade and the exact date and time will be agreed upon. The developers must decide on the new client releases for the Pectra upgrade by February 3. The Sepolia Fork will occur on February 12, and Holesky will follow seven days later. As noted, the mainnet fork will come by early to mid-March. However, this depends on whether nothing derails the plan. the proposed schedule is: jan 23 or jan 30, on next few acd calls finalize block number, exact date/time, for upgrades feb 3, publish new client releases for the upgrade by this date ~feb 12, sepolia fork ~feb 19, holesky fork early to mid march, mainnet fork — Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) January 16, 2025 As Christine Kim highlighted, Ethereum developers are not planning to launch another devnet for the upgrade. This is why they are improvising with a shadow fork of Sepolia and/or Holesky testnets. Recall the developers launched the Mekong testnet last year for the pectra upgrade. Overall, she said bugs in code might shift the timeline considerably. However, she noted that the odds of a March launch remain high after today’s call. What is Special About Pectra? It is worth noting that this upgrade is the biggest after the Dencun Upgrade that lowered fees on Layer-2 protocols. The Pectra upgrade complements this enhancement with scalability and security. Once launched, it will introduce innovative features that optimize transaction speeds. With new features like account abstraction and EVM Object Format (EOF) enhancements in EIP-7692, the upgrade will benefit users and developers alike. After Pectra, Coingape highlighted that the Fusaka upgrade is next for the ETH developers. However, the timeline of the schedule for this next upgrade remains unclear at this time. Aiding the ETH L2 Ecosystem The ongoing series of upgrades in the Ethereum ecosystem is designed to enhance Layer-2 scaling solutions. Notably, these L2 protocols welcome more innovations than the Ethereum blockchain, so they may be the biggest beneficiaries of these upgrades. As reported earlier, Tether has launched USDT0 , its new stablecoin on Ink, the L2 solution launched by Kraken. This next wave of innovations might benefit more from the enhanced developer experience that Pectra and Fusaka will introduce in the coming months.

With the general crypto market recovery strong following recent news about Donald Trump’s inauguration as the new president of the United States, BTC could muster enough momentum to reclaim its current all-time high. Key Chart Formation Emerges As Bitcoin Recovers As momentum builds in the market, informative platform IC News has cited a price trend on the Bitcoin chart that might trigger a notable rally for BTC in the short term. Looking at BTC’s movements, the platform highlighted that a significant falling wedge formation is unfolding on its chart. A falling wedge formation, often associated with bullish reversals, indicates that an upward move for BTC could be on the horizon. This impending chart pattern has captured the attention of traders and investors alike, sparking speculations about a possible continuation of the recent uptrend. Following an investigation of the 1-day chart, IC News stated that BTC has been stabilizing below the crucial $100,000 mark after briefly surging above the level twice. Meanwhile, the market is currently locked within the emerging large falling wedge formation. Similar trends in the past have ignited the start of significant price spikes, increasing interest in the flagship asset’s next move. Given the market’s resurgence, a comparable scenario may occur, igniting the much-anticipated rally for Bitcoin to its all-time high. Should the asset break the pattern to the upside with strong momentum, the platform foresees an explosive rise to new highs in the coming months. Furthermore, IC News expects the rally to push BTC toward the $120,000 milestone, marking a new all-time high . Has BTC Achieved Its Peak For This Cycle? After reaching its current peak of $108,000 last month, Bitcoin witnessed a sharp descent, triggering heightened speculation that the asset may have reached its top for this cycle. However, some crypto analysts contend that BTC is not yet close to its top as it still has a long way to go in the current cycle. Market expert and creator Stockmoney Lizards addressing the discussion and confusion in the community highlighted that Bitcoin is only halfway to its top. His perspective comes after the flagship asset’s recent upsurge, reclaiming the $100,000 level. Comparing this cycle with previous ones using the post-Halving trend, Stockmoney Lizards noted that BTC had not reached the top of the channel as indicated in his chart. Furthermore, no Relative Strength Index-based top indication has been provided, and BTC’s price is still well above the blue channel following a brief retest. As a result, the expert anticipates a rally all the way to the top, predicting a path to the $200,000 milestone by the year of the end. With on-chain metrics and historical trends showing potential for continued growth, the expected move to this cycle peak might kickstart in the following months.",Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|MNT|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ZK|WLD|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-17 00:00:28

Elon Bromance (ELOBRO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOBRO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Bromance can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Bromance could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Bromance launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Bromance on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Bromance by entering its contract address – FY7aYv7K3yEE9Z8hzgURj5z7biTE8Z6BpunBPAnCEpxj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELOBRO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-17 00:24:00

Once dismissed as mere novelties, these coins have captivated a generation of investors, becoming a significant force in modern economies. They’re not just for laughs anymore; they’re becoming serious players that can yield substantial returns. As the meme coin market matures, investors are keen to spot the top new meme coins to buy this month. Meme coins have surged in popularity, particularly among younger audiences who appreciate their whimsical nature and community-driven ethos. Tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu paved the way, showing that a fun concept could translate into serious financial gain. Now, new players like BTFD Coin are entering the arena with ambitious projects aimed at taking the meme coin craze to a whole new level.

But it’s not alone; Snek is reaching more investors with its relatable branding, and Gigachad is making a comeback that’s impossible to ignore. Let’s dive into how these coins stack up against each other and why they’re among the top new meme coins to buy this month. BTFD Coin: The Excitement is Real BTFD Coin has been making headlines since its launch, and for good reason. Currently in the 13th stage of its presale and priced at just $0.000142, this coin is drawing significant attention. What’s even more exciting is its presale performance, having surpassed $5.2 million within the first month. If you’re considering investing, let’s break it down: if you were to invest $40,000 at the current price, you’d snag around 281,690,140 BTFD coins. Now, if the price rises to $0.0006 by the end of the presale, your investment would skyrocket to approximately $169,000! That’s the kind of massive return potential that gets people excited. One of the standout features of BTFD Coin is its community-centric approach. The coin offers a referral programme that rewards holders for bringing in new investors, creating a vibrant ecosystem where everyone can benefit. This not only enhances the user experience but also fosters a sense of belonging among investors. The addition of a P2E game is a game-changer, allowing users to earn while having fun.

Its community-driven approach and engaging branding make it one of the top new meme coins to buy this month. Gigachad: The Comeback Kid Last but certainly not least, we have Gigachad, a meme coin that’s making a noteworthy comeback. Initially launched with much fanfare, Gigachad faced some challenges that caused it to lose momentum. However, recent developments indicate that this coin is ready to reclaim its spot among the top new meme coins to buy this month.

Launched as an alternative for Bitcoin in 2011, the cryptocurrency draws much interest among analysts and investors alike. Canary Capital has made a significant step forward in its quest for a Litecoin ETF. The company recently filed an amendment to its S-1 registration form with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, a move that industry experts interpret as a sign of ongoing discussions with the regulatory body. Related Reading: Expert Sees Bitcoin Dipping To $50K While Bullish Momentum Persists For market watchers and crypto aficionados alike, this development has spurred a great ounce of optimism. Considered as a good indication of possible approval, the revised filing indicates that the SEC has responded on Canary’s application. Analysts Comment On Litecoin ETF Approval Prospects Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg has publicly expressed his opinion that the “most likely” contender for the next spot crypto ETF approval is a Litecoin ETF. This prediction has gained traction in the crypto community. Balchunas does, however, also recognize the uncertainties the forthcoming shift in SEC leadership brings. Though the date of his Senate confirmation is yet unknown, the choice of former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins—considered crypto-friendly—by President-elect Donald Trump has spurred hope even further. We had heard chatter that the Litecoin S-1 had gotten comments back from SEC. This looks to confirm that which bodes well for our prediction that Litecoin is most likely to be the next coin approved. All that said, new SEC chair has yet to start and that’s a huge variable. https://t.co/cKFswPwcr0 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 15, 2025 James Seyffart, another Bloomberg ETF expert, said that the change could mean that the SEC has given feedback on the application. NEW: @CanaryFunds just filed an amended S-1 for their Litecoin ETF filing. No guarantees — but this might be indicative of SEC engagement on the filing. Still no 19b-4 filing yet though (A 19b-4 would actually start the potential approval/denial clock) h/t @isabelletanlee pic.twitter.com/wFtNOmbmYx — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 15, 2025 Investor Activity & Market Reaction A Litecoin ETF promises to set off a major market reaction.

The trading activity has also increased sharply, with Litecoin’s 24-hour volume jumping over 240%, reaching $1.7 billion. Implications For The Crypto Market If approved, a Litecoin ETF would represent a big milestone for the digital currency. Litecoin would then join Bitcoin and Ethereum as the only cryptocurrencies with US-approved spot ETFs, strengthening its market position.

The proposal aims to reduce inflation. SIMD-0228 introduces a market-oriented solution that fluctuates based on the staking participation rate, which is calculated by dividing the amount of staked SOL. Assuming the staking participation rate falls below the recommended target of 50%, new token issuance will increase to reward stakers and validators and secure the network. In reverse, if the participation rate exceeds the target rate, token issuance is restricted, and the inflationary rate is cap-capped to limit the rate at which new tokens are minted. Tokenomics and inflation continue to challenge distributed cryptocurrency networks, sparking ongoing debates about the best incentive models. Solana validators approve proposal to redirect priority fees Mid-last year, Solana validators voted to approve another proposal, SIMD-0096, which removed the 50% burn mechanism for validator priority fees over the network and allowed 100% of the fees to be allocated to block producers. This proposal aimed to improve incentives around how validators receive priority fees, helping with network security. SIMD-0096 was expected to eliminate possible side deals between block producers and transaction submitters, improving incentives within the validator system. The original proposal stated . This ensures that validators are appropriately incentivized to prioritize network security and efficiency, rather than being incentivized to engage in potentially detrimental side deals . SIMD-0096 proposal Critics of the proposal warned that removing the protocol’s 50% fee-burning mechanism to incentivize validators would raise SOL’s inflation rate. This inflation would benefit validators; however, SOL holders who choose not to stake could face the negative effects of inflation eroding their holdings. Though the proposal received a 77% approval rate, SIMD-0096 has not yet been implemented on the Solana mainnet at the time of this writing. 65% of SOL is staked, with Jito’s MEV rewards exceeding $100 million Data from StakingRewards shows that approximately 65% of SOL’s circulating supply is currently staked. Jito — a Solana-based maximal extractable value (MEV) block-building solution — surpassed $100 million in tips in December 2024, offering an additional income stream for validators. The advocates of adjusting Solana’s token emissions argue that validator rewards gained through maximal extractable value are sufficient incentives for validators to secure the network. According to proponents, these MEV-based incentives reduce the necessity of allocating 100% of priority fees to network validators and are considered preferable to the risk of increasing SOL’s inflation rate.
