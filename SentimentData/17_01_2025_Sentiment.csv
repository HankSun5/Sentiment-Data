Citing an article published by Axios on Wednesday, the report detailed Trump's comments during a meeting with representatives of an unnamed company. Trump allegedly said, “You made this much money last year and you're going to make a lot more now because of me… But where were you when I needed you? You weren't with me and maybe you were with Kamala Harris.” Two sources told Unchained that the company Trump was referring to was Ripple. While the Axios report did not mention Ripple by name or specify when the alleged conversation took place, it noted that Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen had previously donated millions of dollars to political action committees (PACs) supporting Harris. Related News: What's the Latest on the XRP Big Bull? Why Has XRP Price Increased? Ripple Labs has not released a statement in response to the allegations, and a spokesperson for the company declined to comment on whether Ripple is indeed the firm not mentioned in the Axios report. Similarly, Trump’s transition team did not respond to questions on the matter. This development highlights Trump’s continued scrutiny of companies and individuals he believes do not support him politically. Whether this will impact Ripple’s position in the crypto space or the ongoing regulatory battles remains to be seen. *This is not investment advice.

Toncoin whale activity has significantly increased, with transactions above $100,000 growing steadily in the last 24 hours. In parallel, Chainlink (LINK) continues to turn heads with a promising forecast, potentially reaching up to $366.22 by 2031. For those seeking the best long-term crypto, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out. The project is on a strong path toward reaching its $600 million goal, driven by its exciting partnership with Inter Milan, one of the most recognized football clubs in the world. The popularity of BlockDAG is growing rapidly, and the platform is getting ready to launch on 10 major centralized exchanges. These moves position BlockDAG as one of the most exciting prospects in the crypto space today. Toncoin Whale Activity Signals Strategic Moves While many cryptocurrencies face pressure from the market, Toncoin (TON) has displayed remarkable strength. A significant increase in whale activity partly drives this resilience. Over the past 24 hours, Toncoin’s whale transactions have surged by 94%, totalling an impressive $8.21 billion. These high-value transactions, often exceeding $100,000, indicate that TON whales might be accumulating or redistributing their holdings, possibly preparing for future gains. Despite the market’s fluctuations, Toncoin remains sensitive to larger economic factors such as investor sentiment and regulatory shifts, which could influence its future growth. Chainlink Price Prediction Points to Long-Term Potential Chainlink’s potential remains strong as decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology continue to grow. The platform’s integrations with major networks like Ethereum, Avalanche, and Arbitrum only add to its utility and relevance in the market. Chainlink’s price prediction shows a promising future, with the coin potentially reaching $37.83 by 2025, $116.57 by 2028, and up to $366.22 by 2031. While the current market is experiencing some volatility, recent whale activity points to a continued belief in Chainlink’s long-term growth. Still, short-term fluctuations and broader market pressures require careful attention. BlockDAG’s Road to $600M: Big Listings & Power Partnerships Ahead! Toncoin and Chainlink are drawing attention for their potential, but BlockDAG is swiftly becoming a top contender for those seeking a long-term crypto asset. So, what’s driving this momentum? BlockDAG combines cutting-edge technology with consistent growth and strategic partnerships, with one of the most notable being its collaboration with Inter Milan. This partnership has significantly raised BlockDAG’s global profile, introducing the project to millions of new potential buyers through high-profile events and social media campaigns. The influence of Inter Milan has not only enhanced BlockDAG’s visibility but also directly contributed to the success of its presale. To date, BlockDAG has raised over $181 million, with more than 17.9 billion BDAG coins sold. The current price for BDAG has surged to $0.0248, a dramatic increase from its initial offering of $0.001. Additionally, the presale has raised $6.2 million through miner sales, with over 15,400 miners now part of the community. With this strong momentum, BlockDAG is well on its way to meeting its $600 million presale target. This exciting trajectory will continue, especially with the planned launch of 10 major centralized exchanges. For anyone looking to get involved in a promising crypto project, now is an excellent time to jump in, as prices are expected to rise rapidly with growing demand. Achieve Financial Success with Top Long-Term Crypto With all the activity in the market, it’s clear that now is a critical time for crypto enthusiasts. Toncoin’s whale activity hints at a strong future, while Chainlink’s price forecast indicates long-term value. Yet, the real story may be BlockDAG. Thanks to its solid growth and partnership with Inter Milan, BlockDAG is becoming one of the most attractive options for long-term crypto buyers. As it nears its $600 million target, the opportunity to secure BDAG coins at today’s prices is closing quickly.

This success reflects substantial interest and has given participants a return potential of over 2380% since the first batch. BlockDAG’s collaboration with HackerEarth is part of a larger plan. This partnership aims to position BlockDAG as a central platform for developers, creators, and blockchain fans by conducting global hackathons that develop real-world uses and ensure lasting growth. Global Hackathons: A Key Move for BlockDAG These upcoming hackathons are crucial to BlockDAG’s plan to build a strong and active ecosystem. Through its partnership with HackerEarth, BlockDAG will organize four major global hackathons involving 10,000 to 15,000 developers. The focus is on attracting skilled teams to create decentralized applications on the network, targeting sectors such as DeFi, governance, and infrastructure.

This approach helps maintain a continuous flow of new ideas, providing developers the resources and motivation to implement their projects on BlockDAG’s scalable, decentralized platform. For those involved in the presale, these hackathons represent a commitment to building a robust ecosystem, not merely selling coins. Why Developer Engagement is Crucial for BlockDAG BlockDAG recognizes the importance of a dynamic developer community for the adoption of blockchain technology. The hackathons aim to draw developers by offering them the necessary resources to excel. With HackerEarth’s platform, which boasts a 7.6 million-strong community, BlockDAG connects with top-tier talent. For developers, these hackathons are more than just coding events; they are gateways to becoming integral parts of a blockchain network with significant real-world impact. For presale participants, the hackathons provide reassurance that BlockDAG values creation over mere speculation. The applications and projects developed are expected to increase the practical utility of BDAG coins, benefiting early backers. Record-Breaking Presale: Jump in Before it Ends! The BlockDAG presale offers a unique chance for individuals to be part of a project with a proactive future vision. Coins are reasonably priced at $0.0248 during the ongoing 27th batch, with significant growth potential. By the time results from the hackathons materialize early backers could see their stakes appreciate as BDAG coin demand rises. With over $181 million raised and presale incentives like the LAUNCH300, which provides a 300% bonus on purchases, the timing is ideal. Participants get to solidify their roles not just as observers but as active contributors to the ecosystem’s development. Looking Forward BlockDAG’s strategy to merge a successful presale with developer-centered innovations is unique in the blockchain sphere. The project does more than just offer coins—it builds a community where developers and early backers can prosper together. The presale is an entry point for enthusiasts, and the hackathons are set to deliver applications that will boost the network’s worth.

After dropping to a low of $168, SOL surged over 22% to reach $207, signaling renewed strength and bullish momentum. This impressive recovery has reignited optimism among investors and analysts alike, many of whom now anticipate a swift recovery and a potential bullish rally. Related Reading: Cardano Whales Go On A Shopping Spree – 100 Million ADA in 48 Hours Top analyst Jelle has shared a compelling technical analysis, highlighting that the “Solana season” may be on the verge of a major comeback. According to Jelle, Solana’s recent price movements indicate a significant shift in market structure. The downtrend appears to have flipped, with key resistance levels now acting as support. This critical development could pave the way for further upside in the coming days. As Solana continues to lead the charge among altcoins, its ability to maintain and build upon this momentum will be closely watched. With analysts predicting a strong recovery and investors eyeing new opportunities, all eyes are on SOL to see if it can sustain this bullish trajectory and reclaim its status as a top-performing asset in the market. Bullish Breakout And Sentiment Shifts Solana has shown remarkable strength in recent days, pushing above critical supply levels after enduring weeks of selling pressure. While the broader market remains volatile, Solana has managed to inspire confidence among investors and analysts, thanks to its steady climb. However, the asset still faces a significant challenge: reclaiming the local high around $220. Achieving this milestone could set the stage for a bullish rally into uncharted price territory. Top analyst Jelle recently shared an optimistic technical analysis on X, emphasizing the dramatic shift in Solana’s market structure. According to Jelle, the downtrend that defined Solana’s recent performance has officially flipped, with key resistance levels now acting as solid support. This critical development is a bullish signal for Solana’s prospects, reinforcing the idea that the asset is nearing the end of its consolidation phase. Jelle highlighted that one final hurdle remains before Solana can enter price discovery: breaking decisively above the $220 mark. If bulls can overcome this obstacle, the potential for a massive rally becomes highly likely. The sentiment surrounding Solana is increasingly positive, with many investors echoing Jelle’s sentiment that “Solana season” is on the horizon.

With bullish momentum picking up, Solana is positioned to challenge higher resistance levels in the coming days. The immediate target for bulls is reclaiming the $222 mark, a significant level that could determine the trajectory of Solana’s next move. Successfully breaking above this price and converting it into support would confirm the continuation of the bullish trend. This would also set the stage for Solana to target its all-time high (ATH), a psychological milestone for both traders and long-term investors. Related Reading: Chainlink Weekly Chart Looks Promising – If Bulls Reclaim $30 ‘ATH Are Next’ Analysts suggest that once Solana crosses the $222 level, the surge to ATH could happen rapidly. Market sentiment remains optimistic, with many participants expecting Solana to lead a new wave of upward momentum in the altcoin space. If the price continues to hold key support levels and bulls maintain control, Solana is poised to regain its status as one of the market’s top-performing assets. For now, all eyes are on $222 as the next critical step in Solana’s bullish journey.

Musk Saves California (MUSKCALI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKCALI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Saves California can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Saves California could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Saves California launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Saves California on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Saves California by entering its contract address – 2mtzeaYqDPLtCemX5jNPuuq8jw65cbgNUXuT3fBra2M2 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCALI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-16 23:03:00

The price of XRP surged to $3.20 on Jan. 15, marking a seven-year high, before retreating slightly to $3.09 as of 8:45 a.m. UTC on Jan. 16. CoinMarketCap data shows XRP gained over 32% in the past week. This rally occurred despite the SEC’s appeal filed on Jan. 15. The agency seeks to overturn a July 2023 decision by District Judge Analisa Torres, which ruled that XRP sales to retail investors were not unregistered securities. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, noted that XRP’s price momentum is largely due to Ripple Labs’ partial legal victories and growing investor optimism about regulatory clarity. “XRP’s surge can be attributed to favorable outcomes in Ripple’s SEC lawsuit and a more crypto-friendly political climate in the US. If regulatory uncertainties are resolved, the influx of institutional investors could further solidify XRP’s position in the crypto market,” Lee told Cointelegraph . RippleNet’s expanding adoption has also strengthened XRP’s appeal in the market, Lee added. Investor confidence is rising ahead of US President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20. His administration is expected to provide greater regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies and consider the Bitcoin Act, aimed at establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the US economy. Looking ahead, an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) could serve as a major price catalyst in 2025. JPMorgan estimates that an approved XRP ETF could attract $3 billion to $6 billion in net new investments, similar to Ether ETFs. Some analysts predict XRP could surpass $14, supported by technical indicators like a bullish pennant formation.

But while this could see BTC prices swell to $120,000, a “correction” could also see Bitcoin dip back to the $80,000 mark.

Dudchenko said there was “still a possibility that the price of Bitcoin will rise again” in the near future.

The only question is this: Will the wave be sparked by a deeper correction in BTC/USD, or will it begin in the very near future?” Nikolai Dudchenko, analyst at Russian financial/media group Finam Cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX has been fined $100 million for violating the federal Bank Secrecy Act by failing to adequately police money laundering, the DOJ said https://t.co/9hUmB2w2TD pic.twitter.com/nwZpcLD9gD — Reuters Legal (@ReutersLegal) January 15, 2025 The Trump Factor Dudchenko added that if a “correction” does take place, this could see the price of Bitcoin drop to $80,000. But should the price instead rise again in the short term, the expert said that the “nearest target for possible growth” was the $120,000 mark. Dudchenko suggested that a range of factors could affect Bitcoin prices’ imminent “sharp” growth or fall.

Dudchenko said that Bitcoin is currently “consolidating in the range of $90,000 to $100,000.” However, he warned that “volatility” was likely during Trump’s inauguration period, with the market braced for developments. Source: Dune/@21co Dudchenko said that market watchers would be wise to recall that “the reason for the fall in the price of Bitcoin at the end of December 2024” was a speech from the head of the US Federal Reserve System Jerome Powell. Powell argued against the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve. However, on January 16, the New York Post said that Trump was “receptive” to the idea of building strategic reserves.

XRP surged to $3.33 on Thursday after a New York Post report that President-elect Donald Trump is receptive to the idea of a US-based crypto reserve, comprising assets like XRP and Solana. 🇺🇸 BREAKING: Trump considers US-based crypto reserve, potentially prioritizing coins like Solana and $XRP . pic.twitter.com/Lwix7XGrHx — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) January 16, 2025 This comes on the heels of other reports stating that Donald Trump’s SEC could pause all crypto enforcement actions, essentially confirming that the agency could drop or settle its lawsuit against XRP’s parent company, Ripple. Is It Too Late To Buy XRP? XRP is undoubtedly the strongest large-cap cryptocurrency on the market. It is not without any reason the XRP/BTC ratio is up by 33% over the past week and 42% over the past month, despite the Bitcoin price trading at $100,000. With Donald Trump set to take oath on January 20th, experts are wondering whether there could be any mention of Ripple or a US crypto reserve in his inaugural speech. It is dubious whether the US Congress will approve a crypto reserve including volatile altcoins like Solana and XRP. Experts aren’t even convinced about the possibility of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, with Polymarket betters giving it only a 48% chance. This level of support from an incoming President could position XRP as a top choice for institutional investors. Moreover, the incoming SEC — led by pro-crypto Paul Atkins — has already benefitted Ripple. The XRP price breached the crucial $2.90 resistance level after reports that the agency could pause all crypto enforcement actions, hinting that the Ripple-SEC lawsuit is all but over. Basically, $XRP no longer a security! https://t.co/aZDtQdR8hp — Ali (@ali_charts) January 15, 2025 The new Commission could also approve a spot XRP ETF, which JPMorgan analysts believe could add up to $8 billion to XRP’s market cap in the first year alone. However, a few bulls have started to take profits, suggesting that it may now be too late to buy XRP. For instance, prominent trader Crypto Tony reveals he secured some profits at $3.1, even as he expects the token to rally to $3.84. $XRP / $USD - Update Played out perfect. I have shed some profit here. pic.twitter.com/JuUWqRPLul — Crypto Tony (@CryptoTony__) January 16, 2025 Another prominent analyst Crypto Prime reveals that he will close his current long position at $3.40. It would now be prudent for sidelined investors to wait for an XRP dip before scaling into long positions. Nevertheless, it does remain an excellent long-term investment, with many now expecting it to peak at $10 in 2025. Are AI Agent Coins The Best Crypto To Buy Now? While XRP’s current bull rally may be reaching a point of exhaustion, AI agent coins don’t appear to be running out of steam any time soon. VIRTUAL, AI16Z and AIXBT continue to extend their gains, while a new AI agent crypto Moby reached a $100 million market cap in 3 days. Another new AI meme coin — Mind of Pepe (MIND) — has raised over $1.5 million on day one of its ICO, signalling high upside potential. Mind of Pepe is a self-evolving, self-sovereign AI agent, with self-managed X and Telegram accounts as well as a crypto wallet. $MIND holders will soon receive real-time market intelligence, alpha trading strategies and sentiment and technical analysis, thanks to cutting-edge AI tech and community intelligence. They may even receive discounted access to new crypto coins that Mind of Pepe launches. MIND also has its own staking pool, a feature missing in many AI meme coins. Early buyers are already generating significant passive income, currently at an APY of over 1000%. Considering the strong latent demand for new AI meme coins, it is no surprise that experts are calling Mind of Pepe the next 10x crypto.

Is Now the Right Time to Invest in XRP? XRP stands out as the most robust among large-cap cryptocurrencies. It's no surprise that the XRP/BTC ratio has increased by 33% this past week and 42% over the last month, even as Bitcoin's price sits at $100,000. As Donald Trump prepares to be sworn in on January 20th, analysts are speculating whether Ripple or a US crypto reserve might be mentioned in his inaugural address. It's uncertain if the US Congress would endorse a crypto reserve that includes volatile altcoins like Solana and XRP. Many experts remain skeptical about a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, with bets from Polymarket giving it just a 48% likelihood. Such support from a new President could make XRP an attractive option for institutional investors. Additionally, the incoming SEC, led by crypto-friendly Paul Atkins, has already positively impacted Ripple.

This activity is a precursor to potential price increases, as whales tend to accumulate assets when they expect upward momentum. Whales Accumulate 200M DOGE as Dogecoin Price Targets $3 According to analyst Ali Martinez, whales have added 200 million DOGE to their holdings within 48 hours, signaling strong bullish sentiment. Whale accumulation often reflects confidence in the asset’s potential, particularly in anticipation of market movements. This activity has fueled optimism for Dogecoin potential to break past key resistance levels. Source: X Dogecoin price currently holds above the critical $0.36 resistance, indicating a possible upward trajectory. If the bullish trend continues, analysts suggest the price may rise to $0.40 or higher, backed by growing market interest and whale activity. Similarly, a recent DOGE price prediction suggested the possibility of a rally to $3 as early as January, citing Fibonacci retracement patterns and historical trends. With Dogecoin currently trading around $0.37, this projection suggests an 8x rally fueled by growing market momentum. Analysts highlight the January 20 inauguration and meme coin activity as potential catalysts for a breakout. Key Resistance Levels and Path to $3 Dogecoin price must overcome immediate resistance at $0.4007 to sustain its bullish momentum. Analysts believe breaking this level could open the path to $0.45, with potential gains beyond this mark driven by leveraged long positions. However, failure to hold above $0.35 may lead to profit-taking or the liquidation of leveraged positions. Historical patterns also support the bullish outlook. The current 46% correction in Dogecoin price mirrors its January 2021 setup, which preceded a significant bull run. If the pattern repeats, Dogecoin may be gearing up for a similar breakout, with a rally targeting $3. Source: X Bullish Sentiment Fueled by Broader Market Recovery The broader crypto market recovery has further strengthened bullish sentiment for Dogecoin. Rising daily trading volumes, which have increased by 18% to surpass $4 billion, suggest growing retail and institutional interest. Other market analysts have also supported the bullish outlook for Dogecoin , highlighting the double bottom pattern as a key reversal signal. Technical indicators like Chaikin Money Flow and RSI suggest further upward potential, provided DOGE holds critical support levels. At press time, Dogecoin is trading at $0.3769, reflecting a 17% gain over the past week. The market cap stands at $55.64 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $4.19 billion, up by 7%.

At the meeting, the ETH developers finalized the timeline for the upgrade launch following months of active deliberations. A Galaxy Research executive, Christine Kim, shared the call summary with the community. Ethereum Pectra Upgrade: When Launch? The developers agreed to launch the upgrade early to mid-March. They also agreed on a new set of schedules, including January 20 or 30 for the next ACDE calls. At this meeting, the block number for the upgrade and the exact date and time will be agreed upon. The developers must decide on the new client releases for the Pectra upgrade by February 3. The Sepolia Fork will occur on February 12, and Holesky will follow seven days later. As noted, the mainnet fork will come by early to mid-March. However, this depends on whether nothing derails the plan. the proposed schedule is: jan 23 or jan 30, on next few acd calls finalize block number, exact date/time, for upgrades feb 3, publish new client releases for the upgrade by this date ~feb 12, sepolia fork ~feb 19, holesky fork early to mid march, mainnet fork — Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) January 16, 2025 As Christine Kim highlighted, Ethereum developers are not planning to launch another devnet for the upgrade. This is why they are improvising with a shadow fork of Sepolia and/or Holesky testnets. Recall the developers launched the Mekong testnet last year for the pectra upgrade. Overall, she said bugs in code might shift the timeline considerably. However, she noted that the odds of a March launch remain high after today’s call. What is Special About Pectra? It is worth noting that this upgrade is the biggest after the Dencun Upgrade that lowered fees on Layer-2 protocols. The Pectra upgrade complements this enhancement with scalability and security. Once launched, it will introduce innovative features that optimize transaction speeds. With new features like account abstraction and EVM Object Format (EOF) enhancements in EIP-7692, the upgrade will benefit users and developers alike. After Pectra, Coingape highlighted that the Fusaka upgrade is next for the ETH developers. However, the timeline of the schedule for this next upgrade remains unclear at this time. Aiding the ETH L2 Ecosystem The ongoing series of upgrades in the Ethereum ecosystem is designed to enhance Layer-2 scaling solutions. Notably, these L2 protocols welcome more innovations than the Ethereum blockchain, so they may be the biggest beneficiaries of these upgrades. As reported earlier, Tether has launched USDT0 , its new stablecoin on Ink, the L2 solution launched by Kraken. This next wave of innovations might benefit more from the enhanced developer experience that Pectra and Fusaka will introduce in the coming months.

Elon Bromance (ELOBRO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOBRO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Bromance can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Bromance could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Bromance launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Bromance on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Bromance by entering its contract address – FY7aYv7K3yEE9Z8hzgURj5z7biTE8Z6BpunBPAnCEpxj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELOBRO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-17 00:24:00

Tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu paved the way, showing that a fun concept could translate into serious financial gain.

Launched as an alternative for Bitcoin in 2011, the cryptocurrency draws much interest among analysts and investors alike. Canary Capital has made a significant step forward in its quest for a Litecoin ETF. The company recently filed an amendment to its S-1 registration form with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, a move that industry experts interpret as a sign of ongoing discussions with the regulatory body. Related Reading: Expert Sees Bitcoin Dipping To $50K While Bullish Momentum Persists For market watchers and crypto aficionados alike, this development has spurred a great ounce of optimism. Considered as a good indication of possible approval, the revised filing indicates that the SEC has responded on Canary’s application. Analysts Comment On Litecoin ETF Approval Prospects Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg has publicly expressed his opinion that the “most likely” contender for the next spot crypto ETF approval is a Litecoin ETF. This prediction has gained traction in the crypto community. Balchunas does, however, also recognize the uncertainties the forthcoming shift in SEC leadership brings. Though the date of his Senate confirmation is yet unknown, the choice of former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins—considered crypto-friendly—by President-elect Donald Trump has spurred hope even further. We had heard chatter that the Litecoin S-1 had gotten comments back from SEC. This looks to confirm that which bodes well for our prediction that Litecoin is most likely to be the next coin approved. All that said, new SEC chair has yet to start and that’s a huge variable. https://t.co/cKFswPwcr0 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 15, 2025 James Seyffart, another Bloomberg ETF expert, said that the change could mean that the SEC has given feedback on the application. NEW: @CanaryFunds just filed an amended S-1 for their Litecoin ETF filing. No guarantees — but this might be indicative of SEC engagement on the filing. Still no 19b-4 filing yet though (A 19b-4 would actually start the potential approval/denial clock) h/t @isabelletanlee pic.twitter.com/wFtNOmbmYx — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 15, 2025 Investor Activity & Market Reaction A Litecoin ETF promises to set off a major market reaction.

Implications For The Crypto Market If approved, a Litecoin ETF would represent a big milestone for the digital currency. Litecoin would then join Bitcoin and Ethereum as the only cryptocurrencies with US-approved spot ETFs, strengthening its market position.

The proposal aims to reduce inflation. SIMD-0228 introduces a market-oriented solution that fluctuates based on the staking participation rate, which is calculated by dividing the amount of staked SOL. Assuming the staking participation rate falls below the recommended target of 50%, new token issuance will increase to reward stakers and validators and secure the network. In reverse, if the participation rate exceeds the target rate, token issuance is restricted, and the inflationary rate is cap-capped to limit the rate at which new tokens are minted. Tokenomics and inflation continue to challenge distributed cryptocurrency networks, sparking ongoing debates about the best incentive models. Solana validators approve proposal to redirect priority fees Mid-last year, Solana validators voted to approve another proposal, SIMD-0096, which removed the 50% burn mechanism for validator priority fees over the network and allowed 100% of the fees to be allocated to block producers. This proposal aimed to improve incentives around how validators receive priority fees, helping with network security. SIMD-0096 was expected to eliminate possible side deals between block producers and transaction submitters, improving incentives within the validator system. The original proposal stated . This ensures that validators are appropriately incentivized to prioritize network security and efficiency, rather than being incentivized to engage in potentially detrimental side deals . SIMD-0096 proposal Critics of the proposal warned that removing the protocol’s 50% fee-burning mechanism to incentivize validators would raise SOL’s inflation rate. This inflation would benefit validators; however, SOL holders who choose not to stake could face the negative effects of inflation eroding their holdings. Though the proposal received a 77% approval rate, SIMD-0096 has not yet been implemented on the Solana mainnet at the time of this writing. 65% of SOL is staked, with Jito’s MEV rewards exceeding $100 million Data from StakingRewards shows that approximately 65% of SOL’s circulating supply is currently staked. Jito — a Solana-based maximal extractable value (MEV) block-building solution — surpassed $100 million in tips in December 2024, offering an additional income stream for validators. The advocates of adjusting Solana’s token emissions argue that validator rewards gained through maximal extractable value are sufficient incentives for validators to secure the network. According to proponents, these MEV-based incentives reduce the necessity of allocating 100% of priority fees to network validators and are considered preferable to the risk of increasing SOL’s inflation rate.

The surge in large transactions of over $100,000 in the past 24 hours signals key moves by Toncoin holders. In addition, Chainlink (LINK) continues attracting positive attention, with forecasts showing it could reach $366.22 by 2031. However, BlockDAG (BDAG) is leading the charge for those seeking the best long-term crypto options. With over $181 million raised, BlockDAG is making significant strides toward its $600 million goal. Its ongoing partnership with Inter Milan, a world-renowned football club, is creating a surge in interest, further propelling its success. As BlockDAG gains global recognition, plans are in motion to list the project on 10 major centralized exchanges. This sets the stage for BlockDAG to challenge the expectations of the crypto market, becoming one of the top choices for investors seeking long-term opportunities. Toncoin Whale Activity Signals Strategic Moves Despite broader market pressure, Toncoin (TON) has shown resilience, driven by an impressive surge in whale activity. On-chain data reveals a 94% increase in large transactions, totaling $8.21 billion in just 24 hours. These high-value transactions suggest that whales either accumulate or redistribute their holdings, potentially positioning themselves for future gains. The rise in whale activity comes amid broader market conditions that have caused liquidations worth $482 million. However, Toncoin continues to stand out as a stable force in the market, with these strategic moves signaling a strong outlook for the future. While Toncoin’s future remains linked to factors like market sentiment and regulatory shifts, its resilience in the face of current conditions makes it a crypto worth watching. Chainlink Price Prediction: Long-Term Outlook Strong Chainlink’s integration with major blockchain platforms like Ethereum, Avalanche, and Arbitrum has reinforced its role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain ecosystems. These partnerships position Chainlink as a key player in improving decentralized applications, solidifying its market position. Price predictions for Chainlink suggest a promising trajectory, with potential highs of $37.83 by 2025, $116.57 by 2028, and up to $366.22 by 2031. Despite short-term market fluctuations, recent whale activity, with large accumulations of LINK, indicates confidence in its long-term value. While Chainlink faces short-term volatility, it remains a crucial asset in the evolving DeFi space. Strategic Moves for BlockDAG: Reaching $600M with Partnerships and Listing While Toncoin and Chainlink generate discussion with their respective forecasts, all attention is now on BlockDAG, which is rapidly emerging as one of the best long-term crypto options. The driving force behind this success is BlockDAG’s robust technology, steady growth, and strategic alliances. BlockDAG’s ongoing partnership with Inter Milan has expanded its global reach, connecting the project with millions of football fans worldwide. This alliance has played a key role in introducing new buyers to BlockDAG, thanks to high-profile events and campaigns bringing global attention to the project. BlockDAG’s presale has reached an impressive $181 million, with over 17.9 billion coins sold. Early participants have seen substantial returns, as the price has surged from $0.001 in the first presale batch to $0.0248 in the current batch 27. Demand is growing, and with the current presale nearing its conclusion, the opportunity to acquire BDAG coins at a low price is quickly closing. As BlockDAG’s presale grows, the project is pushing closer to its $600 million target. Its upcoming debut on 10 centralized exchanges will provide the visibility needed for even greater success. Buyers continue to flock to BlockDAG, recognizing its potential for explosive growth and positioning it as one of the most exciting long-term crypto opportunities on the market today. Build Lasting Wealth with the Best Crypto The cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, with notable movements from Toncoin and Chainlink generating discussion. Toncoin’s whale activity highlights potential accumulation, while Chainlink’s forecast indicates strong growth over the next decade. Despite short-term price volatility, many are turning to BlockDAG for its consistent growth and strong financial potential. The project’s partnership with Inter Milan has significantly increased its rising demand, bringing it closer to the $600 million milestone. BlockDAG’s presale is nearing its end, and as it prepares to list on 10 major centralized exchanges, now is the time to secure BDAG coins. This is a rare opportunity to join a crypto project set to redefine the market. With the right foundation and continued global exposure, BlockDAG is positioning itself as one of the best long-term crypto options.

Toncoin is facing tough market conditions that have people worried about its future. At the same time, Shiba Inu is delighting the crypto crowd with a special event where it gives away its new TREAT coin, aiming to get more people using its services. Meanwhile, the e-commerce platform Web3Bay , with its token 3BAY, has gathered an impressive $730K in its presale, showing strong trust from investors. Such advancements reflect the intense, high-reward potential of the leading cryptocurrencies in the market. Toncoin’s Price Stability: Examining Support and Resistance Levels Toncoin is currently navigating its price around a critical $5.00 support, with its price wavering under a $6.00 resistance level. This limited movement suggests a sideways market trend, with a possible rise to $7.00 if it stays above the $5.00 mark. If Toncoin falls below this critical support, it risks dropping to lower levels at $4.78 or $4.50. With its current price at $5.34, many are watching closely, considering what could happen next in the market—a vital moment for Toncoin’s near-term price movement. Shiba Inu’s Exciting TREAT Token Airdrop Shiba Inu is making headlines with the rollout of its TREAT token airdrop, gaining significant interest from the investment world. This important move, involving key exchanges like KuCoin, Gate.io, and Bitget, aims to boost usage and improve liquidity for Shiba Inu’s soon-to-launch stablecoin. The steps to join in the airdrop—such as setting up an account and verifying identities—are carefully crafted to guarantee a safe and fair distribution, ramping up enthusiasm and participation among investors. This effort marks a critical step in incorporating TREAT into Shiba Inu’s extensive network, solidifying its status as a leading cryptocurrency. What Makes Web3Bay Stand Out & How Early Birds Can Reap 6,430%? Web3Bay is gaining traction by eliminating traditional intermediaries like banks and payment processors, drastically reducing transaction fees and increasing transparency for all participants. This platform is leading a shift in the decentralized online shopping sector by leveraging blockchain technology to challenge established retail models. At the core of Web3Bay’s strategy is its unique token, 3BAY, which is vital to its ecosystem. This token facilitates smooth transactions, offering both purchasing ease and significant governance rights to its holders. These rights include voting on key platform updates, accessing exclusive deals, and earning rewards, which cultivate a robust community feel. Web3Bay is currently conducting a vigorous presale for the 3BAY token, having already raised over $730K. This presale features a tiered pricing structure, starting at $0.003 and potentially rising to $0.1959, designed to benefit early backers significantly. This pricing reflects the platform’s ambitious growth plans and suggests a potential return on investment that could surpass 6430% for initial investors. As blockchain continues to integrate into various sectors, Web3Bay’s strategic placement at the crossroads of blockchain and e-commerce makes it a strong competitor in the market. The success of its ongoing presale indicates solid confidence and enthusiasm for its model, which aims to offer a fairer and more transparent shopping experience. By merging blockchain’s efficiency with essential e-commerce features, Web3Bay is not just participating in the market—it’s actively transforming it. As blockchain technology expands its influence, Web3Bay’s innovative positioning makes it a key player in redefining e-commerce and a top crypto coin right now in the crypto market. Final Thoughts As we move through 2025, the differing fortunes of Toncoin, Shiba Inu, and Web3Bay paint a vivid picture of the crypto field. Toncoin’s struggles with market swings contrast with Shiba Inu’s popular airdrop and Web3Bay’s successful presale. These stories show that innovation and community involvement are crucial to standing out in the crypto space, hinting at the resilience and growth potential of these platforms as they aim to become top crypto coins in the crypto market.

In a new strategy session, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 108,000 followers on the social media platform X that payments altcoin XRP is forming a bull pennant pattern. A bull pennant pattern is a continuation pattern where a period of consolidation is often followed by a breakout. “XRP has one of the most bullish setups in crypto right now after the recent retest of the breakout zone!” Source: Ali Martinez/X He also says XRP may soar to $10, an increase of more than 217% from its current value, as crypto whales are buying massive amounts of the token. “XRP is in the middle of a massive bullish breakout… On-chain data reveals that whales have been heavily accumulating XRP. In the last week alone, they’ve purchased over 1.10 billion XRP. This buying pressure is building momentum. XRP has broken out of a bull pennant, a classic bullish pattern. If the buying pressure continues, it could help propel XRP to $10.” XRP is trading for $3.15 at time of writing, up 18.2% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the analyst says that Ethereum ( ETH ) layer-2 scaling solution Polygon ( MATIC ) is gearing up for a massive move in either direction as it consolidates within a descending triangle. “Polygon is on the verge of a 40% move! All we have to do is wait for a sustained close outside of the $0.47 to $0.41 range to determine the direction of the breakout.” Source: Ali Martinez/X MATIC is trading for $0.48 at time of writing, up 7.1% in the last 24 hours. Next, he suggests Ethena ( ENA ), a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum, may have avoided a severe correction after surging to reclaim a key support level within a trading range with $1.03 as the upper bound and $0.85 as the lower bound. “Ethena appears to have broken out of a parallel channel! Failing to reclaim $0.86 as support could trigger a price correction toward $0.69 or $0.57.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Ethena is trading for $0.94 at time of writing, up 14.1% in the last 24 hours. Lastly, he suggests layer-1 protocol Algorand ( ALGO ) is now in a bullish trend after breaking out of the upper trendline of a symmetrical triangle on the four-hour chart. Symmetrical triangle patterns can either be bullish or bearish – bullish if the price breaks out above the upper trend line and bearish if the price breaks down below the lower trend line. “ALGO is poised for a potential 60% breakout! A decisive close outside the $0.39-$0.32 range will set the direction of the trend.” Source: Ali Martinez/X ALGO is trading for $0.44 at time of writing up 20.3% in the last 24 hours.

Smart Traders Pivot to RCOF to Get a 19,090% Upside",https://timestabloid.com/cardano-and-the-xrp-price-close-to-their-peaks-smart-traders-pivot/,"The XRP price has been a focal point for investors, especially with its recent climb towards what many consider to be its peak performance. However, as both Cardano and XRP hover near their highs, savvy traders are looking beyond these established cryptocurrencies towards RCO Finance (RCOF) , which promises an astounding upside with its presale currently in the spotlight. Cardano and XRP Price Movements Capture Investors’ Attention Market data from CoinGecko shows Cardano (ADA) experiencing a surge. The price has risen by 8.24% in the last 24 hours and is trading at $1. Cardano has shown resilience and growth, particularly with developments like the upcoming Plomin hard fork, which aims to enhance network performance. On the other hand, XRP has also seen a significant uptick, rising 7.68% to trade at $2.52. However, despite these gains, investors have a sense of caution due to potential bearish momentum for XRP, with critical support levels near $2.00 being closely watched. Also, while on an upward trajectory, Cardano has faced an 8.98% weekly decline, suggesting that while both cryptocurrencies are close to their recent peaks, the market’s volatility could lead to rapid changes. These developments have led some to question the sustainability of these highs, pushing investors to explore alternative opportunities. Investors Turn to RCO Finance for Post-Presale Returns With Cardano and XRP showing signs of peaking or stabilizing, investors are turning their attention to RCO Finance’s presale . Currently, in its fourth presale stage, the RCOF token has already seen a dramatic increase of 509% from its initial price to $0.0777. Once the presale comes to an end, the token is expected to get listed at between $0.4 and $0.6 offering even those who invest now a chance for lucrative returns. However, the real excitement lies in the forecast that once the RCO Finance platform officially rolls out, the token could soar by up to 19,090%. This prediction is based on the platform’s unique features and the anticipated demand for its innovative financial tools and the growth potential of AI-driven financial ecosystems. RCO Finance Set to Revolutionize the DeFi Investment Landscape RCO Finance is poised to disrupt the traditional investment paradigm with its array of advanced features. At the heart of its offerings is an AI-powered Robo Advisor , which provides personalized investment strategies based on real-time market data, individual risk tolerance, and financial goals. The Robo Advisor aims democratize access to sophisticated investment strategies, making them available without the need for deep financial knowledge or intermediary involvement. Additionally, RCO Finance will offer access to over 120,000 assets across 12,500 asset classes, including tokenized real-world assets like real estate and commodities, thus broadening the investment horizon for users. The platform will also operate in a KYC-free ecosystem, emphasizing user privacy and reducing entry barriers, which is particularly appealing in today’s data-conscious environment. Security is also paramount; RCO Finance’s smart contracts have been audited by SolidProof , a reputable blockchain security firm, ensuring a robust and trustworthy trading environment. Furthermore, the tokenomics of the platform’s native token, RCOF, are structured to encourage long-term holding through staking rewards and governance rights, while also employing a deflationary model where unsold tokens are burned, potentially increasing the token’s value over time. This combination of features not only aims to revolutionize DeFi but also offers a compelling case for why investors might choose RCOF over more traditional cryptocurrency investments as they anticipate the next big wave in digital finance.

The Trust is structured to reflect the market price of XRP, minus fees and expenses, without requiring investors to directly purchase or manage the cryptocurrency. XRP itself is used primarily for cross-border payments and is supported by the Ripple Network, a decentralized blockchain system facilitating fast and efficient transactions.

The network allows users to exchange tokens of value, called XRP, with speed and minimal friction. Launched on Sept. 5, 2024, the Grayscale XRP Trust is benchmarked against the CoinDesk Ripple Price Index (XRX). With a performance fee of 0.00% and a management fee of 2.50%, the Trust offers a cost-effective solution for accredited investors seeking exposure to XRP. The reopening of the Grayscale’s XRP Trust coincides with major developments in Ripple Labs’ legal proceedings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In December 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple, alleging that the company raised over $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP. In July 2023, a federal judge ruled that XRP is not a security when sold to the general public on digital-asset exchanges, though sales to institutional investors were considered unregistered securities transactions. This partial legal victory has bolstered confidence in XRP’s regulatory standing. Grayscale has recently expanded its range of digital asset products. On Dec. 12, 2024, the company launched the Lido DAO ( LDO ) Trust and Optimism ( OP ) Trust, providing exposure to governance tokens linked to Ethereum staking and scaling solutions. These launches followed earlier additions, including the Grayscale Sui Trust in August, the XRP Trust in September, and the Aave Trust in October, reflecting Grayscale’s commitment to diversifying its investment products. As of Jan. 17, 2025, XRP is trading at $3.27, with a 24-hour trading volume of $25.77 billion. The circulating supply stands at approximately 57.56 billion XRP tokens, resulting in a market capitalization of around $188.23 billion. Over the past 24 hours, XRP has experienced a price increase of 7.01%.

Leading the charge is Texas, with Senator Charles Schwertner announcing a bill to launch its first state-level Bitcoin reserve. In a Twitter/X post, Senator Schwertner announced the filing of SB 778, making Texas the first state to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve. According to the Texan legislator, creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve will position the state as a blockchain leader , drive economic growth, and secure everyone’s economic freedom. Texas Wants To Lead The Bitcoin Revolution Texas is the 10th largest economy globally and has over $194 billion in general revenue that will fund the state’s operations from 2026 to 2027. In addition to its huge budget, the state has a growing Bitcoin and blockchain economy. It’s also home to several crypto mines, including the one in the city of Rockdale, which is acknowledged as the biggest Bitcoin mining operation in North America. It’s time for Texas to lead the way in establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. That’s why I filed SB 778, which, if passed and signed into law, would make Texas the first state in the nation to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This would position our state at the… pic.twitter.com/dRdCt86Otr — Charles Schwertner (@DrSchwertner) January 15, 2025 According to Schwertner, it’s about time that Texas led the way in approving and launching a crypto reserve. In addition to the proposal to start a reserve fund, SB 778 also outlines a recommendation to set up the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Advisory Committee. This committee shall include the House chairs for Appropriations and Finance, a comptroller, a member of the Senate and the House, among others. Texas’ Crypto Reserve And Its Primary Purpose Although the general aim of establishing the state’s crypto reserve is to leverage the blockchain and use it as a hedge against inflation, SB 778 also outlines its specific purposes. According to Section 403.703, the state aims to hold BTC as a financial asset. The document also specifies that persons, including Texans, can donate Bitcoin to advance shared ownership and a sense of community. The document also highlights specific transactions that will not be allowed. For example, Section 403.705 indicates that the comptroller cannot approve transactions to buy BTC to be held in other countries. Other US States Are Actively Pursuing Individual Reserves Although some questions and risks are associated with creating a reserve, many states are pushing forward. Aside from Texas, Oklahoma has shared its plans to hold the premiere digital currency as part of its currency reserves. Representative Cody Maynard filed HB 1203, the Strategic Reserve Act, which aims to allocate a portion of the state’s pension funds to buy these digital assets. Pennsylvania lawmakers also submitted their plans to invest in Bitcoin. The state’s policymakers suggest that the state’s Treasury allocate up to 10% of the funds to buy crypto. Representative Mike Cabell says the state can follow the lead of private financial firms like Fidelity and BlackRock.

Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) could become the next viral memecoin. Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) by entering its contract address – GmW5qPRZ4TfoTw6U1KL9Btxn1uqXJJhieMAfeJk4wkbg – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPAI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-17 01:50:00

This rebound has not only boosted TON’s market capitalization by some millions but also brought investors to ponder on Toncoin’s potential for a sustained rally. Particularly, as the TON market stabilizes so far, questions about investor sentiment and market risk are coming to the forefront. Related Reading: Toncoin Could See A 65% Surge In The Next 43 Days—Here’s Why Is Now The Time To Buy TON A CryptoQuant Quicktake Platform contributor Darkfost recently analyzed Toncoin’s market behavior, focusing on the annualized realized volatility over a one-week period. This metric as shared by the analyst has dropped below the 0.25 threshold, offering insights into the prevailing investor sentiment and perceived market risk. While low volatility is often associated with reduced risk, it may also indicate waning market interest or growing investor caution. Notably, the decline in realized volatility is a significant development, as periods of low volatility have historically been followed by market reversals. Darkfost emphasized that reduced volatility often signals diminished investor interest, which can present both opportunities and challenges for traders. On the one hand, such periods may highlight reduced market risks, offering potential entry points for long-term investors. On the other hand, they require careful analysis, as low volatility alone cannot guarantee future price movements. Darkfost suggested that monitoring these low-volatility periods closely, alongside other indicators, is essential for making informed decisions. Additional evaluation of broader trends and corroborating signals is necessary to identify whether these zones represent genuine buying opportunities. Toncoin Market Performance And Outlook In recent weeks, TON’s price has shown little movement in either a bullish or bearish direction. Despite the broader crypto market experiencing a recent downturn, TON has managed to hold steady above the $5 mark, avoiding any significant drops below this level.

While Shiba Inu, often dubbed the “Dogecoin killer,” has turned heads for its volatility, a new contender is emerging on the horizon. RCO Finance (RCOF) , an AI altcoin that is generating buzz with ambitious targets, aiming to soar from its current price of $0.07 to an astonishing $1. The convergence of the Shiba Inu price fluctuating fortunes and the meteoric rise of RCOF is stirring up a sense of FOMO among investors eager to capitalize on the next big opportunity. Shiba Inu Price Resilience Amid Market Volatility The Shiba Inu price recently demonstrated impressive resilience by reclaiming its position above the critical 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.00002082. This recovery has brought a sigh of relief to investors, signaling renewed buying interest and a potential stabilization in the near term. The 200 EMA often serves as a key dividing line between bullish and bearish trends; the Shiba Inu price ability to stay above this level showcases underlying strength in its price action. Currently trading at $0.00002169, the Shiba Inu price faces notable resistance at the 26 EMA and 50 EMA, set at $0.00002242 and $0.00002271, respectively. Breaking these levels is essential for SHIB to regain bullish momentum. While the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 45 indicates a neutral stance, the token’s trajectory will depend on breaking resistance levels and external factors like market sentiment and ecosystem developments. The Shiba Inu price performance reflects a cautious optimism among investors. The Rise of AI Altcoin Market Positions RCO Finance (RCOF) for DeFi Dominance The ongoing surge in the Shiba Inu price action has significantly triggered a buying spree on the RCO FInance (RCOF) AI altcoin .

Cryptocurrencies like Tron and Ondo are turning heads with their unique market moves and promising setups. Tron’s bullish pattern and Ondo’s upcoming token unlock have captured the attention of seasoned traders and newbies alike. But one name is making an entrance that’s impossible to ignore: Qubetics. This newcomer is not just another token; it’s a movement. With its presale generating massive interest, Qubetics is paving the way for blockchain’s next evolution. Tron recently saw a price dip but remains primed for a rebound thanks to a nearly complete inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. Meanwhile, Ondo, despite being one of the worst performers last month, is showing signs of life as whales quietly accumulate ahead of a major token unlock. These projects bring unique strengths to the table, but the buzz around Qubetics is hard to beat. With real-world applications like its Decentralized VPN feature, it’s solving problems many didn’t even realize existed. Qubetics isn’t just about hype; it’s about utility. It’s here to tackle the issues that traditional blockchain platforms couldn’t. From revolutionizing online security to enhancing global connectivity, this project is set to launch in Q2 2025, and it’s already raising eyebrows for all the right reasons. Let’s explore why these three cryptocurrencies are the best coins to join for 2025. Qubetics ($TICS): The New Standard for Blockchain Utility Qubetics is causing a stir, and if you’ve been keeping tabs on its presale, you know why. With more than 420 million tokens sold and over $9.6 million raised so far, it’s clear that investors are paying attention. At just $0.0501 per token, $TICS offers an opportunity to get in early on a project that’s built to last. One of Qubetics’ standout features is its Decentralized VPN (DVPN) . Think of it as a VPN, but without the pitfalls of centralization. Imagine you’re a digital nomad in Bali, working on sensitive projects for global clients. Traditional VPNs can fail you, exposing your data to cyber threats or even government surveillance. Qubetics’ DVPN eliminates these risks by decentralizing the network, ensuring your data remains private and secure. For small businesses in Sydney, the DVPN offers unparalleled security for handling client data. Picture a startup sharing sensitive documents between offices in different cities. With Qubetics, they can encrypt their communications without relying on centralized servers that could be hacked or monitored. Even individuals benefit. Think about a gamer in Tokyo wanting to access global servers without lag or throttling. The DVPN ensures a seamless and secure experience. Qubetics isn’t just solving technical issues; it’s redefining how we think about online privacy and connectivity. With its Q2 2025 launch on the horizon, anticipation is building. Analysts predict massive ROI potential, and its real-world applications make it one of the best coins to join for 2025 . Tron: Ready for a Bullish Comeback Tron has had its share of ups and downs, but it’s never one to stay out of the spotlight for long. Recently, the cryptocurrency dipped below $0.23, leaving some investors wary. But those who’ve studied the charts see a different story. Crypto analyst Evan Luthra highlighted that Tron’s inverse head-and-shoulders pattern is nearing completion. If this pattern plays out, Tron could surge to $0.277 in Q1 2025, marking a significant comeback. Data doesn’t lie. Tron is trading above its 100-day EMA at $0.22, and its momentum indicator suggests a buying opportunity. For traders in regions like Malaysia or New Zealand, these are the kinds of signals that trigger action. Imagine a tech entrepreneur in Auckland looking to diversify their crypto portfolio. Tron’s strong technical setup makes it an enticing choice. Tron’s appeal isn’t just technical. Its blockchain offers low transaction fees and high scalability, making it a favorite for developers. Picture a gaming startup in Singapore using Tron’s platform to launch a play-to-earn model. The low costs and fast speeds make it a no-brainer. What keeps Tron on the list of the best coins to join for 2025 is its resilience. Market fluctuations are inevitable, but Tron’s ability to bounce back and its strong fundamentals make it a solid pick for anyone looking to ride the next wave of crypto innovation. Ondo: A Sleeper Hit Poised for Action Ondo hasn’t had the easiest run lately. With its price dropping 40% over the past month, it’s been a tough pill to swallow for investors. But here’s the kicker: the upcoming token unlock on January 18 could change everything. Over 1.94 billion tokens, valued at $2.42 billion, are set to hit the market. Events like these often bring volatility, but they also present opportunities. Whales have been quietly accumulating ONDO ahead of the unlock, and on-chain data shows significant buying activity. A trader in Jakarta might look at these signals and see a chance to get in while prices are still low. If the falling wedge pattern on the 4-hour chart holds, ONDO could rebound to $1.76, offering a potential double-digit surge. Ondo’s technicals are equally intriguing. The RSI is in oversold territory, signaling that a bullish reversal could be on the horizon. For a crypto enthusiast in Manila, this might be the perfect setup for a short-term play with long-term potential. What sets Ondo apart is its ability to adapt. Despite recent setbacks, the project has strong fundamentals and a committed community. This combination makes it one of the best coins to join for 2025, especially for investors who know how to spot a comeback story. How Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN Works and Why It Matters The Decentralized VPN feature isn’t just a gimmick; it’s a revolution in online security. Traditional VPNs rely on centralized servers, which are vulnerable to hacking, surveillance, and throttling. Qubetics flips the script by using blockchain technology to decentralize the network. This means no single point of failure and complete anonymity for users. Here’s how it works. Imagine you’re a freelancer in Kuala Lumpur working with international clients. You need to access sensitive documents securely. Qubetics’ DVPN encrypts your data and routes it through a decentralized network of nodes, ensuring your information stays private. For businesses, the benefits are even greater. A company in Brisbane managing a global supply chain can use the DVPN to secure communications and protect trade secrets. Even gamers in Seoul can enjoy lag-free, secure access to servers worldwide. Why does this matter? Because online security is no longer a luxury; it’s a necessity. As the world becomes more connected, the need for secure, reliable solutions will only grow. Qubetics is leading the charge, making its DVPN feature a cornerstone of blockchain’s future. Conclusion If you’re looking for the best coins to join for 2025 , Qubetics, Tron, and Ondo should be at the top of your list. Each brings something unique to the table. Qubetics is revolutionizing online security with its Decentralized VPN. Tron’s bullish setup and robust blockchain make it a strong contender, while Ondo’s upcoming token unlock presents a golden opportunity for savvy investors. The crypto world moves fast, and these projects are shaping the future. Don’t wait too long to make your move. Join the action, explore these opportunities, and be part of the next big wave in blockchain innovation.

Takahiro Anno’s vision for “Digital Democracy 2030” is not favored by everyone, however, and falls in line with previous disturbing ideas put forth by the J-gov about leaning into AI rulership. 2024 Tokyo gubernatorial hopeful and self-proclaimed Sci-Fi writer Takahiro Anno thinks AI could help clean up governance in Japan. According to local media , the software engineer (who came in fifth in the 2024 Tokyo election) has announced he will create an open-source tool for aggregating public opinion, managing funds, and shaping policy. Anno’s controversial vision of ‘Digital Democracy 2030’ Anno explained on January 16 during a speech in Shinjuku Ward, Tokyo, that his vision for “ Digital Democracy 2030 ” sees artificial intelligence taking a central role in shaping politics, with Nikkei reporting that the tool aims to “manage political funds” and “aggregate public opinion.” Further, it will connect its findings to policy creation. Source: X On the surface this may seem like a one-off, pie-in-the-sky idea from another random software engineer and science-fiction geek, but Anno actually has big state ties as a current advisor to GovTech Tokyo, an organization dedicated to digital transformation (DX) which is 100% bankrolled by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Further, back in November of last year, Japan’s Digital Administrative and Financial Reform Council released a document describing how artificial intelligence, drones, and robots can be used in the implementation of a new kind of surveillance state to better govern the nation — ideas right in line with Anno’s proclamations. Japanese reactions mixed, residents still struggling with immediate fiscal hardships Social media responses to the Nikkei article on Anno were mixed, as residents of Japan seem to think there are much more important matters to attend to. One user even questioned (translated by Google): “Is there any point in using AI as an intermediary? Another public money business?” Still, other commenters said the idea was “amazing” and expressed interest in getting the AI tool in place. As Cryptopolitan has previously reported , Japan’s current economic struggles are increasing for everyday individuals, with a flagging JPY, skyrocketing food prices, and a growing elderly population that cannot afford to retire on the state’s poverty-line pensions. As such, it’s really no wonder people are skeptical of a well-funded, 34-year-old Sci-Fi writer’s ideas for how their money should be spent.
