Citing an article published by Axios on Wednesday, the report detailed Trump's comments during a meeting with representatives of an unnamed company. Trump allegedly said, “You made this much money last year and you're going to make a lot more now because of me… But where were you when I needed you? You weren't with me and maybe you were with Kamala Harris.” Two sources told Unchained that the company Trump was referring to was Ripple. While the Axios report did not mention Ripple by name or specify when the alleged conversation took place, it noted that Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen had previously donated millions of dollars to political action committees (PACs) supporting Harris. Related News: What's the Latest on the XRP Big Bull? Why Has XRP Price Increased? Ripple Labs has not released a statement in response to the allegations, and a spokesperson for the company declined to comment on whether Ripple is indeed the firm not mentioned in the Axios report. Similarly, Trump’s transition team did not respond to questions on the matter. This development highlights Trump’s continued scrutiny of companies and individuals he believes do not support him politically. Whether this will impact Ripple’s position in the crypto space or the ongoing regulatory battles remains to be seen. *This is not investment advice.

Toncoin whale activity has significantly increased, with transactions above $100,000 growing steadily in the last 24 hours. In parallel, Chainlink (LINK) continues to turn heads with a promising forecast, potentially reaching up to $366.22 by 2031. For those seeking the best long-term crypto, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out. The project is on a strong path toward reaching its $600 million goal, driven by its exciting partnership with Inter Milan, one of the most recognized football clubs in the world. The popularity of BlockDAG is growing rapidly, and the platform is getting ready to launch on 10 major centralized exchanges. These moves position BlockDAG as one of the most exciting prospects in the crypto space today. Toncoin Whale Activity Signals Strategic Moves While many cryptocurrencies face pressure from the market, Toncoin (TON) has displayed remarkable strength. A significant increase in whale activity partly drives this resilience. Over the past 24 hours, Toncoin’s whale transactions have surged by 94%, totalling an impressive $8.21 billion. These high-value transactions, often exceeding $100,000, indicate that TON whales might be accumulating or redistributing their holdings, possibly preparing for future gains. Despite the market’s fluctuations, Toncoin remains sensitive to larger economic factors such as investor sentiment and regulatory shifts, which could influence its future growth. Chainlink Price Prediction Points to Long-Term Potential Chainlink’s potential remains strong as decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology continue to grow. The platform’s integrations with major networks like Ethereum, Avalanche, and Arbitrum only add to its utility and relevance in the market. Chainlink’s price prediction shows a promising future, with the coin potentially reaching $37.83 by 2025, $116.57 by 2028, and up to $366.22 by 2031. While the current market is experiencing some volatility, recent whale activity points to a continued belief in Chainlink’s long-term growth. Still, short-term fluctuations and broader market pressures require careful attention. BlockDAG’s Road to $600M: Big Listings & Power Partnerships Ahead! Toncoin and Chainlink are drawing attention for their potential, but BlockDAG is swiftly becoming a top contender for those seeking a long-term crypto asset. So, what’s driving this momentum? BlockDAG combines cutting-edge technology with consistent growth and strategic partnerships, with one of the most notable being its collaboration with Inter Milan. This partnership has significantly raised BlockDAG’s global profile, introducing the project to millions of new potential buyers through high-profile events and social media campaigns. The influence of Inter Milan has not only enhanced BlockDAG’s visibility but also directly contributed to the success of its presale. To date, BlockDAG has raised over $181 million, with more than 17.9 billion BDAG coins sold. The current price for BDAG has surged to $0.0248, a dramatic increase from its initial offering of $0.001. Additionally, the presale has raised $6.2 million through miner sales, with over 15,400 miners now part of the community. With this strong momentum, BlockDAG is well on its way to meeting its $600 million presale target. This exciting trajectory will continue, especially with the planned launch of 10 major centralized exchanges. For anyone looking to get involved in a promising crypto project, now is an excellent time to jump in, as prices are expected to rise rapidly with growing demand. Achieve Financial Success with Top Long-Term Crypto With all the activity in the market, it’s clear that now is a critical time for crypto enthusiasts. Toncoin’s whale activity hints at a strong future, while Chainlink’s price forecast indicates long-term value. Yet, the real story may be BlockDAG. Thanks to its solid growth and partnership with Inter Milan, BlockDAG is becoming one of the most attractive options for long-term crypto buyers. As it nears its $600 million target, the opportunity to secure BDAG coins at today’s prices is closing quickly.

This success reflects substantial interest and has given participants a return potential of over 2380% since the first batch. BlockDAG’s collaboration with HackerEarth is part of a larger plan. This partnership aims to position BlockDAG as a central platform for developers, creators, and blockchain fans by conducting global hackathons that develop real-world uses and ensure lasting growth. Global Hackathons: A Key Move for BlockDAG These upcoming hackathons are crucial to BlockDAG’s plan to build a strong and active ecosystem. Through its partnership with HackerEarth, BlockDAG will organize four major global hackathons involving 10,000 to 15,000 developers. The focus is on attracting skilled teams to create decentralized applications on the network, targeting sectors such as DeFi, governance, and infrastructure.

This approach helps maintain a continuous flow of new ideas, providing developers the resources and motivation to implement their projects on BlockDAG’s scalable, decentralized platform. For those involved in the presale, these hackathons represent a commitment to building a robust ecosystem, not merely selling coins. Why Developer Engagement is Crucial for BlockDAG BlockDAG recognizes the importance of a dynamic developer community for the adoption of blockchain technology. The hackathons aim to draw developers by offering them the necessary resources to excel. With HackerEarth’s platform, which boasts a 7.6 million-strong community, BlockDAG connects with top-tier talent. For developers, these hackathons are more than just coding events; they are gateways to becoming integral parts of a blockchain network with significant real-world impact. For presale participants, the hackathons provide reassurance that BlockDAG values creation over mere speculation. The applications and projects developed are expected to increase the practical utility of BDAG coins, benefiting early backers. Record-Breaking Presale: Jump in Before it Ends! The BlockDAG presale offers a unique chance for individuals to be part of a project with a proactive future vision. Coins are reasonably priced at $0.0248 during the ongoing 27th batch, with significant growth potential. By the time results from the hackathons materialize early backers could see their stakes appreciate as BDAG coin demand rises. With over $181 million raised and presale incentives like the LAUNCH300, which provides a 300% bonus on purchases, the timing is ideal. Participants get to solidify their roles not just as observers but as active contributors to the ecosystem’s development. Looking Forward BlockDAG’s strategy to merge a successful presale with developer-centered innovations is unique in the blockchain sphere. The project does more than just offer coins—it builds a community where developers and early backers can prosper together. The presale is an entry point for enthusiasts, and the hackathons are set to deliver applications that will boost the network’s worth.

After dropping to a low of $168, SOL surged over 22% to reach $207, signaling renewed strength and bullish momentum. This impressive recovery has reignited optimism among investors and analysts alike, many of whom now anticipate a swift recovery and a potential bullish rally. Related Reading: Cardano Whales Go On A Shopping Spree – 100 Million ADA in 48 Hours Top analyst Jelle has shared a compelling technical analysis, highlighting that the “Solana season” may be on the verge of a major comeback. According to Jelle, Solana’s recent price movements indicate a significant shift in market structure. The downtrend appears to have flipped, with key resistance levels now acting as support. This critical development could pave the way for further upside in the coming days. As Solana continues to lead the charge among altcoins, its ability to maintain and build upon this momentum will be closely watched. With analysts predicting a strong recovery and investors eyeing new opportunities, all eyes are on SOL to see if it can sustain this bullish trajectory and reclaim its status as a top-performing asset in the market. Bullish Breakout And Sentiment Shifts Solana has shown remarkable strength in recent days, pushing above critical supply levels after enduring weeks of selling pressure. While the broader market remains volatile, Solana has managed to inspire confidence among investors and analysts, thanks to its steady climb. However, the asset still faces a significant challenge: reclaiming the local high around $220. Achieving this milestone could set the stage for a bullish rally into uncharted price territory. Top analyst Jelle recently shared an optimistic technical analysis on X, emphasizing the dramatic shift in Solana’s market structure. According to Jelle, the downtrend that defined Solana’s recent performance has officially flipped, with key resistance levels now acting as solid support. This critical development is a bullish signal for Solana’s prospects, reinforcing the idea that the asset is nearing the end of its consolidation phase. Jelle highlighted that one final hurdle remains before Solana can enter price discovery: breaking decisively above the $220 mark. If bulls can overcome this obstacle, the potential for a massive rally becomes highly likely. The sentiment surrounding Solana is increasingly positive, with many investors echoing Jelle’s sentiment that “Solana season” is on the horizon.

With bullish momentum picking up, Solana is positioned to challenge higher resistance levels in the coming days. The immediate target for bulls is reclaiming the $222 mark, a significant level that could determine the trajectory of Solana’s next move. Successfully breaking above this price and converting it into support would confirm the continuation of the bullish trend. This would also set the stage for Solana to target its all-time high (ATH), a psychological milestone for both traders and long-term investors. Related Reading: Chainlink Weekly Chart Looks Promising – If Bulls Reclaim $30 ‘ATH Are Next’ Analysts suggest that once Solana crosses the $222 level, the surge to ATH could happen rapidly. Market sentiment remains optimistic, with many participants expecting Solana to lead a new wave of upward momentum in the altcoin space. If the price continues to hold key support levels and bulls maintain control, Solana is poised to regain its status as one of the market’s top-performing assets. For now, all eyes are on $222 as the next critical step in Solana’s bullish journey.

Musk Saves California (MUSKCALI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKCALI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Saves California can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Saves California could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Saves California launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Saves California on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Saves California by entering its contract address – 2mtzeaYqDPLtCemX5jNPuuq8jw65cbgNUXuT3fBra2M2 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCALI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-16 23:03:00

The price of XRP surged to $3.20 on Jan. 15, marking a seven-year high, before retreating slightly to $3.09 as of 8:45 a.m. UTC on Jan. 16. CoinMarketCap data shows XRP gained over 32% in the past week. This rally occurred despite the SEC’s appeal filed on Jan. 15. The agency seeks to overturn a July 2023 decision by District Judge Analisa Torres, which ruled that XRP sales to retail investors were not unregistered securities. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, noted that XRP’s price momentum is largely due to Ripple Labs’ partial legal victories and growing investor optimism about regulatory clarity. “XRP’s surge can be attributed to favorable outcomes in Ripple’s SEC lawsuit and a more crypto-friendly political climate in the US. If regulatory uncertainties are resolved, the influx of institutional investors could further solidify XRP’s position in the crypto market,” Lee told Cointelegraph . RippleNet’s expanding adoption has also strengthened XRP’s appeal in the market, Lee added. Investor confidence is rising ahead of US President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20. His administration is expected to provide greater regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies and consider the Bitcoin Act, aimed at establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the US economy. Looking ahead, an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) could serve as a major price catalyst in 2025. JPMorgan estimates that an approved XRP ETF could attract $3 billion to $6 billion in net new investments, similar to Ether ETFs. Some analysts predict XRP could surpass $14, supported by technical indicators like a bullish pennant formation.

But while this could see BTC prices swell to $120,000, a “correction” could also see Bitcoin dip back to the $80,000 mark.

Dudchenko said there was “still a possibility that the price of Bitcoin will rise again” in the near future.

The only question is this: Will the wave be sparked by a deeper correction in BTC/USD, or will it begin in the very near future?” Nikolai Dudchenko, analyst at Russian financial/media group Finam Cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX has been fined $100 million for violating the federal Bank Secrecy Act by failing to adequately police money laundering, the DOJ said https://t.co/9hUmB2w2TD pic.twitter.com/nwZpcLD9gD — Reuters Legal (@ReutersLegal) January 15, 2025 The Trump Factor Dudchenko added that if a “correction” does take place, this could see the price of Bitcoin drop to $80,000. But should the price instead rise again in the short term, the expert said that the “nearest target for possible growth” was the $120,000 mark. Dudchenko suggested that a range of factors could affect Bitcoin prices’ imminent “sharp” growth or fall.

Dudchenko said that Bitcoin is currently “consolidating in the range of $90,000 to $100,000.” However, he warned that “volatility” was likely during Trump’s inauguration period, with the market braced for developments. Source: Dune/@21co Dudchenko said that market watchers would be wise to recall that “the reason for the fall in the price of Bitcoin at the end of December 2024” was a speech from the head of the US Federal Reserve System Jerome Powell. Powell argued against the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve. However, on January 16, the New York Post said that Trump was “receptive” to the idea of building strategic reserves.

XRP surged to $3.33 on Thursday after a New York Post report that President-elect Donald Trump is receptive to the idea of a US-based crypto reserve, comprising assets like XRP and Solana. 🇺🇸 BREAKING: Trump considers US-based crypto reserve, potentially prioritizing coins like Solana and $XRP . pic.twitter.com/Lwix7XGrHx — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) January 16, 2025 This comes on the heels of other reports stating that Donald Trump’s SEC could pause all crypto enforcement actions, essentially confirming that the agency could drop or settle its lawsuit against XRP’s parent company, Ripple. Is It Too Late To Buy XRP? XRP is undoubtedly the strongest large-cap cryptocurrency on the market. It is not without any reason the XRP/BTC ratio is up by 33% over the past week and 42% over the past month, despite the Bitcoin price trading at $100,000. With Donald Trump set to take oath on January 20th, experts are wondering whether there could be any mention of Ripple or a US crypto reserve in his inaugural speech. It is dubious whether the US Congress will approve a crypto reserve including volatile altcoins like Solana and XRP. Experts aren’t even convinced about the possibility of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, with Polymarket betters giving it only a 48% chance. This level of support from an incoming President could position XRP as a top choice for institutional investors. Moreover, the incoming SEC — led by pro-crypto Paul Atkins — has already benefitted Ripple. The XRP price breached the crucial $2.90 resistance level after reports that the agency could pause all crypto enforcement actions, hinting that the Ripple-SEC lawsuit is all but over. Basically, $XRP no longer a security! https://t.co/aZDtQdR8hp — Ali (@ali_charts) January 15, 2025 The new Commission could also approve a spot XRP ETF, which JPMorgan analysts believe could add up to $8 billion to XRP’s market cap in the first year alone. However, a few bulls have started to take profits, suggesting that it may now be too late to buy XRP. For instance, prominent trader Crypto Tony reveals he secured some profits at $3.1, even as he expects the token to rally to $3.84. $XRP / $USD - Update Played out perfect. I have shed some profit here. pic.twitter.com/JuUWqRPLul — Crypto Tony (@CryptoTony__) January 16, 2025 Another prominent analyst Crypto Prime reveals that he will close his current long position at $3.40. It would now be prudent for sidelined investors to wait for an XRP dip before scaling into long positions. Nevertheless, it does remain an excellent long-term investment, with many now expecting it to peak at $10 in 2025. Are AI Agent Coins The Best Crypto To Buy Now? While XRP’s current bull rally may be reaching a point of exhaustion, AI agent coins don’t appear to be running out of steam any time soon. VIRTUAL, AI16Z and AIXBT continue to extend their gains, while a new AI agent crypto Moby reached a $100 million market cap in 3 days. Another new AI meme coin — Mind of Pepe (MIND) — has raised over $1.5 million on day one of its ICO, signalling high upside potential. Mind of Pepe is a self-evolving, self-sovereign AI agent, with self-managed X and Telegram accounts as well as a crypto wallet. $MIND holders will soon receive real-time market intelligence, alpha trading strategies and sentiment and technical analysis, thanks to cutting-edge AI tech and community intelligence. They may even receive discounted access to new crypto coins that Mind of Pepe launches. MIND also has its own staking pool, a feature missing in many AI meme coins. Early buyers are already generating significant passive income, currently at an APY of over 1000%. Considering the strong latent demand for new AI meme coins, it is no surprise that experts are calling Mind of Pepe the next 10x crypto.

Is Now the Right Time to Invest in XRP? XRP stands out as the most robust among large-cap cryptocurrencies. It's no surprise that the XRP/BTC ratio has increased by 33% this past week and 42% over the last month, even as Bitcoin's price sits at $100,000. As Donald Trump prepares to be sworn in on January 20th, analysts are speculating whether Ripple or a US crypto reserve might be mentioned in his inaugural address. It's uncertain if the US Congress would endorse a crypto reserve that includes volatile altcoins like Solana and XRP. Many experts remain skeptical about a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, with bets from Polymarket giving it just a 48% likelihood. Such support from a new President could make XRP an attractive option for institutional investors. Additionally, the incoming SEC, led by crypto-friendly Paul Atkins, has already positively impacted Ripple.

This activity is a precursor to potential price increases, as whales tend to accumulate assets when they expect upward momentum. Whales Accumulate 200M DOGE as Dogecoin Price Targets $3 According to analyst Ali Martinez, whales have added 200 million DOGE to their holdings within 48 hours, signaling strong bullish sentiment. Whale accumulation often reflects confidence in the asset’s potential, particularly in anticipation of market movements. This activity has fueled optimism for Dogecoin potential to break past key resistance levels. Source: X Dogecoin price currently holds above the critical $0.36 resistance, indicating a possible upward trajectory. If the bullish trend continues, analysts suggest the price may rise to $0.40 or higher, backed by growing market interest and whale activity. Similarly, a recent DOGE price prediction suggested the possibility of a rally to $3 as early as January, citing Fibonacci retracement patterns and historical trends. With Dogecoin currently trading around $0.37, this projection suggests an 8x rally fueled by growing market momentum. Analysts highlight the January 20 inauguration and meme coin activity as potential catalysts for a breakout. Key Resistance Levels and Path to $3 Dogecoin price must overcome immediate resistance at $0.4007 to sustain its bullish momentum. Analysts believe breaking this level could open the path to $0.45, with potential gains beyond this mark driven by leveraged long positions. However, failure to hold above $0.35 may lead to profit-taking or the liquidation of leveraged positions. Historical patterns also support the bullish outlook. The current 46% correction in Dogecoin price mirrors its January 2021 setup, which preceded a significant bull run. If the pattern repeats, Dogecoin may be gearing up for a similar breakout, with a rally targeting $3. Source: X Bullish Sentiment Fueled by Broader Market Recovery The broader crypto market recovery has further strengthened bullish sentiment for Dogecoin. Rising daily trading volumes, which have increased by 18% to surpass $4 billion, suggest growing retail and institutional interest. Other market analysts have also supported the bullish outlook for Dogecoin , highlighting the double bottom pattern as a key reversal signal. Technical indicators like Chaikin Money Flow and RSI suggest further upward potential, provided DOGE holds critical support levels. At press time, Dogecoin is trading at $0.3769, reflecting a 17% gain over the past week. The market cap stands at $55.64 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $4.19 billion, up by 7%.

At the meeting, the ETH developers finalized the timeline for the upgrade launch following months of active deliberations. A Galaxy Research executive, Christine Kim, shared the call summary with the community. Ethereum Pectra Upgrade: When Launch? The developers agreed to launch the upgrade early to mid-March. They also agreed on a new set of schedules, including January 20 or 30 for the next ACDE calls. At this meeting, the block number for the upgrade and the exact date and time will be agreed upon. The developers must decide on the new client releases for the Pectra upgrade by February 3. The Sepolia Fork will occur on February 12, and Holesky will follow seven days later. As noted, the mainnet fork will come by early to mid-March. However, this depends on whether nothing derails the plan. the proposed schedule is: jan 23 or jan 30, on next few acd calls finalize block number, exact date/time, for upgrades feb 3, publish new client releases for the upgrade by this date ~feb 12, sepolia fork ~feb 19, holesky fork early to mid march, mainnet fork — Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) January 16, 2025 As Christine Kim highlighted, Ethereum developers are not planning to launch another devnet for the upgrade. This is why they are improvising with a shadow fork of Sepolia and/or Holesky testnets. Recall the developers launched the Mekong testnet last year for the pectra upgrade. Overall, she said bugs in code might shift the timeline considerably. However, she noted that the odds of a March launch remain high after today’s call. What is Special About Pectra? It is worth noting that this upgrade is the biggest after the Dencun Upgrade that lowered fees on Layer-2 protocols. The Pectra upgrade complements this enhancement with scalability and security. Once launched, it will introduce innovative features that optimize transaction speeds. With new features like account abstraction and EVM Object Format (EOF) enhancements in EIP-7692, the upgrade will benefit users and developers alike. After Pectra, Coingape highlighted that the Fusaka upgrade is next for the ETH developers. However, the timeline of the schedule for this next upgrade remains unclear at this time. Aiding the ETH L2 Ecosystem The ongoing series of upgrades in the Ethereum ecosystem is designed to enhance Layer-2 scaling solutions. Notably, these L2 protocols welcome more innovations than the Ethereum blockchain, so they may be the biggest beneficiaries of these upgrades. As reported earlier, Tether has launched USDT0 , its new stablecoin on Ink, the L2 solution launched by Kraken. This next wave of innovations might benefit more from the enhanced developer experience that Pectra and Fusaka will introduce in the coming months.

Elon Bromance (ELOBRO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOBRO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Bromance can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Bromance could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Bromance launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Bromance on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Bromance by entering its contract address – FY7aYv7K3yEE9Z8hzgURj5z7biTE8Z6BpunBPAnCEpxj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELOBRO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-17 00:24:00

Tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu paved the way, showing that a fun concept could translate into serious financial gain.

Launched as an alternative for Bitcoin in 2011, the cryptocurrency draws much interest among analysts and investors alike. Canary Capital has made a significant step forward in its quest for a Litecoin ETF. The company recently filed an amendment to its S-1 registration form with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, a move that industry experts interpret as a sign of ongoing discussions with the regulatory body. Related Reading: Expert Sees Bitcoin Dipping To $50K While Bullish Momentum Persists For market watchers and crypto aficionados alike, this development has spurred a great ounce of optimism. Considered as a good indication of possible approval, the revised filing indicates that the SEC has responded on Canary’s application. Analysts Comment On Litecoin ETF Approval Prospects Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg has publicly expressed his opinion that the “most likely” contender for the next spot crypto ETF approval is a Litecoin ETF. This prediction has gained traction in the crypto community. Balchunas does, however, also recognize the uncertainties the forthcoming shift in SEC leadership brings. Though the date of his Senate confirmation is yet unknown, the choice of former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins—considered crypto-friendly—by President-elect Donald Trump has spurred hope even further. We had heard chatter that the Litecoin S-1 had gotten comments back from SEC. This looks to confirm that which bodes well for our prediction that Litecoin is most likely to be the next coin approved. All that said, new SEC chair has yet to start and that’s a huge variable. https://t.co/cKFswPwcr0 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 15, 2025 James Seyffart, another Bloomberg ETF expert, said that the change could mean that the SEC has given feedback on the application. NEW: @CanaryFunds just filed an amended S-1 for their Litecoin ETF filing. No guarantees — but this might be indicative of SEC engagement on the filing. Still no 19b-4 filing yet though (A 19b-4 would actually start the potential approval/denial clock) h/t @isabelletanlee pic.twitter.com/wFtNOmbmYx — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 15, 2025 Investor Activity & Market Reaction A Litecoin ETF promises to set off a major market reaction.

Implications For The Crypto Market If approved, a Litecoin ETF would represent a big milestone for the digital currency. Litecoin would then join Bitcoin and Ethereum as the only cryptocurrencies with US-approved spot ETFs, strengthening its market position.

The proposal aims to reduce inflation. SIMD-0228 introduces a market-oriented solution that fluctuates based on the staking participation rate, which is calculated by dividing the amount of staked SOL. Assuming the staking participation rate falls below the recommended target of 50%, new token issuance will increase to reward stakers and validators and secure the network. In reverse, if the participation rate exceeds the target rate, token issuance is restricted, and the inflationary rate is cap-capped to limit the rate at which new tokens are minted. Tokenomics and inflation continue to challenge distributed cryptocurrency networks, sparking ongoing debates about the best incentive models. Solana validators approve proposal to redirect priority fees Mid-last year, Solana validators voted to approve another proposal, SIMD-0096, which removed the 50% burn mechanism for validator priority fees over the network and allowed 100% of the fees to be allocated to block producers. This proposal aimed to improve incentives around how validators receive priority fees, helping with network security. SIMD-0096 was expected to eliminate possible side deals between block producers and transaction submitters, improving incentives within the validator system. The original proposal stated . This ensures that validators are appropriately incentivized to prioritize network security and efficiency, rather than being incentivized to engage in potentially detrimental side deals . SIMD-0096 proposal Critics of the proposal warned that removing the protocol’s 50% fee-burning mechanism to incentivize validators would raise SOL’s inflation rate. This inflation would benefit validators; however, SOL holders who choose not to stake could face the negative effects of inflation eroding their holdings. Though the proposal received a 77% approval rate, SIMD-0096 has not yet been implemented on the Solana mainnet at the time of this writing. 65% of SOL is staked, with Jito’s MEV rewards exceeding $100 million Data from StakingRewards shows that approximately 65% of SOL’s circulating supply is currently staked. Jito — a Solana-based maximal extractable value (MEV) block-building solution — surpassed $100 million in tips in December 2024, offering an additional income stream for validators. The advocates of adjusting Solana’s token emissions argue that validator rewards gained through maximal extractable value are sufficient incentives for validators to secure the network. According to proponents, these MEV-based incentives reduce the necessity of allocating 100% of priority fees to network validators and are considered preferable to the risk of increasing SOL’s inflation rate.

The surge in large transactions of over $100,000 in the past 24 hours signals key moves by Toncoin holders. In addition, Chainlink (LINK) continues attracting positive attention, with forecasts showing it could reach $366.22 by 2031. However, BlockDAG (BDAG) is leading the charge for those seeking the best long-term crypto options. With over $181 million raised, BlockDAG is making significant strides toward its $600 million goal. Its ongoing partnership with Inter Milan, a world-renowned football club, is creating a surge in interest, further propelling its success. As BlockDAG gains global recognition, plans are in motion to list the project on 10 major centralized exchanges. This sets the stage for BlockDAG to challenge the expectations of the crypto market, becoming one of the top choices for investors seeking long-term opportunities. Toncoin Whale Activity Signals Strategic Moves Despite broader market pressure, Toncoin (TON) has shown resilience, driven by an impressive surge in whale activity. On-chain data reveals a 94% increase in large transactions, totaling $8.21 billion in just 24 hours. These high-value transactions suggest that whales either accumulate or redistribute their holdings, potentially positioning themselves for future gains. The rise in whale activity comes amid broader market conditions that have caused liquidations worth $482 million. However, Toncoin continues to stand out as a stable force in the market, with these strategic moves signaling a strong outlook for the future. While Toncoin’s future remains linked to factors like market sentiment and regulatory shifts, its resilience in the face of current conditions makes it a crypto worth watching. Chainlink Price Prediction: Long-Term Outlook Strong Chainlink’s integration with major blockchain platforms like Ethereum, Avalanche, and Arbitrum has reinforced its role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain ecosystems. These partnerships position Chainlink as a key player in improving decentralized applications, solidifying its market position. Price predictions for Chainlink suggest a promising trajectory, with potential highs of $37.83 by 2025, $116.57 by 2028, and up to $366.22 by 2031. Despite short-term market fluctuations, recent whale activity, with large accumulations of LINK, indicates confidence in its long-term value. While Chainlink faces short-term volatility, it remains a crucial asset in the evolving DeFi space. Strategic Moves for BlockDAG: Reaching $600M with Partnerships and Listing While Toncoin and Chainlink generate discussion with their respective forecasts, all attention is now on BlockDAG, which is rapidly emerging as one of the best long-term crypto options. The driving force behind this success is BlockDAG’s robust technology, steady growth, and strategic alliances. BlockDAG’s ongoing partnership with Inter Milan has expanded its global reach, connecting the project with millions of football fans worldwide. This alliance has played a key role in introducing new buyers to BlockDAG, thanks to high-profile events and campaigns bringing global attention to the project. BlockDAG’s presale has reached an impressive $181 million, with over 17.9 billion coins sold. Early participants have seen substantial returns, as the price has surged from $0.001 in the first presale batch to $0.0248 in the current batch 27. Demand is growing, and with the current presale nearing its conclusion, the opportunity to acquire BDAG coins at a low price is quickly closing. As BlockDAG’s presale grows, the project is pushing closer to its $600 million target. Its upcoming debut on 10 centralized exchanges will provide the visibility needed for even greater success. Buyers continue to flock to BlockDAG, recognizing its potential for explosive growth and positioning it as one of the most exciting long-term crypto opportunities on the market today. Build Lasting Wealth with the Best Crypto The cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, with notable movements from Toncoin and Chainlink generating discussion. Toncoin’s whale activity highlights potential accumulation, while Chainlink’s forecast indicates strong growth over the next decade. Despite short-term price volatility, many are turning to BlockDAG for its consistent growth and strong financial potential. The project’s partnership with Inter Milan has significantly increased its rising demand, bringing it closer to the $600 million milestone. BlockDAG’s presale is nearing its end, and as it prepares to list on 10 major centralized exchanges, now is the time to secure BDAG coins. This is a rare opportunity to join a crypto project set to redefine the market. With the right foundation and continued global exposure, BlockDAG is positioning itself as one of the best long-term crypto options.

Toncoin is facing tough market conditions that have people worried about its future. At the same time, Shiba Inu is delighting the crypto crowd with a special event where it gives away its new TREAT coin, aiming to get more people using its services. Meanwhile, the e-commerce platform Web3Bay , with its token 3BAY, has gathered an impressive $730K in its presale, showing strong trust from investors. Such advancements reflect the intense, high-reward potential of the leading cryptocurrencies in the market. Toncoin’s Price Stability: Examining Support and Resistance Levels Toncoin is currently navigating its price around a critical $5.00 support, with its price wavering under a $6.00 resistance level. This limited movement suggests a sideways market trend, with a possible rise to $7.00 if it stays above the $5.00 mark. If Toncoin falls below this critical support, it risks dropping to lower levels at $4.78 or $4.50. With its current price at $5.34, many are watching closely, considering what could happen next in the market—a vital moment for Toncoin’s near-term price movement. Shiba Inu’s Exciting TREAT Token Airdrop Shiba Inu is making headlines with the rollout of its TREAT token airdrop, gaining significant interest from the investment world. This important move, involving key exchanges like KuCoin, Gate.io, and Bitget, aims to boost usage and improve liquidity for Shiba Inu’s soon-to-launch stablecoin. The steps to join in the airdrop—such as setting up an account and verifying identities—are carefully crafted to guarantee a safe and fair distribution, ramping up enthusiasm and participation among investors. This effort marks a critical step in incorporating TREAT into Shiba Inu’s extensive network, solidifying its status as a leading cryptocurrency. What Makes Web3Bay Stand Out & How Early Birds Can Reap 6,430%? Web3Bay is gaining traction by eliminating traditional intermediaries like banks and payment processors, drastically reducing transaction fees and increasing transparency for all participants. This platform is leading a shift in the decentralized online shopping sector by leveraging blockchain technology to challenge established retail models. At the core of Web3Bay’s strategy is its unique token, 3BAY, which is vital to its ecosystem. This token facilitates smooth transactions, offering both purchasing ease and significant governance rights to its holders. These rights include voting on key platform updates, accessing exclusive deals, and earning rewards, which cultivate a robust community feel. Web3Bay is currently conducting a vigorous presale for the 3BAY token, having already raised over $730K. This presale features a tiered pricing structure, starting at $0.003 and potentially rising to $0.1959, designed to benefit early backers significantly. This pricing reflects the platform’s ambitious growth plans and suggests a potential return on investment that could surpass 6430% for initial investors. As blockchain continues to integrate into various sectors, Web3Bay’s strategic placement at the crossroads of blockchain and e-commerce makes it a strong competitor in the market. The success of its ongoing presale indicates solid confidence and enthusiasm for its model, which aims to offer a fairer and more transparent shopping experience. By merging blockchain’s efficiency with essential e-commerce features, Web3Bay is not just participating in the market—it’s actively transforming it. As blockchain technology expands its influence, Web3Bay’s innovative positioning makes it a key player in redefining e-commerce and a top crypto coin right now in the crypto market. Final Thoughts As we move through 2025, the differing fortunes of Toncoin, Shiba Inu, and Web3Bay paint a vivid picture of the crypto field. Toncoin’s struggles with market swings contrast with Shiba Inu’s popular airdrop and Web3Bay’s successful presale. These stories show that innovation and community involvement are crucial to standing out in the crypto space, hinting at the resilience and growth potential of these platforms as they aim to become top crypto coins in the crypto market.

In a new strategy session, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 108,000 followers on the social media platform X that payments altcoin XRP is forming a bull pennant pattern. A bull pennant pattern is a continuation pattern where a period of consolidation is often followed by a breakout. “XRP has one of the most bullish setups in crypto right now after the recent retest of the breakout zone!” Source: Ali Martinez/X He also says XRP may soar to $10, an increase of more than 217% from its current value, as crypto whales are buying massive amounts of the token. “XRP is in the middle of a massive bullish breakout… On-chain data reveals that whales have been heavily accumulating XRP. In the last week alone, they’ve purchased over 1.10 billion XRP. This buying pressure is building momentum. XRP has broken out of a bull pennant, a classic bullish pattern. If the buying pressure continues, it could help propel XRP to $10.” XRP is trading for $3.15 at time of writing, up 18.2% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the analyst says that Ethereum ( ETH ) layer-2 scaling solution Polygon ( MATIC ) is gearing up for a massive move in either direction as it consolidates within a descending triangle. “Polygon is on the verge of a 40% move! All we have to do is wait for a sustained close outside of the $0.47 to $0.41 range to determine the direction of the breakout.” Source: Ali Martinez/X MATIC is trading for $0.48 at time of writing, up 7.1% in the last 24 hours. Next, he suggests Ethena ( ENA ), a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum, may have avoided a severe correction after surging to reclaim a key support level within a trading range with $1.03 as the upper bound and $0.85 as the lower bound. “Ethena appears to have broken out of a parallel channel! Failing to reclaim $0.86 as support could trigger a price correction toward $0.69 or $0.57.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Ethena is trading for $0.94 at time of writing, up 14.1% in the last 24 hours. Lastly, he suggests layer-1 protocol Algorand ( ALGO ) is now in a bullish trend after breaking out of the upper trendline of a symmetrical triangle on the four-hour chart. Symmetrical triangle patterns can either be bullish or bearish – bullish if the price breaks out above the upper trend line and bearish if the price breaks down below the lower trend line. “ALGO is poised for a potential 60% breakout! A decisive close outside the $0.39-$0.32 range will set the direction of the trend.” Source: Ali Martinez/X ALGO is trading for $0.44 at time of writing up 20.3% in the last 24 hours.

Smart Traders Pivot to RCOF to Get a 19,090% Upside",https://timestabloid.com/cardano-and-the-xrp-price-close-to-their-peaks-smart-traders-pivot/,"The XRP price has been a focal point for investors, especially with its recent climb towards what many consider to be its peak performance. However, as both Cardano and XRP hover near their highs, savvy traders are looking beyond these established cryptocurrencies towards RCO Finance (RCOF) , which promises an astounding upside with its presale currently in the spotlight. Cardano and XRP Price Movements Capture Investors’ Attention Market data from CoinGecko shows Cardano (ADA) experiencing a surge. The price has risen by 8.24% in the last 24 hours and is trading at $1. Cardano has shown resilience and growth, particularly with developments like the upcoming Plomin hard fork, which aims to enhance network performance. On the other hand, XRP has also seen a significant uptick, rising 7.68% to trade at $2.52. However, despite these gains, investors have a sense of caution due to potential bearish momentum for XRP, with critical support levels near $2.00 being closely watched. Also, while on an upward trajectory, Cardano has faced an 8.98% weekly decline, suggesting that while both cryptocurrencies are close to their recent peaks, the market’s volatility could lead to rapid changes. These developments have led some to question the sustainability of these highs, pushing investors to explore alternative opportunities. Investors Turn to RCO Finance for Post-Presale Returns With Cardano and XRP showing signs of peaking or stabilizing, investors are turning their attention to RCO Finance’s presale . Currently, in its fourth presale stage, the RCOF token has already seen a dramatic increase of 509% from its initial price to $0.0777. Once the presale comes to an end, the token is expected to get listed at between $0.4 and $0.6 offering even those who invest now a chance for lucrative returns. However, the real excitement lies in the forecast that once the RCO Finance platform officially rolls out, the token could soar by up to 19,090%. This prediction is based on the platform’s unique features and the anticipated demand for its innovative financial tools and the growth potential of AI-driven financial ecosystems. RCO Finance Set to Revolutionize the DeFi Investment Landscape RCO Finance is poised to disrupt the traditional investment paradigm with its array of advanced features. At the heart of its offerings is an AI-powered Robo Advisor , which provides personalized investment strategies based on real-time market data, individual risk tolerance, and financial goals. The Robo Advisor aims democratize access to sophisticated investment strategies, making them available without the need for deep financial knowledge or intermediary involvement. Additionally, RCO Finance will offer access to over 120,000 assets across 12,500 asset classes, including tokenized real-world assets like real estate and commodities, thus broadening the investment horizon for users. The platform will also operate in a KYC-free ecosystem, emphasizing user privacy and reducing entry barriers, which is particularly appealing in today’s data-conscious environment. Security is also paramount; RCO Finance’s smart contracts have been audited by SolidProof , a reputable blockchain security firm, ensuring a robust and trustworthy trading environment. Furthermore, the tokenomics of the platform’s native token, RCOF, are structured to encourage long-term holding through staking rewards and governance rights, while also employing a deflationary model where unsold tokens are burned, potentially increasing the token’s value over time. This combination of features not only aims to revolutionize DeFi but also offers a compelling case for why investors might choose RCOF over more traditional cryptocurrency investments as they anticipate the next big wave in digital finance.

The Trust is structured to reflect the market price of XRP, minus fees and expenses, without requiring investors to directly purchase or manage the cryptocurrency. XRP itself is used primarily for cross-border payments and is supported by the Ripple Network, a decentralized blockchain system facilitating fast and efficient transactions.

The network allows users to exchange tokens of value, called XRP, with speed and minimal friction. Launched on Sept. 5, 2024, the Grayscale XRP Trust is benchmarked against the CoinDesk Ripple Price Index (XRX). With a performance fee of 0.00% and a management fee of 2.50%, the Trust offers a cost-effective solution for accredited investors seeking exposure to XRP. The reopening of the Grayscale’s XRP Trust coincides with major developments in Ripple Labs’ legal proceedings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In December 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple, alleging that the company raised over $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP. In July 2023, a federal judge ruled that XRP is not a security when sold to the general public on digital-asset exchanges, though sales to institutional investors were considered unregistered securities transactions. This partial legal victory has bolstered confidence in XRP’s regulatory standing. Grayscale has recently expanded its range of digital asset products. On Dec. 12, 2024, the company launched the Lido DAO ( LDO ) Trust and Optimism ( OP ) Trust, providing exposure to governance tokens linked to Ethereum staking and scaling solutions. These launches followed earlier additions, including the Grayscale Sui Trust in August, the XRP Trust in September, and the Aave Trust in October, reflecting Grayscale’s commitment to diversifying its investment products. As of Jan. 17, 2025, XRP is trading at $3.27, with a 24-hour trading volume of $25.77 billion. The circulating supply stands at approximately 57.56 billion XRP tokens, resulting in a market capitalization of around $188.23 billion. Over the past 24 hours, XRP has experienced a price increase of 7.01%.

Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) could become the next viral memecoin. Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) by entering its contract address – GmW5qPRZ4TfoTw6U1KL9Btxn1uqXJJhieMAfeJk4wkbg – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPAI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-17 01:50:00

This rebound has not only boosted TON’s market capitalization by some millions but also brought investors to ponder on Toncoin’s potential for a sustained rally. Particularly, as the TON market stabilizes so far, questions about investor sentiment and market risk are coming to the forefront. Related Reading: Toncoin Could See A 65% Surge In The Next 43 Days—Here’s Why Is Now The Time To Buy TON A CryptoQuant Quicktake Platform contributor Darkfost recently analyzed Toncoin’s market behavior, focusing on the annualized realized volatility over a one-week period. This metric as shared by the analyst has dropped below the 0.25 threshold, offering insights into the prevailing investor sentiment and perceived market risk. While low volatility is often associated with reduced risk, it may also indicate waning market interest or growing investor caution. Notably, the decline in realized volatility is a significant development, as periods of low volatility have historically been followed by market reversals. Darkfost emphasized that reduced volatility often signals diminished investor interest, which can present both opportunities and challenges for traders. On the one hand, such periods may highlight reduced market risks, offering potential entry points for long-term investors. On the other hand, they require careful analysis, as low volatility alone cannot guarantee future price movements. Darkfost suggested that monitoring these low-volatility periods closely, alongside other indicators, is essential for making informed decisions. Additional evaluation of broader trends and corroborating signals is necessary to identify whether these zones represent genuine buying opportunities. Toncoin Market Performance And Outlook In recent weeks, TON’s price has shown little movement in either a bullish or bearish direction. Despite the broader crypto market experiencing a recent downturn, TON has managed to hold steady above the $5 mark, avoiding any significant drops below this level. Related Reading: Toncoin Signals Accumulation Phase as Open Interest Hits Nine-Month Low – What’s Next?

While Shiba Inu, often dubbed the “Dogecoin killer,” has turned heads for its volatility, a new contender is emerging on the horizon. RCO Finance (RCOF) , an AI altcoin that is generating buzz with ambitious targets, aiming to soar from its current price of $0.07 to an astonishing $1. The convergence of the Shiba Inu price fluctuating fortunes and the meteoric rise of RCOF is stirring up a sense of FOMO among investors eager to capitalize on the next big opportunity. Shiba Inu Price Resilience Amid Market Volatility The Shiba Inu price recently demonstrated impressive resilience by reclaiming its position above the critical 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.00002082. This recovery has brought a sigh of relief to investors, signaling renewed buying interest and a potential stabilization in the near term. The 200 EMA often serves as a key dividing line between bullish and bearish trends; the Shiba Inu price ability to stay above this level showcases underlying strength in its price action. Currently trading at $0.00002169, the Shiba Inu price faces notable resistance at the 26 EMA and 50 EMA, set at $0.00002242 and $0.00002271, respectively. Breaking these levels is essential for SHIB to regain bullish momentum. While the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 45 indicates a neutral stance, the token’s trajectory will depend on breaking resistance levels and external factors like market sentiment and ecosystem developments. The Shiba Inu price performance reflects a cautious optimism among investors. The Rise of AI Altcoin Market Positions RCO Finance (RCOF) for DeFi Dominance The ongoing surge in the Shiba Inu price action has significantly triggered a buying spree on the RCO FInance (RCOF) AI altcoin .

Cryptocurrencies like Tron and Ondo are turning heads with their unique market moves and promising setups. Tron’s bullish pattern and Ondo’s upcoming token unlock have captured the attention of seasoned traders and newbies alike. But one name is making an entrance that’s impossible to ignore: Qubetics. This newcomer is not just another token; it’s a movement. With its presale generating massive interest, Qubetics is paving the way for blockchain’s next evolution. Tron recently saw a price dip but remains primed for a rebound thanks to a nearly complete inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. Meanwhile, Ondo, despite being one of the worst performers last month, is showing signs of life as whales quietly accumulate ahead of a major token unlock. These projects bring unique strengths to the table, but the buzz around Qubetics is hard to beat. With real-world applications like its Decentralized VPN feature, it’s solving problems many didn’t even realize existed. Qubetics isn’t just about hype; it’s about utility. It’s here to tackle the issues that traditional blockchain platforms couldn’t. From revolutionizing online security to enhancing global connectivity, this project is set to launch in Q2 2025, and it’s already raising eyebrows for all the right reasons. Let’s explore why these three cryptocurrencies are the best coins to join for 2025. Qubetics ($TICS): The New Standard for Blockchain Utility Qubetics is causing a stir, and if you’ve been keeping tabs on its presale, you know why. With more than 420 million tokens sold and over $9.6 million raised so far, it’s clear that investors are paying attention. At just $0.0501 per token, $TICS offers an opportunity to get in early on a project that’s built to last. One of Qubetics’ standout features is its Decentralized VPN (DVPN) . Think of it as a VPN, but without the pitfalls of centralization. Imagine you’re a digital nomad in Bali, working on sensitive projects for global clients. Traditional VPNs can fail you, exposing your data to cyber threats or even government surveillance. Qubetics’ DVPN eliminates these risks by decentralizing the network, ensuring your data remains private and secure. For small businesses in Sydney, the DVPN offers unparalleled security for handling client data. Picture a startup sharing sensitive documents between offices in different cities. With Qubetics, they can encrypt their communications without relying on centralized servers that could be hacked or monitored. Even individuals benefit. Think about a gamer in Tokyo wanting to access global servers without lag or throttling. The DVPN ensures a seamless and secure experience. Qubetics isn’t just solving technical issues; it’s redefining how we think about online privacy and connectivity. With its Q2 2025 launch on the horizon, anticipation is building. Analysts predict massive ROI potential, and its real-world applications make it one of the best coins to join for 2025 . Tron: Ready for a Bullish Comeback Tron has had its share of ups and downs, but it’s never one to stay out of the spotlight for long. Recently, the cryptocurrency dipped below $0.23, leaving some investors wary. But those who’ve studied the charts see a different story. Crypto analyst Evan Luthra highlighted that Tron’s inverse head-and-shoulders pattern is nearing completion. If this pattern plays out, Tron could surge to $0.277 in Q1 2025, marking a significant comeback. Data doesn’t lie. Tron is trading above its 100-day EMA at $0.22, and its momentum indicator suggests a buying opportunity. For traders in regions like Malaysia or New Zealand, these are the kinds of signals that trigger action. Imagine a tech entrepreneur in Auckland looking to diversify their crypto portfolio. Tron’s strong technical setup makes it an enticing choice. Tron’s appeal isn’t just technical. Its blockchain offers low transaction fees and high scalability, making it a favorite for developers. Picture a gaming startup in Singapore using Tron’s platform to launch a play-to-earn model. The low costs and fast speeds make it a no-brainer. What keeps Tron on the list of the best coins to join for 2025 is its resilience. Market fluctuations are inevitable, but Tron’s ability to bounce back and its strong fundamentals make it a solid pick for anyone looking to ride the next wave of crypto innovation. Ondo: A Sleeper Hit Poised for Action Ondo hasn’t had the easiest run lately. With its price dropping 40% over the past month, it’s been a tough pill to swallow for investors. But here’s the kicker: the upcoming token unlock on January 18 could change everything. Over 1.94 billion tokens, valued at $2.42 billion, are set to hit the market. Events like these often bring volatility, but they also present opportunities. Whales have been quietly accumulating ONDO ahead of the unlock, and on-chain data shows significant buying activity. A trader in Jakarta might look at these signals and see a chance to get in while prices are still low. If the falling wedge pattern on the 4-hour chart holds, ONDO could rebound to $1.76, offering a potential double-digit surge. Ondo’s technicals are equally intriguing. The RSI is in oversold territory, signaling that a bullish reversal could be on the horizon. For a crypto enthusiast in Manila, this might be the perfect setup for a short-term play with long-term potential. What sets Ondo apart is its ability to adapt. Despite recent setbacks, the project has strong fundamentals and a committed community. This combination makes it one of the best coins to join for 2025, especially for investors who know how to spot a comeback story. How Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN Works and Why It Matters The Decentralized VPN feature isn’t just a gimmick; it’s a revolution in online security. Traditional VPNs rely on centralized servers, which are vulnerable to hacking, surveillance, and throttling. Qubetics flips the script by using blockchain technology to decentralize the network. This means no single point of failure and complete anonymity for users. Here’s how it works. Imagine you’re a freelancer in Kuala Lumpur working with international clients. You need to access sensitive documents securely. Qubetics’ DVPN encrypts your data and routes it through a decentralized network of nodes, ensuring your information stays private. For businesses, the benefits are even greater. A company in Brisbane managing a global supply chain can use the DVPN to secure communications and protect trade secrets. Even gamers in Seoul can enjoy lag-free, secure access to servers worldwide. Why does this matter? Because online security is no longer a luxury; it’s a necessity. As the world becomes more connected, the need for secure, reliable solutions will only grow. Qubetics is leading the charge, making its DVPN feature a cornerstone of blockchain’s future. Conclusion If you’re looking for the best coins to join for 2025 , Qubetics, Tron, and Ondo should be at the top of your list. Each brings something unique to the table. Qubetics is revolutionizing online security with its Decentralized VPN. Tron’s bullish setup and robust blockchain make it a strong contender, while Ondo’s upcoming token unlock presents a golden opportunity for savvy investors. The crypto world moves fast, and these projects are shaping the future. Don’t wait too long to make your move.

Takahiro Anno’s vision for “Digital Democracy 2030” is not favored by everyone, however, and falls in line with previous disturbing ideas put forth by the J-gov about leaning into AI rulership. 2024 Tokyo gubernatorial hopeful and self-proclaimed Sci-Fi writer Takahiro Anno thinks AI could help clean up governance in Japan. According to local media , the software engineer (who came in fifth in the 2024 Tokyo election) has announced he will create an open-source tool for aggregating public opinion, managing funds, and shaping policy. Anno’s controversial vision of ‘Digital Democracy 2030’ Anno explained on January 16 during a speech in Shinjuku Ward, Tokyo, that his vision for “ Digital Democracy 2030 ” sees artificial intelligence taking a central role in shaping politics, with Nikkei reporting that the tool aims to “manage political funds” and “aggregate public opinion.” Further, it will connect its findings to policy creation. Source: X On the surface this may seem like a one-off, pie-in-the-sky idea from another random software engineer and science-fiction geek, but Anno actually has big state ties as a current advisor to GovTech Tokyo, an organization dedicated to digital transformation (DX) which is 100% bankrolled by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Further, back in November of last year, Japan’s Digital Administrative and Financial Reform Council released a document describing how artificial intelligence, drones, and robots can be used in the implementation of a new kind of surveillance state to better govern the nation — ideas right in line with Anno’s proclamations. Japanese reactions mixed, residents still struggling with immediate fiscal hardships Social media responses to the Nikkei article on Anno were mixed, as residents of Japan seem to think there are much more important matters to attend to. One user even questioned (translated by Google): “Is there any point in using AI as an intermediary? Another public money business?” Still, other commenters said the idea was “amazing” and expressed interest in getting the AI tool in place. As Cryptopolitan has previously reported , Japan’s current economic struggles are increasing for everyday individuals, with a flagging JPY, skyrocketing food prices, and a growing elderly population that cannot afford to retire on the state’s poverty-line pensions. As such, it’s really no wonder people are skeptical of a well-funded, 34-year-old Sci-Fi writer’s ideas for how their money should be spent.

According to multiple reports, the incoming administration is preparing executive orders aimed at boosting the cryptocurrency sector, including new policies to support industry growth and streamline regulations. Donald Trump Executive Order to Focus on Cryptocurrency President-elect Donald Trump is said to be working on an executive order that will ensure that cryptocurrency is viewed as an essential part of the US economy. The order is anticipated to call on the regulators to work closely with the crypto industry and to form a crypto advisory council. This council would afford industry stakeholders an opportunity to raise their concerns and make recommendations. According to the sources , the executive order could be signed on January 20, the first day of Trump’s presidency. It may also suspend all ongoing crypto cases and order all government bodies to rethink their stance on digital currencies. Brian Hughes, the spokesperson for Trump’s transition team, said, “President Trump will follow through on his word to promote American dominance in the crypto space.” Creation of a Bitcoin Reserve Under Discussion Another idea being floated under the Donald Trump administration is the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve through seized digital assets. At the moment, the U.S. government has about $20 billion worth of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from law enforcement belongings, as per Arkham Intelligence. The Bitcoin Policy Institute has proposed that $21 billion be invested to make Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset. Should this be implemented it will afford a mechanism through which the U.S. can effectively deal with the issue of debt and enhance its position within the global economy. Amid this discussion, Senator Cynthia Lummis has called out proposed plans by the US Marshals to sell its seized Bitcoin stash which would invalidate the Bitcoin Reserve strategy. In addition, there are also indications that the Trump administration may expand this reserve to other digital assets such as Solana (SOL) and XRP, as part of a broader plan to diversify national crypto assets. Review of Banking and Accounting Policies The new Donald Trump administration is expected to tackle crypto de-banking and repeal the accounting standards that regard banks’ crypto assets as their liabilities. These amendments subsequently are directed towards enabling financial institutions to hold and manage digital assets more efficiently, which will open up the door for the broader market. Concurrently, according to the Washington Post the SEC could revisit ongoing legal proceedings against crypto companies. Some of the people familiar with the plans said that other cases without fraud allegations may be put on hold under the new administration. Ripple Labs’ Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty has recently claimed that the long-standing regulatory actions against the company can be dropped under the Trump administration.

However, a new project is quietly gaining momentum and capturing the attention of savvy investors. Lightchain AI , an emerging blockchain platform, is carving out its space in the market. With over $10.6 million raised during its presale, priced at $0.00525 in Stage 12, Lightchain AI’s innovative approach is making it a serious contender to watch. Solana Strengths and Current Market Challenges Solana has shown great strength bouncing back from a low of $9.64 to near $199; this is a rise of 2,143% in two years. Its strength in a type of trade called DEX, with numbers ͏over $100 billion, shows its tech skill and charm to buyers. But, Solana has problems, like a drop in Total Value Locked of $11 billion to $7.93 billion which shows bad signs and investor worries. Also, the network has felt crowding and deal breaks, maybe lessening user and builder trust. Even with these bumps, Solana’s growth in the space and lots of money coming in show a chance for more rise in the changing crypto world. Lightchain AI Is Stealing the Spotlight Lightchain AI offers a fresh perspective on blockchain development, emphasizing usability, scalability, and enterprise-grade solutions. Unlike Solana, which focuses heavily on DeFi and NFTs, Lightchain AI is designed to cater to a broader range of industries with features tailored for real-world applications. One key differentiator is Lightchain AI’s ability to simplify decentralized application (dApp) development. The platform provides comprehensive developer tools, including intuitive APIs and a sandbox testing environment, making it accessible to a wider range of creators. This approach lowers barriers to entry, encouraging innovation and adoption. Another standout feature is its advanced security framework. Lightchain AI integrates cryptographic techniques to protect sensitive data, ensuring compliance with global standards. This focus on privacy and security makes it particularly appealing to industries like healthcare, AI, and finance. What’s Driving the Momentum? The strong investor confidence in Lightchain AI’s presale reflects its potential to disrupt the market. With a roadmap that includes a testnet launch in 2025, the project is attracting developers and enterprises eager to explore its capabilities. Unlike Solana, which has faced criticism for centralization concerns, Lightchain AI prioritizes a decentralized governance model, giving token holders a direct say in platform development. Market analysts predict that Lightchain AI’s unique features and focus on scalability will enable it to compete with established players like Solana. As the project continues to gain traction, it’s poised to become a key player in the blockchain ecosystem. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-17 03:00:00
33767162,[object Object],1737082834,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts When The Dogecoin Price Will Hit $1, It’s Not That Far Away",https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-will-hit-1/,"CoinCodex’s machine-learning algorithm has predicted when the Dogecoin price could hit the psychological $1 level . Interestingly, based on the prediction, market participants won’t have to wait too long before they see the foremost meme coin reach this price level. When The Dogecoin Price Will Hit $1 The machine learning algorithm predicted that the Dogecoin price would hit the $1 target by March this year. Specifically, the algorithm predicted that the foremost meme coin could rally to as high as $1.04 by March. DOGE is also expected to further rally to $1.11 by April, representing an increase of around 200% from its current price level. The platform noted that the sentiment around Dogecoin price is currently bullish, although the fear and greed index is currently at 75, which indicates greed. Despite the bullish sentiment , the machine-learning algorithm predicts that Dogecoin could continue to range around its current price level for the remainder of this month. Like the machine learning algorithm, crypto analysts such as Master Kenobi have also predicted that the Dogecoin price could soon reach the much-anticipated $1 target. Master Kenobi recently highlighted Donald Trump’s inauguration as a catalyst for the parabolic surge to this price level. Trump will take office on January 20, which is bullish for the Dogecoin price because of his pro-crypto stance. Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) will also come to life, which is bullish for the foremost meme coin because of the similarity with its ticker ‘DOGE.’ Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade also recently predicted that the Dogecoin price rally to $1 is imminent. The analyst predicted that DOGE could hit this price level as early as March. Galaxy Research also predicted that the rally to $1 will happen this year. What To Expect From DOGE Crypto analyst KrissPax has provided insights into what to expect from the Dogecoin price in the coming days. In an X post, he stated that Dogecoin is about to break out of a downward channel. The analyst remarked that the foremost meme coin would most likely trade up to $40, retrace back to test the previous resistance, confirm it as support, and then move higher. On the other hand, crypto analyst Kevin Capital has warned market participants about the current Dogecoin price action.

A recent study by Binance indicates that XRP could hit $10 by 2025, fueled by Ripple’s successful challenges against the SEC and the expansion of RLUSD, a stablecoin that supports Ripple’s network. At the same time, Web3Bay (3BAY) is capturing attention as a notable project that merges e-commerce with cryptocurrency features, presenting new opportunities for crypto investors. Is a $10 Value Feasible for Ripple (XRP) by 2025? The potential for Ripple to achieve a $10 value is backed by various vital elements. A legal win over the SEC has cleared up regulatory doubts, prompting banks to consider XRP for worldwide money transfers. This, along with signs like a high RSI and consistent trading volumes, points to a possible price increase for XRP. Moreover, incorporating RLUSD into Ripple’s framework solidifies its presence in the international financial scene by improving cross-border payment services. Large wallet acquisitions by whales also contribute to the positive outlook for Ripple’s (XRP) future in overcoming major price barriers and maintaining its market drive toward the $10 mark. Web3Bay: Transforming E-Commerce with Blockchain Technology Conversely, Web3Bay is transforming e-commerce by integrating cryptocurrency payments with regular banking operations. The platform cuts out middlemen and excessive fees, allowing sellers to access a worldwide market while reducing transaction costs. It also plans to incorporate NFTs and loyalty schemes, building an ecosystem for goods, collectibles, and decentralized finance possibilities. Web3Bay’s Security and Community-Driven Approach Web3Bay’s stringent security protocols, like smart contracts and permanent blockchain records, ensure a trustworthy environment for users and large investors alike. Its decentralized governance structure lets token owners help guide the platform, encouraging ongoing loyalty and community involvement. 3BAY’s hybrid model is gaining traction among merchants and consumers globally, enhancing accessibility and ease in online shopping. The ongoing presale has successfully gathered over $740,000, with 210 million tokens sold at $0.0039675 each. With an anticipated market price of $0.1959, early backers stand to see substantial gains. Additionally, Web3Bay provides staking options during the presale, offering participants a chance to earn while supporting the platform’s expansion. Summing Up Ripple (XRP) is on a trajectory toward $10, guided by advances in regulation, growing market trust, and practical implementations like the integration of RLUSD. Concurrently, Web3Bay is making strides in the retail sector by integrating blockchain with e-commerce, introducing a novel viewpoint on international commerce. As Ripple aims to transform cross-border payments, Web3Bay engages those interested in pioneering crypto applications in the retail industry. Together, these initiatives showcase the flexibility and transformative impact of cryptocurrency within finance and commerce. Ripple (XRP) remains at the forefront of payment solutions, while Web3Bay’s distinctive approach to e-commerce marks it as a prominent player in the growing digital market. Both endeavors highlight the expansive potential of blockchain to reform industries and offer investment opportunities in the rapidly growing crypto market of 2025 .

The buzzword? Community. And what’s better than diving into an ecosystem where memes meet moolah? If you’ve been scouting for the top new meme coins to join today, we’ve got the holy trinity of hype right here: BTFD Coin, MOG, and Neiro. These legends are redefining the game, and we’re about to spill the deets! Let’s kick it off with BTFD Coin, where the party doesn’t just stop at staking or P2E games. Nope—it’s the referral rewards program that’s making waves, turning every investor into a recruitment rockstar. And spoiler: the ROI potential? Chef’s kiss.

Say you invest $3,000 at today’s presale price of $0.000142. That bags you a hefty 21,126,761 BTFD Coins. If the coin hits $0.0006, you’re sitting on $12,676. But here’s where the FOMO hits hard—if BTFD Coin moons to $0.006, you’re looking at a whopping $126,760.

MOG is proving that laughter really is the best currency, and with the way it’s trending, this lifestyle coin might just be the ticket to the moon. Neiro: The No-Tax Wonder Next on the list is Neiro, a fresh face in the crypto scene with a big promise: zero buy/sell tax. Yep, you heard that right.

Musk Saves California (MUSKCALI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKCALI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Saves California can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Saves California could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Saves California launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Saves California on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Saves California by entering its contract address – 2mtzeaYqDPLtCemX5jNPuuq8jw65cbgNUXuT3fBra2M2 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCALI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-17 03:18:13

With renewed interest in cross-border payments and Ripple’s increasing institutional adoption, experts suggest XRP could achieve an astonishing 15,000% growth in the next market cycle. Alongside XRP, emerging tokens like BigBossInu , as well as heavyweights like Cardano (ADA) , Ethereum (ETH) , Optimism (OP) , and VeChain (VET) , are poised to experience significant growth. BigBossInu: The Crypto Project Turning Heads with Its Presale BigBossInu’s high-demand presale is creating waves, making it a hot topic among investors and analysts. BigBossInu is one of the most promising projects set to deliver massive returns. Positioned as a high-potential altcoin, BigBossInu has the potential to capture the market’s attention, making it a valuable addition to any portfolio aiming for substantial growth in 2025 and beyond. BigBossInu celebrates $100,000 raised within minutes! For a limited time, get a 50% EXTRA BONUS by using the code EXTRA50X. >> Ripple (XRP)’s meteoric 700% rise is a reflection of its unique position as a leader in the cross-border payments space. Ripple experienced a 98% surge after Ripple’s partial success in its case against the SEC, briefly becoming the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. Cardano (ADA) has earned a reputation for its cutting-edge technology focused on sustainability and scalability. As the platform continues to roll out key upgrades like Hydra, which will significantly improve scalability, Cardano is expected to handle more decentralized applications (dApps). Ethereum (ETH) remains the undisputed leader in decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and NFTs. Ethereum is holding strong around $2,450 after a small dip with Bitcoin. Despite the anticipation surrounding Ethereum ETF approval, it hasn’t significantly impacted price movement. Optimism (OP) has become one of the most important Layer-2 scaling solutions for Ethereum, helping alleviate network congestion and reduce fees. By enhancing Ethereum’s scalability, VeChain (VET) is transforming the supply chain industry by providing blockchain-based solutions that enhance transparency, traceability, and fraud prevention. Its real-time tracking capabilities have been adopted by various industries to monitor products throughout their lifecycle. >>>> Conclusion With XRP positioned for a potential 15,000% surge and the rising influence of BigBossInu , the next market cycle is set to deliver explosive growth across several key altcoins. Cardano (ADA) , Ethereum (ETH) , Optimism (OP) , and VeChain (VET) are all poised for significant advances, offering investors a diverse array of opportunities to capture value in 2025.

ETH is holding gains and might aim for a fresh increase above the $3,480 zone. Ethereum started a decent recovery wave above the $3,240 zone. The price is trading above $3,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $3,320 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it clears the $3,400 resistance level. Ethereum Price Stays Above The Key Support Ethereum price started a decent upward move above the $3,240 level but upsides were limited compared to Bitcoin . ETH was able to clear the $3,300 and $3,320 resistance levels to move into a short-term positive zone. The pair even surged above the $3,350 and $3,400 levels. Finally, it tested the $3,480 zone. A high was formed at $3,473 and recently the price corrected some gains. There was a drop below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,912 swing low to the $3,473 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,280 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . It is again rising and trading above $3,300. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $3,320 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,400 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,420 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,480. A clear move above the $3,480 resistance might send the price toward the $3,550 resistance. An upside break above the $3,550 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,650 resistance zone or even $3,720 in the near term. Downside Correction In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,400 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,280 level. The first major support sits near the $3,200 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,912 swing low to the $3,473 high. A clear move below the $3,200 support might push the price toward the $3,120 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,050 support level in the near term.

Here’s what on-chain data says could be behind the rally. Litecoin Has Overperformed Market With A Strong Surge In The Last 24 Hours The past day has seen recovery from the cryptocurrency sector as a whole, but Litecoin in particular has stood out with its impressive rally of more than 19%, which has taken its price beyond the $120 mark. Related Reading: XRP, Bitcoin Recovery Only Short-Lived? TD Sequential May Suggest So Below is a chart that shows how the recent performance of the coin has looked. Among the top digital assets by market cap, only XRP (XRP) and Hedera (HBAR) have shown comparable returns to Litecoin during the last 24 hours. In terms of weekly profits, though, LTC still lags behind many coins with an overall uplift of just 16%. As for what could be providing the fuel for the rally, perhaps behavior of the key investors of the cryptocurrency could provide some answers. LTC Sharks & Whales Have Been Buying Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed about the latest trend in the Supply Distribution of the Litecoin sharks and whales. The “Supply Distribution” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of LTC that a given wallet group is holding right now. Addresses or investors are divided into these cohorts based on the number of coins that they are carrying in their balance. The 1 to 10 coins group, for instance, contains all the wallets holding between and one and ten tokens of the asset. In the context of the current topic, two cohorts are of interest: sharks and whales. The combined range for these investors could be defined as 10,000 LTC to infinity. The lower end of the range is equivalent to around $120,000 at the current exchange rate, so the only holders who would qualify for these groups would be the sizeable ones. As the influence of any investor in the market goes up the more coins that they hold, the sharks and whales can be worth keeping an eye on since their movements may end up reflecting on the cryptocurrency. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution of the Litecoin sharks and whales over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Litecoin sharks and whales have seen their total supply go up recently, which suggests that these large investors have been participating in net accumulation. In all, the groups have bought a total of 250,000 tokens (around $30 million) during this surge in the indicator over the last week. Given the timing, it’s probable that these holders have had a part to play in the latest price rally.

BITX charges a high 1.85% expense ratio and has underperformed its promise, delivering only 1.5x Bitcoin's return due to decay issues. President Trump's potential 'Bitcoin Reserve' policy could boost Bitcoin prices, but simpler ETFs like IBIT are better for bullish investors without leverage risks. I rate BITX a hold and recommend IBIT ETF for those seeking Bitcoin exposure without the downsides of leverage or decay. With President-elect Donald Trump expected to return to the White House next week and likely designating cryptocurrencies a 'national priority' on day 1, investors may be tempted to add Bitcoin exposure ahead of inauguration day. One option is to buy the 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITX ), which promises to deliver twice the daily returns of holding Bitcoins. However, in my opinion, the BITX ETF may not be investors' best option if they expect Bitcoins to rally for an extended period of time. The BITX ETF suffers from significant contango and volatility decay that causes significant slippage compared to actual Bitcoin returns. I rate BITX a hold and prefer the simpler, low-cost Bitcoin ETFs instead. Brief Fund Overview For those unfamiliar, the 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF seeks to provide daily returns that are twice the return of the S&P CME Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index (""SPBTFDUE Index""). This index measures the daily performance of a rolling position in front-month Bitcoin futures that trade on the CME Exchange and is rebalanced on a daily basis between the front-month contract and the second-month contract to maintain its 200% daily exposure. For example, on January 16th, 2025, BITX held 77.6% of its notional exposure in January futures and 122.4% in February futures, with collateral held as cash (Figure 1). Figure 1 - BITX holdings, January 16, 2025 (volatilityshares.com) The BITX ETF has $3.5 billion in net assets and charges a 1.85% expense ratio (Figure 2). Figure 2 - BITX overview (volatilityshares.com) Contango And Volatility Causes Slippage I may sound like a broken record, but investors considering a leveraged futures ETF like the BIX must consider contango and volatility decay. Contango , with respect to a futures market, means that asset prices are more expensive the farther out in maturity you go. For example, while spot Bitcoins are quoted at ~$99,000 on January 16th, 2025, the January futures are trading at $100,500 and the February futures are trading at $101,600 (Figure 2). Figure 3 - Illustrative Bitcoin futures curve (trading view.com) This becomes problematic for a futures-based ETF like BITX because the fund must rebalance its exposure every single day to maintain a weighted average 1-month maturity. On a daily basis, BITX must sell the 'cheaper' near-month future and buy the more 'expensive' second-month future. This constant 'sell-low/buy-high' leads to a gradual decay in value for the BITX ETF. Compounding the problem for BITX is its 200% leveraged exposure. In addition to 'contango decay' , leveraged ETFs suffer from 'volatility decay' . Assume investors have bought $100 worth of BITX. If Bitcoins return +5% on day 1 followed by -5% on day 2, the returns experience for BITX investors is +10% followed by -10% and they will end up with $99.00, significantly less than twice the 2-day compounded loss of 0.25% or $99.50. This loss in value is commonly called 'volatility decay'. While these losses may appear small on a day-to-day basis, when compounded over long periods of time, contango and volatility decay can cause very significant slippage in BITX's returns compared to holding Bitcoins directly. For example, in the past year, Bitcoin has surged by 131%, but the BITX ETF has only returned 194%, significantly less than its claim of 200% returns (Figure 4). Figure 4 - BITX vs. Bitcoins, trailing 1 year (Seeking Alpha) Traders considering the BITX ETF should ensure they fully understand the tracking error risks involved with levered and futures-based ETFs as explained in these FINRA and SEC warnings. 'Bitcoin Reserve' To Become A National Priority According to leaked reports , one of President Trump's first executive order once he returns to the White House may be to establish a 'national strategic Bitcoin stockpile', much like how the U.S. government currently holds gold bullion in reserve. While the details remain hazy, there are several avenues President Trump could pursue to establish this 'Bitcoin Reserve'. One simple way would be for the U.S. government to take the ~200k Bitcoins it has obtained from confiscations and seizures and deem them as the 'Bitcoin Reserve' and add to it over time. However, a more bullish scenario is a proposal by Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis that could require the United States buy 200,000 Bitcoins per year, for 5 years, until it has accumulated a total of 1,000,000 Bitcoins. As a reminder, there are currently 19.9 million Bitcoins in circulation and only 21 million Bitcoins can ever exist, according to Bitcoin's codebase. If the United States' 'Bitcoin Reserve' is set in terms of number of coins instead of dollars, then that means there may be a constant 'bid' underneath Bitcoin prices as the U.S. government will be forced to steadily accumulate Bitcoins, regardless of price. Comparing BITX To Peer Funds With such a bullish outlook, investors may be salivating at the chance to 'front-run' the government. But how does BITX compare against other Bitcoin investment options? In terms of investment funds, I believe BITX is a relatively poor choice. First, in terms of fees, the BITX ETF is by far the most expensive, charging a 1.9% expense ratio compared to the ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ) that charges 0.95% or the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) that charges 0.12% (Figure 5). BITO is similar to BITX in that it is futures-based, while IBIT actually holds Bitcoins in its own wallet. Figure 5 - BITX is expensive (Seeking Alpha) Alternatively, investors can also choose to invest in Bitcoins directly through a crypto-broker like Coinbase, or invest in crypto-related equities like MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) or MARA Holdings ( MARA ). Let's briefly discuss the pros and cons of the various options using the trailing 1-year return as a guide (Figure 6). Figure 6 - BITX vs. alternative Bitcoin investment options, trailing 1 year returns (Seeking Alpha) Options To Avoid BITO, as a futures-based ETF, suffers from 'contango decay' and should be avoided in my opinion. Bitcoin miners like MARA should also be avoided. Bitcoin miners' business model is constantly challenged by an arms-race against other Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin's codebase, which 'halves' the mining reward every ~18-24 months, leading to poor profitability for the miners. In fact, collectively, I do not believe any Bitcoin miners have cumulatively turned a profit for their shareholders. For example, MARA has lost a cumulative $568 million since its 2014, and it turned a profit in the past 12 months only on the revaluation of digital assets (Figure 7). Figure 7 - MARA has lost a cumulative $568 million since 2014 (Seeking Alpha) Options To Consider The IBIT ETF and other Bitcoin-based ETFs, closely track the returns of Bitcoin and can be considered by bullish investors. In the past year, the IBIT ETF returned 131%, the same as Bitcoin's 131% return less a small management fee. BITX, while it claims to offer 2x returns, actually delivered just 1.5x Bitcoin's return (194% vs. 131%), as 'contango decay' and 'volatility' decay ate into its returns. However, for those seeking 'leveraged' returns, it is an option to consider. MicroStrategy has been the most impressive, returning 661% compared to Bitcoin's 131%, or 5x the returns of Bitcoin, as the company has seemingly discovered a 'Bitcoin flywheel' that allows the company to constantly issue capital (both equity and debt) to buy Bitcoins for its treasury that increases the company's valuation. However, the issue I have with MSTR is that its shares trade at a 100% premium to its holdings of Bitcoins (Figure 8). Figure 8 - MSTR trades at a 100% premium to NAV (mstr-tracker.com) While MSTR's premium valuation can be sustained as long as investors continue to support its shares and Bitcoin remains in a bullish phase, MSTR shares are also vulnerable to sharp declines if Bitcoins suffers an extended correction. In fact, given its premium valuation, MSTR's shares may have a similar leveraged effect on the downside. For example, in the past month, as Bitcoin prices digest its gains made since the November election, MSTR has exhibited double the downside of Bitcoin (-10% vs. -5%) (Figure 9). Figure 9 - BITX vs. Bitcoin alternatives, trailing 1 month returns (Seeking Alpha) BITX and BITO returns have also been poor, returning -15% and -10% respectively in the past month, triple and double the declines of Bitcoin. MARA has been especially atrocious, as it has basically failed to participate in Bitcoin's rally in the past year but has delivered 5 times the decline in the past month. Risks To BITX The short-term risk to BITX and Bitcoin investments is President Trump's policies. A lot of expectation has been built up over the potential of the 'Bitcoin Reserve' and if President fails to deliver, BITX and Bitcoin prices could be in for a rude surprise. Conclusion In my opinion, for most investors, a simple Bitcoin ETF like IBIT should be more than sufficient for those who are bullish on Bitcoin, without the downsides of leverage or decay. I rate BITX a hold , given its significant contango and volatility decay, and prefer to buy the IBIT ETF instead to express my bullish view on Bitcoin.",BITX,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-17 03:42:00

Some of the best single month returns for Bitcoin have come in Februaries following halving years. 2024 was a halving year. On-chain data shows diminishing supply held via exchanges, and miner supply is also slowly trending lower. Miner share of volume also indicates upward price pressure is likely. While BITO will get dragged higher with Bitcoin in a sustained rally, it's not the best way to play Bitcoin longer term. A little over two months ago, I said I was buying the ""breakout shakeout"" in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) in an article covering the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) for Seeking Alpha. The performance since that call has been solid. The total return for BITO since that piece is nearly 40%. In a more recent piece , I gave some thoughts on the technical setup that I saw in the chart of Bitcoin near the beginning of January: Bitcoin's daily chart shows RSI divergences going back to November. The coin has also given back the 50 day moving average and appears poised to go below $90k per coin for the first time in nearly two months. While I still liked the potential for new price highs in BTC between now and the end of the year, I did see weakness in the chart that I felt foreshadowed sub-$90k BTC prices in the shorter term. We have since seen a very temporary breach of that $90k level and a quick 12% gain from those lows in just 2 days. In this article, we'll go over seasonality implications for Bitcoin as we approach February and look at some of the important supply/demand implications from the on-chain data. Seasonality Signals Before we get too far into this, take heed of the old investment adage that past performance does not guarantee future results. This is true in all investment forms and doubly true for the digital asset market. That said, I do think that seasonality trends can be helpful and, to a degree, self-reinforcing. February is typically a terrific month for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Seasonality, by month (TrendSpider) Over the last 11 years, the month of February has generated a positive return 73% of the time, and the mean return over that time is 10.6% in the month. After October, February has historically been the second best month of the year for BTC price returns. While January is more mixed, if we get more granular we can see that we're moving through what has historically been a rough patch to start the year: Bitcoin Seasonality, by week (TrendSpider) Week 2 has typically resulted in a negative week over the last 11 years. Weeks 3 and 4 are a bit more mixed, as they result in gains more often than not but have slightly negative mean changes. The details about February are what I find to be more useful: Year February Return 2012 (Halving Year) -11.7% 2013 54.9% 2016 (Halving Year) 18.5% 2017 21.5% 2020 (Halving Year) -8.2% 2021 36.0% 2024 (Halving Year) 44% Source: CryptoRank If we look at Bitcoin's February price appreciation following halving years, we see an average February return in those years of over 37%. The point is, February is historically a great month for BTC price returns and post-halving year February has typically been an exceptional month to be long Bitcoin. As I said at the beginning of this section, this does necessarily mean this year will be the same. There is perhaps an argument to be made that the approval of spot ETFs in the United States last year pulled forward expected gains for the 2024 halving cycle. February 2024 returned 44% in a halving year - this is not typical and is the kind of return that would be expected in a post-halving year. Cycle Date Price On Halving Cycle Top Price Days To Cycle Top 1st Halving Nov 28, 2012 $12.38 $1,191.55 366 2nd Halving Jul 9, 2016 $644.39 $19,310.77 525 3rd Halving May 11, 2020 $8,758.85 $72,500.92 1,402 4th Halving Apr 19, 2024 $62,549.72 $106,839.06 242 Source: IntoTheBlock Furthermore, the cycle top high from the 3rd halving took nearly the entire 4 years from the date of the 2020 block reward halving. While we've certainly had a new high already during this 4th halving epoch, we don't yet know if it is the high price for the cycle or not. I don't think we can rule out the possibility that the top is already in, but I'm personally of the view that the coin will make one more new high before a larger pullback. Signals From On-Chain Data While the long-term trend in on-chain activity has been disappointing when looking at metrics like daily active users, there are other figures that are headed in the right direction. For instance, monthly USD-denominated volume: Adjusted Monthly Volume (The Block) In December, Bitcoin's on-chain volume topped $2.2 trillion. This was certainly not a record for monthly volume, but it was a 125% improvement over December 2023 and a 73% improvement over volume from the last halving-year December (2020). Shifting to supply/demand dynamics, the aggregated exchange balance continues to decline: Bitcoin Exchange Balance (CoinGlass) As of January 15th, the BTC exchange balance was just 2.2 million, or 11% of the circulating supply. A year ago, the exchange balance was 2.7 million BTC. So even as more BTC has been mined into circulation over the last 12 months, the number of BTC held through centralized exchanges has gone down by 23%. A declining exchange balance has generally been viewed as a bullish signal and indicative of a holder base that doesn't plan to liquidate the asset. One of the primary sources of sell-pressure is Bitcoin miners: BTC Miner Supply (CoinMetrics) We've obviously seen more of a trend toward HODLing BTC even from many companies in the public equity markets . Despite that, miner supply of BTC has generally trended lower and is currently sitting at 1.8 million BTC. Miner volume share has started to plummet as well: Miners Volume Share (IntoTheBlock) So far in the month of January, miner volume share is averaging about 5%. Theoretically, the long term trend here should be down as more on-chain usage is from non-mining entities. When Bitcoin's price peaked back in November 2021, miner share fell down to just 1.3%. Like everything mentioned before, there is no rule that says the same thing has to happen again. But generally speaking, these metrics are all indicative of market expectations for higher prices. Supply is coming off exchanges, miner share of volume is plummeting, miner supply is at decade-lows, and on-chain volume is picking up steam. ProShares Bitcoin Strategy Despite the proliferation of spot ETFs that have entered the market over the last 12 months, BITO is still a very well capitalized fund at $2.5 billion. However, given the fund does utilize a futures-based strategy rather than a spot strategy, it is more expensive to play Bitcoin this way over longer periods of time. The 0.95% expense ratio is closer to parity with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) at 1.5% than it is the iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) at 0.25% 1 Year Price Return (Seeking Alpha) Unsurprisingly, the total return in BITO has lagged that of both IBIT and the underlying asset. For that reason, I'm not a fan of BITO as a long term investment relative to spot funds. However, I do think Bitcoin has more room to run higher this year and in the event BTC rips to new highs, the coin will drag BITO up with it. Final Takeaways 2024 was a monster year for Bitcoin, both from a price appreciation standpoint and an investor demand standpoint. To be sure, there have been key differences in this halving epoch compared to previous halving cycles. There is certainly no guarantee any of this means the price of Bitcoin has to continue higher. As investors and traders, the best we can do is make a judgement based on numerous pieces of information. From where I sit, there are positive signs in the supply/demand dynamics of Bitcoin; exchange balance continues to decline and miner share of volume is falling quickly. Miners have even flipped from sellers to buyers. Beyond that, February has historically been a terrific month for BTC price returns - particularly in post-halving years, and 2025 is a post-halving year. It's absolutely possible we've already seen the price high for this cycle, but I'm betting we get one more large move higher before the deeper pullback in BTC. I'm reiterating BITO as a 'buy' purely on the belief the fund will move with Bitcoin. But there are better ways to get exposure to BTC with a longer-term perspective.",BTC-USD|BITO,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-17 03:57:00
