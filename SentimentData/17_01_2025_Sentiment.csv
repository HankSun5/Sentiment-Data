Citing an article published by Axios on Wednesday, the report detailed Trump's comments during a meeting with representatives of an unnamed company. Trump allegedly said, “You made this much money last year and you're going to make a lot more now because of me… But where were you when I needed you? You weren't with me and maybe you were with Kamala Harris.” Two sources told Unchained that the company Trump was referring to was Ripple. While the Axios report did not mention Ripple by name or specify when the alleged conversation took place, it noted that Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen had previously donated millions of dollars to political action committees (PACs) supporting Harris. Related News: What's the Latest on the XRP Big Bull? Why Has XRP Price Increased? Ripple Labs has not released a statement in response to the allegations, and a spokesperson for the company declined to comment on whether Ripple is indeed the firm not mentioned in the Axios report. Similarly, Trump’s transition team did not respond to questions on the matter. This development highlights Trump’s continued scrutiny of companies and individuals he believes do not support him politically. Whether this will impact Ripple’s position in the crypto space or the ongoing regulatory battles remains to be seen. *This is not investment advice.

Toncoin whale activity has significantly increased, with transactions above $100,000 growing steadily in the last 24 hours. In parallel, Chainlink (LINK) continues to turn heads with a promising forecast, potentially reaching up to $366.22 by 2031. For those seeking the best long-term crypto, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out. The project is on a strong path toward reaching its $600 million goal, driven by its exciting partnership with Inter Milan, one of the most recognized football clubs in the world. The popularity of BlockDAG is growing rapidly, and the platform is getting ready to launch on 10 major centralized exchanges. These moves position BlockDAG as one of the most exciting prospects in the crypto space today. Toncoin Whale Activity Signals Strategic Moves While many cryptocurrencies face pressure from the market, Toncoin (TON) has displayed remarkable strength. A significant increase in whale activity partly drives this resilience. Over the past 24 hours, Toncoin’s whale transactions have surged by 94%, totalling an impressive $8.21 billion. These high-value transactions, often exceeding $100,000, indicate that TON whales might be accumulating or redistributing their holdings, possibly preparing for future gains. Despite the market’s fluctuations, Toncoin remains sensitive to larger economic factors such as investor sentiment and regulatory shifts, which could influence its future growth. Chainlink Price Prediction Points to Long-Term Potential Chainlink’s potential remains strong as decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology continue to grow. The platform’s integrations with major networks like Ethereum, Avalanche, and Arbitrum only add to its utility and relevance in the market. Chainlink’s price prediction shows a promising future, with the coin potentially reaching $37.83 by 2025, $116.57 by 2028, and up to $366.22 by 2031. While the current market is experiencing some volatility, recent whale activity points to a continued belief in Chainlink’s long-term growth. Still, short-term fluctuations and broader market pressures require careful attention. BlockDAG’s Road to $600M: Big Listings & Power Partnerships Ahead! Toncoin and Chainlink are drawing attention for their potential, but BlockDAG is swiftly becoming a top contender for those seeking a long-term crypto asset. So, what’s driving this momentum? BlockDAG combines cutting-edge technology with consistent growth and strategic partnerships, with one of the most notable being its collaboration with Inter Milan. This partnership has significantly raised BlockDAG’s global profile, introducing the project to millions of new potential buyers through high-profile events and social media campaigns. The influence of Inter Milan has not only enhanced BlockDAG’s visibility but also directly contributed to the success of its presale. To date, BlockDAG has raised over $181 million, with more than 17.9 billion BDAG coins sold. The current price for BDAG has surged to $0.0248, a dramatic increase from its initial offering of $0.001. Additionally, the presale has raised $6.2 million through miner sales, with over 15,400 miners now part of the community. With this strong momentum, BlockDAG is well on its way to meeting its $600 million presale target. This exciting trajectory will continue, especially with the planned launch of 10 major centralized exchanges. For anyone looking to get involved in a promising crypto project, now is an excellent time to jump in, as prices are expected to rise rapidly with growing demand. Achieve Financial Success with Top Long-Term Crypto With all the activity in the market, it’s clear that now is a critical time for crypto enthusiasts. Toncoin’s whale activity hints at a strong future, while Chainlink’s price forecast indicates long-term value. Yet, the real story may be BlockDAG. Thanks to its solid growth and partnership with Inter Milan, BlockDAG is becoming one of the most attractive options for long-term crypto buyers. As it nears its $600 million target, the opportunity to secure BDAG coins at today’s prices is closing quickly.

This success reflects substantial interest and has given participants a return potential of over 2380% since the first batch. BlockDAG’s collaboration with HackerEarth is part of a larger plan. This partnership aims to position BlockDAG as a central platform for developers, creators, and blockchain fans by conducting global hackathons that develop real-world uses and ensure lasting growth. Global Hackathons: A Key Move for BlockDAG These upcoming hackathons are crucial to BlockDAG’s plan to build a strong and active ecosystem. Through its partnership with HackerEarth, BlockDAG will organize four major global hackathons involving 10,000 to 15,000 developers. The focus is on attracting skilled teams to create decentralized applications on the network, targeting sectors such as DeFi, governance, and infrastructure.

This approach helps maintain a continuous flow of new ideas, providing developers the resources and motivation to implement their projects on BlockDAG’s scalable, decentralized platform. For those involved in the presale, these hackathons represent a commitment to building a robust ecosystem, not merely selling coins. Why Developer Engagement is Crucial for BlockDAG BlockDAG recognizes the importance of a dynamic developer community for the adoption of blockchain technology. The hackathons aim to draw developers by offering them the necessary resources to excel. With HackerEarth’s platform, which boasts a 7.6 million-strong community, BlockDAG connects with top-tier talent. For developers, these hackathons are more than just coding events; they are gateways to becoming integral parts of a blockchain network with significant real-world impact. For presale participants, the hackathons provide reassurance that BlockDAG values creation over mere speculation. The applications and projects developed are expected to increase the practical utility of BDAG coins, benefiting early backers. Record-Breaking Presale: Jump in Before it Ends! The BlockDAG presale offers a unique chance for individuals to be part of a project with a proactive future vision. Coins are reasonably priced at $0.0248 during the ongoing 27th batch, with significant growth potential. By the time results from the hackathons materialize early backers could see their stakes appreciate as BDAG coin demand rises. With over $181 million raised and presale incentives like the LAUNCH300, which provides a 300% bonus on purchases, the timing is ideal. Participants get to solidify their roles not just as observers but as active contributors to the ecosystem’s development. Looking Forward BlockDAG’s strategy to merge a successful presale with developer-centered innovations is unique in the blockchain sphere. The project does more than just offer coins—it builds a community where developers and early backers can prosper together. The presale is an entry point for enthusiasts, and the hackathons are set to deliver applications that will boost the network’s worth.

After dropping to a low of $168, SOL surged over 22% to reach $207, signaling renewed strength and bullish momentum. This impressive recovery has reignited optimism among investors and analysts alike, many of whom now anticipate a swift recovery and a potential bullish rally. Related Reading: Cardano Whales Go On A Shopping Spree – 100 Million ADA in 48 Hours Top analyst Jelle has shared a compelling technical analysis, highlighting that the “Solana season” may be on the verge of a major comeback. According to Jelle, Solana’s recent price movements indicate a significant shift in market structure. The downtrend appears to have flipped, with key resistance levels now acting as support. This critical development could pave the way for further upside in the coming days. As Solana continues to lead the charge among altcoins, its ability to maintain and build upon this momentum will be closely watched. With analysts predicting a strong recovery and investors eyeing new opportunities, all eyes are on SOL to see if it can sustain this bullish trajectory and reclaim its status as a top-performing asset in the market. Bullish Breakout And Sentiment Shifts Solana has shown remarkable strength in recent days, pushing above critical supply levels after enduring weeks of selling pressure. While the broader market remains volatile, Solana has managed to inspire confidence among investors and analysts, thanks to its steady climb. However, the asset still faces a significant challenge: reclaiming the local high around $220. Achieving this milestone could set the stage for a bullish rally into uncharted price territory. Top analyst Jelle recently shared an optimistic technical analysis on X, emphasizing the dramatic shift in Solana’s market structure. According to Jelle, the downtrend that defined Solana’s recent performance has officially flipped, with key resistance levels now acting as solid support. This critical development is a bullish signal for Solana’s prospects, reinforcing the idea that the asset is nearing the end of its consolidation phase. Jelle highlighted that one final hurdle remains before Solana can enter price discovery: breaking decisively above the $220 mark. If bulls can overcome this obstacle, the potential for a massive rally becomes highly likely. The sentiment surrounding Solana is increasingly positive, with many investors echoing Jelle’s sentiment that “Solana season” is on the horizon.

With bullish momentum picking up, Solana is positioned to challenge higher resistance levels in the coming days. The immediate target for bulls is reclaiming the $222 mark, a significant level that could determine the trajectory of Solana’s next move. Successfully breaking above this price and converting it into support would confirm the continuation of the bullish trend. This would also set the stage for Solana to target its all-time high (ATH), a psychological milestone for both traders and long-term investors. Related Reading: Chainlink Weekly Chart Looks Promising – If Bulls Reclaim $30 ‘ATH Are Next’ Analysts suggest that once Solana crosses the $222 level, the surge to ATH could happen rapidly. Market sentiment remains optimistic, with many participants expecting Solana to lead a new wave of upward momentum in the altcoin space. If the price continues to hold key support levels and bulls maintain control, Solana is poised to regain its status as one of the market’s top-performing assets. For now, all eyes are on $222 as the next critical step in Solana’s bullish journey.

Musk Saves California (MUSKCALI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKCALI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Saves California can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Saves California could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Saves California launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Saves California on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Saves California by entering its contract address – 2mtzeaYqDPLtCemX5jNPuuq8jw65cbgNUXuT3fBra2M2 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCALI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-16 23:03:00

The price of XRP surged to $3.20 on Jan. 15, marking a seven-year high, before retreating slightly to $3.09 as of 8:45 a.m. UTC on Jan. 16. CoinMarketCap data shows XRP gained over 32% in the past week. This rally occurred despite the SEC’s appeal filed on Jan. 15. The agency seeks to overturn a July 2023 decision by District Judge Analisa Torres, which ruled that XRP sales to retail investors were not unregistered securities. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, noted that XRP’s price momentum is largely due to Ripple Labs’ partial legal victories and growing investor optimism about regulatory clarity. “XRP’s surge can be attributed to favorable outcomes in Ripple’s SEC lawsuit and a more crypto-friendly political climate in the US. If regulatory uncertainties are resolved, the influx of institutional investors could further solidify XRP’s position in the crypto market,” Lee told Cointelegraph . RippleNet’s expanding adoption has also strengthened XRP’s appeal in the market, Lee added. Investor confidence is rising ahead of US President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20. His administration is expected to provide greater regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies and consider the Bitcoin Act, aimed at establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the US economy. Looking ahead, an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) could serve as a major price catalyst in 2025. JPMorgan estimates that an approved XRP ETF could attract $3 billion to $6 billion in net new investments, similar to Ether ETFs. Some analysts predict XRP could surpass $14, supported by technical indicators like a bullish pennant formation.

But while this could see BTC prices swell to $120,000, a “correction” could also see Bitcoin dip back to the $80,000 mark.

Dudchenko said there was “still a possibility that the price of Bitcoin will rise again” in the near future.

The only question is this: Will the wave be sparked by a deeper correction in BTC/USD, or will it begin in the very near future?” Nikolai Dudchenko, analyst at Russian financial/media group Finam Cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX has been fined $100 million for violating the federal Bank Secrecy Act by failing to adequately police money laundering, the DOJ said https://t.co/9hUmB2w2TD pic.twitter.com/nwZpcLD9gD — Reuters Legal (@ReutersLegal) January 15, 2025 The Trump Factor Dudchenko added that if a “correction” does take place, this could see the price of Bitcoin drop to $80,000. But should the price instead rise again in the short term, the expert said that the “nearest target for possible growth” was the $120,000 mark. Dudchenko suggested that a range of factors could affect Bitcoin prices’ imminent “sharp” growth or fall.

Dudchenko said that Bitcoin is currently “consolidating in the range of $90,000 to $100,000.” However, he warned that “volatility” was likely during Trump’s inauguration period, with the market braced for developments. Source: Dune/@21co Dudchenko said that market watchers would be wise to recall that “the reason for the fall in the price of Bitcoin at the end of December 2024” was a speech from the head of the US Federal Reserve System Jerome Powell. Powell argued against the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve. However, on January 16, the New York Post said that Trump was “receptive” to the idea of building strategic reserves.

XRP surged to $3.33 on Thursday after a New York Post report that President-elect Donald Trump is receptive to the idea of a US-based crypto reserve, comprising assets like XRP and Solana. 🇺🇸 BREAKING: Trump considers US-based crypto reserve, potentially prioritizing coins like Solana and $XRP . pic.twitter.com/Lwix7XGrHx — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) January 16, 2025 This comes on the heels of other reports stating that Donald Trump’s SEC could pause all crypto enforcement actions, essentially confirming that the agency could drop or settle its lawsuit against XRP’s parent company, Ripple. Is It Too Late To Buy XRP? XRP is undoubtedly the strongest large-cap cryptocurrency on the market. It is not without any reason the XRP/BTC ratio is up by 33% over the past week and 42% over the past month, despite the Bitcoin price trading at $100,000. With Donald Trump set to take oath on January 20th, experts are wondering whether there could be any mention of Ripple or a US crypto reserve in his inaugural speech. It is dubious whether the US Congress will approve a crypto reserve including volatile altcoins like Solana and XRP. Experts aren’t even convinced about the possibility of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, with Polymarket betters giving it only a 48% chance. This level of support from an incoming President could position XRP as a top choice for institutional investors. Moreover, the incoming SEC — led by pro-crypto Paul Atkins — has already benefitted Ripple. The XRP price breached the crucial $2.90 resistance level after reports that the agency could pause all crypto enforcement actions, hinting that the Ripple-SEC lawsuit is all but over. Basically, $XRP no longer a security! https://t.co/aZDtQdR8hp — Ali (@ali_charts) January 15, 2025 The new Commission could also approve a spot XRP ETF, which JPMorgan analysts believe could add up to $8 billion to XRP’s market cap in the first year alone. However, a few bulls have started to take profits, suggesting that it may now be too late to buy XRP. For instance, prominent trader Crypto Tony reveals he secured some profits at $3.1, even as he expects the token to rally to $3.84. $XRP / $USD - Update Played out perfect. I have shed some profit here. pic.twitter.com/JuUWqRPLul — Crypto Tony (@CryptoTony__) January 16, 2025 Another prominent analyst Crypto Prime reveals that he will close his current long position at $3.40. It would now be prudent for sidelined investors to wait for an XRP dip before scaling into long positions. Nevertheless, it does remain an excellent long-term investment, with many now expecting it to peak at $10 in 2025. Are AI Agent Coins The Best Crypto To Buy Now? While XRP’s current bull rally may be reaching a point of exhaustion, AI agent coins don’t appear to be running out of steam any time soon. VIRTUAL, AI16Z and AIXBT continue to extend their gains, while a new AI agent crypto Moby reached a $100 million market cap in 3 days. Another new AI meme coin — Mind of Pepe (MIND) — has raised over $1.5 million on day one of its ICO, signalling high upside potential. Mind of Pepe is a self-evolving, self-sovereign AI agent, with self-managed X and Telegram accounts as well as a crypto wallet. $MIND holders will soon receive real-time market intelligence, alpha trading strategies and sentiment and technical analysis, thanks to cutting-edge AI tech and community intelligence. They may even receive discounted access to new crypto coins that Mind of Pepe launches. MIND also has its own staking pool, a feature missing in many AI meme coins. Early buyers are already generating significant passive income, currently at an APY of over 1000%. Considering the strong latent demand for new AI meme coins, it is no surprise that experts are calling Mind of Pepe the next 10x crypto.

Is Now the Right Time to Invest in XRP? XRP stands out as the most robust among large-cap cryptocurrencies. It's no surprise that the XRP/BTC ratio has increased by 33% this past week and 42% over the last month, even as Bitcoin's price sits at $100,000. As Donald Trump prepares to be sworn in on January 20th, analysts are speculating whether Ripple or a US crypto reserve might be mentioned in his inaugural address. It's uncertain if the US Congress would endorse a crypto reserve that includes volatile altcoins like Solana and XRP. Many experts remain skeptical about a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, with bets from Polymarket giving it just a 48% likelihood. Such support from a new President could make XRP an attractive option for institutional investors. Additionally, the incoming SEC, led by crypto-friendly Paul Atkins, has already positively impacted Ripple.

This activity is a precursor to potential price increases, as whales tend to accumulate assets when they expect upward momentum. Whales Accumulate 200M DOGE as Dogecoin Price Targets $3 According to analyst Ali Martinez, whales have added 200 million DOGE to their holdings within 48 hours, signaling strong bullish sentiment. Whale accumulation often reflects confidence in the asset’s potential, particularly in anticipation of market movements. This activity has fueled optimism for Dogecoin potential to break past key resistance levels. Source: X Dogecoin price currently holds above the critical $0.36 resistance, indicating a possible upward trajectory. If the bullish trend continues, analysts suggest the price may rise to $0.40 or higher, backed by growing market interest and whale activity. Similarly, a recent DOGE price prediction suggested the possibility of a rally to $3 as early as January, citing Fibonacci retracement patterns and historical trends. With Dogecoin currently trading around $0.37, this projection suggests an 8x rally fueled by growing market momentum. Analysts highlight the January 20 inauguration and meme coin activity as potential catalysts for a breakout. Key Resistance Levels and Path to $3 Dogecoin price must overcome immediate resistance at $0.4007 to sustain its bullish momentum. Analysts believe breaking this level could open the path to $0.45, with potential gains beyond this mark driven by leveraged long positions. However, failure to hold above $0.35 may lead to profit-taking or the liquidation of leveraged positions. Historical patterns also support the bullish outlook. The current 46% correction in Dogecoin price mirrors its January 2021 setup, which preceded a significant bull run. If the pattern repeats, Dogecoin may be gearing up for a similar breakout, with a rally targeting $3. Source: X Bullish Sentiment Fueled by Broader Market Recovery The broader crypto market recovery has further strengthened bullish sentiment for Dogecoin. Rising daily trading volumes, which have increased by 18% to surpass $4 billion, suggest growing retail and institutional interest. Other market analysts have also supported the bullish outlook for Dogecoin , highlighting the double bottom pattern as a key reversal signal. Technical indicators like Chaikin Money Flow and RSI suggest further upward potential, provided DOGE holds critical support levels. At press time, Dogecoin is trading at $0.3769, reflecting a 17% gain over the past week. The market cap stands at $55.64 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $4.19 billion, up by 7%.

At the meeting, the ETH developers finalized the timeline for the upgrade launch following months of active deliberations. A Galaxy Research executive, Christine Kim, shared the call summary with the community. Ethereum Pectra Upgrade: When Launch? The developers agreed to launch the upgrade early to mid-March. They also agreed on a new set of schedules, including January 20 or 30 for the next ACDE calls. At this meeting, the block number for the upgrade and the exact date and time will be agreed upon. The developers must decide on the new client releases for the Pectra upgrade by February 3. The Sepolia Fork will occur on February 12, and Holesky will follow seven days later. As noted, the mainnet fork will come by early to mid-March. However, this depends on whether nothing derails the plan. the proposed schedule is: jan 23 or jan 30, on next few acd calls finalize block number, exact date/time, for upgrades feb 3, publish new client releases for the upgrade by this date ~feb 12, sepolia fork ~feb 19, holesky fork early to mid march, mainnet fork — Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) January 16, 2025 As Christine Kim highlighted, Ethereum developers are not planning to launch another devnet for the upgrade. This is why they are improvising with a shadow fork of Sepolia and/or Holesky testnets. Recall the developers launched the Mekong testnet last year for the pectra upgrade. Overall, she said bugs in code might shift the timeline considerably. However, she noted that the odds of a March launch remain high after today’s call. What is Special About Pectra? It is worth noting that this upgrade is the biggest after the Dencun Upgrade that lowered fees on Layer-2 protocols. The Pectra upgrade complements this enhancement with scalability and security. Once launched, it will introduce innovative features that optimize transaction speeds. With new features like account abstraction and EVM Object Format (EOF) enhancements in EIP-7692, the upgrade will benefit users and developers alike. After Pectra, Coingape highlighted that the Fusaka upgrade is next for the ETH developers. However, the timeline of the schedule for this next upgrade remains unclear at this time. Aiding the ETH L2 Ecosystem The ongoing series of upgrades in the Ethereum ecosystem is designed to enhance Layer-2 scaling solutions. Notably, these L2 protocols welcome more innovations than the Ethereum blockchain, so they may be the biggest beneficiaries of these upgrades. As reported earlier, Tether has launched USDT0 , its new stablecoin on Ink, the L2 solution launched by Kraken. This next wave of innovations might benefit more from the enhanced developer experience that Pectra and Fusaka will introduce in the coming months.

Elon Bromance (ELOBRO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOBRO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Bromance can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Bromance could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Bromance launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Bromance on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Bromance by entering its contract address – FY7aYv7K3yEE9Z8hzgURj5z7biTE8Z6BpunBPAnCEpxj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELOBRO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-17 00:24:00

Tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu paved the way, showing that a fun concept could translate into serious financial gain.

Launched as an alternative for Bitcoin in 2011, the cryptocurrency draws much interest among analysts and investors alike. Canary Capital has made a significant step forward in its quest for a Litecoin ETF. The company recently filed an amendment to its S-1 registration form with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, a move that industry experts interpret as a sign of ongoing discussions with the regulatory body. Related Reading: Expert Sees Bitcoin Dipping To $50K While Bullish Momentum Persists For market watchers and crypto aficionados alike, this development has spurred a great ounce of optimism. Considered as a good indication of possible approval, the revised filing indicates that the SEC has responded on Canary’s application. Analysts Comment On Litecoin ETF Approval Prospects Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg has publicly expressed his opinion that the “most likely” contender for the next spot crypto ETF approval is a Litecoin ETF. This prediction has gained traction in the crypto community. Balchunas does, however, also recognize the uncertainties the forthcoming shift in SEC leadership brings. Though the date of his Senate confirmation is yet unknown, the choice of former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins—considered crypto-friendly—by President-elect Donald Trump has spurred hope even further. We had heard chatter that the Litecoin S-1 had gotten comments back from SEC. This looks to confirm that which bodes well for our prediction that Litecoin is most likely to be the next coin approved. All that said, new SEC chair has yet to start and that’s a huge variable. https://t.co/cKFswPwcr0 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 15, 2025 James Seyffart, another Bloomberg ETF expert, said that the change could mean that the SEC has given feedback on the application. NEW: @CanaryFunds just filed an amended S-1 for their Litecoin ETF filing. No guarantees — but this might be indicative of SEC engagement on the filing. Still no 19b-4 filing yet though (A 19b-4 would actually start the potential approval/denial clock) h/t @isabelletanlee pic.twitter.com/wFtNOmbmYx — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 15, 2025 Investor Activity & Market Reaction A Litecoin ETF promises to set off a major market reaction.

Implications For The Crypto Market If approved, a Litecoin ETF would represent a big milestone for the digital currency. Litecoin would then join Bitcoin and Ethereum as the only cryptocurrencies with US-approved spot ETFs, strengthening its market position.

The proposal aims to reduce inflation. SIMD-0228 introduces a market-oriented solution that fluctuates based on the staking participation rate, which is calculated by dividing the amount of staked SOL. Assuming the staking participation rate falls below the recommended target of 50%, new token issuance will increase to reward stakers and validators and secure the network. In reverse, if the participation rate exceeds the target rate, token issuance is restricted, and the inflationary rate is cap-capped to limit the rate at which new tokens are minted. Tokenomics and inflation continue to challenge distributed cryptocurrency networks, sparking ongoing debates about the best incentive models. Solana validators approve proposal to redirect priority fees Mid-last year, Solana validators voted to approve another proposal, SIMD-0096, which removed the 50% burn mechanism for validator priority fees over the network and allowed 100% of the fees to be allocated to block producers. This proposal aimed to improve incentives around how validators receive priority fees, helping with network security. SIMD-0096 was expected to eliminate possible side deals between block producers and transaction submitters, improving incentives within the validator system. The original proposal stated . This ensures that validators are appropriately incentivized to prioritize network security and efficiency, rather than being incentivized to engage in potentially detrimental side deals . SIMD-0096 proposal Critics of the proposal warned that removing the protocol’s 50% fee-burning mechanism to incentivize validators would raise SOL’s inflation rate. This inflation would benefit validators; however, SOL holders who choose not to stake could face the negative effects of inflation eroding their holdings. Though the proposal received a 77% approval rate, SIMD-0096 has not yet been implemented on the Solana mainnet at the time of this writing. 65% of SOL is staked, with Jito’s MEV rewards exceeding $100 million Data from StakingRewards shows that approximately 65% of SOL’s circulating supply is currently staked. Jito — a Solana-based maximal extractable value (MEV) block-building solution — surpassed $100 million in tips in December 2024, offering an additional income stream for validators. The advocates of adjusting Solana’s token emissions argue that validator rewards gained through maximal extractable value are sufficient incentives for validators to secure the network. According to proponents, these MEV-based incentives reduce the necessity of allocating 100% of priority fees to network validators and are considered preferable to the risk of increasing SOL’s inflation rate.

The surge in large transactions of over $100,000 in the past 24 hours signals key moves by Toncoin holders. In addition, Chainlink (LINK) continues attracting positive attention, with forecasts showing it could reach $366.22 by 2031. However, BlockDAG (BDAG) is leading the charge for those seeking the best long-term crypto options. With over $181 million raised, BlockDAG is making significant strides toward its $600 million goal. Its ongoing partnership with Inter Milan, a world-renowned football club, is creating a surge in interest, further propelling its success. As BlockDAG gains global recognition, plans are in motion to list the project on 10 major centralized exchanges. This sets the stage for BlockDAG to challenge the expectations of the crypto market, becoming one of the top choices for investors seeking long-term opportunities. Toncoin Whale Activity Signals Strategic Moves Despite broader market pressure, Toncoin (TON) has shown resilience, driven by an impressive surge in whale activity. On-chain data reveals a 94% increase in large transactions, totaling $8.21 billion in just 24 hours. These high-value transactions suggest that whales either accumulate or redistribute their holdings, potentially positioning themselves for future gains. The rise in whale activity comes amid broader market conditions that have caused liquidations worth $482 million. However, Toncoin continues to stand out as a stable force in the market, with these strategic moves signaling a strong outlook for the future. While Toncoin’s future remains linked to factors like market sentiment and regulatory shifts, its resilience in the face of current conditions makes it a crypto worth watching. Chainlink Price Prediction: Long-Term Outlook Strong Chainlink’s integration with major blockchain platforms like Ethereum, Avalanche, and Arbitrum has reinforced its role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain ecosystems. These partnerships position Chainlink as a key player in improving decentralized applications, solidifying its market position. Price predictions for Chainlink suggest a promising trajectory, with potential highs of $37.83 by 2025, $116.57 by 2028, and up to $366.22 by 2031. Despite short-term market fluctuations, recent whale activity, with large accumulations of LINK, indicates confidence in its long-term value. While Chainlink faces short-term volatility, it remains a crucial asset in the evolving DeFi space. Strategic Moves for BlockDAG: Reaching $600M with Partnerships and Listing While Toncoin and Chainlink generate discussion with their respective forecasts, all attention is now on BlockDAG, which is rapidly emerging as one of the best long-term crypto options. The driving force behind this success is BlockDAG’s robust technology, steady growth, and strategic alliances. BlockDAG’s ongoing partnership with Inter Milan has expanded its global reach, connecting the project with millions of football fans worldwide. This alliance has played a key role in introducing new buyers to BlockDAG, thanks to high-profile events and campaigns bringing global attention to the project. BlockDAG’s presale has reached an impressive $181 million, with over 17.9 billion coins sold. Early participants have seen substantial returns, as the price has surged from $0.001 in the first presale batch to $0.0248 in the current batch 27. Demand is growing, and with the current presale nearing its conclusion, the opportunity to acquire BDAG coins at a low price is quickly closing. As BlockDAG’s presale grows, the project is pushing closer to its $600 million target. Its upcoming debut on 10 centralized exchanges will provide the visibility needed for even greater success. Buyers continue to flock to BlockDAG, recognizing its potential for explosive growth and positioning it as one of the most exciting long-term crypto opportunities on the market today. Build Lasting Wealth with the Best Crypto The cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, with notable movements from Toncoin and Chainlink generating discussion. Toncoin’s whale activity highlights potential accumulation, while Chainlink’s forecast indicates strong growth over the next decade. Despite short-term price volatility, many are turning to BlockDAG for its consistent growth and strong financial potential. The project’s partnership with Inter Milan has significantly increased its rising demand, bringing it closer to the $600 million milestone. BlockDAG’s presale is nearing its end, and as it prepares to list on 10 major centralized exchanges, now is the time to secure BDAG coins. This is a rare opportunity to join a crypto project set to redefine the market. With the right foundation and continued global exposure, BlockDAG is positioning itself as one of the best long-term crypto options.

Toncoin is facing tough market conditions that have people worried about its future. At the same time, Shiba Inu is delighting the crypto crowd with a special event where it gives away its new TREAT coin, aiming to get more people using its services. Meanwhile, the e-commerce platform Web3Bay , with its token 3BAY, has gathered an impressive $730K in its presale, showing strong trust from investors. Such advancements reflect the intense, high-reward potential of the leading cryptocurrencies in the market. Toncoin’s Price Stability: Examining Support and Resistance Levels Toncoin is currently navigating its price around a critical $5.00 support, with its price wavering under a $6.00 resistance level. This limited movement suggests a sideways market trend, with a possible rise to $7.00 if it stays above the $5.00 mark. If Toncoin falls below this critical support, it risks dropping to lower levels at $4.78 or $4.50. With its current price at $5.34, many are watching closely, considering what could happen next in the market—a vital moment for Toncoin’s near-term price movement. Shiba Inu’s Exciting TREAT Token Airdrop Shiba Inu is making headlines with the rollout of its TREAT token airdrop, gaining significant interest from the investment world. This important move, involving key exchanges like KuCoin, Gate.io, and Bitget, aims to boost usage and improve liquidity for Shiba Inu’s soon-to-launch stablecoin. The steps to join in the airdrop—such as setting up an account and verifying identities—are carefully crafted to guarantee a safe and fair distribution, ramping up enthusiasm and participation among investors. This effort marks a critical step in incorporating TREAT into Shiba Inu’s extensive network, solidifying its status as a leading cryptocurrency. What Makes Web3Bay Stand Out & How Early Birds Can Reap 6,430%? Web3Bay is gaining traction by eliminating traditional intermediaries like banks and payment processors, drastically reducing transaction fees and increasing transparency for all participants. This platform is leading a shift in the decentralized online shopping sector by leveraging blockchain technology to challenge established retail models. At the core of Web3Bay’s strategy is its unique token, 3BAY, which is vital to its ecosystem. This token facilitates smooth transactions, offering both purchasing ease and significant governance rights to its holders. These rights include voting on key platform updates, accessing exclusive deals, and earning rewards, which cultivate a robust community feel. Web3Bay is currently conducting a vigorous presale for the 3BAY token, having already raised over $730K. This presale features a tiered pricing structure, starting at $0.003 and potentially rising to $0.1959, designed to benefit early backers significantly. This pricing reflects the platform’s ambitious growth plans and suggests a potential return on investment that could surpass 6430% for initial investors. As blockchain continues to integrate into various sectors, Web3Bay’s strategic placement at the crossroads of blockchain and e-commerce makes it a strong competitor in the market. The success of its ongoing presale indicates solid confidence and enthusiasm for its model, which aims to offer a fairer and more transparent shopping experience. By merging blockchain’s efficiency with essential e-commerce features, Web3Bay is not just participating in the market—it’s actively transforming it. As blockchain technology expands its influence, Web3Bay’s innovative positioning makes it a key player in redefining e-commerce and a top crypto coin right now in the crypto market. Final Thoughts As we move through 2025, the differing fortunes of Toncoin, Shiba Inu, and Web3Bay paint a vivid picture of the crypto field. Toncoin’s struggles with market swings contrast with Shiba Inu’s popular airdrop and Web3Bay’s successful presale. These stories show that innovation and community involvement are crucial to standing out in the crypto space, hinting at the resilience and growth potential of these platforms as they aim to become top crypto coins in the crypto market.

In a new strategy session, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 108,000 followers on the social media platform X that payments altcoin XRP is forming a bull pennant pattern. A bull pennant pattern is a continuation pattern where a period of consolidation is often followed by a breakout. “XRP has one of the most bullish setups in crypto right now after the recent retest of the breakout zone!” Source: Ali Martinez/X He also says XRP may soar to $10, an increase of more than 217% from its current value, as crypto whales are buying massive amounts of the token. “XRP is in the middle of a massive bullish breakout… On-chain data reveals that whales have been heavily accumulating XRP. In the last week alone, they’ve purchased over 1.10 billion XRP. This buying pressure is building momentum. XRP has broken out of a bull pennant, a classic bullish pattern. If the buying pressure continues, it could help propel XRP to $10.” XRP is trading for $3.15 at time of writing, up 18.2% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the analyst says that Ethereum ( ETH ) layer-2 scaling solution Polygon ( MATIC ) is gearing up for a massive move in either direction as it consolidates within a descending triangle. “Polygon is on the verge of a 40% move! All we have to do is wait for a sustained close outside of the $0.47 to $0.41 range to determine the direction of the breakout.” Source: Ali Martinez/X MATIC is trading for $0.48 at time of writing, up 7.1% in the last 24 hours. Next, he suggests Ethena ( ENA ), a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum, may have avoided a severe correction after surging to reclaim a key support level within a trading range with $1.03 as the upper bound and $0.85 as the lower bound. “Ethena appears to have broken out of a parallel channel! Failing to reclaim $0.86 as support could trigger a price correction toward $0.69 or $0.57.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Ethena is trading for $0.94 at time of writing, up 14.1% in the last 24 hours. Lastly, he suggests layer-1 protocol Algorand ( ALGO ) is now in a bullish trend after breaking out of the upper trendline of a symmetrical triangle on the four-hour chart. Symmetrical triangle patterns can either be bullish or bearish – bullish if the price breaks out above the upper trend line and bearish if the price breaks down below the lower trend line. “ALGO is poised for a potential 60% breakout! A decisive close outside the $0.39-$0.32 range will set the direction of the trend.” Source: Ali Martinez/X ALGO is trading for $0.44 at time of writing up 20.3% in the last 24 hours.

Smart Traders Pivot to RCOF to Get a 19,090% Upside",https://timestabloid.com/cardano-and-the-xrp-price-close-to-their-peaks-smart-traders-pivot/,"The XRP price has been a focal point for investors, especially with its recent climb towards what many consider to be its peak performance. However, as both Cardano and XRP hover near their highs, savvy traders are looking beyond these established cryptocurrencies towards RCO Finance (RCOF) , which promises an astounding upside with its presale currently in the spotlight. Cardano and XRP Price Movements Capture Investors’ Attention Market data from CoinGecko shows Cardano (ADA) experiencing a surge. The price has risen by 8.24% in the last 24 hours and is trading at $1. Cardano has shown resilience and growth, particularly with developments like the upcoming Plomin hard fork, which aims to enhance network performance. On the other hand, XRP has also seen a significant uptick, rising 7.68% to trade at $2.52. However, despite these gains, investors have a sense of caution due to potential bearish momentum for XRP, with critical support levels near $2.00 being closely watched. Also, while on an upward trajectory, Cardano has faced an 8.98% weekly decline, suggesting that while both cryptocurrencies are close to their recent peaks, the market’s volatility could lead to rapid changes. These developments have led some to question the sustainability of these highs, pushing investors to explore alternative opportunities. Investors Turn to RCO Finance for Post-Presale Returns With Cardano and XRP showing signs of peaking or stabilizing, investors are turning their attention to RCO Finance’s presale . Currently, in its fourth presale stage, the RCOF token has already seen a dramatic increase of 509% from its initial price to $0.0777. Once the presale comes to an end, the token is expected to get listed at between $0.4 and $0.6 offering even those who invest now a chance for lucrative returns. However, the real excitement lies in the forecast that once the RCO Finance platform officially rolls out, the token could soar by up to 19,090%. This prediction is based on the platform’s unique features and the anticipated demand for its innovative financial tools and the growth potential of AI-driven financial ecosystems. RCO Finance Set to Revolutionize the DeFi Investment Landscape RCO Finance is poised to disrupt the traditional investment paradigm with its array of advanced features. At the heart of its offerings is an AI-powered Robo Advisor , which provides personalized investment strategies based on real-time market data, individual risk tolerance, and financial goals. The Robo Advisor aims democratize access to sophisticated investment strategies, making them available without the need for deep financial knowledge or intermediary involvement. Additionally, RCO Finance will offer access to over 120,000 assets across 12,500 asset classes, including tokenized real-world assets like real estate and commodities, thus broadening the investment horizon for users. The platform will also operate in a KYC-free ecosystem, emphasizing user privacy and reducing entry barriers, which is particularly appealing in today’s data-conscious environment. Security is also paramount; RCO Finance’s smart contracts have been audited by SolidProof , a reputable blockchain security firm, ensuring a robust and trustworthy trading environment. Furthermore, the tokenomics of the platform’s native token, RCOF, are structured to encourage long-term holding through staking rewards and governance rights, while also employing a deflationary model where unsold tokens are burned, potentially increasing the token’s value over time. This combination of features not only aims to revolutionize DeFi but also offers a compelling case for why investors might choose RCOF over more traditional cryptocurrency investments as they anticipate the next big wave in digital finance.

The Trust is structured to reflect the market price of XRP, minus fees and expenses, without requiring investors to directly purchase or manage the cryptocurrency. XRP itself is used primarily for cross-border payments and is supported by the Ripple Network, a decentralized blockchain system facilitating fast and efficient transactions.

The network allows users to exchange tokens of value, called XRP, with speed and minimal friction. Launched on Sept. 5, 2024, the Grayscale XRP Trust is benchmarked against the CoinDesk Ripple Price Index (XRX). With a performance fee of 0.00% and a management fee of 2.50%, the Trust offers a cost-effective solution for accredited investors seeking exposure to XRP. The reopening of the Grayscale’s XRP Trust coincides with major developments in Ripple Labs’ legal proceedings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In December 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple, alleging that the company raised over $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP. In July 2023, a federal judge ruled that XRP is not a security when sold to the general public on digital-asset exchanges, though sales to institutional investors were considered unregistered securities transactions. This partial legal victory has bolstered confidence in XRP’s regulatory standing. Grayscale has recently expanded its range of digital asset products. On Dec. 12, 2024, the company launched the Lido DAO ( LDO ) Trust and Optimism ( OP ) Trust, providing exposure to governance tokens linked to Ethereum staking and scaling solutions. These launches followed earlier additions, including the Grayscale Sui Trust in August, the XRP Trust in September, and the Aave Trust in October, reflecting Grayscale’s commitment to diversifying its investment products. As of Jan. 17, 2025, XRP is trading at $3.27, with a 24-hour trading volume of $25.77 billion. The circulating supply stands at approximately 57.56 billion XRP tokens, resulting in a market capitalization of around $188.23 billion. Over the past 24 hours, XRP has experienced a price increase of 7.01%.

Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) could become the next viral memecoin. Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) by entering its contract address – GmW5qPRZ4TfoTw6U1KL9Btxn1uqXJJhieMAfeJk4wkbg – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPAI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-17 01:50:00

This rebound has not only boosted TON’s market capitalization by some millions but also brought investors to ponder on Toncoin’s potential for a sustained rally. Particularly, as the TON market stabilizes so far, questions about investor sentiment and market risk are coming to the forefront. Related Reading: Toncoin Could See A 65% Surge In The Next 43 Days—Here’s Why Is Now The Time To Buy TON A CryptoQuant Quicktake Platform contributor Darkfost recently analyzed Toncoin’s market behavior, focusing on the annualized realized volatility over a one-week period. This metric as shared by the analyst has dropped below the 0.25 threshold, offering insights into the prevailing investor sentiment and perceived market risk. While low volatility is often associated with reduced risk, it may also indicate waning market interest or growing investor caution. Notably, the decline in realized volatility is a significant development, as periods of low volatility have historically been followed by market reversals. Darkfost emphasized that reduced volatility often signals diminished investor interest, which can present both opportunities and challenges for traders. On the one hand, such periods may highlight reduced market risks, offering potential entry points for long-term investors. On the other hand, they require careful analysis, as low volatility alone cannot guarantee future price movements. Darkfost suggested that monitoring these low-volatility periods closely, alongside other indicators, is essential for making informed decisions. Additional evaluation of broader trends and corroborating signals is necessary to identify whether these zones represent genuine buying opportunities. Toncoin Market Performance And Outlook In recent weeks, TON’s price has shown little movement in either a bullish or bearish direction. Despite the broader crypto market experiencing a recent downturn, TON has managed to hold steady above the $5 mark, avoiding any significant drops below this level. Related Reading: Toncoin Signals Accumulation Phase as Open Interest Hits Nine-Month Low – What’s Next? Even as the broader crypto market now begins to recover, TON has struggled to break past the $5 threshold, indicating that it may be encountering resistance at this price point.

While Shiba Inu, often dubbed the “Dogecoin killer,” has turned heads for its volatility, a new contender is emerging on the horizon. RCO Finance (RCOF) , an AI altcoin that is generating buzz with ambitious targets, aiming to soar from its current price of $0.07 to an astonishing $1. The convergence of the Shiba Inu price fluctuating fortunes and the meteoric rise of RCOF is stirring up a sense of FOMO among investors eager to capitalize on the next big opportunity. Shiba Inu Price Resilience Amid Market Volatility The Shiba Inu price recently demonstrated impressive resilience by reclaiming its position above the critical 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.00002082. This recovery has brought a sigh of relief to investors, signaling renewed buying interest and a potential stabilization in the near term. The 200 EMA often serves as a key dividing line between bullish and bearish trends; the Shiba Inu price ability to stay above this level showcases underlying strength in its price action. Currently trading at $0.00002169, the Shiba Inu price faces notable resistance at the 26 EMA and 50 EMA, set at $0.00002242 and $0.00002271, respectively. Breaking these levels is essential for SHIB to regain bullish momentum. While the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 45 indicates a neutral stance, the token’s trajectory will depend on breaking resistance levels and external factors like market sentiment and ecosystem developments. The Shiba Inu price performance reflects a cautious optimism among investors. The Rise of AI Altcoin Market Positions RCO Finance (RCOF) for DeFi Dominance The ongoing surge in the Shiba Inu price action has significantly triggered a buying spree on the RCO FInance (RCOF) AI altcoin .

Cryptocurrencies like Tron and Ondo are turning heads with their unique market moves and promising setups. Tron’s bullish pattern and Ondo’s upcoming token unlock have captured the attention of seasoned traders and newbies alike. But one name is making an entrance that’s impossible to ignore: Qubetics. This newcomer is not just another token; it’s a movement. With its presale generating massive interest, Qubetics is paving the way for blockchain’s next evolution. Tron recently saw a price dip but remains primed for a rebound thanks to a nearly complete inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. Meanwhile, Ondo, despite being one of the worst performers last month, is showing signs of life as whales quietly accumulate ahead of a major token unlock. These projects bring unique strengths to the table, but the buzz around Qubetics is hard to beat. With real-world applications like its Decentralized VPN feature, it’s solving problems many didn’t even realize existed. Qubetics isn’t just about hype; it’s about utility. It’s here to tackle the issues that traditional blockchain platforms couldn’t. From revolutionizing online security to enhancing global connectivity, this project is set to launch in Q2 2025, and it’s already raising eyebrows for all the right reasons. Let’s explore why these three cryptocurrencies are the best coins to join for 2025. Qubetics ($TICS): The New Standard for Blockchain Utility Qubetics is causing a stir, and if you’ve been keeping tabs on its presale, you know why. With more than 420 million tokens sold and over $9.6 million raised so far, it’s clear that investors are paying attention. At just $0.0501 per token, $TICS offers an opportunity to get in early on a project that’s built to last. One of Qubetics’ standout features is its Decentralized VPN (DVPN) . Think of it as a VPN, but without the pitfalls of centralization. Imagine you’re a digital nomad in Bali, working on sensitive projects for global clients. Traditional VPNs can fail you, exposing your data to cyber threats or even government surveillance. Qubetics’ DVPN eliminates these risks by decentralizing the network, ensuring your data remains private and secure. For small businesses in Sydney, the DVPN offers unparalleled security for handling client data. Picture a startup sharing sensitive documents between offices in different cities. With Qubetics, they can encrypt their communications without relying on centralized servers that could be hacked or monitored. Even individuals benefit. Think about a gamer in Tokyo wanting to access global servers without lag or throttling. The DVPN ensures a seamless and secure experience. Qubetics isn’t just solving technical issues; it’s redefining how we think about online privacy and connectivity. With its Q2 2025 launch on the horizon, anticipation is building. Analysts predict massive ROI potential, and its real-world applications make it one of the best coins to join for 2025 . Tron: Ready for a Bullish Comeback Tron has had its share of ups and downs, but it’s never one to stay out of the spotlight for long. Recently, the cryptocurrency dipped below $0.23, leaving some investors wary. But those who’ve studied the charts see a different story. Crypto analyst Evan Luthra highlighted that Tron’s inverse head-and-shoulders pattern is nearing completion. If this pattern plays out, Tron could surge to $0.277 in Q1 2025, marking a significant comeback. Data doesn’t lie. Tron is trading above its 100-day EMA at $0.22, and its momentum indicator suggests a buying opportunity. For traders in regions like Malaysia or New Zealand, these are the kinds of signals that trigger action. Imagine a tech entrepreneur in Auckland looking to diversify their crypto portfolio. Tron’s strong technical setup makes it an enticing choice. Tron’s appeal isn’t just technical. Its blockchain offers low transaction fees and high scalability, making it a favorite for developers. Picture a gaming startup in Singapore using Tron’s platform to launch a play-to-earn model. The low costs and fast speeds make it a no-brainer. What keeps Tron on the list of the best coins to join for 2025 is its resilience. Market fluctuations are inevitable, but Tron’s ability to bounce back and its strong fundamentals make it a solid pick for anyone looking to ride the next wave of crypto innovation. Ondo: A Sleeper Hit Poised for Action Ondo hasn’t had the easiest run lately. With its price dropping 40% over the past month, it’s been a tough pill to swallow for investors. But here’s the kicker: the upcoming token unlock on January 18 could change everything. Over 1.94 billion tokens, valued at $2.42 billion, are set to hit the market. Events like these often bring volatility, but they also present opportunities. Whales have been quietly accumulating ONDO ahead of the unlock, and on-chain data shows significant buying activity. A trader in Jakarta might look at these signals and see a chance to get in while prices are still low. If the falling wedge pattern on the 4-hour chart holds, ONDO could rebound to $1.76, offering a potential double-digit surge. Ondo’s technicals are equally intriguing. The RSI is in oversold territory, signaling that a bullish reversal could be on the horizon. For a crypto enthusiast in Manila, this might be the perfect setup for a short-term play with long-term potential. What sets Ondo apart is its ability to adapt. Despite recent setbacks, the project has strong fundamentals and a committed community. This combination makes it one of the best coins to join for 2025, especially for investors who know how to spot a comeback story. How Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN Works and Why It Matters The Decentralized VPN feature isn’t just a gimmick; it’s a revolution in online security. Traditional VPNs rely on centralized servers, which are vulnerable to hacking, surveillance, and throttling. Qubetics flips the script by using blockchain technology to decentralize the network. This means no single point of failure and complete anonymity for users. Here’s how it works. Imagine you’re a freelancer in Kuala Lumpur working with international clients. You need to access sensitive documents securely. Qubetics’ DVPN encrypts your data and routes it through a decentralized network of nodes, ensuring your information stays private. For businesses, the benefits are even greater. A company in Brisbane managing a global supply chain can use the DVPN to secure communications and protect trade secrets. Even gamers in Seoul can enjoy lag-free, secure access to servers worldwide. Why does this matter? Because online security is no longer a luxury; it’s a necessity. As the world becomes more connected, the need for secure, reliable solutions will only grow. Qubetics is leading the charge, making its DVPN feature a cornerstone of blockchain’s future. Conclusion If you’re looking for the best coins to join for 2025 , Qubetics, Tron, and Ondo should be at the top of your list. Each brings something unique to the table. Qubetics is revolutionizing online security with its Decentralized VPN. Tron’s bullish setup and robust blockchain make it a strong contender, while Ondo’s upcoming token unlock presents a golden opportunity for savvy investors.

Takahiro Anno’s vision for “Digital Democracy 2030” is not favored by everyone, however, and falls in line with previous disturbing ideas put forth by the J-gov about leaning into AI rulership. 2024 Tokyo gubernatorial hopeful and self-proclaimed Sci-Fi writer Takahiro Anno thinks AI could help clean up governance in Japan. According to local media , the software engineer (who came in fifth in the 2024 Tokyo election) has announced he will create an open-source tool for aggregating public opinion, managing funds, and shaping policy. Anno’s controversial vision of ‘Digital Democracy 2030’ Anno explained on January 16 during a speech in Shinjuku Ward, Tokyo, that his vision for “ Digital Democracy 2030 ” sees artificial intelligence taking a central role in shaping politics, with Nikkei reporting that the tool aims to “manage political funds” and “aggregate public opinion.” Further, it will connect its findings to policy creation. Source: X On the surface this may seem like a one-off, pie-in-the-sky idea from another random software engineer and science-fiction geek, but Anno actually has big state ties as a current advisor to GovTech Tokyo, an organization dedicated to digital transformation (DX) which is 100% bankrolled by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Further, back in November of last year, Japan’s Digital Administrative and Financial Reform Council released a document describing how artificial intelligence, drones, and robots can be used in the implementation of a new kind of surveillance state to better govern the nation — ideas right in line with Anno’s proclamations. Japanese reactions mixed, residents still struggling with immediate fiscal hardships Social media responses to the Nikkei article on Anno were mixed, as residents of Japan seem to think there are much more important matters to attend to. One user even questioned (translated by Google): “Is there any point in using AI as an intermediary? Another public money business?” Still, other commenters said the idea was “amazing” and expressed interest in getting the AI tool in place. As Cryptopolitan has previously reported , Japan’s current economic struggles are increasing for everyday individuals, with a flagging JPY, skyrocketing food prices, and a growing elderly population that cannot afford to retire on the state’s poverty-line pensions. As such, it’s really no wonder people are skeptical of a well-funded, 34-year-old Sci-Fi writer’s ideas for how their money should be spent.

According to multiple reports, the incoming administration is preparing executive orders aimed at boosting the cryptocurrency sector, including new policies to support industry growth and streamline regulations. Donald Trump Executive Order to Focus on Cryptocurrency President-elect Donald Trump is said to be working on an executive order that will ensure that cryptocurrency is viewed as an essential part of the US economy. The order is anticipated to call on the regulators to work closely with the crypto industry and to form a crypto advisory council. This council would afford industry stakeholders an opportunity to raise their concerns and make recommendations. According to the sources , the executive order could be signed on January 20, the first day of Trump’s presidency. It may also suspend all ongoing crypto cases and order all government bodies to rethink their stance on digital currencies. Brian Hughes, the spokesperson for Trump’s transition team, said, “President Trump will follow through on his word to promote American dominance in the crypto space.” Creation of a Bitcoin Reserve Under Discussion Another idea being floated under the Donald Trump administration is the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve through seized digital assets. At the moment, the U.S. government has about $20 billion worth of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from law enforcement belongings, as per Arkham Intelligence. The Bitcoin Policy Institute has proposed that $21 billion be invested to make Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset. Should this be implemented it will afford a mechanism through which the U.S. can effectively deal with the issue of debt and enhance its position within the global economy. Amid this discussion, Senator Cynthia Lummis has called out proposed plans by the US Marshals to sell its seized Bitcoin stash which would invalidate the Bitcoin Reserve strategy. In addition, there are also indications that the Trump administration may expand this reserve to other digital assets such as Solana (SOL) and XRP, as part of a broader plan to diversify national crypto assets. Review of Banking and Accounting Policies The new Donald Trump administration is expected to tackle crypto de-banking and repeal the accounting standards that regard banks’ crypto assets as their liabilities. These amendments subsequently are directed towards enabling financial institutions to hold and manage digital assets more efficiently, which will open up the door for the broader market. Concurrently, according to the Washington Post the SEC could revisit ongoing legal proceedings against crypto companies. Some of the people familiar with the plans said that other cases without fraud allegations may be put on hold under the new administration. Ripple Labs’ Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty has recently claimed that the long-standing regulatory actions against the company can be dropped under the Trump administration.

However, a new project is quietly gaining momentum and capturing the attention of savvy investors. Lightchain AI , an emerging blockchain platform, is carving out its space in the market. With over $10.6 million raised during its presale, priced at $0.00525 in Stage 12, Lightchain AI’s innovative approach is making it a serious contender to watch. Solana Strengths and Current Market Challenges Solana has shown great strength bouncing back from a low of $9.64 to near $199; this is a rise of 2,143% in two years. Its strength in a type of trade called DEX, with numbers ͏over $100 billion, shows its tech skill and charm to buyers. But, Solana has problems, like a drop in Total Value Locked of $11 billion to $7.93 billion which shows bad signs and investor worries. Also, the network has felt crowding and deal breaks, maybe lessening user and builder trust. Even with these bumps, Solana’s growth in the space and lots of money coming in show a chance for more rise in the changing crypto world. Lightchain AI Is Stealing the Spotlight Lightchain AI offers a fresh perspective on blockchain development, emphasizing usability, scalability, and enterprise-grade solutions. Unlike Solana, which focuses heavily on DeFi and NFTs, Lightchain AI is designed to cater to a broader range of industries with features tailored for real-world applications. One key differentiator is Lightchain AI’s ability to simplify decentralized application (dApp) development. The platform provides comprehensive developer tools, including intuitive APIs and a sandbox testing environment, making it accessible to a wider range of creators. This approach lowers barriers to entry, encouraging innovation and adoption. Another standout feature is its advanced security framework. Lightchain AI integrates cryptographic techniques to protect sensitive data, ensuring compliance with global standards. This focus on privacy and security makes it particularly appealing to industries like healthcare, AI, and finance. What’s Driving the Momentum? The strong investor confidence in Lightchain AI’s presale reflects its potential to disrupt the market. With a roadmap that includes a testnet launch in 2025, the project is attracting developers and enterprises eager to explore its capabilities. Unlike Solana, which has faced criticism for centralization concerns, Lightchain AI prioritizes a decentralized governance model, giving token holders a direct say in platform development. Market analysts predict that Lightchain AI’s unique features and focus on scalability will enable it to compete with established players like Solana. As the project continues to gain traction, it’s poised to become a key player in the blockchain ecosystem. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-17 03:00:00

A recent study by Binance indicates that XRP could hit $10 by 2025, fueled by Ripple’s successful challenges against the SEC and the expansion of RLUSD, a stablecoin that supports Ripple’s network. At the same time, Web3Bay (3BAY) is capturing attention as a notable project that merges e-commerce with cryptocurrency features, presenting new opportunities for crypto investors. Is a $10 Value Feasible for Ripple (XRP) by 2025? The potential for Ripple to achieve a $10 value is backed by various vital elements. A legal win over the SEC has cleared up regulatory doubts, prompting banks to consider XRP for worldwide money transfers. This, along with signs like a high RSI and consistent trading volumes, points to a possible price increase for XRP. Moreover, incorporating RLUSD into Ripple’s framework solidifies its presence in the international financial scene by improving cross-border payment services. Large wallet acquisitions by whales also contribute to the positive outlook for Ripple’s (XRP) future in overcoming major price barriers and maintaining its market drive toward the $10 mark. Web3Bay: Transforming E-Commerce with Blockchain Technology Conversely, Web3Bay is transforming e-commerce by integrating cryptocurrency payments with regular banking operations. The platform cuts out middlemen and excessive fees, allowing sellers to access a worldwide market while reducing transaction costs. It also plans to incorporate NFTs and loyalty schemes, building an ecosystem for goods, collectibles, and decentralized finance possibilities.

The buzzword? Community. And what’s better than diving into an ecosystem where memes meet moolah? If you’ve been scouting for the top new meme coins to join today, we’ve got the holy trinity of hype right here: BTFD Coin, MOG, and Neiro. These legends are redefining the game, and we’re about to spill the deets! Let’s kick it off with BTFD Coin, where the party doesn’t just stop at staking or P2E games. Nope—it’s the referral rewards program that’s making waves, turning every investor into a recruitment rockstar. And spoiler: the ROI potential? Chef’s kiss. With its presale still going strong in Stage 13 and having amassed over $5.2 million in funds, all heads are turning Bull-ward! BTFD Coin: Bulls Squad + Referral Rewards = 🔥 ROI Opportunities First up is BTFD Coin, the OG of meme coins for those who know how to “Buy the Freaking Dip” like pros. This isn’t just a coin; it’s a movement, led by the iconic Bulls Squad—Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull. Each character brings a unique twist to the ecosystem, but today, it’s the Referral Rewards Program that’s stealing the show. Imagine this: you join the BTFD party, share your unique referral code with your crew, and for every $50 purchase they make, they get 10% extra $BTFD tokens. And you? You bag 10% of the amount they spend if you rank in the top 20! Yes, it’s like turning your network into your net worth. How the Numbers Stack Up Let’s break it down. Say you invest $3,000 at today’s presale price of $0.000142. That bags you a hefty 21,126,761 BTFD Coins. If the coin hits $0.0006, you’re sitting on $12,676. But here’s where the FOMO hits hard—if BTFD Coin moons to $0.006, you’re looking at a whopping $126,760. Add the referral rewards to this mix, and you’re printing money while flexing your referral leaderboard status. Oh, and Stage 13 of the presale is nearly complete—so unless you’re planning to regret not hopping in, now’s the time to lock in that irresistible $0.000142 price.

Its ecosystem is a vibe, offering staking rewards with a killer APY, a P2E game tied to the Bulls Squad , and Ethereum-backed security for long-term stability. This coin isn’t just growing; it’s glowing with potential. MOG: The Meme Lifestyle MOG isn’t just about being a meme coin; it’s a whole mood. The community is a tight-knit squad of meme connoisseurs who are rewriting the playbook on how memes can dominate the internet. What makes MOG special? It’s all about passion, humor, and an unstoppable commitment to creating the most shareable, laugh-out-loud content the internet has ever seen. Oh, and did we mention their numbers?

MOG is proving that laughter really is the best currency, and with the way it’s trending, this lifestyle coin might just be the ticket to the moon. Neiro: The No-Tax Wonder Next on the list is Neiro, a fresh face in the crypto scene with a big promise: zero buy/sell tax. Yep, you heard that right. Neiro is all about giving investors maximum bang for their buck with a fully community-driven approach.

Musk Saves California (MUSKCALI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKCALI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Saves California can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Saves California could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Saves California launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Saves California on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Saves California by entering its contract address – 2mtzeaYqDPLtCemX5jNPuuq8jw65cbgNUXuT3fBra2M2 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCALI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-17 03:18:13

With renewed interest in cross-border payments and Ripple’s increasing institutional adoption, experts suggest XRP could achieve an astonishing 15,000% growth in the next market cycle. Alongside XRP, emerging tokens like BigBossInu , as well as heavyweights like Cardano (ADA) , Ethereum (ETH) , Optimism (OP) , and VeChain (VET) , are poised to experience significant growth. BigBossInu: The Crypto Project Turning Heads with Its Presale BigBossInu’s high-demand presale is creating waves, making it a hot topic among investors and analysts. BigBossInu is one of the most promising projects set to deliver massive returns. Positioned as a high-potential altcoin, BigBossInu has the potential to capture the market’s attention, making it a valuable addition to any portfolio aiming for substantial growth in 2025 and beyond. BigBossInu celebrates $100,000 raised within minutes! For a limited time, get a 50% EXTRA BONUS by using the code EXTRA50X. >> Ripple (XRP)’s meteoric 700% rise is a reflection of its unique position as a leader in the cross-border payments space. Ripple experienced a 98% surge after Ripple’s partial success in its case against the SEC, briefly becoming the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. Cardano (ADA) has earned a reputation for its cutting-edge technology focused on sustainability and scalability. As the platform continues to roll out key upgrades like Hydra, which will significantly improve scalability, Cardano is expected to handle more decentralized applications (dApps). Ethereum (ETH) remains the undisputed leader in decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and NFTs. Ethereum is holding strong around $2,450 after a small dip with Bitcoin. Despite the anticipation surrounding Ethereum ETF approval, it hasn’t significantly impacted price movement. Optimism (OP) has become one of the most important Layer-2 scaling solutions for Ethereum, helping alleviate network congestion and reduce fees. By enhancing Ethereum’s scalability, VeChain (VET) is transforming the supply chain industry by providing blockchain-based solutions that enhance transparency, traceability, and fraud prevention. Its real-time tracking capabilities have been adopted by various industries to monitor products throughout their lifecycle. >>>> Conclusion With XRP positioned for a potential 15,000% surge and the rising influence of BigBossInu , the next market cycle is set to deliver explosive growth across several key altcoins. Cardano (ADA) , Ethereum (ETH) , Optimism (OP) , and VeChain (VET) are all poised for significant advances, offering investors a diverse array of opportunities to capture value in 2025.

ETH is holding gains and might aim for a fresh increase above the $3,480 zone. Ethereum started a decent recovery wave above the $3,240 zone. The price is trading above $3,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $3,320 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it clears the $3,400 resistance level. Ethereum Price Stays Above The Key Support Ethereum price started a decent upward move above the $3,240 level but upsides were limited compared to Bitcoin . ETH was able to clear the $3,300 and $3,320 resistance levels to move into a short-term positive zone. The pair even surged above the $3,350 and $3,400 levels. Finally, it tested the $3,480 zone. A high was formed at $3,473 and recently the price corrected some gains. There was a drop below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,912 swing low to the $3,473 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,280 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . It is again rising and trading above $3,300. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $3,320 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,400 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,420 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,480. A clear move above the $3,480 resistance might send the price toward the $3,550 resistance. An upside break above the $3,550 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,650 resistance zone or even $3,720 in the near term. Downside Correction In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,400 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,280 level. The first major support sits near the $3,200 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,912 swing low to the $3,473 high. A clear move below the $3,200 support might push the price toward the $3,120 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,050 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,000. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

Here’s what on-chain data says could be behind the rally. Litecoin Has Overperformed Market With A Strong Surge In The Last 24 Hours The past day has seen recovery from the cryptocurrency sector as a whole, but Litecoin in particular has stood out with its impressive rally of more than 19%, which has taken its price beyond the $120 mark. Related Reading: XRP, Bitcoin Recovery Only Short-Lived? TD Sequential May Suggest So Below is a chart that shows how the recent performance of the coin has looked. Among the top digital assets by market cap, only XRP (XRP) and Hedera (HBAR) have shown comparable returns to Litecoin during the last 24 hours. In terms of weekly profits, though, LTC still lags behind many coins with an overall uplift of just 16%. As for what could be providing the fuel for the rally, perhaps behavior of the key investors of the cryptocurrency could provide some answers. LTC Sharks & Whales Have Been Buying Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed about the latest trend in the Supply Distribution of the Litecoin sharks and whales. The “Supply Distribution” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of LTC that a given wallet group is holding right now. Addresses or investors are divided into these cohorts based on the number of coins that they are carrying in their balance. The 1 to 10 coins group, for instance, contains all the wallets holding between and one and ten tokens of the asset. In the context of the current topic, two cohorts are of interest: sharks and whales. The combined range for these investors could be defined as 10,000 LTC to infinity. The lower end of the range is equivalent to around $120,000 at the current exchange rate, so the only holders who would qualify for these groups would be the sizeable ones. As the influence of any investor in the market goes up the more coins that they hold, the sharks and whales can be worth keeping an eye on since their movements may end up reflecting on the cryptocurrency. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution of the Litecoin sharks and whales over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Litecoin sharks and whales have seen their total supply go up recently, which suggests that these large investors have been participating in net accumulation. In all, the groups have bought a total of 250,000 tokens (around $30 million) during this surge in the indicator over the last week. Given the timing, it’s probable that these holders have had a part to play in the latest price rally.

BITX charges a high 1.85% expense ratio and has underperformed its promise, delivering only 1.5x Bitcoin's return due to decay issues. President Trump's potential 'Bitcoin Reserve' policy could boost Bitcoin prices, but simpler ETFs like IBIT are better for bullish investors without leverage risks. I rate BITX a hold and recommend IBIT ETF for those seeking Bitcoin exposure without the downsides of leverage or decay. With President-elect Donald Trump expected to return to the White House next week and likely designating cryptocurrencies a 'national priority' on day 1, investors may be tempted to add Bitcoin exposure ahead of inauguration day. One option is to buy the 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITX ), which promises to deliver twice the daily returns of holding Bitcoins. However, in my opinion, the BITX ETF may not be investors' best option if they expect Bitcoins to rally for an extended period of time. The BITX ETF suffers from significant contango and volatility decay that causes significant slippage compared to actual Bitcoin returns. I rate BITX a hold and prefer the simpler, low-cost Bitcoin ETFs instead. Brief Fund Overview For those unfamiliar, the 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF seeks to provide daily returns that are twice the return of the S&P CME Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index (""SPBTFDUE Index""). This index measures the daily performance of a rolling position in front-month Bitcoin futures that trade on the CME Exchange and is rebalanced on a daily basis between the front-month contract and the second-month contract to maintain its 200% daily exposure. For example, on January 16th, 2025, BITX held 77.6% of its notional exposure in January futures and 122.4% in February futures, with collateral held as cash (Figure 1). Figure 1 - BITX holdings, January 16, 2025 (volatilityshares.com) The BITX ETF has $3.5 billion in net assets and charges a 1.85% expense ratio (Figure 2). Figure 2 - BITX overview (volatilityshares.com) Contango And Volatility Causes Slippage I may sound like a broken record, but investors considering a leveraged futures ETF like the BIX must consider contango and volatility decay. Contango , with respect to a futures market, means that asset prices are more expensive the farther out in maturity you go. For example, while spot Bitcoins are quoted at ~$99,000 on January 16th, 2025, the January futures are trading at $100,500 and the February futures are trading at $101,600 (Figure 2). Figure 3 - Illustrative Bitcoin futures curve (trading view.com) This becomes problematic for a futures-based ETF like BITX because the fund must rebalance its exposure every single day to maintain a weighted average 1-month maturity. On a daily basis, BITX must sell the 'cheaper' near-month future and buy the more 'expensive' second-month future. This constant 'sell-low/buy-high' leads to a gradual decay in value for the BITX ETF. Compounding the problem for BITX is its 200% leveraged exposure. In addition to 'contango decay' , leveraged ETFs suffer from 'volatility decay' . Assume investors have bought $100 worth of BITX. If Bitcoins return +5% on day 1 followed by -5% on day 2, the returns experience for BITX investors is +10% followed by -10% and they will end up with $99.00, significantly less than twice the 2-day compounded loss of 0.25% or $99.50. This loss in value is commonly called 'volatility decay'. While these losses may appear small on a day-to-day basis, when compounded over long periods of time, contango and volatility decay can cause very significant slippage in BITX's returns compared to holding Bitcoins directly. For example, in the past year, Bitcoin has surged by 131%, but the BITX ETF has only returned 194%, significantly less than its claim of 200% returns (Figure 4). Figure 4 - BITX vs. Bitcoins, trailing 1 year (Seeking Alpha) Traders considering the BITX ETF should ensure they fully understand the tracking error risks involved with levered and futures-based ETFs as explained in these FINRA and SEC warnings. 'Bitcoin Reserve' To Become A National Priority According to leaked reports , one of President Trump's first executive order once he returns to the White House may be to establish a 'national strategic Bitcoin stockpile', much like how the U.S. government currently holds gold bullion in reserve. While the details remain hazy, there are several avenues President Trump could pursue to establish this 'Bitcoin Reserve'. One simple way would be for the U.S. government to take the ~200k Bitcoins it has obtained from confiscations and seizures and deem them as the 'Bitcoin Reserve' and add to it over time. However, a more bullish scenario is a proposal by Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis that could require the United States buy 200,000 Bitcoins per year, for 5 years, until it has accumulated a total of 1,000,000 Bitcoins. As a reminder, there are currently 19.9 million Bitcoins in circulation and only 21 million Bitcoins can ever exist, according to Bitcoin's codebase. If the United States' 'Bitcoin Reserve' is set in terms of number of coins instead of dollars, then that means there may be a constant 'bid' underneath Bitcoin prices as the U.S. government will be forced to steadily accumulate Bitcoins, regardless of price. Comparing BITX To Peer Funds With such a bullish outlook, investors may be salivating at the chance to 'front-run' the government. But how does BITX compare against other Bitcoin investment options? In terms of investment funds, I believe BITX is a relatively poor choice. First, in terms of fees, the BITX ETF is by far the most expensive, charging a 1.9% expense ratio compared to the ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ) that charges 0.95% or the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) that charges 0.12% (Figure 5). BITO is similar to BITX in that it is futures-based, while IBIT actually holds Bitcoins in its own wallet. Figure 5 - BITX is expensive (Seeking Alpha) Alternatively, investors can also choose to invest in Bitcoins directly through a crypto-broker like Coinbase, or invest in crypto-related equities like MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) or MARA Holdings ( MARA ). Let's briefly discuss the pros and cons of the various options using the trailing 1-year return as a guide (Figure 6). Figure 6 - BITX vs. alternative Bitcoin investment options, trailing 1 year returns (Seeking Alpha) Options To Avoid BITO, as a futures-based ETF, suffers from 'contango decay' and should be avoided in my opinion. Bitcoin miners like MARA should also be avoided. Bitcoin miners' business model is constantly challenged by an arms-race against other Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin's codebase, which 'halves' the mining reward every ~18-24 months, leading to poor profitability for the miners. In fact, collectively, I do not believe any Bitcoin miners have cumulatively turned a profit for their shareholders. For example, MARA has lost a cumulative $568 million since its 2014, and it turned a profit in the past 12 months only on the revaluation of digital assets (Figure 7). Figure 7 - MARA has lost a cumulative $568 million since 2014 (Seeking Alpha) Options To Consider The IBIT ETF and other Bitcoin-based ETFs, closely track the returns of Bitcoin and can be considered by bullish investors. In the past year, the IBIT ETF returned 131%, the same as Bitcoin's 131% return less a small management fee. BITX, while it claims to offer 2x returns, actually delivered just 1.5x Bitcoin's return (194% vs. 131%), as 'contango decay' and 'volatility' decay ate into its returns. However, for those seeking 'leveraged' returns, it is an option to consider. MicroStrategy has been the most impressive, returning 661% compared to Bitcoin's 131%, or 5x the returns of Bitcoin, as the company has seemingly discovered a 'Bitcoin flywheel' that allows the company to constantly issue capital (both equity and debt) to buy Bitcoins for its treasury that increases the company's valuation. However, the issue I have with MSTR is that its shares trade at a 100% premium to its holdings of Bitcoins (Figure 8). Figure 8 - MSTR trades at a 100% premium to NAV (mstr-tracker.com) While MSTR's premium valuation can be sustained as long as investors continue to support its shares and Bitcoin remains in a bullish phase, MSTR shares are also vulnerable to sharp declines if Bitcoins suffers an extended correction. In fact, given its premium valuation, MSTR's shares may have a similar leveraged effect on the downside. For example, in the past month, as Bitcoin prices digest its gains made since the November election, MSTR has exhibited double the downside of Bitcoin (-10% vs. -5%) (Figure 9). Figure 9 - BITX vs. Bitcoin alternatives, trailing 1 month returns (Seeking Alpha) BITX and BITO returns have also been poor, returning -15% and -10% respectively in the past month, triple and double the declines of Bitcoin. MARA has been especially atrocious, as it has basically failed to participate in Bitcoin's rally in the past year but has delivered 5 times the decline in the past month. Risks To BITX The short-term risk to BITX and Bitcoin investments is President Trump's policies. A lot of expectation has been built up over the potential of the 'Bitcoin Reserve' and if President fails to deliver, BITX and Bitcoin prices could be in for a rude surprise. Conclusion In my opinion, for most investors, a simple Bitcoin ETF like IBIT should be more than sufficient for those who are bullish on Bitcoin, without the downsides of leverage or decay. I rate BITX a hold , given its significant contango and volatility decay, and prefer to buy the IBIT ETF instead to express my bullish view on Bitcoin.",BITX,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-17 03:42:00

Some of the best single month returns for Bitcoin have come in Februaries following halving years. 2024 was a halving year. On-chain data shows diminishing supply held via exchanges, and miner supply is also slowly trending lower. Miner share of volume also indicates upward price pressure is likely. While BITO will get dragged higher with Bitcoin in a sustained rally, it's not the best way to play Bitcoin longer term. A little over two months ago, I said I was buying the ""breakout shakeout"" in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) in an article covering the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) for Seeking Alpha. The performance since that call has been solid. The total return for BITO since that piece is nearly 40%. In a more recent piece , I gave some thoughts on the technical setup that I saw in the chart of Bitcoin near the beginning of January: Bitcoin's daily chart shows RSI divergences going back to November. The coin has also given back the 50 day moving average and appears poised to go below $90k per coin for the first time in nearly two months. While I still liked the potential for new price highs in BTC between now and the end of the year, I did see weakness in the chart that I felt foreshadowed sub-$90k BTC prices in the shorter term. We have since seen a very temporary breach of that $90k level and a quick 12% gain from those lows in just 2 days. In this article, we'll go over seasonality implications for Bitcoin as we approach February and look at some of the important supply/demand implications from the on-chain data. Seasonality Signals Before we get too far into this, take heed of the old investment adage that past performance does not guarantee future results. This is true in all investment forms and doubly true for the digital asset market. That said, I do think that seasonality trends can be helpful and, to a degree, self-reinforcing. February is typically a terrific month for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Seasonality, by month (TrendSpider) Over the last 11 years, the month of February has generated a positive return 73% of the time, and the mean return over that time is 10.6% in the month. After October, February has historically been the second best month of the year for BTC price returns. While January is more mixed, if we get more granular we can see that we're moving through what has historically been a rough patch to start the year: Bitcoin Seasonality, by week (TrendSpider) Week 2 has typically resulted in a negative week over the last 11 years. Weeks 3 and 4 are a bit more mixed, as they result in gains more often than not but have slightly negative mean changes. The details about February are what I find to be more useful: Year February Return 2012 (Halving Year) -11.7% 2013 54.9% 2016 (Halving Year) 18.5% 2017 21.5% 2020 (Halving Year) -8.2% 2021 36.0% 2024 (Halving Year) 44% Source: CryptoRank If we look at Bitcoin's February price appreciation following halving years, we see an average February return in those years of over 37%. The point is, February is historically a great month for BTC price returns and post-halving year February has typically been an exceptional month to be long Bitcoin. As I said at the beginning of this section, this does necessarily mean this year will be the same. There is perhaps an argument to be made that the approval of spot ETFs in the United States last year pulled forward expected gains for the 2024 halving cycle. February 2024 returned 44% in a halving year - this is not typical and is the kind of return that would be expected in a post-halving year. Cycle Date Price On Halving Cycle Top Price Days To Cycle Top 1st Halving Nov 28, 2012 $12.38 $1,191.55 366 2nd Halving Jul 9, 2016 $644.39 $19,310.77 525 3rd Halving May 11, 2020 $8,758.85 $72,500.92 1,402 4th Halving Apr 19, 2024 $62,549.72 $106,839.06 242 Source: IntoTheBlock Furthermore, the cycle top high from the 3rd halving took nearly the entire 4 years from the date of the 2020 block reward halving. While we've certainly had a new high already during this 4th halving epoch, we don't yet know if it is the high price for the cycle or not. I don't think we can rule out the possibility that the top is already in, but I'm personally of the view that the coin will make one more new high before a larger pullback. Signals From On-Chain Data While the long-term trend in on-chain activity has been disappointing when looking at metrics like daily active users, there are other figures that are headed in the right direction. For instance, monthly USD-denominated volume: Adjusted Monthly Volume (The Block) In December, Bitcoin's on-chain volume topped $2.2 trillion. This was certainly not a record for monthly volume, but it was a 125% improvement over December 2023 and a 73% improvement over volume from the last halving-year December (2020). Shifting to supply/demand dynamics, the aggregated exchange balance continues to decline: Bitcoin Exchange Balance (CoinGlass) As of January 15th, the BTC exchange balance was just 2.2 million, or 11% of the circulating supply. A year ago, the exchange balance was 2.7 million BTC. So even as more BTC has been mined into circulation over the last 12 months, the number of BTC held through centralized exchanges has gone down by 23%. A declining exchange balance has generally been viewed as a bullish signal and indicative of a holder base that doesn't plan to liquidate the asset. One of the primary sources of sell-pressure is Bitcoin miners: BTC Miner Supply (CoinMetrics) We've obviously seen more of a trend toward HODLing BTC even from many companies in the public equity markets . Despite that, miner supply of BTC has generally trended lower and is currently sitting at 1.8 million BTC. Miner volume share has started to plummet as well: Miners Volume Share (IntoTheBlock) So far in the month of January, miner volume share is averaging about 5%. Theoretically, the long term trend here should be down as more on-chain usage is from non-mining entities. When Bitcoin's price peaked back in November 2021, miner share fell down to just 1.3%. Like everything mentioned before, there is no rule that says the same thing has to happen again. But generally speaking, these metrics are all indicative of market expectations for higher prices. Supply is coming off exchanges, miner share of volume is plummeting, miner supply is at decade-lows, and on-chain volume is picking up steam. ProShares Bitcoin Strategy Despite the proliferation of spot ETFs that have entered the market over the last 12 months, BITO is still a very well capitalized fund at $2.5 billion. However, given the fund does utilize a futures-based strategy rather than a spot strategy, it is more expensive to play Bitcoin this way over longer periods of time. The 0.95% expense ratio is closer to parity with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) at 1.5% than it is the iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) at 0.25% 1 Year Price Return (Seeking Alpha) Unsurprisingly, the total return in BITO has lagged that of both IBIT and the underlying asset. For that reason, I'm not a fan of BITO as a long term investment relative to spot funds. However, I do think Bitcoin has more room to run higher this year and in the event BTC rips to new highs, the coin will drag BITO up with it. Final Takeaways 2024 was a monster year for Bitcoin, both from a price appreciation standpoint and an investor demand standpoint. To be sure, there have been key differences in this halving epoch compared to previous halving cycles. There is certainly no guarantee any of this means the price of Bitcoin has to continue higher. As investors and traders, the best we can do is make a judgement based on numerous pieces of information. From where I sit, there are positive signs in the supply/demand dynamics of Bitcoin; exchange balance continues to decline and miner share of volume is falling quickly. Miners have even flipped from sellers to buyers. Beyond that, February has historically been a terrific month for BTC price returns - particularly in post-halving years, and 2025 is a post-halving year. It's absolutely possible we've already seen the price high for this cycle, but I'm betting we get one more large move higher before the deeper pullback in BTC. I'm reiterating BITO as a 'buy' purely on the belief the fund will move with Bitcoin. But there are better ways to get exposure to BTC with a longer-term perspective.",BTC-USD|BITO,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-17 03:57:00

The rumors suggested that former President Donald Trump criticized Ripple for alleged financial support of Kamala Harris during a past election. Alderoty dismissed the claims as baseless and entirely fabricated, taking to Twitter to call out the reports as “pure fiction.” Ripple CLO Refutes Claims of Political Allegations Rumors have started to surface following a report made by Unchained, which stated that insiders said that Ripple had a conversation with Trump during which he allegedly bashed the company. In the report, Trump claimed that Ripple did not support his administration at a crucial time and highlighted that Chris Larsen, the co-founder of Ripple, had donated to PACs backing Kamala Harris. The report further suggested that Ripple may have influenced another rumor published by the New York Post . The rumor claimed Trump was open to including non-Bitcoin, American cryptocurrencies, such as XRP, in a national reserve . XRP, Ripple’s native token, experienced a significant price surge following the report, reaching a seven-year high of $3.40. Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty quickly fired back at the allegations on social media and questioned the origins of the information from the unnamed sources. “The rumors published by this third-tier crypto rag are pure fiction. Completely made up,” Alderoty wrote on X. John Deaton Criticizes Speculative Reporting Like Ripple CLO, Prominent attorney John Deaton, who has been a vocal figure in the XRP community, also criticized the speculative reporting. Deaton questioned the reliability of unnamed sources and emphasized the importance of evidence-based claims. As Deaton took to X to express his opinions he wrote, ” Let me get this straight, a person who was not at the meeting told another person that they were guessing what may have been said at the meeting?” This is why we have rules of evidence in Court.” Deaton also pointed to the dangers of “tribalism” within the crypto sector, which is often characterized by groups that try to spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) about other projects. According to him, the recent market performance of XRP which has been performing better than Bitcoin among other cryptocurrencies was likely to raise eyebrows. XRP Price Hits 7 Year High Amid Controversy The speculation was made at the same time of the unprecedented increase of XRP usage having hit more than 2,365 $100K transactions. Concurrently, XRP price has increased by more than 10% in the last 24 hours hitting a 7 year high due to speculations that the digital asset will be added to a US strategic digital assets reserve. Other publications, including the New York Times, revealed that Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, had urged Trump to consider expanding such a reserve to include other cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoins. Despite these claims, no report could establish whether Trump had accepted the proposition or not. Ripple’s representative, Susan Hendrick, has confirmed that Garlinghouse did reach out to the former president, but she denied that Ripple was behind the rumors of Trump supporting XRP . ‘All those allegations are lies,’ she told Unchained when confronted with the allegations. The controversy arises at a time when Ripple is still in a legal tussle with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC recently filed an appeal of a 2023 decision by US District Judge Analisa Torres which found that XRP sales on cryptocurrency trading platforms did not constitute securities transactions.

Attorney Jeremy Hogan discussed the appeal, explaining that the SEC is only appealing one specific ruling: that the XRP sold to retail investors on exchanges was not considered a security. The SEC is not challenging the finding that no investors were harmed. Weaknesses in the SEC’s Brief Hogan finds the SEC’s brief weak and said that much of it simply repeats what the lower court already decided. The SEC is asking the appellate court to rule that it doesn’t need to prove that XRP buyers were aware of Ripple’s efforts to raise the price of XRP. To support this, the SEC points to three past cases, but Hogan argues that these cases don’t really back up the SEC’s position. Ripple Likely to Challenge SEC’s Argument Hogan predicts that Ripple will strongly challenge the SEC’s argument in its reply. The SEC’s best case for support is the Aqua-Sonic case, but Hogan said that the SEC has to piece together statements from different parts of the case to make it work, and even then, it doesn’t align well with Ripple’s situation. SEC’s Missed Opportunity with Evidence Hogan is also surprised that the SEC didn’t address evidence from XRP buyers who didn’t know about Ripple’s actions, especially given the thousands of affidavits submitted by attorney John Deaton. The SEC’s failure to counter this evidence could hurt their case in the long run. Possible Impact of the Appeal If the appeal goes forward and the court upholds the ruling on retail sales, it could create a tough situation for the SEC. They would have to prove that buyers knew about Ripple’s promotional efforts, which would be challenging and time-consuming. Additionally, this appeal might allow Ripple to raise new arguments about what constitutes an “investment contract,” potentially strengthening their position.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-17 04:35:57

Elon Bromance (ELOBRO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOBRO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Bromance can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Bromance could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Bromance launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Bromance on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Bromance by entering its contract address – FY7aYv7K3yEE9Z8hzgURj5z7biTE8Z6BpunBPAnCEpxj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELOBRO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-17 04:42:00

Two of the most often discussed memecoins, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), have shown fortitude in the face of recent market swings and rising community trust. But with innovative blockchain-powered solutions for cross-border payments, a new rival, Remittix (RTX) is gently transforming the financial scene. Remittix is becoming the best crypto investment of the year surpassing these top crypto coins. Shiba Inu (SHIB) on the Verge of a Comeback Earlier driven down to the $0.000021 support by bearish pressure, optimistic momentum has now propelled it back to the $0.000025 resistance. Although the Shiba Inu price chart shows a 23% drop, which paints a more pessimistic image for the past month, the community attitude is still positive. This resiliency reflects the optimism of SHIB holders, who view this decline as an opportunity to buy the dips. Therefore, Shiba Inu is reaffirming itself as one of the promising altcoins to watch. Technical indicators suggest a rally is just around the corner. Although the Shiba Inu price is still below its all-time high (ATH) of $0.000088, experts think the meme coin will retest this mark during this bull run. Promising a profitable journey ahead, this dog-themed digital asset remains one of the most talked about altcoins as many people are anticipating the memecoin to surge massively this year. Dogecoin (DOGE) Witnesses Significant Volatility The considerable swings in the Dogecoin price in recent weeks have drawn attention. The Dogecoin price was rejected and plummeted to the $0.31 support level, where it has been consolidating, following reaching the $0.34 resistance zone. The general sentiment within the Dogecoin community stays quite positive despite the price volatility. But the Dogecoin price chart shows a clear bearish trend over the previous month. Technical indications show that Dogecoin might continue to undergo both corrections and increasing momentum in the near future. Looking ahead, many are still hopeful about Dogecoin’s long-term performance; some even think the memecoin might return to its all-time high of $0.737 in Q1 2025. Forecasting a possible price range between $0.26 and $1.33, the 2025 Dogecoin price prediction shows significant upside potential. Dogecoin is still regarded as one of the top altcoins to hold for those looking for long-term gains in the crypto market amid a strong community and expanding acceptance. Here Is How Remittix Is Set To Transform Cross Border Payments Remittix (RTX) is redefining global payments by integrating blockchain technology with fiat transactions, offering fast and cost-efficient cross-border solutions. With support for over 40 cryptocurrencies, including Cardano, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Ethereum, the platform provides instant conversions into fiat currencies like USD and GBP, enabling seamless deposits into recipients’ bank accounts. As a bridge between crypto and fiat, Remittix is the superior counterpart to traditional payment providers such as Stripe and Wise and crypto-exclusive platforms like Coinbase Wallet. Supporting 30+ fiat currencies and over 50 crypto pairs, Remittix ensures accessibility and inclusivity for businesses and individuals, simplifying global commerce with its extensive range of options. Furthermore notable is the platform’s open flat-fee approach, which offers savings and transparency over exorbitant costs and inadequate exchange rates of conventional banks. This approach guarantees that the full amount sent reaches the recipient, making Remittix a game-changer in the payments industry, where shady practices are unfortunately all too common. Currently priced at $0.0207 during its presale, the RTX token offers a compelling investment opportunity. Forecasts predict significant growth, with a 25x multiplier expected in the presale phase and over 1,500% gains after launch, as demand for innovative cross-border payment solutions continues to rise. Beyond their common emphasis on cross-border payments, XRP and Remittix’s ability to upend established financial institutions and provide actual answers calls for comparison. While Remittix is going one step further with its inclusive approach and excellent technology, XRP has shown the value of blockchain in worldwide banking. Remittix offers investors a chance to interact with a project with the potential same as XRP but at an earlier stage as the bitcoin market develops. RTX might not only equal XRP’s success but also alter the benchmarks for blockchain-based financial solutions with increasing acceptance, a solid basis, and evident market demand.

They offer a seamless and easy way to trade cryptocurrencies, eliminate existing entry barriers to the trillion-dollar market, and drive adoption on a global scale. Despite these, CEXes are susceptible to several security risks, are not privacy-focused, require extensive information before registration, and are in the purview of regulatory compliance agencies. The top exchanges require users to pass the Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations before creating an account. This poses a problem for enthusiasts looking to handle transactions without mandatory registration swiftly. With both exchange types riddled with substantial sticking points, Xgram, a seamless, decentralized, fast, and secure crypto exchange platform, was launched to address these problems. What is Xgram Cryptocurrency Exchange? Xgram is an advanced crypto exchanger that allows users to exchange assets. It is available on a web app and a Telegram mini-app , guaranteeing additional levels of convenience. To resolve existing industry challenges, Xgram merges CEX and its liquidity protocol to deliver a user-friendly, safe, and secure platform that processes private transactions. It leverages the best of both worlds, offering high liquidity and confidentiality. The team comprises reputable Web3 developers that combine and support both exchanges, eliminating the need to choose between security and liquidity. Xgram is the most flexible and user-friendly platform in the market and has amassed high ratings from popular monitoring sites. Expectedly, it has received accolades and tons of positive reviews from opinion leaders, influencers, and users, reaffirming its position as the most reliable and convenient crypto exchange platform. By combining the best of both exchange types, Xgram is ideal for both experienced traders and newbies. It is the perfect gateway into the crypto market for all and sundry. Benefits of Xgram Crypto Exchange Xgram is replete with amazing benefits, some of which include these: Proprietary Liquidity Protocol Most platforms rely on centralized exchanges for liquidity, leading to delays, higher fees, and sometimes, frozen funds. Xgram takes a different path; launching its proprietary liquidity product that ensures that all exchanges happen on the platform, dispelling the need for third parties. This promotes faster transaction processing time, lower cost, and most importantly, protects users from external risks and compliance concerns. Over time, centralized exchanges have been known to freeze users’ funds over suspicions of fraud, internal policies, and regulatory demands. This results in long delays and, in some cases, permanent loss of funds. Xgram resolves this problem. It operates independently, ensuring that all transactions take place on its secure platform. This shields customers’ funds from external and internal risks. Transactions Without Mandatory Registration While most crypto exchanges require users’ information to create an account, Xgram, in contrast, offers exchange services without registration. Thanks to decentralization, this platform ensures that your transactions remain confidential and that your information is not disclosed to third-party protocols. Furthermore, all transactions on the platform are safeguarded with cryptographic algorithms for utmost safety. The team only utilizes reputable and properly audited security protocols to offer reliable transactions with almost zero risks. Lower Transaction Fees and Faster Transaction Throughput Xgram’s recently launched proprietary liquidity feature expels intermediaries, therefore reducing the cost of transactions across the web app and Telegram mini-app. Additionally, the platform currently supports over 590 cryptocurrency pairs, offering you an opportunity to choose from a wide range of options. As expected, there is a round-the-clock customer service support team. There are no hidden charges or markups, and fees are as low as 0.1%. Xgram also guarantees faster transaction throughput—an average of 12 minutes. It is the perfect platform for crypto enthusiasts who value speed, privacy, security, and convenience. How to Use the Xgram Crypto Exchange via Telegram Mini-app and Web Here is a step-by-step guide to using Xgram’s Telegram mini-app Go to the Telegram bot and launch the service. Choose from the 590+ cryptocurrency pairs and specify the amount you want to exchange. Enter your receiving wallet address Transfer the specified amount by copying the deposit address and making the transfer. Doing this will take you to the next stage of the process. Monitor the process via the screen. It typically takes about 12 minutes to execute a transaction. Once it is completed, verify that you have received the right coin and amount. Xgram rewards you with XG tokens for additional benefits. Get internal XG tokens for transactions and get cashback at a better price! Only for the TG mini-app. A step-by-step guide to using Xgram via the web app. Visit the web app to get started. Select the coins you wish to exchange and set an amount. Enter your address and only your email address to continue Deposit the amount you want to exchange to the address Track your transaction progress via the screen. Like the mini-app, this will only take about 12 minutes to complete. Verify your coins have been received. There is a 24/7 customer support team available to offer necessary assistance before, during, and after your token exchange experience.

(NASDAQ: COIN) in the case filed by the U.S. SEC. The U.S. SEC accused Coinbase of operating as an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. However, Coinbase has vehemently denied the accusations and alleged that the agency under Chair gary gensler gary gensler Gary Gensler is a pioneer and the current chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He has extensive experience that spans Wall Street, government regulation, and an angel teaching about cryptocurrencies and blockchain at MIT. Gary S. Gensler was on born October 18, 1957, in Baltimore, Maryland.He graduated from Pikesville High School in 1975, where he was later given a Distinguished Alumnus award. He also earned a degree in economics.Gensler served in the United States Department of the Treasury as Assistant Secretary for Financial Markets from 1997 to 1999, then as Undersecretary for Domestic Finance from 1999 to 2001He has expressed his desire to present crypto-related approach changes later on that include token commitments, decentralized finance, stablecoins, guardianship, exchange-traded resources, and advancing stages. Chairman has refused to provide clear crypto regulatory guidance. Moreover, the U.S. SEC has been using archaic rules on nascent crypto and blockchain technology , thus crippling the U.S. web3 industry . Binance Taps On Coinbase’s Victory The U.S. SEC accused Binance Holdings of the same offense, in that the cryptocurrency has been operating as a securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency without the necessary approval. With the recent ruling of the Coinbase vs SEC case , which ordered the agency to offer a complete explanation of the cryptocurrency regulations under the federal securities law, Binance has now filed a notice of supplemental authority. Binance used the recent Coinbase vs SEC ruling as Exhibit A. Previously, Binance had requested the court to dismiss the SEC’s case due to a lack of satisfactory evidence of digital assets violating the Howey test.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin is trying hard to hold its momentum above $100K. This surge in value is partly attributed to the broader market response to Donald Trump’s election. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential of holding above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

This marks a 6.1% increase over the past week, signaling growing optimism among market participants. Amid this, there has been an interesting trend observed by a CryptoQuant analyst concerning Bitcoin’s on-chain metrics and investor activity. One key area of focus is the exchange netflow data. The CryptoQuant analyst known as KriptoBaykusV2 recently shared insights into the significance of exchange netflow, emphasizing its role in understanding market trends and investor behavior. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin’s Upward Cycle Back? Key Insights Into The Latest Recovery Bitcoin Defying Exchange Flow Trend Exchange netflow is a critical metric that tracks the net movement of cryptocurrencies into and out of trading platforms over a specific period. An increase in inflows to exchanges is often seen as a sign of potential selling pressure, as investors transfer assets to liquidate positions. Conversely, outflows indicate that investors are moving their holdings to private wallets, suggesting reduced trading activity and a preference to hold assets. According to KriptoBaykusV2, recent netflow data revealed a significant inflow of Bitcoin into exchanges on January 12. This raised concerns about a possible sell-off, as large inflows typically precede increased selling activity. However, despite the heightened inflow, KriptoBaykusV2 highlighted that Bitcoin’s price began to rise gradually from January 13 onwards, defying expectations. This trend suggests that the transferred Bitcoin was either not sold or that market demand absorbed the increased supply, keeping prices stable and eventually pushing them higher. Implications For Investors Undoubtedly, the relationship between exchange netflow and price movements offers valuable insights for investors navigating Bitcoin’s market. Significant inflows to exchanges are often perceived as a warning sign of selling pressure, but recent data has shown the importance of context. Market conditions and buyer demand can mitigate the impact of large inflows, as demonstrated by Bitcoin’s ongoing surge, according to KriptoBaykusV2. The analyst advises investors to analyze netflow data alongside other indicators to make informed decisions. KriptoBaykusV2 wrote: Go Beyond the Data: Netflow data alone is not a decision-making tool. On-chain metrics, social media sentiment, and market-wide news should also be considered. Meanwhile, at the time of writing, Bitcoin remains above $98,000. BTC’s price is now approaching the $100,000 price mark with a current trading price of $99,519. According to crypto analyst Javon Marks, Bitcoin is approaching a notable breakout which indicates the potential for another rally. $BTC (BITCOIN) IS APPROACHING A MASSIVE BREAKOUT 🔮!

Riot Platforms significantly expanded its mining capacity, achieving a 155% YoY increase in hash rate, making it the fastest-growing Bitcoin miner globally. Riot's strategy includes acquiring ready-to-run mining sites and diversifying energy sources, reducing reliance on Texas and benefiting from Kentucky's energy-saving programs. Riot's valuation benefits from its substantial Bitcoin holdings and innovative ""HODL strategy,"" positioning it for significant upside as Bitcoin prices rise. Authored by Dionysis Partsinevelos Investment Thesis Cryptocurrencies had a very strong run in 2024 due to a favorable regulatory environment and of course Donald Trump’s victory in November’s presidential election. Bitcoin specifically cruised through major catalysts, beginning with the approval of its first spot ETF in January, ending the year with a 121% gain. Likewise, smart money flowed into the markets to capture this upside, with a lot of them rushing to buy any public company related to Bitcoin. Exchanges like Coinbase, de-facto treasuries like MicroStrategy, but also, Bitcoin miners like Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) all saw increased attention from investors. While others choose to abstain from investing in what they don’t understand, we choose to deep-dive into it to understand the reason why such companies attract interest. We believe there is a big change underway in the bitcoin mining industry, and we want to make sure we are on time to capture as much of this untapped potential as possible. Riot’s operations and energy strategy The bitcoin mining game is a game of electricity and computational power. Success in this industry is defined by how efficiently a company can turn energy into mined bitcoin. Operational efficiency for bitcoin miners is measured in “exa hash” (EH/s), or simply, its hash rate. Back in July 2024, Riot was struggling with elevated fixed costs and not operating at its full capacity, with just 15.5 EH/s out of the maximum 23.3 EH/s possible . This inflated its fixed costs per Bitcoin mined, like staff salaries, equipment depreciation and stock-based compensation. According to a CoinShares report as of Q3 2024, Riot had the highest weighted-average cost per milliwatt ((MW)) among peers. MW helps us measure a company’s electricity capacity. CoinShares During the autumn of 2024, however, Riot made significant steps in expanding its mining operations. According to its December press release , the company managed to increase its deployed hash rate to 31.5 EH/s, a 155% increase YoY, which even outpaces the growth of the entire Bitcoin network. Meanwhile, its average operating hash rate improved to 27.4 EH/s. This basically allows Riot to mine more bitcoin without a parallel increase in costs. The fact is that Riot is the fastest growing miner in the world. It increased its mining capacity by 52% QoQ in Q3 2024 and by an additional 26% by December 2024. CoinShares We also like Riot's most recent move to combine the building of new mining facilities (a process that takes years and R&D investments) with an acquisition approach, targeting ready-to-run sites. Riot has recently purchased Block Mining , adding an additional 60 MW and 1 EH/s to its operations immediately, with plans to further expand to 16 additional EH/s by 2025. The acquisition also allows Riot to reduce its reliance on its Texas facilities by diversifying into Kentucky, where electricity is cheaper . Kentucky also offers special energy-saving programs that Riot can take advantage of. Its reliance on Texas energy has been a point of criticism by analysts. Riot Platforms Investor Presentation Riot’s ambitious goal is to reach 100 EH/s by 2027 and position itself as the leader in the mining industry. The Rise of Bitcoin Treasuries Riot Platforms and most of the bitcoin miners are beginning to favor the “HODL strategy”, slowly moving away from the traditional “mine & sell” business plan. This strategy essentially means that miners are now holding on to the Bitcoin that they mine instead of selling it immediately. CoinShares’ 2025 Outlook report highlights how Bitcoin miners are now deciding to leverage their Bitcoin reserves to secure loans and reinvest in more mining infrastructure or Bitcoin acquisitions. This essentially allows Bitcoin miners to acquire further value through their Bitcoin holdings, especially as Bitcoin’s price rises. This “bitcoin-as-a-collateral” model has been popularized in 2024 by none other than Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy. Riot’s Bitcoin holdings now serve three key purposes: They are a major source of revenue, they are being used as a financing tool, and they also attract the attention of investors. Riot can now grow its operations and infrastructure using an appreciating asset, while reducing their reliance on equity financing and share dilution. Valuation Analysis Valuing Bitcoin mining companies is a difficult task because we cannot rely on traditional cash flow calculations to measure intrinsic value. The majority of miners remain unprofitable, or their profits are insanely volatile and depend on Bitcoin’s price. For this reason, we choose to value Bitcoin miners using a few different and novel methods, such as their premium to NAV based on their Bitcoin holdings, their liquidation value, their power capacity, and price-to-book ratios. An increasingly popular valuation method is the premium to NAV. We personally believe that the rise of “Bitcoin treasuries” is something more analysts need to pay attention to. As of the end of 2024, Riot holds 17,722 Bitcoin on its balance sheet, valued at approximately $1.69 billion, assuming a BTC price of $95,000. The company’s liabilities stood around $173.3 million according to their latest earnings report. Therefore, Riot’s net BTC assets are worth around $1.51 billion. At a market cap of around $4 billion, the company trades at around 2.6x its NAV. This valuation is heavily reliant on Bitcoin’s price, but it also allows us to have a clear picture of how high the value of the company can go, should Bitcoin’s price keep increasing. At current BTC holdings, some examples include: $125,000 per BTC: Implied share price of $16 (30% upside) $200,000 per BTC: Implied share price of $27 (125% upside) $250,000 per BTC: Implied share price of $34 (183% upside) HedgeMix Now as long as the company keeps holding on to its mined Bitcoin, we can also expect its share price to increase while its NAV multiple remain steady. We believe this is an excellent way for a growing company to easily scale its operations until it reaches maximum operational capacity and energy efficiency, which will allow it to mine even more coins, with minimal costs. Some analysts are now recognizing this strategy as a viable way for companies to leverage their balance sheets and attract investor inflows. For example , JPMorgan has recently raised its price targets for a small number of Bitcoin miners, citing how they are now valuing these companies based on the value of their land, power, and Bitcoin holdings, which was referred to as the “HODL premium”. Another popular method of valuing companies that depend on electricity for their operations, is to value their current megawatts. VanEck’s report found that Bitcoin miners trade at around $4.5 million per megawatt of installed capacity. Factoring in Riot’s 1160 of MW as of December 2024, this values the company at around $5.2 billion. That is a potential upside of 31% from its current market cap. HedgeMix Lastly, Riot’s valuation is extremely attractive to us as its price-to-book ratio is significantly lower than the rest of its competitors. HedgeMix Our Bullish Point of View We maintain a very bullish outlook for Riot as we anticipate a number of catalysts and favorable market conditions to play out over the next couple years. First of all, we believe that the crypto market is still in its early stages of a bull run and Bitcoin finds itself in the middle of increased institutional adoption and favorable regulatory frameworks. There are more reasons to be bullish on crypto than not. Investors are also attracted to the rise of BTC-yielding companies, and it is clear to us that Riot is one of the few companies that will capture this interest over the next few years. This rise of “Bitcoin treasuries” has also brought to the table a novel approach to financing and growth for these companies. Thanks to this new approach of using Bitcoin as a financing tool, we expect that smart Bitcoin miners will keep accumulating coins in the short-term, in order to raise more funds through low-interest loans and invest in more infrastructure. This will significantly raise their hash rate and operational capacity. Additionally, as the Federal funds rate decreases throughout 2025 and 2026, it should act as a tailwind for companies that focus on increasing their debt financing. We are also excited about the potential that AI and high-performance computing (HPC) can offer to Bitcoin miners. VanEck estimates that miners that pivot towards AI and HPC could unlock an additional $37.6 billion in revenues by 2027. Riot already possesses the infrastructure needed for this shift, and with a strong balance sheet, we believe the company is going to make some big moves very soon. VanEck estimates that if the synergies between bitcoin mining, AI/HPC and energy grids continue to improve, the market cap of mining companies could double by 2028, even with Bitcoin’s price remaining stagnant. The $4.5M/MW valuation that was used in this report is significantly lower than the $30M/MW that is used for the average data center stock, leaving a huge valuation gap for Bitcoin miners. We are also expecting a more favorable M&A environment in 2025 and 2026, which should help bitcoin miners achieve better synergies and cost-effective growth. Finally, Riot is already getting some acknowledgment by ETF providers. For example, Defiance ETF recently announced its 2X long ETF on Riot , $RIOX, which seeks to provide 200% long daily targeted exposure to the Bitcoin miner. Takeaway message We maintain a very bullish outlook for Bitcoin miners over the next years. While the recent Bitcoin halving has raised mining difficulty, we anticipate that Riot’s growth in hashrate and operational capacity will help offset this very soon. Although Bitcoin’s price potential is uncertain, we are very optimistic about the digital currency in the long run. We believe that the company’s strategy to keep acquiring more coins and leveraging them to borrow and invest in infrastructure is a very intelligent move. The market is acknowledging this move since it is willing to pay a premium to the net assets of Riot. Now disregarding BTC’s price, there is also the potential for an AI/HPC pivot which is a large, untapped market. We are very optimistic that Riot’s plan to reach 100 EH/s by 2027 is on track, and perhaps can even be surpassed. Valuations for the stock are attractive, and we believe our bullish thesis is yet to be priced in.",RIOT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-17 05:31:21

Still, one key indicator shows a lack of excitement among U.S. investors. Late Thursday, Bloomberg reported that President-elect Donald Trump will likely issue an executive order announcing crypto as a national imperative or priority with a voice in his administration. Trump could also announce the creation of a crypto advisory that will advocate the digital asset industry's policy goals. The report comes amid heightened expectations that Trump will announce an executive order supporting the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve on the first day of the office. Trump, a one-time crypto skeptic, embraced the industry in the lead-up to the November elections, raising hopes for easier regulations and widespread adoption of digital assets. On Friday, the crypto industry will host the ""Inaugural Crypto Ball"" in support of Trump, hoping he will live up to his poll promises after taking office on Jan. 20. An executive order declaring the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve and policy priority would starkly contrast the largely anti-crypto Biden administration, under which agencies took more than 100 enforcement actions against the industry. Still, BTC is trading at a slight discount on the Nasdaq-listed Coinbase exchange relative to the global bourse Binance Holdings. It's a sign of muted stateside demand for the leading cryptocurrency. The chart by CryptoQuant shows gyrations in the Coinbase premium indicator, which measures the spread between BTC's price on Coinbase and Binance. BTC's November-December surge from $70,000 to over $108,000 was led by U.S. investors, as evident from the consistent Coinbase premium during that period. There's yet to be comparable bullish pricing on Coinbase, despite expectations for significant positive developments in the U.S. Perhaps much of the Trump optimism was factored in during the November-December rally, and stateside traders are now waiting to see if the incoming President to follow through on his promises. BTC changed hands at $101,600 at press time.

We’re currently testing previous highs, with the market hovering around the 2017-2018 highs at around $3.28. Although the price hasn’t sustained the breakout, the trend is still positive, with Bitcoin pushing higher. Fibonacci Extension Levels: The next key Fibonacci levels for XRP are around $4.20 and $5. These levels are based on the Fibonacci extension of the initial price movement. The $5 level is especially important as it is part of a larger pattern and tends to hold more significance in this scenario. The $4.20 level, while still relevant, may not be as strong. If XRP continues its upward trajectory, it could see these targets being tested in the near future. Short-Term Price Action: In terms of short-term movement, the overall uptrend is still intact. The key support zone has consistently held between the $2.52 and $2.94 range. The price has shown higher lows and lower highs, which indicates that the bullish structure is intact. During this consolidation phase, several triangle breakouts have been observed, and these often result in rapid price movement when the breakout happens. It’s important to know that these moves are not parabolic yet, but the trend is clearly leaning toward the upside. Support Levels: Current support levels are between $2.52 and $2.94. If the price dips into this area, it could be a buying opportunity. However, there is no guarantee of a pullback yet. If XRP breaks below the $2.52 level or the $2.30 level (the January 13th low), it could signal a reversal in the trend. The trend is still bullish, but a break below $2.52 could indicate a warning.

As Multicoin Capital proposes a dynamic token emission model to stabilize Solana's inflation rate, discussions around the potential launch of Solana-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) highlight the challenges of navigating complex SEC regulations. With industry experts divided on the timeline for ETF approval and broader concerns over tokenomics, the coming years may prove pivotal for Solana’s role in both the decentralized finance space and traditional investment markets. Multicoin Capital Proposes Variable Inflation Model to Address Solana’s Tokenomics Challenges Multicoin Capital has introduced a bold proposal to reform Solana’s token emission model, aiming to balance inflationary pressures with the need for robust network security. The proposal, known as SIMD-0228, suggests a dynamic, variable-rate system for Solana’s token issuance, designed to respond to shifts in staking participation and provide incentives for network validators. SIMD-0228 introduces a market-oriented approach to Solana’s tokenomics, wherein token issuance rates adjust according to the staking participation rate. This rate is determined by dividing the amount of staked SOL by the total circulating supply. The goal is to maintain a healthy 50% staking participation rate to ensure network security and economic stability. Under the proposed system: Below Target Participation: If staking participation falls below 50%, new token issuance would increase. This measure aims to attract stakers and validators, thereby bolstering network security. Above Target Participation: Conversely, when staking participation exceeds 50%, token issuance would be limited. A cap on inflationary rates ensures that the minting of new tokens is controlled, preventing excessive dilution of SOL holders’ investments. This adaptive model marks a significant departure from Solana’s current fixed-rate system. Inflation remains a contentious issue in the cryptocurrency space, as networks strive to balance validator incentives with the preservation of token value for holders. Solana’s tokenomics have been a subject of scrutiny, with critics arguing that previous changes disproportionately benefited validators at the expense of non-staking token holders. One such instance occurred in May 2024, when validators approved SIMD-0096, a proposal eliminating the protocol’s 50% fee-burning mechanism for validator priority fees. Instead, all priority fees were redirected to block producers, increasing rewards for validators. Despite garnering 77% approval, SIMD-0096 sparked heated debate. Critics warned that removing the fee-burning mechanism would exacerbate inflation, diluting the holdings of non-staking SOL holders. As of now, SIMD-0096 has yet to be implemented on the Solana mainnet. Current Staking Landscape and Validator Incentives According to data from StakingRewards, approximately 65% of SOL’s circulating supply is currently staked, reflecting a robust level of network participation. However, concerns about the long-term sustainability of Solana’s incentive model persist. Proponents of the new emission model argue that validator rewards from maximal extractable value (MEV) strategies provide sufficient incentives for validators. For instance, Jito, a Solana-based MEV block-building solution, generated over $100 million in tips for validators by December 2024. Advocates believe this supplemental income stream reduces the need for high inflationary rewards. By leveraging MEV strategies, Solana could potentially decrease its reliance on inflation-driven incentives, aligning with the goals outlined in SIMD-0228. Critics, however, caution that over-reliance on MEV income could introduce centralization risks and undermine the network’s decentralized ethos. The introduction of SIMD-0228 could reshape Solana’s economic model, with far-reaching implications for token holders, validators, and the broader ecosystem. While the proposal aims to stabilize inflation and encourage staking, its success hinges on widespread community support and effective implementation. Multicoin Capital’s proposal is set to ignite discussions across the Solana community, sparking questions about the trade-offs between inflation control and validator rewards. As Solana navigates these complexities, the outcome of SIMD-0228 could serve as a blueprint for other blockchain networks grappling with similar challenges. The Solana community now faces the task of weighing the benefits of a market-responsive inflation model against the potential risks to network decentralization and token value. The results of this debate could define the future of Solana’s tokenomics and its place in the broader cryptocurrency landscape. Solana ETFs Face Regulatory Uncertainty: Possible Launch Pushed to 2026 Despite Crypto-Friendly Administration In related news, the long-anticipated launch of Solana (SOL) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States may not materialize until 2026, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart. Despite a crypto-friendly outlook from the incoming Trump administration, Seyffart warns that regulatory hurdles, particularly from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), could delay progress for years. Speaking to Blockworks on Jan. 16, Seyffart expressed optimism about a potential shift in regulatory attitudes after President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. However, he cautioned that the SEC’s historical timeline for reviewing ETF filings—spanning 240 to 260 days—means issuers might not see movement on Solana ETF applications until 2026. “The SEC’s Division of Enforcement is calling Solana a security, which prevents other SEC divisions from analyzing it for a commodities ETF wrapper,” Seyffart said. The classification as a security presents a significant roadblock for issuers, as ongoing litigation further complicates the approval process. President-elect Trump has signaled his intent to position the United States as a global hub for cryptocurrency innovation. His administration is expected to appoint industry-friendly leaders to key regulatory roles, including the SEC. This policy shift could pave the way for greater acceptance of crypto-based financial products, such as Solana ETFs. During President Joe Biden’s tenure, the SEC adopted an aggressive enforcement stance toward cryptocurrency markets, bringing numerous legal actions against firms and exchanges. In 2024, however, the agency approved spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, representing significant milestones for the industry. Despite this progress, other crypto ETF applications, including those for Solana, remain stalled. The SEC’s treatment of Solana as a security has created a chilling effect on ETF issuers looking to include SOL in their offerings. In 2024, a surge of regulatory filings for ETFs holding altcoins—such as SOL, XRP, and Litecoin—was met with silence or outright rejection from the SEC. “A bunch of Solana ETF filings were made but weren’t acknowledged by the SEC—they were effectively denied outright,” Seyffart said. Some issuers have also proposed crypto index ETFs designed to hold diverse baskets of tokens. These filings, however, were speculative plays contingent on a Trump victory in the presidential race, according to Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Industry Divided on Solana ETF Prospects While Seyffart maintains that a Solana ETF is unlikely before 2026, other industry experts are more optimistic. In November 2024, Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of digital asset research, described the odds of a Solana ETF listing in the United States before the end of 2025 as “overwhelmingly high.” The discrepancy in outlook sheds light on the uncertainty surrounding the SEC’s approach to altcoin ETFs. The agency’s approval of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs suggests a willingness to expand cryptocurrency investment vehicles, but its stance on Solana and other altcoins remains opaque. The launch of Solana ETFs could mark a turning point for the cryptocurrency industry, providing institutional investors with a regulated pathway to gain exposure to SOL. However, the timeline remains uncertain, with regulatory hurdles and legal challenges posing significant obstacles. For now, issuers and investors must navigate a complex regulatory environment as they await clarity from the SEC and the incoming administration. Whether 2026 will finally bring Solana ETFs to US markets depends on a confluence of factors, including litigation outcomes, SEC leadership changes, and broader shifts in regulatory attitudes under President Trump.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-17 06:00:00

Les fonds, soit un total de 100 000 dollars, ont été transférés et peuvent être consultés via le portefeuille suivant : https://etherscan.io/address/0x5D1a7B8b3Ff10A11eD674FE51bfbcE5e63Cea0#tokentxns . Quant aux autres participants, qui ont accumulé des points en giflant leurs adversaires, en relevant des défis sociaux et en enregistrant leur Best Wallet , ils ont commencé à recevoir leurs tokens $SLAP dès 11 heures le jeudi 16 janvier. Pour éviter une vente massive de tokens immédiatement après la distribution, les récompenses $SLAP seront versées progressivement sur une période de 90 jours. Une approche pensée pour contrer les effets observés lors de précédents airdrops, comme celui de Hamster Kombat. Le tableau de classement du Slapdrop permet aux participants de suivre en détail leurs performances, avec une répartition claire : des Slap points, des Zealy points, du score global, de leur rang. À ce jour, pas moins de 4 908 portefeuilles affichent un score supérieur à zéro et figurent dans le classement. Vous pouvez voir les rangs sur Slapdrop .

In a statement today, PostFinance announced that it plans to expand its staking services to other cryptocurrencies in the near future. Staking involves allocating crypto assets to support blockchain transactions in exchange for rewards, making it an increasingly popular way for investors to earn passive income. PostFinance, which began offering cryptocurrency trading and custody services nearly a year ago, has become the first systemically important Swiss bank to introduce staking. The move underscores the bank’s commitment to embracing digital assets as interest in crypto continues to grow in Switzerland and beyond. Related News: Insidious Danger Awaiting Bitcoin and Altcoins: Analysts Warn Ahead The expansion comes amid a surge in crypto prices and renewed global interest in digital assets, driven in part by Donald Trump’s return to power in the United States, which has reignited debate over crypto-friendly policies. Interest in digital assets has been growing in Switzerland, known for its progressive approach to blockchain and crypto innovation. A group of Swiss crypto advocates recently proposed a national referendum that would require the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to hold bitcoin in its reserves alongside traditional assets like dollars, euros, and gold. While the proposal has attracted attention, it faces significant hurdles as the SNB is openly skeptical about the adoption of cryptocurrencies at a national level. *This is not investment advice.

Despite its large market capitalization, it achieved substantial gains in a short time. Over the past eight weeks, XRP has recorded an over 190% increase in value. To put this into perspective, Bitcoin took the entirety of 2024 to achieve a 124% gain. This comparison highlights XRP’s ability to achieve price growth at an accelerated pace compared to Bitcoin. XRP’s Price Movements Require Less Capital Crypto analyst Dom attributes XRP’s rapid price movement to low supply and thin order books. He emphasized that market capitalization alone does not dictate the ease of price movement. Instead, the liquidity in the order books plays a critical role. In an analysis shared on Twitter, Dom used data from Binance perpetual markets to demonstrate the disparity between XRP and Bitcoin in terms of the capital required for price shifts. According to his findings, approximately 985 million USDT is needed to buy 9,040 BTC and push its price by 25%. Conversely, only 59.73 million USDT is required to purchase 19.88 million XRP and achieve the same 25% price increase. This analysis suggests that triggering a 25% price jump in XRP is about 16.5 times easier than doing so with Bitcoin. The thinner order book of XRP accounts for this disparity, making it more prone to price volatility. Very informative post I shared last month, check it below if you haven't Many wonder how $XRP , having such a large marketcap can move so quickly & much higher, and the simple answer is low supply and thin orderbooks Let me put this into perspective using Binance perp markets as… https://t.co/s55nsqOqZi pic.twitter.com/MNRnA8XcqI — Dom (@traderview2) January 14, 2025 Liquidity and Supply Dynamics in XRP’s Market Dom further explained that XRP’s price surges are heavily influenced by the fragile state of its order books. Limited liquidity on the sell side creates conditions where significant buy pressure can lead to sharp upward price movements. In these situations, prices rise quickly until they encounter substantial resistance from larger sell orders. He also noted that this phenomenon is particularly evident in lower-priced assets like XRP, which typically have smaller liquidity pools compared to higher-priced assets such as Bitcoin. Moreover, Dom highlighted the behavior of XRP holders as a contributing factor to the asset’s price dynamics. Many XRP investors have held the token for extended periods, enduring substantial volatility. As a result, they are less likely to sell after moderate gains, even during periods of rapid price increases. With many viewing XRP as undervalued, its holders often aim to retain the asset for long-term gains, limiting the supply available in the market. Implications for XRP’s Future Price Movements According to Dom, the interplay of supply and demand is at the core of XRP’s price action. He concluded that the current market conditions, characterized by constrained supply and thin order books, allow for rapid price increases when demand surges. However, he cautioned that resistance levels would become more apparent as larger sell orders accumulate in the order books. As XRP gains momentum, understanding the mechanics of its price movements provides valuable insights for traders and investors alike. The current dynamics suggest that liquidity and holder behavior will remain pivotal in shaping the asset’s market trajectory.

However, it’s 1Fuel that many believe is an outside chance for 2025. As the market shifts its attention towards new blockchain opportunities, 1Fuel has stood out in its proposition, attracting the attention of investors. This performance has already given holders over 60% significant profits, thus showing its prospects in the future years. 1FUEL: Leading the charge in the DeFi revolution 1FUEL is leading the way in DeFi with a vision of adding simplicity, innovation, and power to users’ hands. This one-stop crypto wallet enables users to carry out single-click cross-chain transfers while maintaining privacy and security simultaneously. Offering cold storage-level security for its assets while still ensuring easy access, 1FUEL helps both newbies and experienced ones in the crypto sphere. The driving force of 1FUEL’s proposition lies in its progressive environment. Trading is done through a peer-to-peer exchange, which dials up the benefits of more participants joining in, thereby reaping the benefits of network externalities. Accompanying this is an attractive staking program providing for up to 30% annual percentage rate, which means passive income is now within the reach of investors. What is important to understand is that 1FUEL does not only consist of transactions and staking. With its planned virtual as well as physical debit cards, the firm seeks to ensure that it can be as easy to pay for goods and services using digital currencies as it is to use cash. More significantly, the project has already shown promise as they have been able to raise over $1.3 million in their presale stage which set a record. As tokens rose from $0.01 to $0.017 and considering analysts’ projection of a 500x increase that is expected post-launch, it is no surprise that 1FUEL is considered a perfect investment in 2025. 1FUEL means more than just a token; It is the key to the emerging world of secure, extinguishable, and optimal decentralized finance. By having millions raised during its presale and initial investors already reaping good profits, 1FUEL becomes a leading cryptocurrency investment for long-term profitability in 2025. Monero (XMR): A pillar of privacy and security in cryptocurrency Monero (XMR) is one of the best cryptocurrencies used by customers who value the privacy and security of their transactions. However, unlike most other digital assets, Monero uses today’s technologies like ring signatures, stealth addresses, and bulletproofs to make the transactions anonymous and inconvertible. These help users keep their financial identity anonymous amid ever-growing surveillance in the digital world. Currently, plans have been confirmed for Monero to be added to the Keystone Hardware Wallet starting in January 2025, jointly with Cake Wallet. This integration will improve security and privacy on the Monero network, and the pull request is still open. The collaboration represents the expansion of better user protection and convenience trends within the cryptocurrency market. So, for investors and users still intending to find a stable and quite private cryptocurrency, Monero remains a good option. It provides more anonymity, security, and distribution than currently popular cryptosystems. Monero trades at $213.46 having increased 8.72% in the past week Binance Coin (BNB): A resilient leader in the crypto market Binance Coin (BNB) continues to perform very well as a result of its strong symbiotic relationship with Binance. Currently listed at about $714 on CoinMarketCap, BNB is unique in that it can be used to buy traded coins and tokens, pay trading fees, stake, and participate in Initial Exchange Offerings. It will remain useful in the DeFi and CEX, and interested investors will include retail and institutional investors. New partners of BNB Chain involve the partnership with GAIMIN to grant support to developers in creating Web3 games, boost the coverage of blockchain gaming, and advance esports activities. Furthermore, BNB Chain has joined forces with Matrixdock, which has been recognized as the official Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization partner. These collaborations are based on ownership of assets and capital in the ecosystem aligned to sustainable patterns. These partnerships are particularly important because they stress the continued growth of BNB Chain towards becoming more dominant in the gaming and tokenization industries.

Bitcoin has broken past the $100,000 barrier, now trading around $101,000. That’s an 8% jump over the past week. This move has brought welcome reassurance to investors.

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $332 billion and a 24-hour average traded volume of around $20 billion, has stamped its dominance in the third position after recently displacing Tether USDT . The notable rise of XRP, amid the ongoing Bitcoin (BTC) rally , has signaled the onset of a much-anticipated altseason. Moreover, Bitcoin dominance has been forming a macro reversal pattern after being trapped in a rising trend for the past two years. When Spot XRP ETF? The idea of a spot XRP ETF has gained significant momentum in the recent past, fueled by the re-election of Donald Trump and other pro-crypto US leaders. Already, several companies – led by Bitwise, Canary Capital, WisdomTree, and 21Shares – have filed for a spot XRP ETF with the US SEC. As a result, Polymarket users believe there is a 70 percent chance the US SEC will approve a spot XRP ETF in 2025. Additionally, Polymarket users believe that there is a 52 percent chance that the US SEC will approve a spot XRP ETF by July 31, 2025. Market Impact Following the renewed demand for XRP among institutional investors, the market value is expected to continue rising in the coming months. Furthermore, XRP’s monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) has surged above 80 percent for the first time since November 2017 but has yet to reach a peak of around 90 percent. Additionally, the XRP/BTC has already rallied above the crucial multi-year resistance level, suggesting rising cash rotation from Bitcoin to XRP. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple News Today : Did US Crypto Reserve Rumors Fuel XRP Price? , Bigger Picture Since the 2023 ruling by Judge Analisa Torres, which concluded that XRP sales to retail investors do not constitute investment contracts, the demand for XRP among institutional investors has significantly surged. Furthermore, Ripple Labs has made deliberate moves to improve the mainstream adoption of XRP via the web3 ecosystem . For instance, Ripple Labs recently launched a fiat-backed stablecoin to supplement its cross-border operations. The blockchain payment company has also introduced smart contracts to the XRPL network, thus increasing its overall on-chain activities. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Giving first-hand visibility to the massive developer ecosystem that ZIGChain has. A full-fledged DEX with Standard AMM & CLMM capabilities together with a robust feature-rich roadmap, Oroswap (“Oro” Spanish for “gold”) is more than the promise of an on-chain marketplace.

However, we didn’t want just another DEX. Having past experience in AI & machine learning, we wanted to deliver a product that would supremely improve the user experience for the community and set a standard for all dApps building on ZIGChain – build great products but with superior UI / UX in mind. With Oroswap, we aim to deliver that,” the OROSwap team shared, The Oroswap DEX will be a major dApp on the ZIGChain blockchain and an innovative decentralized exchange experience for wealth managers. Abdul Rafay Gadit , Co-Founder of Zignaly and ZIGChain said, “The team behind Oroswap are some of the brightest developers in the Web2 & Web3 space with an amazing journey that spans AI, Machine Learning, Gamification & even the Bitcoin ecosystem! For us to have such seasoned developers choosing ZIGChain to build on as a way for them to give back to the community is a testament to all the work we have been putting in.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, is leading this recovery, trading at $101,380. Other top coins, including XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin, also saw strong gains of 8.5%, 7%, and 3.8%, respectively. CPI Report Brings Optimism The recent rise in crypto prices follows the release of the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for December. The report showed a 0.4% increase , slightly above the expected 0.3%. Compared to last year, the CPI is up 2.9%, meeting predictions. These numbers suggest inflation is still an issue, but the steady improvement has reassured investors. Litecoin ETF May Get Approval Litecoin is gaining attention as the Nasdaq filed for a Litecoin ETF . This follows updated feedback from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Experts believe the chances of approval are now higher, creating excitement in the market. Bitcoin ETFs See Strong Inflows Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are seeing strong demand. On January 16, Bitcoin ETFs recorded an inflow of $626.1 million , following a $755 million inflow the day before. BlackRock, a leading asset manager, contributed $527.9 million to this surge. These inflows show growing interest in BTC after days of outflow. Liquidations Push Prices Higher The rise in crypto prices has been followed by a wave of liquidations in the derivatives market. Over $326 million worth of positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours, with $182 million being short positions. This means traders betting against the market were forced to close their trades. Binance recorded the largest single liquidation, worth $6.09 million. Bitcoin Stays Strong Above $100,000 Bitcoin has successfully held its position above the critical $100,000 mark, a psychological support level that boosts investor confidence. Many analysts believe this stability could aim for $105,000 if buying pressure remains steady. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Oh, it’s claiming the throne in the top ICO presale rankings. Buckle up for a ride through the quirkiest corners of crypto town. BTFD Coin has the crypto world on its toes. Not only has it amassed jaw-dropping presale numbers, but its 90% APY staking feature is also a certified game-changer.

So, whether you’re a HODLer, a staker, or just here for the memes, let’s dive into why BTFD Coin, GIGA, and NPC are making waves this week.

With a presale price of $0.000142, this meme token is not just riding the wave but steering the ship. It’s a top ICO presale darling for good reason: a staggering 90% APY staking reward. Imagine investing $5,000 at today’s price. You’d bag a hefty 35,211,268 tokens. If the price rises to a conservative $0.0006, your tokens could be worth $21,126. That’s a serious glow-up for your portfolio, right? But BTFD Coin isn’t stopping at staking. Its ecosystem is packed with exciting features like a Play-to-Earn game , where your gaming prowess converts into real rewards, and the Bulls Squad community, adding charm and camaraderie to this crypto adventure. Want in on this action? The presale is heating up—secure your spot before the next stage kicks off. GIGA: Big Goals, Bigger Community What happens when a meme meets self-improvement vibes? You get GIGA, a token that doesn’t just live on Solana but thrives on the ethos of becoming your best self. With a current price of $0.063220 and a market cap of $588M, GIGA is flexing its influence. Sure, it dipped 4% recently, but with over $27M in daily trading volume, GIGA isn’t sweating the small stuff. Beyond the numbers, GIGA’s community-driven philosophy is what sets it apart. It’s not just a coin; it’s a movement. If you’re into memes with a side of motivation, GIGA might just be your new favorite. NPC: The Meme-Fungible Hybrid Non-Playable Coin is here to remind us that even ERC20 tokens can have personality. With a unique design that lets you switch between meme coin and NFT, NPC is all about blending culture with liquidity. It’s like getting two cryptos for the price of one. Currently trading at $0.023602 and up 22% in the last 24 hours, NPC is catching eyes faster than a viral TikTok trend. Its circulating supply matches the human population (talk about inclusivity), and its ability to transform into an NFT makes it a collectible and tradable gem. The 22% leap isn’t just hype—it’s backed by a strong vision. As it builds new infrastructure to link liquidity between ERC20 and ERC1155 tokens, NPC is proving it’s more than just a meme. It’s a blueprint for the future of hybrid crypto projects. Why BTFD Coin Is Your Best Bet While GIGA motivates and NPC innovates, BTFD Coin combines these qualities into a meme coin powerhouse.

It signals growing institutional interest in BTC again as BTC price surged past the $100K level in a strong bullish momentum. Macro factors have acted as major support for the bullish momentum. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Inflows Resume Again BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) scooped a massive 5,250 Bitcoins yesterday, which is nearly 12 times the daily production value of 450 BTC. This shows that the institutional appetite for Bitcoins is growing once again as BTC breaches an important resistance of $100K levels. Source: Apollo Since the beginning of 2025, IBIT has witnessed a mixed bag of inflows and outflows and currently has $55.691 billion in net assets under management. While the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF managed to his this milestone within a year of launch, the firm’s gold ETF took two decades to reach the same figure. As per data from Farside Investors , the net inflows on Thursday stood at $626 million, with BlackRock’s IBIT alone capturing 85% of the total share. Ark Invest’s ARKB stood second registering more than $155 million in inflows yesterday. Earlier this week, BlackRock launched Bitcoin ETF variant on the CBOE exchange in Canada, amid the soaring global demand. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said Fidelity made a swift move by cutting the fee charged on its Canada BTC ETF to 32bps, matching with fees on BlackRock ETFs. Fidelity is cutting the fee on its Canada bitcoin ETF to 32bps to match BlackRock who just launched one up there at 32bps. Both are now the cheapest in the market.

As of press time, the price of Bitcoin today is trading 2% up at $101,334 with its market cap crossing $2 trillion. As per the Coinglass data, the 24-hour liquidations have also shot up to $90 million, of which $50 million is in short liquidations. On-chain indicators are also showing strength with the Bitcoin exchange balance hitting a 7-year low. This supply shock can provide a further catalyst for the BTC price rally to continue.

Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher stated: “Clearing the range high was step one, but Bitcoin must surpass the previous high at $102,500 to confirm a new uptrend.” Failing to break this level could see Bitcoin re-enter its prior range, leading to sideways movement, he added. Deutscher pointed to the upcoming Trump inauguration as a significant market catalyst.

Rumours of a US Crypto Reserve Featuring XRP It was a story published in the New York Post that triggered discussions about the possible inclusion of Ripple’s XRP in the proposed crypto reserve. When asked whether they have any role in spreading rumours regarding XRP’s probable entry into the reserve, the company denied any role in planting the story. XRP’s Record Price Surge In the last five days alone, the XRP market has seen a growth of around 32.48%. At the start of this month, the price was at $2.0841. Since then, it has surged by around 59.17%. Yesterday, the market touched a seven-year peak of $3.40. Right now, it stands at $3.3204. Experts think that retail investors and whale transactions played a key role in the surge witnessed in the XRP market lately.

The liquidity on the XRPL DEX quadrupled indicating increased market activity. In conclusion, Trump’s criticism of Ripple and the ensuing market frenzy around XRP highlight the delicate intersection of politics, crypto and market sentiment. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

With its fast transaction speeds and low fees, However, TRON faces competition from other innovative projects like BigBossInu, which are offering new DeFi solutions and have the potential to outperform in the upcoming market cycle. Bitcoin (BTC) continues to dominate the cryptocurrency landscape as the most widely recognized and valuable digital asset. Though not likely to deliver 18,000% gains, Bitcoin’s stability offers a strong base as investors explore high-growth altcoins. >>>> Conclusion BigBossInu , along with established assets like Ethereum, Polygon (MATIC), TRON, and Bitcoin, is positioned for significant growth. While Bitcoin and Ethereum will continue to play a major role in the market, analysts are closely watching BigBossInu due to its unique approach and high potential for outpacing even the biggest names in the crypto world.

Musk Saves California (MUSKCALI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKCALI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Saves California can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Saves California could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Saves California launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Saves California on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Saves California by entering its contract address – 2mtzeaYqDPLtCemX5jNPuuq8jw65cbgNUXuT3fBra2M2 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKCALI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-17 07:26:00

The order, which may come shortly after his Jan. 20 inauguration or even on day one , is intended to guide government agencies to work with the crypto industry, according to the report. It is also expected to involve the creation of a “crypto advisory council” to advocate for the industry’s policy priorities. Trump plans to release an executive order elevating crypto as a policy priority and giving industry insiders a voice within his administration https://t.co/egBFjchxsO — Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) January 16, 2025 Crypto Priorities For Trump The order could also direct agencies to review digital asset policies and pause crypto-related litigation, the sources said. “Stopping legal actions that have targeted a range of companies from Binance, the world’s biggest crypto exchange, to startup Ripple Labs, is a top priority for the industry,” they added. Ripple’s native token, XRP, has already reacted to the possibility of its four-year battle with the SEC ending by surging close to its all-time high in late trading on Thursday. The creation of a national Bitcoin strategic reserve encompassing the government’s existing BTC holdings is also under consideration, according to Bloomberg’s anonymous sources. The US government held more than 213,000 BTC as of August 2024, currently worth around $21.5 billion, according to CoinGecko. There was a scare earlier this month that a portion of it from Silk Road seizures would be sold off, but this turned out to be more FUD. According to the New York Post, a more controversial concept of an “America-first strategic reserve” would “prioritize digital coins founded in the US, like Solana, USD Coin, and Ripple’s XRP.” Meanwhile, the New York Times reported that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse encouraged Trump to include other crypto assets beyond BTC in its potential strategic reserve.

Tasked with steering the $600 million initiative to fruition, Bock’s arrival signifies a critical alignment of strategic vision and seasoned expertise. A Proven Leader in Blockchain Innovation Marius Bock ’s tenure in blockchain innovation established him as a force in blockchain strategy, scalability, and adoption. His experience spans guiding multi-million-dollar projects and fostering technological advancements within a highly competitive sector. Bock focused on expanding the blockchain’s practical applications, enhancing its decentralization, and navigating regulatory challenges—skills perfectly suited to BlockDAG’s current trajectory. With a proven track record of tackling complex blockchain initiatives, Bock is poised to accelerate BlockDAG’s growth. His ability to blend technical acumen with a forward-looking approach ensures that BlockDAG remains ahead in delivering its high-performance blockchain solutions. Aligning Expertise with Vision BlockDAG aims to redefine blockchain scalability, addressing inefficiencies inherent in traditional blockchain models. Its presale success, amassing over $181 million and engaging 170,000 unique holders, reflects strong market confidence. With Bock’s leadership, the project’s mission to achieve a $600 million target gains a key architect. Bock’s strategy-driven leadership style is expected to streamline BlockDAG’s execution of its multi-phase roadmap. This includes deploying cutting-edge solutions for transaction speed, cost efficiency, and energy consumption. His insights into bridging technical innovation with real-world applications will be instrumental as BlockDAG positions itself as a go-to platform for decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and enterprise-grade blockchain solutions. Building on Early Momentum BlockDAG’s testnet launch in September 2024 marked a milestone, offering features like smart contracts, MetaMask integration, and an advanced Blockchain Explorer. Early user feedback highlighted its scalability and ease of use. Bock’s role will be to harness this momentum, ensuring the seamless transition from testnet to mainnet while optimizing performance metrics. Additionally, BlockDAG’s presale trajectory, climbing in value to $0.0248 per BDAG coin in batch 27, underscores buyer confidence. Bock’s challenge lies in sustaining this enthusiasm by delivering measurable milestones and fortifying stakeholder trust through transparency and innovation. A Future-Focused Strategy One of Bock’s primary focuses will be the adoption of BlockDAG’s technology across diverse industries. By leveraging his Cardano experience, he can attract enterprise clients seeking scalable blockchain solutions. This outreach will include education, healthcare, and supply chain sectors, where blockchain technology offers transformative potential. Moreover, Bock’s expertise in navigating regulatory landscapes will help BlockDAG anticipate and address compliance challenges. Establishing global partnerships, fostering interoperability, and advocating for industry standards are expected to form key pillars of his strategy. His emphasis on these aspects will not only enhance BlockDAG’s credibility but also expand its user base. Strengthening Community & Buyer Confidence Blockchain success is rooted in community engagement, and Bock’s approach reflects this understanding. By prioritizing transparency and regular communication, he plans to strengthen relationships with both retail and institutional traders. Initiatives such as “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) sessions, detailed project updates, and collaborative feedback mechanisms are expected under his leadership. Additionally, Bock will focus on maximizing the potential of BlockDAG’s ecosystem, including its X1 Crypto Miner App , which enables daily BDAG mining. Empowering users with practical tools that integrate seamlessly into their digital workflows will reinforce BlockDAG’s market position. What’s Next! Marius Bock’s addition to BlockDAG is more than a personnel shift; it’s a strategic enhancement that aligns a proven blockchain veteran with one of the sector’s most ambitious projects. His vision, bolstered by years of experience, will be instrumental in achieving BlockDAG’s $600 million goal while delivering a blockchain platform capable of meeting the demands of tomorrow. As BlockDAG advances its mission, stakeholders can anticipate a period of focused execution, bolstered by Bock’s ability to translate bold ideas into tangible results. The synergy between leadership expertise and innovative technology positions BlockDAG as a compelling force in shaping the future of decentralized systems.

According to individuals who requested anonymity to discuss an executive order that has not been publicly released, the incoming administration is also expected to establish a crypto advisory council to advocate for the industry’s policy priorities. Trump’s incoming administration is expected to favor their stance on cryptos In a recent interview, Ron Hammond, senior director of government relations at the Blockchain Association, said that such a crypto council would consist of crypto executives, with individual firms responsible for selecting their representatives. Trump’s incoming administration, slated to begin next Monday, is expected to favor their stance on cryptocurrencies. It is unclear whether a crypto executive order will come to fruition on the day of Trump’s inauguration or within the first week. The Washington Post reported on Monday that one of Trump’s forthcoming executive orders might involve repealing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s contentious crypto accounting guidance, SAB 121. The President-elect is also open to establishing an “America-first” strategic reserve that prioritizes coins founded in the U.S., such as USDC, SOL, and XRP. Trump notes that he intends to form a strategic crypto reserve to position the nation as the leader of the crypto sector. Trump vows to lead the crypto industry with bold initiatives In his first days in office, Trump has pledged to issue a series of executive orders addressing various sectors and issues. Kara Calvert, vice president for US policy at Coinbase Global Inc., the nation’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, said: “What I think Donald Trump is going to do is signal that the United States is back and ready to lead in this industry. What it’s signaling to other countries is be careful, or you won’t keep up.” ~ Kara Calvert Despite regulatory hurdles under Biden, the US crypto industry expanded, with major financial firms, including BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager, launching spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds last year. BNY Mellon has been working to grow its crypto custody services, and Cantor Fitzgerald announced plans to launch a Bitcoin financing business. Trump supported the crypto industry during his presidential campaign last year. In July, he headlined a Bitcoin conference, pledging to make the US the crypto capital of the world. Trump-branded collections of non-fungible tokens have been released for several years, and last year, he and his sons announced a crypto venture called World Liberty Financial, designed to enable people to earn and borrow crypto. However, it has yet to deliver those services.

The broader crypto market has recovered after a recent dip, and Bitcoin (BTC) is trading above the $100,000 level again. The crypto market at large has seemingly recovered from its recent downturn, with BTC reclaiming its position at around the $100,000 level. With the inauguration of Donald Trump just days away, we expect the market to maintain its current strength. Husky Inu (HINU), one of the newest memecoins to grace the crypto world, is ready for the upcoming run. Experts predict immense growth for this Solana-based memecoin. Husky Inu (HINU) Presale Nears $700,000 Husky Inu is the latest memecoin to join the Solana blockchain. Affectionately known as Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) new best friend, Husky Inu, was created to bring its holders more utility and value by leveraging the power of Solana. Husky Inu and its native token, HINU, aim to disrupt the memecoin industry by building a supportive community boasting innovative features and improved rewards. The project recently launched the presale for its native token, HINU and is doing immensely well. Since going live, the presale has generated over $695,000. Husky Inu is working on exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. According to the platform, the Earn App will reward users for engaging with the platform and completing simple tasks such as liking, sharing and reposting content. On the other hand, the DEX will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU token holders. Husky Inu owes its stand-out presale performance to some fantastic features. The project is committed to maintaining a reliable token ecosystem using a carefully designed distribution model and a capped maximum supply to ensure scarcity and value. The project has capped its total supply to 100 billion tokens and boasts a unique deflationary supply element. The deflationary aspect means that 50% of all platform fees collected from the upcoming Husky Inu Exchange and DEX will be used to buy and then burn $HINU tokens and, in such a way, reduce the circulating HINU supply. As we near the altcoin season, we see an influx of funds move to smaller projects where investors expect to make immense potential returns. While BTC remains steadfast in its leading position, currently trading for $101,595 , experts predict that altcoins may see multiple gains as investors expand their portfolio beyond only BTC. Husky Inu (HINU) Likely to Explode in 2025 It is clear to see why the memecoin sector attracts the attention it does. Often, these projects enter the crypto sphere motivated purely by speculation and fun, but specific tokens stand out for their ability to move beyond their beginnings. Husky Inu and its developmental plans have already positioned itself as a promising candidate, and its future roadmap displays the traits of a profitable investment. As we see investors move beyond the realm of BTC, smaller altcoin projects, like HINU, are likely to see a significant surge in investment. Hurry Up and Buy HINU Presale Tokens!

Binance Enhances Trade Offerings For Pepe Coin Echoing Optimism According to an official Binance release dated January 17, the crypto exchange’s P2P division is adding support for Pepe Coin. Notably, PEPE is now enabled against Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region fiat currencies, the announcement added. The platform’s colossal user base can directly buy and sell the token in the new trading pairs across the MENA region. This enhanced offering, providing more market exposure to the asset, paves a bullish path for future movements as the demand is expected to rise. As a result, market watchers expect a bolstered market stand for the meme coin ahead in the wake of one of the top crypto exchanges expanding support for it. Simultaneously, it’s noteworthy that the broader crypto market’s recovery movement has added to optimism surrounding the frog-themed meme coin. Despite CoinGape’s report that revealed a massive 588 billion PEPE deposit by a smart whale , investors continue to eye the crypto bullishly in light of the abovementioned update. Also, a stockpile of other market technicals paves a bullish path for the token’s future movements. Is PEPE Readying For Massive Gains? At the time of reporting, PEPE price witnessed a nearly 1% uptick in value and is currently sitting at $0.00001857. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $0.00001798 and $0.00001886, respectively. The weekly chart for the crypto shows a 7.5% uptick in value. The rising movement has sparked noteworthy investor enthusiasm in tandem with Binance’s announcement. Intriguingly, renowned market expert Max, CEO of BecauseBitcoin, has recently posted on X, spotlighting a bullish trend for Pepe Coin. Focusing on the Coinbase chart for the token, the analyst highlights the formation of a giant bullish compression, indicating a bullish breakout ahead. However, this bullish anticipation should also fall in line with Ethereum (ETH), given the second-largest crypto does not crash. Also, a recent PEPE price prediction by CoinGape has further cemented sentiments of additional gains for the token ahead, with the possibility of the token overtaking Shiba Inu. Against the backdrop of strong market technicals, Pepe Coin showcases the potential rebound and retest the 2024 high of $0.00002826, which is up by 52% from the current level. Investors are gauging in at the critical points mentioned above, expecting more gains ahead. Overall, market watchers constantly monitor the meme token for price action changes amid dynamic market trends and Binance’s listing The post Binance Expands Support For Pepe Coin In MENA Region, What’s Next For PEPE? appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Altcoin News|Binance|Binance listing|Pepe Coin (PEPE),EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB|PEPE,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-01-17 07:41:02

""It Will Continue in 2025!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/good-news-from-jpmorgan-for-bitcoin-btc-investors-it-will-continue-in-2025/,"Banking giant JPMorgan said in its latest report that Bitcoin's dominance over Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins will continue in 2025. According to The Block, analysts stated that they expect Bitcoin (BTC) dominance to continue in 2025. JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said: “We think Bitcoin's dominance against Ethereum and other altcoins will continue this year for a number of reasons.” Listing these reasons, JP Morgan analysts said that Bitcoin will continue its 55% market dominance in 2025, thanks to important factors such as strong inflows in spot Bitcoin ETFs, ongoing MicroStrategy purchases, and the US creating a national Bitcoin reserve. Analysts recently said that the positive regulations and regulatory clarity that the Trump administration will make will also benefit altcoins, but delays in US crypto policies could prolong the consolidation process in altcoins. This will ensure that Bitcoin remains the first-choice asset and continues to dominate altcoins. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Good News from JPMorgan for Bitcoin (BTC) Investors!

The incident occurred after the woman met her victim on a chat app a few months ago. On January 7th, the woman reportedly stole her friend’s phone from their home in Jeju City and used it to access the victim’s crypto holdings. She sold the cryptocurrency for cash, transferring the funds to her own bank accounts. The suspect fled the scene but was tracked down quickly after the victim reported the theft. Police arrested her in Gomi, North Jeolla Province, on January 8th. The woman reportedly confessed that her motive was to pay off debts. Authorities are continuing to investigate the case. This follows previous incidents in South Korea where individuals have been sentenced for similar crimes involving cryptocurrency theft. In December 2024, a South Korean banker was sentenced to 15 years in prison for stealing $12.4 million from his employer, Woori Bank, to fund his cryptocurrency addiction. Over a period of 10 months, the banker forged loan documents, funneled money into his accounts, and spent $10.4 million on crypto investments. Unfortunately, he lost $4.35 million in failed crypto ventures. The court ordered him to repay 10.52 billion won ($7.3 million). While $3 million worth of assets were seized, the remaining $4 million is considered unrecoverable.

Unnamed sources believed to have knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg that the order could create a crypto advisory council and direct government agencies to collaborate with the industry. Chances are the returning president could sign it on Jan. 20, they added. Discussions are reportedly underway for the order to include a directive for all federal agencies to review their crypto policies, with the possibility of pausing ongoing litigation against major industry players. As previously reported by crypto.news, some of these changes are expected to be spearheaded by the new SEC under Trump, led by crypto-friendly Paul Atkins. Under the Biden administration, regulators have brought enforcement actions against prominent firms like Binance and Ripple . The regulator has argued that many cryptocurrencies qualify as securities under the Howey Test. Such enforcement actions and the lack of regulatory clarity have made it difficult for crypto companies to operate within the United States, pushing some to explore friendlier jurisdictions abroad. You might also like: Donald Trump Jr. joins Kalshi as a strategic advisor According to the sources, another consideration of the executive order is the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. This reserve would allow the U.S. government to consolidate and manage its existing crypto holdings, which reportedly total nearly $20 billion, primarily in Bitcoin seized from criminal investigations. Trump embraced the idea of making the U.S. a leader in crypto during his campaign, pledging to turn it into the “crypto capital of the world.” Advocates view the proposed Bitcoin reserve as both an inflation hedge and a way to tackle the national debt. Bitcoin has recovered back above $100,000, fueled by optimism over Trump’s anticipated crypto order and hopes for a supportive regulatory shift. However, sources noted that the order has not been finalized and could be revised before it is made public. Market participants expect these changes to reestablish the U.S. as a leader in the crypto industry. Trump’s policy changes will be a hint that the United States is back and ready to lead, Kara Calvert, vice president for U.S. policy at Coinbase, told Bloomberg. “What it’s signaling to other countries is be careful, or you won’t keep up,” she added. In related news, another report suggests that Trump is considering an “America-first” crypto reserve strategy, which would prioritize U.S.-founded digital assets such as Solana, USD Coin (USDC), and Ripple’s (XRP).

Using Reppo as a connective tissue, AI agents can directly relay needs and negotiate data access from owners across the spectrum without intermediaries, unlocking price discovery and demand for data that would otherwise remain siloed. To facilitate this, the team is building an intent-centric Data Exchange, powered by Anoma and secured by Gateway Protocol. Reppo’s unique approach leverages programmable IP co-ownership as the incentive mechanism to ensure fair use and compensation for data owners—who may not know the immediate value of their data—to benefit from downstream revenue generated by derived IP and its usage. Raghav (RG) Rmadya, CEO and Founder of Reppo Labs, commented “Anyone claiming to build a blockchain specifically for AI is most likely a scam. It’s nothing more than a narrative play. Most blockchains today can already support agentic workflows and AI applications. The more likely future is that each agent or application will have its own chain. In such a world, models, agents, and applications will need permissionless ways to self-source their fuel i.e. data to grow and stay relevant. The days of spoon-feeding AI will soon be over. Unfortunately, current data sources and pipelines are drying up. Ilya Sutskever highlighted this problem at NeurIPS last year, and the recent acquisition of Carbon by Perplexity underscores the growing demand for novel data connectors in the AI industry. Web3 has experimented with DataDAOs as a potential solution, but they are yet to prove scalable. Not all data in the world is user-owned; business-owned data is vast and often untapped. For instance, DePIN node operators generate enormous amounts of operational data that might seem mundane to some but is gold to us. Incentives for these data owners are completely missing. When off-chain dark data becomes accessible to AI builders and agents, amazing things can happen. One example is our work incubating AI auditors for solar farms on the Glow Network. These auditors, trained entirely on off-chain data, automate and decentralize network audits that currently rely on centralized actors. The same applies to many other DePINs. The Crypto x AI ecosystem is starved for niche and novel data—the ‘good nectar.’ Anyone building ‘decentralized’ models or agents today either relies on the same on-chain data streams, pre-cleaned and parameterized datasets, or centralized LLMs trained on a mere 0.1% of the world’s data while competing in a zero-sum game. It’s ironic, to say the least.” Brad Holden, Partner at Protocol VC, said, “What excites us about Reppo is the team’s ability to contextualize and solve challenges they encountered during their time at Filecoin for the broader Web3 and AI ecosystem. Their focus on making off-chain data accessible to build practical AI/ML models and agents is critical for tackling bottlenecks like insurance underwriting, node auditing, and SLA management for blockchain networks, especially for DePINs that we at Protocol VC are ultra bullish on. Few teams take such a systems approach to solving wicked problems and it was a no-brainer for us to partner with Reppo. I’m ecstatic about their mission to democratize permissionless access to previously untapped data for AI developers and agents.” The $2.2 million funding included participation from Protocol Labs, CV VC, CMS Holdings, and a significant portion was raised on Echo.xyz, the first allocation being sold out in less than 10 minutes.

The surge fueled investors’ bullish sentiment, with some market watchers forecasting a breakout to new highs. Related Reading: XRP Hits Seven-Year High After 16% Surge, Is A New ATH Around The Corner? Chainlink Whales Go On Buying Spree Chainlink jumped 9% in the past day, tapping the $23 mark for the first time in ten days. LINK rallied alongside the rest of the market during the post-election pump, surging 200% in one month. During this rally, the cryptocurrency surpassed its Mach 2024 high of $22 and reached a new multi-year high of $30. However, the December pullbacks halted LINK’s momentum, with Chainlink hovering between $20 and $25 for the rest of the month. LINK attempted to retest the $25 resistance zone during the start-of-year run but retraced during the recent market corrections, driving the price to $18, its lowest level in over a month. Amid the current market recovery, the cryptocurrency has surged 27% from its Monday low and caught the attention of analysts and large-scale investors. Altcoin Sherpa signaled that LINK could likely see a “V shape reverse up” following the recovery from the recent market “nuke.” On Thursday, Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that whales have “heavily accumulated” LINK in the last few days. According to the post, large-scale investors have purchased 1.35 million LINK, worth around $31 million, since January 14. It’s worth noting that whales have purchased significant amounts of LINK over the past weeks. In late December, Chainlink whales bought around 3.58 million LINK tokens, valued at $77 million. Meanwhile, on-chain data shared by the analyst shows that these wallets had acquired 1.4 million tokens in the first four days of 2025. LINK Holds Crucial Level Martinez suggested that the buying pressure could further impulse LINK’s momentum. Chainlink has been forming a bull pennant since hitting its December high and failed to break above the upper trendline earlier this month. However, today’s jump sent LINK’s price past the pattern’s upper trendline and, according to the analyst, eyes at the $50 target. Crypto analyst Jelle noted that Chainlink tested a key resistance into support. The analyst previously stated that Chainlink’s weekly chart was “slowly turning into a true thing of beauty” after the “painful retest” and holding the key level “firmly.” Related Reading: Ethereum Recovers From Drop Below $3,000: Analyst Points At 2021 Rally Similarities Jelle pointed out that LINK turned the $18-20 resistance zone into support after the recent retrace and rebound. This zone has been a crucial horizontal level for the token, as Chainlink has rallied to its all-time high (ATH) and new local highs when it was turned into support. Ultimately, Jelle set LINK’s initial target to $30 before the run to new ATHs. As of this writing, Chainlink is trading at $23.56, a 6% increase in the daily timeframe.

Brandt tells his 773,500 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin may surge nearly 50% from its current value. However, he warns that based on Bayesian analysis, a statistical method that evaluates future outcomes based on historical trends and new data, there remains a possibility that Bitcoin may suddenly plummet by more than 50%. “Preface: what I am saying here will completely confuse those of you who are single narrative dogmatic investors. I am a Bayesian, open at the same time to multiple narratives. I’ve forecast $135,000 +/-$15,000 for BTC in 2025. But, as a Bayesian, I still assign the possibility that BTC is constructing a massive top for a 50%+ decline. Do I hedge my bets based on Bayesian priors – of course I do. Being aware of risks comes from being a 50-year career trader.” Source: Peter Brandt/X Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests that Bitcoin may plummet if it completes the bearish head-and-shoulders pattern (H&S) on the daily chart. A head-and-shoulders pattern typically suggests that an asset is losing momentum and could reverse its uptrend if the price breaks below the structure’s support. However, Brandt also says that BTC appears to be flashing a bullish price pattern using the terms bump, hump, slump and dump. The pattern, which was also witnessed last year before BTC surged from $50,000 to above $100,000, suggests that BTC may “dump” to around $84,000 before recovering and ascending toward $150,000. “The big question in my mind is whether Bitcoin will get one more dump (or more lengthy congestive chop) before the pump. Remember, markets generally do not [soar] until retail traders get worn out.” Bitcoin is trading for $100,029 at time of writing. Brandt next weighs in on Ethereum ( ETH ) competitor Cardano ( ADA ). He believes that ADA has reached a local market bottom at $0.81 on the weekly chart and is gearing up for a massive breakout that will flip $1.09 into support. “Altseason? Make no doubt about it, Cardano has bottomed for a grand bull market.” Source: Peter Brandt/X ADA is trading for $1.09 at time of writing, up 4.9% in the last 24 hours.

Breaking the 36-month consolidation has flashed massive bullish signals for the token, which is now believed to achieve a fresh milestone and enter the top 10 cryptos. Besides, the chain has been strengthening every new day, highlighting the rising bullish sentiments for the Hedera & HBAR prices. Why is the HBAR price rising? Will the price reach $1 this bull run? The past week was one of the most exciting weeks for Hedera, which helped the price move so fast. Some of headlines include Several banks in the Philippines are launching peso-backed stablecoin PHPX on the Hedera network Grayscale looking at a potential spot HBAR ETF A record-breaking $41.65 million in USDC flowing into the Hedera network HBAR recorded over $2 million spot inflows With this, HBAR has gained among the top spots in leading social and market activity after Litecoin, which flashes massive bullish signals for the crypto. What’s next for the HBAR price? The above historical chart of HBAR shows that the price has broken the 3-year consolidation, elevating the RSI levels above the upper threshold. The weekly RSI has entered the overbought zone for the first time since the 2021 bull run, reviving the hopes of a similar bull run hereafter. On the other hand, the token appears to be primed for another push as the 50/200-day weekly MA is heading towards a bullish crossover, commonly called the ‘Golden Cross’. Other positive factors to consider here are the bullish sentiments rising to 90.6% for the crypto, Donald Trump’s upcoming presidency boosting the markets with friendlier SEC rules & clearer regulations and importantly, rising inflation in the U.S. Therefore, the Hedera (HBAR) price has launched a massive bullish attack and hence is believed to smash a new ATH above $0.6, provided it surpasses the interim resistances at $0.44 and $0.57.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|LTC|MARKET|TRADING|HBAR,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-17 08:08:23

Technology trade groups TechNet and NetChoice filed a lawsuit on Jan. 16 to challenge the CFPB’s regulatory approach. The complaint is based on a rule published by the CFPB in December 2024. This rule expands the agency’s regulatory jurisdiction to ‘general-use digital consumer payment applications,’ targeting big companies including Apple Pay, Google Wallet, PayPal as well as digital wallet providers and non-bank financial service providers. TechNet, a partnership of technology professionals, and NetChoice, an organization campaigning for internet freedom, argue the CFPB’s action is excessive. They claim that the bureau aims to centralize authority over an innovative sector without showing proof of regulatory deficiencies that justify federal intervention. Industry expert challenges CFPB’s rule The CFPB’s rule allows the agency to conduct proactive investigations of payment applications to ensure they comply with federal privacy and fraud laws. The agency also claims that increased control will protect personal information, decrease fraud, and combat illegal banking, in which individuals are illegally denied access to financial services. NetChoice’s head of litigation, Chris Marchese, criticized the rule, saying it undermines the rule of law, expands the administrative state, and threatens American consumers and creativity. “The CFPB’s unlawful power grab undermines the rule of law, further bloats the administrative state, and puts American consumers and innovation at risk,” NetChoice’s director of litigation, Marchese, said. NetChoice Joins TechNet to Challenge Biden CFPB’s Power Grab Over Digital Payments CONTACT: PRESS@NETCHOICE.ORG WASHINGTON—Today, NetChoice joined @TechNetUpdate in a new lawsuit to protect consumers, businesses and innovation from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau… pic.twitter.com/3OJMmXHbzA — NetChoice (@NetChoice) January 16, 2025 The plaintiffs also assert that payment applications are already subject to strict state rules and that federal oversight creates additional impediments for businesses. They argue that this could result in greater consumer costs and fewer options in the digital payments ecosystem. CFPB lawsuit filed on the same day the bureau penalized Block Inc. The lawsuit was filed on the same day that the bureau penalized Cash App’s parent business, Block Inc., for allegedly failing to provide necessary fraud precautions. According to the CFPB, Block sent fraud victims to their banks for transaction reversals rather than resolving the concerns internally. The settlement calls for up to $120 million in compensation and a $55 million fee for the CFPB’s victim relief fund. The CFPB’s regulatory efforts go beyond payment apps. On Jan. 10, the government proposed a rule requiring crypto asset service providers to reimburse users for losses caused by cyberattacks or frauds. This rule has not been implemented yet. The outcome of this court case could have serious consequences for the digital payments industry. If the court agrees with the CFPB, payment applications may face more intricate compliance rules that will further increase operational expenses. If the complainants are successful, it may limit the agency’s authority to oversee developing technologies and leave control to state governments.

Indeed, the evolution of DeFAI (or AiFi, if you prefer) has been one of the hottest trends in web3 for a while now, with autonomous AI agents increasingly deployed to conduct trades, audit smart contracts, analyze markets, and much more. While there is a long list of projects striving to bring the AI economy on-chain, one in particular deserves special mention: Singularity Finance . An EVM-compatible Layer-2 blockchain designed specifically to support AI-powered financial services, it came about as the consequence of a merger between decentralized portfolio management venture SingularityDAO and Cogito Finance, a project specializing in RWAs. Having recently launched its first incentivized testnet ahead of a scheduled mainnet release in 2025, now is a good time to learn more about the project’s bonafides and vision. From DeFi to DeFAI Bringing AI capabilities to the realm of blockchain, and in particular DeFi, is a tantalizing prospect – and one that has already been put into action: the AI agent market, as defined by the value of the platform’s native tokens, is now worth a cool 16.3 billion and rising fast. And there are plenty of use-cases yet to be explored. What Singularity Finance represents, then, is a gateway to the world of DeFAI for businesses, institutions, and retail users; a venue where they can cut their teeth on the new frontier of DeFi, safe in the knowledge that AI capabilities have been brought on-chain in a transparent and accessible way. AI Hardware ownership is no longer only available to whales.. The Future of DeFAI starts now – $SFI pic.twitter.com/GeMGN6jH1p — Singularity Finance (@Singularity_Fi) January 11, 2025 Built on the open-source OP Stack to ensure full compatibility with Ethereum , the AI-optimized Layer-2 furnishes developers with familiar tools while leveraging the PoS chain’s security and extensive builder community. But don’t take that at face value: the aforementioned testnet is a great opportunity to find out exactly what the network has to offer. Having started on December 30, and set to run for three months, the incentivized testnet allows the Singularity team to evaluate the network’s scalability and security while giving the community valuable hands-on experience with future mainnet features. Participants can engage in all manner of activities, from conducting transactions on testnet dApps (staking, bridging, etc) to testing wallet features, identifying bugs, writing tutorials, completing social tasks, and so on. Naturally, rewards are the main ‘carrot’ in this scenario: the testnet favors a gamified reward system, with a leaderboard tracking user engagement and dispensing rewards accordingly. Integration with MetaMask, meanwhile, provides a familiar entry-point for users and enables seamless testing of transactions and token management, among other benefits. For those interested in putting the network through its paces, test tokens are distributed daily and can be requested at https://faucet-testnet.singularityfinance.ai/ . The testnet block explorer, meanwhile, is accessible through https://explorer-testnet.singularityfinance.ai . Ultimately, the testnet serves as a platform to attract and educate people/protocols about the benefits the network has to offer. Needless to say, the soon-to-be listed Singularity Finance’s native token (SFI) serves as the project’s backbone, functioning similarly to ETH on Ethereum for gas fees while also playing economic and governance roles. The token supply will accommodate both existing token-holders from the merger and future development needs, with a clear conversion ratio for SDAO and CGV owners based on a daily moving price average. When Will Mainnet Launch? With a mainnet launch expected to closely follow the testnet in Q2, Singularity Finance is gearing up to support a broad swathe of real-world applications and cement itself as a pillar of the burgeoning AiFi sector. Among the Layer-2’s most notable planned features are Optimistic Rollup infrastructure, Account Abstraction, SFI vaults, oracles, and bridges, with the chain itself very much in the high-scalability, low-cost bracket. Ultimately, Singularity Finance hopes to create an irresistible environment for web3 developers looking to innovate in DeFAI, and for users intent on seizing yield-bearing opportunities. The platform’s steadfast commitment to ecosystem development is evidenced by its new grant program, an initiative that supports builders who contribute to the network’s growth. Whether the DeFAI sector leads to the creation and popularization of more efficient, accessible, and sophisticated financial services remains to be seen. But there’s no denying the trend’s momentum, or the ambition of cutting-edge platforms like Singularity Finance to positively shape its future.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Bitcoin stagnates, investors are turning to Remittix as the next big crypto opportunity for Q1 2025, with its PayFi utility poised to rival top altcoins like Solana and Shiba Inu. Table of Contents The explosive growth of Solana and SHIB price SHIB price trajectory and Solana price forecast Remittix: One of the best crypto options in 2025 Recent Bitcoin price movements have taken it further from its 30-day high. A rebound after a brief stoop below the $90,000 price level on Monday extends BTC’s oscillation between the $105,000 and $90,000 mark to almost a month. Bitcoin’s lackluster performance has triggered a hunt for the best crypto investment in Q1 in the altcoin market. Investors quickly identified Remittix (RTX) as a perfect fit for description; they believe the utility of this PayFi project outshines the bullish case of other top altcoins. Big market players and institutional investors have wasted no time having a piece of RTX. However, can Remittix live up to market expectations? Can it be the next Solana or Shiba Inu or even more? Let’s review the details and answer these questions. The explosive growth of Solana and SHIB price Back in 2021, the value of Solana took off, flipping the investments of early adopters with parabolic movements. As a foundational blockchain, Solana enjoyed growth in the migration and integration of developers and projects due to its robust infrastructure and developer-friendly ecosystem. This growth attracted interest from crypto whales, and major institutions pushed SOL even higher. SHIB price also skyrocketed, despite its meme origins, expanding developments within its ecosystem (i.e., ShibaSwap and metaverse integrations). Shiba Inu capitalized on community strength, maximizing the hype and developing real-world utilities and solutions. Solana and Shiba Inu have grown to become top altcoins with secured spots in the best crypto options available in the market. Both projects addressed market gaps: Solana streamlined high-performance blockchain solutions, and Shiba Inu democratized crypto access through community-driven initiatives. The key takeaway? Real utility combined with market demand creates unstoppable momentum. This is the same formula experts observed in Remittix. You might also like: Solana and Dogecoin holders rush to buy Remittix SHIB price trajectory and Solana price forecast The SHIB price chart shows it suffered an intra-day drop of approximately 2.6% and a month-long slump of 19.20%. At press time, SHIB trades at $0.00002097 after slipping past the $0.000021 support. Analysts predict further price drops in January, especially if SHIB falls past the $0.00001950 level this week. Solana’s wobbly movements have seen SOL move sideways since last Tuesday, registering little gains and losses. Solana sells at $186.2 per token, consolidating below the $190 resistance. Market metrics such as the RSI and EMA indicators further suggest a pull-back would be difficult, painting a gloomy picture in the Solana price prediction. However, should SOL ETFs get a green light under the current administration, SOL could be heading for a new all-time high since last November. The dull performance of SHIB price movements and the gloomy picture of Solana price prediction suggest both altcoins might sit firmly in the red in the second half of January. Remittix: One of the best crypto options in 2025 Experts highlight Remittix’s mission to solve one of the most persistent problems in global finance: inefficient cross-border payments. Its technology offers a real-world solution with broad market demand, positioning it for mass adoption. Remittix aims to eliminate these barriers by allowing businesses to make instantaneous fiat payments using cryptocurrency assets all for a modest flat fee. As institutional investors and crypto whales continue to accumulate Remittix tokens, the market is taking notice. Its compelling utility, combined with a growing demand for efficient payment systems, suggests that Remittix is on the path to becoming one of the biggest projects in the market. For those searching for the next Solana or Shiba Inu or the best crypto investments in 2025, Remittix is not too far away; at only $0.0207 per token, users could grab tokens and watch RTX head to the moon. The whales are already moving. To learn more about Remittix, visit the website and socials.

Learning how to research altcoins can greatly help you in making better choices and avoiding any potential losses. This guide will offer you practical steps towards analyzing altcoins and finding a good opportunity. Understanding the Purpose of the Altcoin Begin by researching what the altcoin aims to achieve. A good starting point is the project’s website and whitepaper . These documents explain its goals, the problems it seeks to solve, and how it plans to do so. Compare the coin’s purpose with existing projects. Is it offering something unique? Or is it a copy of another cryptocurrency with minimal changes? Take note of its real-world applications. Altcoins with clear, practical use cases often have a stronger foundation than those with vague promises. Team and Partnerships The team behind an altcoin plays a crucial role in its success. Check their professional backgrounds, experience in blockchain , and previous accomplishments. LinkedIn profiles and social media accounts can provide insights into their expertise and credibility. Strong partnerships with established companies or organizations can also indicate potential. Partnerships show that the project has external support and validation, which can help it grow and attract more users. Technology and Features Evaluate the technology powering the altcoin. Key points to consider include: Blockchain Infrastructure : Is the coin built on its own blockchain or a popular network like Ethereum ? Scalability : Can the technology handle growth and increased user activity without major issues? Security : How does the project protect its network and users from attacks? Many altcoins introduce innovative features to attract attention. Review these features critically. Are they practical and beneficial, or just marketing gimmicks? Market Performance and Liquidity Understanding an altcoin’s market performance can help you gauge its current standing. Look at: Market Capitalization : This shows the total value of the coin. A higher market cap generally indicates stability but may also limit rapid growth potential. Trading Volume : High trading volume reflects active interest and liquidity, making it easier to buy or sell the coin . Price Trends : Analyze historical price patterns. Steady growth may suggest strong fundamentals, while sharp spikes followed by drops could indicate speculative behavior. A table can help organize this data for comparison: Metric What to Look For Market Capitalization Mid-range to high for stability Trading Volume Consistently high for liquidity Price Trends Gradual growth vs. wild swings Community and Engagement The strength of a project’s community can signal its future potential. Check social media platforms, forums, and chat groups to gauge the level of engagement. Active communities often contribute to a project’s success by spreading awareness and attracting new users. However, watch for warning signs, like excessive hype without substance. Genuine engagement focuses on meaningful discussions, while unhealthy hype often involves exaggerated claims and promises. Roadmap and Progress A clear and realistic roadmap shows where the project is headed. Review the timeline for planned features, partnerships, and other milestones. Look for signs of progress. Has the team delivered on past promises? Regular updates and transparency are good indicators of a committed team. Be cautious with projects that frequently delay or fail to meet their stated goals. Regulatory and Legal Considerations Regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies vary by region, and some altcoins may face legal challenges. Check if the altcoin complies with relevant laws in major markets. Non-compliance can lead to restrictions or bans, affecting the coin’s value and adoption. Projects that prioritize transparency and operate within legal boundaries often inspire more trust among investors. Competitor Analysis Every altcoin operates within a competitive space. Compare the coin with its peers: What makes this altcoin stand out? Does it solve the same problems better than its competitors? How does its price and market performance compare? Competitor analysis can help you determine if an altcoin is truly worth your investment or if better options are available. Risk Assessment Altcoins carry varying levels of risk. Assess potential red flags, including: Unrealistic promises : Beware of claims that seem too good to be true. Anonymous teams : Lack of transparency about the team can be a warning sign. Low adoption : Coins with minimal real-world use may struggle to gain traction. Balancing potential rewards against risks will help you make more informed decisions. Practical Tools for Evaluation Use online tools to simplify your research. Some popular platforms include: Tool Purpose CoinMarketCap Market data and rankings Glassnode On-chain analytics CryptoCompare Price tracking and comparisons GitHub Open-source code and development activity These tools can provide valuable information to complement your analysis. Evaluating altcoins requires time, effort, and critical thinking. By focusing on purpose, team, technology, and other key factors, you can identify coins with strong potential and reduce your risk. While no strategy guarantees success, informed decisions will always give you a better chance in this fast-changing market.",Reviews|ALTCOINS,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-01-17 09:26:11

In fact, CryptoQuant has observed a significant Bitcoin inflow to Coinbase Prime, pointing to increased over-the-counter (OTC) trading activity. This trend suggests heightened interest from US institutions, which prefer OTC trades as a method for large-scale Bitcoin accumulation to minimize market disruption. Bitcoin Inflows to Coinbase Prime The alert threshold, set at an inflow value exceeding $8 billion, has been surpassed, with the current value standing at over $14 billion. This significant inflow evidences a strong institutional interest, with OTC trading playing a crucial role in facilitating these transactions. OTC trading involves direct, off-exchange transactions between buyers and sellers, typically facilitated by brokers or trading desks. This method allows institutions and high-net-worth individuals to execute large trades with minimal impact on the market. According to Finery Markets’ 2024 Review , the cryptocurrency OTC market saw remarkable growth, with an annual rate of 106% last year. The report stated that 2024 was a transformative year for institutional and large-scale digital asset trading, spurred by macroeconomic trends and industry-specific factors. This includes the launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the election of pro-crypto President Donald Trump, as well as the subsequent regulatory developments. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant’s alert threshold was exceeded soon after Bitcoin touched $100,000 on Thursday – for the first time in 2025. This has prompted market experts to believe that the crypto asset could climb to a new ATH by late January. Crypto as a National Priority? After a modest correction, Bitcoin was back up and trading above $102,000 at the time of writing. This comes amidst reports of President-elect Donald Trump planning to issue an executive order making cryptocurrency a national priority soon after his Jan. 20 inauguration. The order aims to guide government agencies in collaborating with the industry and establishing a “crypto advisory council” to influence policy development. It may also direct agencies to review existing digital asset regulations and pause ongoing crypto-related lawsuits, including high-profile cases involving Binance and Ripple Labs. Additionally, Trump’s administration is considering creating a national Bitcoin strategic reserve, potentially expanding to include U.S.-founded digital assets such as Solana, USD Coin, and Ripple’s XRP.

The network hashrate has risen 2% month-to-date to an average of 793 exahashes per second (EH/s) and is 51% higher than a year ago, the report said. The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty. The hashprice, a measure of daily mining profitability, has dropped less than 1% since the end of December, the bank noted, as ""hashrate growth outpaced BTC price movement."" ""Miners earned ~$54,900 in daily block reward revenue per EH/s over the first two weeks of January,"" analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote, which was 2% less than last month. The combined hashrate of the 14 U.S.-listed miners in the bank's coverage has more than doubled in the last 12 months and now accounts for roughly 30% of the global network. The total market cap of the mining stocks that the bank tracks has increased 16%, or $4.5 billion, in the first two weeks of the year. Riot Platforms (RIOT) outperformed, with a 32% gain, and Bitdeer underperformed, with a 4% decline. Bitcoin has increased about 56% since the halving event in April, around 44% since the U.S. presidential election in November, and is up 134% year-on-year, the report said.

The proposal , authored by Tushar Jain and Vishal Kankani of Multicoin Capital, aims to reduce Solana's inflation. As of January 2025, Solana’s annual inflation rate stands at 4.78% and is set to gradually decrease 15% after each 180-epoch period, according to Mitrade Insights . That represents over $5 billion worth of SOL per year at current prices. The proposal underscores a need for Solana to evolve as more experts introduce their own ideas for optimizing the network. It also highlights concerns about inflationary pressures on Solana’s SOL token.

Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) momentum is turning bearish despite holding above $90,000, as Matrixport reports expanding lower Bollinger Bands, an approaching Greed & Fear Index of 10 — a historically key level for tradable lows — and a growing chance of downside. In a Friday research note, analysts at the Singapore -based blockchain firm said the 30-day rolling return is “nearing -10%, a level that has slowed or reversed downtrends since late 2022,” suggesting a potential opportunity for a trend reversal if key support levels hold. Bitcoin’s price BTC/USDT on a monthly basis | Source: crypto.news Bitcoin is still above the 21-week moving average, which technically keeps it in a bull market. But trading volumes are down, Matrixport notes, adding that “stablecoin minting remains subdued.” “Speculative activity is notably muted, as evidenced by low funding rates, adding to the overall cautious sentiment in the market.” Matrixport You might also like: Over 50% of Americans sold gold and stocks to buy Bitcoin, survey shows Traders are also locking in profits quickly. Historically, when Bitcoin surged over 40% within 30 days, it often peaked or entered a consolidation phase, the analysts note, adding that December’s rally fits this pattern. As of press time, the trend model remains bearish, but Matrixport highlights a key turning point: if Bitcoin breaks above $103,000 the trend could flip bullish. However, “the longer Bitcoin consolidates, the lower the trigger price point for a bullish signal becomes, increasing the potential for a trend reversal,” Matrixport notes. The report also suggests that the $90,000 level appears to be holding due to recent inflows of capital from altcoins into Bitcoin, though the analysts warning that “this signal line is declining.” Despite the bearish signals, Bitcoin’s “inherent volatility and wealth creation potential” still attract strategic investors, particularly during pullbacks, the analysts concluded.

This comes amid the latest accumulation spree initiated by large investors known as whales. DOGEUSD. Source: TradingView Recall that the OG meme coin was hit hard during the broader market’s crash at the end of 2024, and its price tumbled from over $0.4 to $0.26 within days. Since then, though, DOGE has been steadily rising and managed to defend the $0.3 support even during the latest correction that occurred at the start of the current business week. Moreover, it bounced off in a spectacular fashion and jumped to $0.38 by Thursday. The bulls really stepped up on the gas pedal in the past several hours as they pushed its valuation to almost $0.42 for the first time since December 12. Aside from the more obvious overall market resurgance, the other highly probable reason behind this impressive rally is the awakening of DOGE whales.

Hedera ( HBAR ) rallied for four consecutive days to reach a 38-month high of $0.399 on Jan. 17, with its market cap briefly surpassing Stellar Lumens ( XLM ) before settling at $14.5 billion at press time. HBAR’s recent gains were accompanied by a surge in activity and demand among traders, as reflected in the doubling of its trading volume to over $2.65 billion in the last 24 hours and a 25% rise in open interest in the futures market, reaching $562.46 million during the same period. Several catalysts helped fuel HBAR’s rally and could potentially extend the gains in the coming weeks. First, the project has been expanding its presence in the RWA tokenization sector, as highlighted by its recent partnership with gemstone certification giant World Gemological Institute and luxury Web3 fintech Vaultik to tokenize around $3 billion worth of diamonds and other luxury items on the Hedera blockchain network. HBAR also benefitted from speculation around the approval of a spot HBAR exchange-traded fund by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the incoming Trump administration. Notably, Canary, a fund manager, has already filed for an HBAR-focused ETF, and some analysts believe it has a stronger chance of being approved in 2025, ahead of others such as Ripple, Solana, and Litecoin .

Analysts at crypto.news have previously reported that the HBAR daily chart had formed a bull-flag pattern, a strong bullish signal in technical analysis. Based on these indicators, the altcoin is likely to rally to $0.45, a level it has not breached since November 2021, a breakout of this level could see it rallying towards the psychological resistance level at $0.50. Beyond the aforementioned reasons, the HBAR rally could also gain additional support from a strong Bitcoin rally ahead of Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20.

Announced in a Jan. 16 blog post, the service allows users to stake as little as 0.1 Ether—approximately $331—making it accessible to a wider audience. Traditionally, Ether staking requires a minimum of 32 Ether, a threshold many individual investors find prohibitive. PostFinance Making Ether Staking Accessible to Millions Alexander Thoma, head of digital assets at PostFinance, highlighted the seamless integration of this new service into the bank’s existing offerings. “The staking service is completely integrated into PostFinance’s existing services. Customers can view their staking rewards directly in their asset statement alongside other crypto holdings,” Thoma explained. The staking initiative, which locks Ether for a minimum term of 12 weeks, is based on native staking directly on the Ethereum blockchain. While Ether is the only supported token at launch, the bank has indicated plans to expand its staking services to other cryptocurrencies in the future. A Growing Trend in Traditional Banking PostFinance’s move reflects a broader trend of traditional financial institutions embracing cryptocurrency. Notably, in December, Anchorage Digital became the first U.S. federally chartered bank to support liquid Ether staking. The growing adoption of crypto staking services is in line with the Ethereum network’s increasing popularity, as evidenced by over 33 million Ether currently staked—an exponential rise from just 682,000 in December 2020, according to Beacon Chain data. Despite competition from liquid staking platforms like Lido Finance, which commands 28% of the Ether staking market, and Coinbase with 9.5%, PostFinance’s emphasis on simplicity and accessibility could carve out a significant niche for itself. Expanding Crypto Offerings Founded in 1906 as the financial services arm of Swiss Post, PostFinance has gradually strengthened its position in the digital asset landscape. In April 2023, the bank partnered with Sygnum to launch crypto trading and custody services, which went live in February. It has also dabbled in crypto collectibles, issuing digital stamps linked to physical counterparts as early as 2021. Notably, Sygnum bank achieved unicorn status with $58 million funding earlier in January. With approximately $136 billion under management, PostFinance’s foray into Ether staking underscores its commitment to innovation in financial services.

In a call on Jan. 16, known as Execution Layer Meeting 203, led by Tim Beiko, Protocol Support Lead at the Ethereum ( ETH ) Foundation, the developers reviewed the progress of the Pectra upgrade, which will be implemented after the Dencun update. The team confirmed that Pectra Devnet5, a specialized developer testing network created for Ethereum developers to trial the Pectra upgrade, is now live. https://twitter.com/terencechain/status/1879892324353991052 What issues will Pectra upgrade solve? The Pectra upgrade is a paramount step in addressing some of the core issues facing Ethereum, such as scaling issues. Previously, on Mar. 28, the founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin himself, pointed to these challenges. Cooling of the network during peak user traffic has caused slow transaction times and a rise in gas fees due to the cap on the capacity of high-volume transactions. To change this, Pectra would work on improving the efficiency of Ethereum’s consensus layer by creating a smoother transaction validating process and bottleneck mitigation. Ensuring this would make sure Ethereum remains reliable as the blockchain continues to become rather sophisticated. “High demand is driving up transaction fees that make Ethereum expensive for the average user. The disk space needed to run an Ethereum client is growing at a fast rate”, reads Ethereum’s roadmap , making it a good time to introduce the upgrade. You might also like: Top 5 reasons why Ethereum could take off in 2025 While the Pectra upgrade, on its own, does not directly affect gas prices , it will lay the groundwork for other more wallet-friendly upgrades to come. Layer 2 solutions, like Arbitrum ( ARB ) and Optimism ( OP ), take transactions off-chain and are already working toward reducing gas fees. Petra will reduce network burden and pressure by promoting efficiency during peak hours. Further, a major part of the Pectra upgrade is that it introduces accessibility. By guiding hardware requirements for validators, it will be easy for individuals to be part of the team responsible for securing the blockchain. This democratization results in more decentralization, which promotes increased security for the blockchain as a whole. When will the Pectra upgrade launch? Assuming that testing phases proceed normally, the Pectra upgrade is currently envisioned for mainnet activation, possibly in March 2025, as per Jan. 9 call. As reported earlier, the Pectra upgrade was already launched on the Mekong testnet in November 2024, developers plan to finalize a launch timeline as soon as issues left on the Pectra Devnet 5 and public testnets like Sepolia and Holesky get resolved in February 2025. instead of launching another devnet, devs are planning to test pending pectra spec changes in a shadow fork of the sepolia and/or holesky testnets. keep in mind the above is a tentative and optimistic timeline for pectra activation on testnets and mainnet. — Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) January 16, 2025 bugs and issues in code found during testing may delay the timeline. still, odds are looking higher after today's call for a mainnet activation for pectra sometime in march! stay tuned for the full writeup of acde #203 coming out tomorrow! — Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) January 16, 2025 However, developers have said that delays could occur, though, should any major bugs or other compatibility issues get caught during the public testnet upgrades. For now, the first test at fork is tentatively scheduled for the week of Feb. 12. However, the timing of the second test would depend on the client release schedule, said Beiko.

Bitcoin (BTC) continued its upward trajectory, briefly reaching $102,000 before a marginal drop to its current level of $101,482. The flagship currency increased just over 2% over the past 24 hours and almost 8% over the past week. If BTC can stay above $100,000, bulls will set their sights on its all-time high and a move past $110,000. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has registered a marginal decline over the past 24 hours. However, it has remained above $3,300 and could see a potential recovery. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) continues to set the market alight and is up over 8%, trading around $3.32, with bulls eying the $3.50 level. XRP is up a staggering 44% over the past week. Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA) , Dogecoin (DOGE), Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR), Polkadot (DOT), and Litecoin (LTC) also registered substantial gains. Altcoin Market Continues Rally While Bitcoin (BTC) stalled around $102,000, the altcoin market lit up with trading activity, pushing prices higher. The altcoin market registered an increase of $88 billion on Thursday, indicating investors were pivoting towards altcoins as BTC and ETH stalled. The shift in focus towards altcoins also heralds high-risk trading and speculative demand. Ripple (XRP) surged past $3 to its current level of $3.32, with analysts attributing its rally to declining US core inflation, increasing expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut, and anticipation around new spot ETFs. Meanwhile, Litecoin (LTC) went past $130 for the first time in 2025, thanks to a jump of almost 16% over the past 24 hours. LTC’s bullish streak can be attributed to growing hopes that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve a spot for the Litecoin ETF applied by Canary Capital. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out that the SEC had sent comments to Canary, indicating potential approval. Alexander Blume, CEO of Two Prime Digital Assets, stated, “Retail investors [are] looking for opportunities as a new pro-crypto administration gets ready to roll in. The Trump administration is a rising tide that will lift all boats in crypto, and altcoins are seeing some early gains from this.” The approval of a Litecoin ETF could substantially impact the broader Layer1 ecosystem and create a ripple effect for other tokens like SOL and XRP. BlackRock Predicts Historic Year BlackRock has said Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies could see an unprecedented surge under the Donald Trump administration. According to the asset manager’s ETF and index instruments Chief Investment Officer Samara Cohen, crypto deregulation could propel BTC to stratospheric levels in 2025. “There will be progress made on… FIT21 [“Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act.] There will be progress made on stablecoins. There will be progress made just on definitions in taxonomy.” Cohen is widely credited as the brains behind BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), up a staggering 114% since its debut in January 2024. However, despite the ETF and crypto’s stellar performance in 2024, Cohen warned investors must prepare for volatility. “Bitcoin is a risky asset. So, 15% in the context of Bitcoin is not an enormous move. Investors should expect volatility. But in the long term, the price of bitcoin is really going to be determined by the level and pace of adoption.” Bitcoin Fever Reaches Argentina While companies in the US and Europe are considering holding BTC on their balance sheets, their peers in Argentina have pioneered this move, already holding the asset in their portfolios. Argentinian companies like Semler Scientific, Genius Group, Metaplanet, and KULR have adopted Michael Saylor’s concept of "" The Bitcoin Standard” and are diversifying their reserves through BTC. Bitfarms, an Argentinian mining company, holds the most BTC. The company holds 870 BTC as part of its operations. Mercado Libre, one of Argentina's biggest e-tailers, is the second-largest BTC holder, with 412 BTC in its reserves. However, the company’s CIO has stressed the funds are owned by the users of its crypto wallet and not by the company itself. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) rebounded after testing its $90,000 support level to reclaim $100,000 during the current session. The flagship currency is trading at around $101,400 during the ongoing session. If BTC continues to gather momentum, it could extend its rally and retest its all-time high of $108,268. A break above this level could see BTC cross $110,000. BTC’s RSI is currently at 60, above the neutral level of 50, and pointing upwards, indicating bullish momentum. Additionally, the MACD has also flipped to bullish, indicating a buy signal and potential uptrend. With momentum building, buyers hope to reclaim the gains lost last week when BTC faced significant selling pressure and dropped below key support levels and moving averages. BTC turned bearish on Tuesday (January 7) when it dropped over 5%, slipping below $100,000 and the 50-day SMA to $97,019. The price dipped to an intraday low of $92,546 on Wednesday as sellers retained control. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $95,121, ultimately registering a decline of almost 2%. BTC continued to decline on Thursday, falling 2.53% to $92,710. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Friday, rising 2.27% to an intraday high of $95,812 before settling at $94,818. The price registered a marginal decline on Saturday and a marginal increase on Sunday to end the weekend at $94,585.

However, it recovered from this level to reclaim $90,000 and settle at $94,492, registering only a marginal decline. Bullish sentiment returned on Tuesday as BTC rose over 2% to move past the 20-day SMA and settle at $96,566. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday, with BTC rising nearly 4% to move past the 50-day SMA and settle at $100,050. However, buyers lost momentum on Thursday as BTC dropped to an intraday low of $97,086 before recovering to settle at $99,799. The current session sees BTC up almost 2% as it looks to go beyond $102,000. If buyers can build momentum, BTC could test its all-time high of $108,268. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has recovered after dipping below $3,000 on Monday, on its way to an intraday low of $2,927. However, its recovery stalled around $3,500 as sellers drove the price below the 20-day SMA. However, if buyers can build momentum during the ongoing session, ETH could bounce above $3,500 and potentially test the resistance at $3,700. ETH’s RSI is currently at 49, firmly in neutral territory, indicating some weakness. However, the MACD has flipped to bullish, indicating a potential uptrend. ETH registered a substantial drop on Tuesday (January 7), falling below the 20 and 50-day SMAs to $3,381. By Thursday, ETH had dropped to an intraday low of $3,158 as bearish sentiment held sway.

The current session sees ETH up nearly 2% as buyers look to push it past the 20-day SMA towards $3,500. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) has picked up momentum over the past few sessions as it smashed past $200 on Wednesday and settled at $205. With SOL above a key resistance level, it remains to be seen if SOL can reach the levels of December 2024, when the altcoin was trading around the $250 level. SOL faced significant selling pressure last week, turning bearish after failing to move past the 50-day SMA. As a result, SOL dropped over 7% on Tuesday and 2.30% on Wednesday to go below $200 and settle at $197.

Cardano (ADA) Cardano is the brainchild of one of Ethereum’s co-founders, and it’s earned its place among the top cryptos with its focus on sustainability and scalability.

Investeerders speculeren nu massaal over de mogelijkheden voor Ripple, waaronder de komst van een XRP ETF in 2025. Uit gegevens van Polymarket blijkt dat deze voor de zomer goedgekeurd kan worden. Wat gaat Ripple doen na het doorbreken van $3 en het naderen van Trump’s inauguratie op 20 januari? In dit artikel kijken we naar wat we dit jaar kunnen verwachten van XRP en of het een goed idee is om nu Ripple te kopen. Polymarket ziet 68% kans op XRP ETF goedkeuring in 2025 Polymarket is een Web3 platform waar mensen kunnen stemmen op gebeurtenissen in de toekomst en geld verdienen als ze juist hebben gestemd. Stemmers op dit platform zien momenteel een kans van 68% voor een XRP ETF goedkeuring in 2025. Om dit in perspectief te brengen: gisterochtend lag deze verwachte kans nog op 58%, voordat hij zo hoog als 71% is geworden. Dit is een teken dat investeerders erg bullish zijn geworden op XRP. Een andere peiling gaat over een verwachte XRP ETF vóór 1 augustus 2025. De voorspelde kans voor een XRP tegen de zomer ligt momenteel op 51%. Odds an $XRP ETF is approved this year are soaring. 71% chance. pic.twitter.com/PqwwY2oXyz — Polymarket (@Polymarket) January 16, 2025 Als de Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) op 20 januari een nieuwe voorzitter krijgt, wordt de kans voor een XRP ETF in 2025 wellicht nog hoger. Gary Gensler, de huidige voorzitter van de SEC, heeft meerdere keren de deadlines verzet voor de goedkeuring van de Bitcoin- en Ethereum ETF’s. Paul Atkins, de opkomende voorzitter, wil zowel investeerders als innovatie in de crypto sector beschermen. Na de komst van Atkins en Trump, is de kans dat crypto ETF’s sneller worden goedgekeurd. Een ander voordeel voor Ripple is een mogelijke beëindiging van zijn rechtszaak tegen de SEC. Deze rechtszaak duurt al jaren, maar onder leiding van Paul Atkins kan de SEC wellicht tot een conclusie komen, zonder opnieuw in hoger beroep te gaan tegen Ripple. XRP koers overstijgt $3 – Nu Ripple kopen? De XRP koers ligt deze ochtend op $3,25 na een stijging van 7% in de afgelopen 24 uur en een lichte correctie vanuit zijn piek van $3,40. Tot zover lijkt het erop dat Ripple vandaag verder gaat klimmen, maar de kans op een verdere correctie is ook aanwezig. De Relative Strength index (RSI) beweegt zich richting de 80, waar het risico op een pullback significant hoger wordt. Maar hetzelfde moment is de hype rondom Ripple erg voorspelbaar. Dit betekent dat een stijging naar zijn all-time high van $3,84 ook mogelijk is in de komende uren of dagen. Na zijn vorige correctie rond het begin van december, wist XRP alsnog te consolideren boven $2. Mogelijk krijgen we dit keer een vergelijkbaar scenario, mits er in januari überhaupt nog een échte correctie komt voor XRP. De 30-daagse moving average (geel) ligt momenteel nog op $2,40 en beweegt zich verder richting $3. De moving average kan dienen als extra vangnet in het geval van een grotere correctie. Nu Ripple kopen kan goed uitpakken op langere termijn, maar houd op korte termijn dus wel rekening met mogelijke correcties. Ondanks zijn hoge market cap van $187 miljard, kunnen de XRP ETF en het einde van de Ripple rechtszaak zorgen voor nog meer stijgingen. Welke altcoins gaan exploderen in Q1 2025? Met verwachtingen voor een XRP ETF later dit jaar, kan XRP vanuit hier nog flink stijgen. Op korte termijn kunnen stijgingen voor de altcoin echter beperkt zijn. XRP is sinds zijn lows van vorig jaar namelijk al met meer dan 500% gestegen. Andere altcoins hebben potentie om op korte termijn meer winst te leveren. Hieronder kijken we naar 3 nieuwe cryptomunten die veel aandacht hebben gekregen van de markt. Deze altcoins zijn nog voor een lage prijs verkrijgbaar tijdens de presale, maar door hun populariteit kunnen ze exploderen na hun eerste DEX-lancering. Hun utility kan daarnaast zorgen voor groei op langere termijn. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is in december begonnen met zijn presale, maar heeft al een indrukwekkende $50 miljoen opgehaald. $WEPE is momenteel een van de meest populaire presale tokens en heeft daarom potentie om te exploderen na lancering, gezien de vraag zeer hoog blijft. $WEPE holders maken niet alleen kans om hun tokens met grote winst te verkopen, ze krijgen ook toegang tot een exclusieve community met elite trading inzichten. Met deze inzichten valt mogelijk nog meer geld te verdienen, waardoor je wellicht je $WEPE tokens vast wil blijven houden. Hey. You. Wanna have a good time? 🐸 ⚔️ pic.twitter.com/igcSOWPCCY — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) January 16, 2025 De meme coin is vandaag nog verkrijgbaar voor een vaste lage prijs van $0,00036649 per stuk. Naar verwachting is de presale binnenkort voorbij, maar voor deze tijd is het al mogelijk om je tokens te staken voor een APY van 25%. Als $WEPE na de presale explodeert in waarde, komen deze staking beloningen goed van pas. Nu naar Wall Street Pepe Solaxy ($SOLX) Solana zit deze week ook weer in de lift, maar behoort al tot een van de grootste cryptomunten. De nieuwe Solaxy ($SOLX) is een gloednieuwe blockchain die kan meeliften op het succes van Solana. Zijn native token, $SOLX, heeft in de presale ruim $10,8 miljoen opgehaald en biedt toegang tot de nieuwe blockchain. Solaxy is de allereerste Solana Layer-2, dat is een van de redenen dat hij veel hype heeft opgewekt onder investeerders. Met gebruik van $SOLX krijg je toegang tot een blockchain met gloednieuwe projecten, snelle transacties en lage kosten. Hierdoor kan $SOLX mogelijk veel waard worden na lancering. Vandaag kun je deze utility token nog kopen voor $0,001602 per stuk, maar deze prijs stijgt in enkele uren verder. Vroege investeerders kunnen vandaag hun tokens staken om een APY tot wel 325% te verdienen. Mis de lancering van $SOLX niet, want dit project kan een grote boost krijgen door het succes van Solana. Nu naar Solaxy Best Wallet Token ($BEST) Veel mensen gebruiken een crypto wallet enkel voor het opslaan van hun crypto, maar je kunt er veel meer mee dan dat. Best Wallet is een gebruiksvriendelijke wallet met optionele features die je kunnen helpen mee geld te verdienen met crypto. Met gebruik van zijn native Best Wallet Token ($BEST) haal je alles uit deze wallet. Maar wat kun je met $BEST? Door de token vast te houden, krijg je een premium status bij Best Wallet.

The appointment of the pro-crypto advocate is set to kickstart a new era for cryptocurrency investments in the US. Emmer is likely to significantly speed up the adoption of cryptocurrencies and AI in financial systems. What does this mean for crypto investors? Lots of optimism and a potential bull run! With regulatory uncertainties expected to decrease, here are five cryptocurrencies to buy and that you should consider including in your portfolio this year. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – The Best Cryptocurrency To Buy in January 2025 Inspired by the iconic Pepe meme, $WEPE offers token holders access to advanced trading insights, investing training, and a vibrant community of fellow traders and investors so they can all mutually benefit and together have the necessary toolkit to take on the crypto whales, who have been abusing their unfair advantage to dominate the crypto market till date. Simply put, $WEPE aims to give the small players a real shot at crypto trading success. A Robin Hood-like project, if you may, there should be little surprise at $WEPE’s mind-boggling presale numbers – it has raised over $50M so far, having crossed the $45M mark just a few days ago. Can $WEPE be the next 100x token? Well, it certainly has the potential. Each token is currently priced at $0.00036649. Here’s how to buy $WEPE before the price increases in less than nine hours. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana’s First Layer-2 Solution Offering Faster & Reliable Transactions Solaxy ($SOLX) is one of the hottest presales in January 2025 , and for good reason. Built as a Layer-2 solution on the Solana network, it has been designed to address critical issues like limited scalability, network congestion, and failed transactions. All of this makes it a top choice for the DeFi ecosystem. Like $WEPE, $SOLX also boasts some strong presale numbers; it has raised almost $11M at the time of writing, and each token is currently available at $0.001602. The innovative tokenomics of $SOLX are also noteworthy. It allocates 25% of its supply to rewards, 30% to development, and 10% to liquidity pools, meaning it’s keen on building a strong future plan to keep the coin stable. Last but not least, current token holders can also benefit from its 325% staking rewards. 3. Flockerz ($FLOCK) – A Unique Vote-to-Earn Meme Coin with Rewarding Staking APY Flockerz ($FLOCK) is a unique Vote-to-Earn project that allows investors to vote on key project decisions and earn rewards for their participation, irrespective of the final decision. This innovative approach to community engagement and $FLOCK’s strong presale performance positions it as one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy. Consider Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency; Ethereum, the pioneer of smart contracts; or Dogecoin, the original meme coin. Early investors in these projects reaped massive rewards, demonstrating the power of the first-mover advantage in crypto. In the same way, Flockerz could mark the start of a new era in crypto management, fostering a more democratic, community-driven approach instead of relying on single developers. Early adopters of $FLOCK, particularly those who join its presale, stand to gain the most. $FLOCK has already raised over $10.3M in its ongoing presale, which is now in its final stages. With the current price of $0.0066883 per token expected to see a significant jump upon listing, this is possibly the last chance for interested investors to consider this as one of the most promising cryptocurrencies to buy this year. 4. XRP ($XRP) – Listed Meme Coin Continues To Rise $XRP is a digital currency designed for the Ripple Payments network. It allows the network to ensure fast international transactions at a low cost and standardize payment protocols across banking infrastructures. That’s not all, though, as it’s also capable of settling transactions within seconds, and that, too, with minimal energy consumption. One of the biggest reasons we tout $XRP as a top cryptocurrency to buy in January 2025 is its consistent recent performance. In a market that has been bearish of late, $XRP rose from $2.5063 to $3.155 during the last three days, marking a 25% increase. With 1.43B coins added in two months, $XRP’s current price of $3.28 might just be the best entry price you get in a long, long time, especially considering that it has successfully breached the critical $2.9 resistance level . 5. SPX6900 ($SPX) – Unique S&P 500 Index Meme Coin SPX6900 is a meme-driven cryptocurrency inspired by the S&P 500 index. It blends humor with finance and is very different from traditional assets, seeing as it largely thrives on social media buzz and the enthusiasm of the community. SPX6900 surged from $0.00856 in September 2024 to $1.561 in December 2024 – a massive 18,135% rise. The first week of 2025 was also good for the coin as it reached a market cap of $1.44B, which is its highest ever. With 930M tokens currently in circulation and a market cap of over $1.06B, SPX6900 currently offers a good opportunity at $1.142. It’s most likely in a consolidation phase, meaning it’s available at a discount. More good news: analysts believe that SPX6900 is still in its early stages and has a lot of potential. The price may very well breach the $2 mark in the next few months. What’s more, long-term investors can even see the $6-10 level in 3–5 years. Conclusion As the focus shifts towards crypto-supportive legislation, these are the top cryptocurrencies to buy if you wish to make a sizable gain on your investment. However, crypto markets are unpredictable and subject to market risks, which is why it’s important to do your own research before putting your hard-earned money into a crypto asset. Moreover, the above should only be considered our honest opinion and not financial advice.",Cryptocurrency Market News|flockerz|Solaxy|SPX6900|Wall Street Pepe|xrp,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|ZRX,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-17 10:00:50

In a contrasting development, Solana whale activity has raised alarms following the movement of 149,999 SOL, worth $27.92 million, to Binance, which could indicate a potential sell-off. BlockDAG (BDAG) has recently unveiled a new partnership with HackerEarth, with the goal of leveraging global developer talent to foster innovation within its network. This announcement follows a significant fundraising achievement, as BlockDAG (BDAG) has collected over $181 million through its presale. This rapid expansion sets BDAG on a path to potentially hit a $1 valuation by 2025. XRP Market Cap Hits $147B with a Notable 10% Increase This Saturday, XRP witnessed a significant rise, reaching $2.5735, an increase of 10.06%—the most substantial since January 1. This surge has propelled XRP’s market cap to $147.225 billion, representing 4.42% of the total crypto market. Following this increase in XRP market cap, the currency has seen prices ranging from $2.3261 to $2.5936, marking a 5.3% growth over the last week. Despite these gains, XRP still remains 21.78% below its all-time high of $3.29 recorded in January 2018. Solana Whale Activity Raises Eyebrows with Major Binance Transfer The recent transfer of 149,999 Solana (SOL), valued at approximately $27.92 million, to Binance has ignited discussions around Solana whale activity. Such significant transactions often hint at possible sell-offs, as large holders may be positioning for market adjustments. Nevertheless, this activity might also reflect strategic moves, possibly involving portfolio rebalancing or the use of Binance’s staking and lending services, without actually liquidating the holdings. Market watchers are now closely observing how this Solana whale activity might influence Solana’s market prices in the near term. BlockDAG’s Strategic Alliance with HackerEarth Set to Boost Web3 Development BlockDAG is quickly carving out a name for itself in the cryptocurrency arena, having recently achieved a remarkable $181 million during its ongoing presale. The platform is now expanding its influence in the Web3 domain with an exciting new collaboration with HackerEarth. This partnership is designed to draw in exciting development teams to contribute to the BlockDAG network and propel forward the evolution of Web3 technologies. In the coming year, BlockDAG is set to organize four major hackathons, involving 10,000 to 15,000 developers with the goal of launching more than 200 fresh projects. Furthermore, the vast network of 7.6 million developers affiliated with HackerEarth is expected to significantly widen BlockDAG’s influence, fostering a diverse, global community of developers. This collaboration is a significant boost for BlockDAG’s strategic plans, emphasizing its commitment to enhancing blockchain technology and devising functional solutions for a variety of sectors. BlockDAG is creating a hub for genuine innovation through engaging hackathons and collaborative projects powered by HackerEarth. With its ambitious vision and robust presale performance, experts believe BlockDAG could achieve a $1 value by 2025. Currently offered at $0.0248 in its 27th presale batch, the asset has already delivered substantial returns, with initial participants seeing a 2380% ROI. This combination of potent growth potential, applicable real-world uses, and a comprehensive strategy positions BlockDAG as one of the best cryptos to buy right now. Spotlight on the Best Crypto to Buy Right Now XRP’s market cap has escalated to $147.225 billion, marking a 10.06% rise, yet it still trails below its peak historical price. Concurrently, Solana whale activity is stirring discussions about possible market movements, with market observers vigilantly tracking SOL’s price developments. Amid these developments, BlockDAG has emerged as the premier candidate for the best crypto to buy right now, propelled by its ongoing advancements and strategic collaborations. The partnership with HackerEarth underscores BlockDAG’s emphasis on applying blockchain technology to real-world problems and cultivating a robust developer network. Moreover, with BDAG’s impressive 2380% escalation in price since the first presale batch, analysts anticipate its price could hit $1 this year, offering a significant potential ROI for those who participate in the presale before the current batch 27 is fully subscribed.

Ranked 20th by market capitalization, the digital silver appears to be reclaiming its place in the spotlight. A Year of Growth Over the past year, Litecoin has gained 71.6%, making it one of the better-performing assets in the crypto space. While it still trades 70% below its all-time high from May 2021, recent developments hint at renewed interest. Speculation surrounding a potential Litecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a significant catalyst, attracting attention from retail and institutional investors alike.

According to on-chain data, these large holders have accumulated an additional 250,000 Litecoin since January 9, signaling strong confidence in the asset. This accumulation mirrors patterns observed in early December, which also led to significant price movements. Litecoin has decoupled from other altcoins, jumping +16.1% in market cap in just the past 11 hours. Just as we saw in early December, the key driver appears to be whales and sharks holding at least 10K+ $LTC .

In just 11 hours, its market capitalization jumped by 16.1%, showing signs of decoupling from broader market trends. This independence could further bolster investor confidence, positioning Litecoin as a standout choice in a crowded crypto market. The Road Ahead While LTC’s price surge has reignited interest, sustaining this momentum will depend on key developments such as the rumored ETF approval and continued whale activity. For now, Litecoin’s resurgence highlights its resilience and potential as a staple in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As the market watches closely, Litecoin’s next moves could redefine its position among the top crypto contenders. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Probably nothing offers deeper opportunities and risks for our economy, security, and society,” the politician began his speech in the context of AI. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMwqdDzGdx8&t=1s He added that neural networks have the potential to cure cancer; however, without proper precautions, the technology ”threatens our way of life, privacy, jobs, and national security”. ”In the age of AI, it is crucial for people to manage it. And as a country of freedom, America, not China, should lead the development of artificial intelligence,” Biden stated. Among the threats, he also highlighted technology companies. According to him, social media platforms are abandoning fact-checking, the free press is being undermined, and editors are disappearing. The president's speech summarizes his achievements in office and outlines key steps for the future administration. It is worth noting that in January, the Biden administration imposed new restrictions on the import of computer chips developed in the U.S. in an effort to prevent other countries from accessing advanced technologies.Later, the president issued an order to provide federal support to meet significant energy needs required for the operation of data centers that support artificial intelligence functionality.",News|Legal|Security,EN,0,0,ASIA|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-17 10:07:00

She also asked if Gensler had hoped for a different outcome regarding the applications. ”I and my predecessor [Jay Clayton] never spoke about Bitcoin as a security, nor about Ethereum,” responded the SEC chairman. He pointed out that investors had access to these assets even before the introduction of exchange-traded products. ”Under my leadership, we approved a [futures] Bitcoin ETF back in 2021,” Gensler added. He reminded that Clayton opposed such instruments. ”I think investors have better protection with these [spot] ETPs. Much lower fees, oversight from stock exchanges, and disclosure,” Gensler said. Returning to the status of the two leading cryptocurrencies, the SEC chairman refrained from definitively stating that they are not securities. He emphasized that 70-80% of the crypto market is related to Bitcoin and Ethereum, but there are still about 10,000-15,000 digital assets. ”Due to the nature of my work, I always try to be as careful as possible with my language. But I would note, again without making any definitive statements, that investors are putting money into many of these tokens. And think about this in financial terms. Everything here is based on a mix of fundamental principles and sentiment,” Gensler explained. Regarding the community's request for separate legislation for digital assets, the SEC chairman stated that there are time-tested rules in place. These include anti-money laundering regulations, sanctions regimes, commodity and securities laws, and others that many aspects of the crypto industry do not comply with, according to Gensler.He compared claims about the uniqueness of assets to the position of hybrid car owners who might argue that traffic laws were not created for this type of vehicle. ”Don't like the law and regulations? That doesn't mean they don't exist,” he emphasized. Concerning the anticipated change in approach to cryptocurrency regulation under Donald Trump's new administration, Gensler noted that this is part of the democratic process. ”But I really think the public benefits from this 90-year [regulatory] regime. What we at the SEC have done is help promote economic activity and trust in our capital markets,” Gensler stated. He will leave his position on January 20, the day of Trump's inauguration.

This milestone underscores the platform’s ongoing commitment to enhancing token value through deflationary measures. Annual Destruction Metrics In 2024, HTX has destroyed a combined total of 49.63 trillion $HTX tokens, equivalent to 5% of the platform’s total token supply of 999.99 trillion $HTX. This steady 5% annual deflation rate demonstrates the exchange’s strategic approach to maintaining value and scarcity for its platform coin. The Role of Token Destruction in Value Creation HTX’s deflationary mechanism highlights a common strategy among centralized exchanges (CEXs) to increase the value of platform tokens. By tying the token destruction rate to platform revenue, the system aligns token value with the exchange’s performance. The process is straightforward yet effective: 1. Platform Growth: As HTX’s operations and revenue grow, the platform has more resources to commit to token destruction. 2. Accelerated Deflation: Increased destruction reduces token supply, boosting scarcity. 3. Value Appreciation: The deflationary pressure ultimately supports price increases for $HTX, benefiting holders.

HTX’s consistent destruction events create a transparent link between its operational success and the token’s value trajectory. As the exchange continues to grow, the destruction rate could accelerate further, creating a positive feedback loop for token holders. By implementing this strategy, HTX exemplifies how platform token destruction can serve as a cornerstone for fostering value and long-term growth in the competitive crypto exchange landscape.

After making standard moves, the chatbots began to cheat and attempt to circumvent the rules of the game. The first match was between Stockfish and Snapchat AI. The neural network initially performed well in developing its opening but then started breaking the rules. It moved a knight to the center of the board from the other side, ignoring the principles of piece movement. Then, Snapchat AI's king captured its own bishop to avoid check. After a few moves, the AI returned the bishop to the board and then began moving pawns sideways. In the second match, Gemini faced Grok. At the start of the game, both neural networks followed the rules and made standard moves. However, similar to the first match, they soon began to violate established norms. The pieces of both neural networks moved to forbidden squares, ignoring the rules of play. Grok made seven mistakes and put its queen in danger, but Gemini did not take advantage of the opportunity. Next up were ChatGPT and Meta AI. The OpenAI chatbot played an English opening while its opponent made logical moves. Then it started generating random moves and, as is typical for generative AI models, created nonexistent pieces. The neural network also placed game elements on prohibited squares, making them vulnerable to ChatGPT. Then came ”chess telekinesis” Meta AI began moving ChatGPT's ”pieces.” In response, OpenAI's chatbot declared checkmate against its opponent, even though the king was not under threat.The game ended with a victory for ChatGPT — it delivered a clean checkmate. The duel between ChatGPT and Stockfish began with a standard pawn attack on the kingside from the chatbot and Sicilian defense from the professional chess engine. Closer to the middle of the game, the neural network started making useless queen moves and creating meaningless geometric patterns with its pieces. Stockfish continued to strengthen its control over the game.The game was not without rule-breaking moves from ChatGPT; however, this did not help the chatbot secure a win.

After all, FDR’s company is comparable to the “Delta Force” of crypto security – if you pull off a hack, and your victim calls on FDR to help, you can be sure that he’ll be coming after you. Hard and fast. And with highly-trained former US military and intelligence specializing in offensive security, forensic investigative techniques and physiological warfare capable of being deployed almost anywhere on the planet in around 24 hours, all it takes is one slip up. FDR specializes in putting hackers, including solo operators and state-backed groups, under intense pressure from the get-go. Through a combination of military-grade expertise and ruthless determination, chances are you’ll have a team of mean-looking law enforcement officers bursting through your door, pinning you on the ground, stripping you of your ill-gotten gains, well before you manage to cash them out. So how does he do it? We talked to the man himself and found out why, if you’re a hacker, you definitely don’t want him to be on your tail… 1: Groom Lake describes itself as the “private military corporation” for Web3, which suggests that your company operates in a way that’s comparable to the military. But why do Web3 companies/protocols/investors need military-grade security? Groom Lake functions as both a proactive and reactive component to prevent or respond, with extreme prejudice, to exploits and hacks. When you look at the typical perpetrator, it comes down to either an insider threat or a nation-state actor - with Lazarus Group exemplifying this threat for the latter. We conducted Operation Ural Spectre, uncovering an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) operated by Lazarus in the Russian Far East, using on-chain forensics and OSINT (open-source intelligence) to expose their tactics and conduct a proper counteroffensive. The group exploited VPN misconfigurations and utilized OFAC-sanctioned wallets to launder assets - which highlights the central reason of why North Korean state actors continue to perpetrate crypto hacks in the face of mounting sanctions and inaccessibility to the global financial system. You can see historically that these attacks are not isolated but represent a growing trend of state-level actors targeting protocols, exchanges, and high-net-worth individuals. As the industry moves into a bull market, the financial incentives for these groups increase, raising the stakes for their targets. In fact, there’s a direct correlation in data between highly volatile, active markets and the amount of assets exploited by nation-state threats. When Groom Lake offers military-grade security, we are telling the industry that if you want to counteract these threats, you have to operate at the same level or higher in terms of capability - with advanced intelligence, rapid response, and offensive security tactics which we’ve proven from our time at the NSA or Army Cyber Command can neutralize groups like Lazarus. 2: How likely is it that one of your average customers is going to face some kind of critical security threat? It’s highly likely. The likelihood is exacerbated because the security focus in Web3 historically has fully centered around smart contract risk, and the solutions have always been static, point-in-time products like audits - and what normally happens as a result is that people give up when these audits fail to catch critical vulnerabilities, and they view the likelihood of further recovery and investigation as something to leave to slow-moving bureaucrats in law enforcement. The reality is that customers face threats across multiple angles, including phishing, SIM swaps, insider threats, and these conventional smart contract exploits. So, protocols really need to consider both sides of the spectrum - traditional security best practices and smart contract security, which Groom Lake has also spearheaded through products like Drosera. 3: Your presentation repeatedly emphasizes the need for a plan of action and rapid speed when responding to security incidents, and it claims you can have an operative on the ground, anywhere in the world in 48 hours or less. Why is this so important, and what kind of impact does this speedy response have on the success of your investigations, compared to just rolling up a few days later? 48 hours is long for us, normally it’s 24. Time is critical in incident response - the longer the victim delays actions, the more likely it is they’ll suffer permanent fund loss or collateral damage. It’s like that show ‘“The First 4*”, where you always see these detectives and law enforcement professionals racing to accomplish key milestones within the first 48 hours of a murder. Things are fresh, the perpetrator is more likely to make mistakes, and so on. The secret to this game is that psychological warfare, shock and awe, and the silent pressure of being hunted are valuable components of achieving victory. We demonstrated this to powerful effect in London with British authorities in Operation Hidden Forge — our team led the charge to trace funds, locate the perpetrator, and surveil his movements until the arrival of authorities. If the client, or Groom Lake, hadn’t acted swiftly - who knows what would have resulted or where the perpetrator would have escaped to. 4: In your Operation Wavefront case study, it says you used OSINT to track down a developer who had freshly minted millions of new tokens and sold them on exchanges. What kind of OSINT did you rely on? What steps were taken to identify this person, how many people were involved in this process and how long did it take? Groom Lake never fully discloses its TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) - but at a surface level, we combined open-source intelligence (OSINT) with blockchain forensics to identify the developer. There was a GitHub API leak that revealed the email of the perpetrator that was further linked to the primary suspect's Ethereum wallet. This email was tied to public business reviews that disclosed the name of the perpetrator, which we verified using X and other social media. On-chain analysis allowed us to trace the movement of stolen tokens through exchanges and wallets, building a complete profile. Our team reached key conclusions within hours of being activated for the operation, and we deployed shortly thereafter. Normally for these operations, it’s handled at the strategic level by members of the Intelligence Shop for Phase 1, then as we prepare to deploy we send a single primary operative to the region, who then meets with secondary Groom Lake assets on the ground in the host country. 5: Besides catching the culprit, did you offer the project in the above case any assistance in terms of mitigating the impact of what happened (exchanges being flooded with tokens, sending the price crashing)? If so, what did you do? In similar cases, Groom Lake has coordinated with exchanges to freeze transactions, recover funds, and prevent further token sales. Additional measures may include analyzing liquidity impacts and advising projects on recovery strategies to stabilize token prices - overall, you’re paying Groom Lake to be your shock and awe and the ‘tip of the spear,’ not so much to be lawyers or negotiators, per se. 6: Your case studies focus on how you have assisted protocols, but you also offer services to VIPs and whales. How different is the nature of the threats faced by VIPs and whales, and how do you protect them against these threats? Groom Lake covers an even greater scope of potential risk for VIPs and whales - they primarily face threats on the traditional security side such as targeted phishing, SIM swaps, and social engineering attacks. Our skill set at Groom Lake already caters to this in a primary way, but we’ve developed proprietary tools like REAPER (a custom threat intelligence feed for clients in real time) that proactively monitors these risks and safeguards clients. 7: Have you helped any whales/VIPs who were hacked before? If so, can you tell us about it? Yes, though details remain confidential. Groom Lake has successfully recovered assets for high-profile clients through swift fund tracing, collaboration with exchanges, and leveraging global intelligence networks. Specific cases can only be disclosed with client consent. But I can tell you. It's all about information. We have helped whales and VIPs in a myriad of ways. Some end up in a more straightforward solution of conducting an investigation, providing the report to authorities and identifying exchanges that funds are being offloaded to. In special circumstances, we organize deployments to go after the individuals in joint operations with law enforcement, resulting in arrests. These deployments require different approaches and utilize everything from psychological warfare to off-chain intelligence to find out everything possible about the target. We have even helped VIPs who have been targeted and threatened by competitors - by DOXing the targets and helping the client to maneuver accordingly with the newfound information. These cases usually result in retaining our proactive services to make the odds of this happening again very low. 8: What are the most beneficial security best practices that every protocol and whale should employ, and which, if any, are not really that useful? Universal security should be built in as you go. There are some fundamental, high-risk platforms like Twitter, Discord, GitHub, Google Workspace, and more that are often neglected as teams focus on development rather than securing what’s already in place. Key measures include implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) through authenticator apps (avoiding SMS-based MFA due to the risk of SIM swapping), diligently verifying links before clicking, conducting regular access audits, and enforcing the principle of least privilege (POLP) to prevent ""shadow IT"" — users who misuse excessive permissions. For whales, the security landscape differs. Without enterprise systems, their primary attack surface is themselves. High-profile individuals are common targets for vishing (voice phishing) and traditional phishing attempts. To mitigate these risks, always verify the identity of anyone contacting you, understanding that phone numbers can be spoofed. If in doubt, hang up and call the person back directly — outbound calls are difficult to spoof unless the target has been SIM swapped. Adding extra security measures with your mobile carrier can further reduce SIM swap risks. Additionally, whales should safeguard their digital assets using MFA through authenticator apps instead of SMS-based methods. The basics remain critical for a reason, and if further support is needed, Groom Lake is available to assist with both preventative strategies and incident response. 9: Is there any kind of scenario where Groom Lake might struggle to investigate/catch the bad guys? If so, what are you trying to do to address this deficiency? Cold-cases, or ones where that initial period of attack has significantly passed, are always more difficult and result in a lower chance of recovery - funds were likely spent, or off-ramped, or the perpetrator has sufficiently covered their tracks, for example. Challenges further arise with highly anonymized attacks or when facing state-backed operatives. However, Groom Lake collaborates with law enforcement, international agencies like INTERPOL, and leverages proprietary tools to minimize these barriers. At Groom Lake, we utilize the same analytic standards and processes used in the U.S. intelligence community, specifically ICD 203. This framework was developed after the intelligence failures surrounding WMD assessments during the 2003 Iraq War, ensuring our estimates and spot reports (spotreps) meet the highest possible standard of reliability. Our team includes NSA-trained operatives who apply this extremely rigorous methodology to their work, bringing a level of precision and accountability that surpasses what is typical in most civilian firms. By adhering to these military-grade standards, we deliver security solutions capable of addressing the unique and complex threats facing Web3 ecosystems.

The crypto community is watching Trump’s next move closely, anticipating a ripple effect that could prompt other governments worldwide to adopt similar policies. Industry experts believe the strategic Bitcoin reserve would be Trump’s Day 1 initiative. Crypto investor and mathematician Fred Krueger remains confident about Trump’s Bitcoin reserve announcement on January 20. Experts’ Thoughts on Donald Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve In a recent X post , Fred Kreuger reaffirmed his optimism on Trump’s Bitcoin reserve plans. “A Bitcoin Strategic Reserve will be announced on Monday,” said Krueger. He based his belief on three basic speculations. A Bitcoin Strategic Reserve will be announced on Monday. Here's why I am sure: 1. There will be a very large number of Executive Orders announced Monday. (This is a given.) 2. If there isn’t an Executive Order on BSR in this large number of announcements, then a lot of Trump’s… — Fred Krueger (@dotkrueger) January 17, 2025 Notably, Trump has already announced plans to roll out more than 100 executive orders on his initial day. While reports revealed the inclusion of Trump’s top campaign promises in the orders, there are anticipations of crypto evaluation and policy changes on the same day. Krueger posited that the strategic Bitcoin reserve will be one of the executive orders Donald Trump could implement on his first day in office, as part of a broader effort to make crypto a policy priority. He added that Trump’s donors’ would be upset if that doesn’t happen. In addition, Bitcoin Magazine Editor Pete Rizzo also sees the Bitcoin scheme as Trump’s initial day plan. He stated, This could be the Day 1 initiative. It’s certainly an idea that has come a long way in a short amount of time. Trump Envisions Making Crypto a National Priority In a recent development, Trump declared his decision to elevate cryptocurrency to a national priority . The administration intends to summon regulators to evaluate and reform the crypto landscape, beginning with the formation of a crypto advisory council. The government also plans to seek opinions and concerns from industry experts and stakeholders. Moreover, SEC officials like Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda will reassess the ongoing crypto lawsuits. They would particularly focus on cases with no explicit fraud allegations to know the possibility of freezing or withdrawing some lawsuits. Bitcoin’s Rise to Global Reserve Status Countries like South Africa, Poland, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong, and Venezuela are also considering adopting BTC into their portfolio, primarily triggered by Trump’s progressive approach. US states like Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Oklahoma to embrace Bitcoin . The potential developments in the US economy could significantly influence other countries, with more governments adopting Bitcoin reserves. BTC price currently trades above $102K, up 140% in a year. Experts have predicted a $150K–$200K price target for Bitcoin.

After all, FDR’s company is comparable to the “Delta Force” of crypto security – if you pull off a hack, and your victim calls on FDR to help, you can be sure that he’ll be coming after you. Hard and fast. And with highly-trained former US military and intelligence specializing in offensive security, forensic investigative techniques and physiological warfare capable of being deployed almost anywhere on the planet in around 24 hours, all it takes is one slip up. FDR specializes in putting hackers, including solo operators and state-backed groups, under intense pressure from the get-go. Through a combination of military-grade expertise and ruthless determination, chances are you’ll have a team of mean-looking law enforcement officers bursting through your door, pinning you on the ground, stripping you of your ill-gotten gains, well before you manage to cash them out. So how does he do it? We talked to the man himself and found out why, if you’re a hacker, you definitely don’t want him to be on your tail… 1: Groom Lake describes itself as the “private military corporation” for Web3, which suggests that your company operates in a way that’s comparable to the military. But why do Web3 companies/protocols/investors need military-grade security? Groom Lake functions as both a proactive and reactive component to prevent or respond, with extreme prejudice, to exploits and hacks. When you look at the typical perpetrator, it comes down to either an insider threat or a nation-state actor - with Lazarus Group exemplifying this threat for the latter. We conducted Operation Ural Spectre, uncovering an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) operated by Lazarus in the Russian Far East, using on-chain forensics and OSINT (open-source intelligence) to expose their tactics and conduct a proper counteroffensive. The group exploited VPN misconfigurations and utilized OFAC-sanctioned wallets to launder assets - which highlights the central reason of why North Korean state actors continue to perpetrate crypto hacks in the face of mounting sanctions and inaccessibility to the global financial system. You can see historically that these attacks are not isolated but represent a growing trend of state-level actors targeting protocols, exchanges, and high-net-worth individuals. As the industry moves into a bull market, the financial incentives for these groups increase, raising the stakes for their targets. In fact, there’s a direct correlation in data between highly volatile, active markets and the amount of assets exploited by nation-state threats. When Groom Lake offers military-grade security, we are telling the industry that if you want to counteract these threats, you have to operate at the same level or higher in terms of capability - with advanced intelligence, rapid response, and offensive security tactics which we’ve proven from our time at the NSA or Army Cyber Command can neutralize groups like Lazarus. 2: How likely is it that one of your average customers is going to face some kind of critical security threat? It’s highly likely. The likelihood is exacerbated because the security focus in Web3 historically has fully centered around smart contract risk, and the solutions have always been static, point-in-time products like audits - and what normally happens as a result is that people give up when these audits fail to catch critical vulnerabilities, and they view the likelihood of further recovery and investigation as something to leave to slow-moving bureaucrats in law enforcement. The reality is that customers face threats across multiple angles, including phishing, SIM swaps, insider threats, and these conventional smart contract exploits. So, protocols really need to consider both sides of the spectrum - traditional security best practices and smart contract security, which Groom Lake has also spearheaded through products like Drosera. 3: Your presentation repeatedly emphasizes the need for a plan of action and rapid speed when responding to security incidents, and it claims you can have an operative on the ground, anywhere in the world in 48 hours or less. Why is this so important, and what kind of impact does this speedy response have on the success of your investigations, compared to just rolling up a few days later? 48 hours is long for us, normally it’s 24. Time is critical in incident response - the longer the victim delays actions, the more likely it is they’ll suffer permanent fund loss or collateral damage. It’s like that show ‘“The First 4*”, where you always see these detectives and law enforcement professionals racing to accomplish key milestones within the first 48 hours of a murder. Things are fresh, the perpetrator is more likely to make mistakes, and so on. The secret to this game is that psychological warfare, shock and awe, and the silent pressure of being hunted are valuable components of achieving victory.

On-chain data pointed out that the government moved the abovementioned amount to two unknown addresses, with one potentially linked to the crypto exchange giant Binance. Therefore, market watchers remain curious as Bitcoin price recently recovered to reach the $102K level. Royal Government Of Bhutan Moves 633 BTC Amid Broader Recovery According to the latest data by Arkham Intelligence , the Royal Government of Bhutan moved 633 BTC via a couple of transactions on January 17. The government initially transferred 255.26 coins, worth $26 million, to the unknown address 38mbNK7j7. Notably, per data by the tracker Onchain Lens on X, this address likely belongs to Binance. Further, the Bhutanese government again shifted a whopping 377.78 Bitcoins, worth $38.57 million, to the unknown address bc1qavh2. Altogether, the massive transfers gained significant traction across the sector as they occurred amid a broader crypto market recovery . Also, it’s noteworthy that the Bhutan Government still holds 11.055K BTC, worth $1.13 billion, per Arkham data. Market watchers remain apprehensive as the motive for the massive transfers currently remains unclear. Besides, given that the entity decides to sell ahead, heightened selling pressure could further present the flagship crypto with turbulence. Simultaneously, it’s also mentioned that Bhutan’s Gelephu Mindfulness City (GMC) has recently announced plans to include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB in strategic reserves, bolstering its crypto adoption plan. The abovementioned transfers following this news have further added a layer of intrigue among market participants globally. What’s Next For The Flagship Crypto? At the time of reporting, BTC price witnessed a 3% uptick in value, reaching $102,303. The coin’s intraday low and high were $97,364.44 and $102,502.81, respectively. Notably, the current upward trajectory aligns with soaring market optimism as President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office on January 20. Moreover, a recent Bitcoin price analysis by CoinGape revealed that a $130K price target for the coin looms right over the horizon. The bullish anticipation comes against the backdrop of strong market trends, driven by bullish on-chain data and whale activity spurt. Nevertheless, crypto traders and investors are extensively eyeing the flagship crypto for further price action shifts, attributable to the Bhutan Government’s massive transfers.

Each time Bitcoin sees a price spike, the odds of a Bitcoin reserve being established also rise. Experts in the crypto space believe that if a reserve is announced, Bitcoin’s price will likely surge; if not, it could drop. In an interview with Scott Melker , Sigel opened up and he believes that the new administration in the U.S. could be a game changer for Bitcoin. With expected headlines around easing regulations and supporting deregulated energy markets, the stage is set for Bitcoin adoption to take off. However, the altcoin market has faced recent struggles. Last Friday, altcoins experienced a 35% correction—the largest dip since the 2020 elections. This sharp drop signals that a lot of speculative money has been wiped out, but it may set the stage for Bitcoin’s rise as negative sentiment wanes. Sigel also pointed to significant token unlocks this week, which have caused some jitters in the market. With $3 billion worth of altcoins unlocking, some traders expect these tokens to be sold off, putting downward pressure on prices. Despite this, Sigel remains positive for the long-term, believing that these market fluctuations are just part of the cycle. Finally, there’s growing support at the state level for Bitcoin reserves. Oklahoma, for example, recently introduced a bill to create its own Bitcoin reserve. This shift could further fuel Bitcoin’s growth, regardless of what happens at the federal level. As Bitcoin moves forward, experts believe positive changes are on the horizon, with the new administration’s actions likely providing the momentum needed for a bullish 2025.

One popular expert predicts that the Ripple price will jump to $15, a 340% surge from the current level. These pros cite catalysts like the surging Ripple USD (RLUSD) volume, potential strategic reserves, and an XRP ETF. XRP Price Breaks Out As Pro Sees A Surge To $15 Ripple, which has grown into the third-biggest cryptocurrency, soared to a high of $3.40, up 580% from its 2024 low. In an X post, Ali Martinez, a popular crypto expert, said the coin was on a path to $15. He cited the fact that it had made a breakout above the symmetrical triangle on the monthly chart. XRP Price to $15 A 340% surge is possible since the coin jumped by more than 315% from its lowest level in November last year. Such a move would push its market cap from $189 billion to $643 billion. RLUSD Volume, Ripple ETF, and SEC Changes XRP price has numerous catalysts that may push its price to $15. RLUSD stablecoin growth. XRP ETF approval. SEC changes under Trump. First, there are signs that the Ripple USD stablecoin is gaining market share as its volume surges. The 24-hour volume rose to over $185 million, passing some of the top stablecoins like USDD and PayPal’s PYUSD. RLUSD’s adoption will likely continue growing after a crucial vote passed this week. This vote will allow the stablecoin to be put in automated market maker (AMM) pools, giving it more utility this year. There are rising possibility that the SEC will approve a spot XRP ETF, a move that JPMorgan analysts expect will bring $8 billion in inflows. These inflows and hype may lead to higher prices this year. XRP ETF Odds Further, the SEC is considering making changes to align with Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance. One approach is to pause some of the lawsuits filed under Gary Gensler, a move that may benefit Ripple Labs and XRP price. Ripple Price Chart Pattern Points More Gains Are Coming Martinez noted that the Ripple price formed a symmetrical triangle on the monthly chart. My view is that the daily chart provides a better Ripple price forecast since the coin has formed a bullish pennant chart pattern. This pattern comprises 2 key parts: a flag pole and a triangle. It has now moved above the lengthy flag pole, meaning more gains may come. This flag pole had a length of about 500%, meaning that a similar surge means that a surge to $15 will come. The only caveat is that these patterns take time to materialize, meaning that a surge to $15 may happen in the fourth quarter or even in 2026. XRP Price Chart A drop below $1.90, the lower side of the pennant’s triangle, may invalidate the bullish view and point to a crash to $0.5, its November lows.

With one analyst predicting it has 100x potential, this scaling solution could be the key to solving Solana’s congestion issues. As a result, investors are racing to get in early before SOLX’s price climbs higher. How Solaxy Brings Ethereum-Style Layer-2 Scaling to Solana Layer-2 networks have totally changed blockchain scalability – particularly on Ethereum. These networks operate on top of a base layer (or layer-1) to handle transactions off-chain before settling them back on the main network. This approach reduces congestion, cuts costs, and still benefits from the security of the underlying blockchain. Ethereum’s layer-2 ecosystem – with networks like Optimism and Arbitrum – has attracted billions in total value locked (TVL). It’s also seen widespread adoption among developers and traders. https://twitter.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1879583651979042872 Solaxy aims to replicate this success on Solana, introducing the chain’s first layer-2 solution. Using rollup technology, Solaxy processes transactions off-chain and “batches” them for settlement on Solana’s mainnet. Its goal is to tackle network congestion and high failure rates during busy periods. Solaxy could transform Solana’s ecosystem by acting as a bridge for new DApps, from AI to meme coins. Traders and developers are excited by this prospect. Solaxy’s Telegram community has grown to over 3,300 people, with many eagerly awaiting its launch. The SOLX Token – Powering Solaxy’s Ecosystem with Massive Price Potential The SOLX token powers Solaxy’s ecosystem. It plays a role in enabling faster and cheaper transactions by covering fees on the Solaxy network. Plus, SOLX holders can stake their tokens to earn passive income, with APY rates currently estimated at 330%. Beyond staking, SOLX will be a key part of the development team’s planned bridge between Solana and Ethereum. It’s also expected to grant governance rights for future protocol decisions. The ongoing presale for SOLX has been an enormous success. Earlier this week, it crossed the $10 million mark, with SOLX tokens currently available for $0.001602. Analysts have noticed Solaxy’s explosive momentum, with YouTuber ClayBro predicting that once it lists on exchanges, SOLX could deliver 100x gains. Although that prediction might seem outlandish, such a price increase wouldn’t be unheard of in crypto, especially given Solaxy’s potential. And based on the current SOLX price and total supply, it would give the token a fully diluted market cap of over $22 billion. That’s more than the likes of TRON and Avalanche. Solaxy’s Security, Tokenomics, and Perfect Timing for the Crypto Bull Run Solaxy’s team prioritizes security and transparency. They’ve had the project’s smart contracts audited by Coinsult , who found no issues, giving confidence to early investors. Solaxy also has a clear tokenomics structure designed to balance growth and sustainability. A 30% chunk of the supply is allocated for development, while 25% is set aside for rewarding early investors. Marketing efforts receive 15%, and 10% is reserved for exchange liquidity – with the remaining 20% held in the project’s treasury. What also makes Solaxy so exciting is its timing. Launching just as many analysts anticipate a huge bull run this year, the project could benefit from all the investor interest. Plus, with Solana’s growth expected to continue, the need for faster (and cheaper) trades will be more apparent. Solaxy can help with this. Everything seems to be falling into place for this Solana scaling solution. And if ClayBro’s 100x price prediction proves accurate, SOLX might be one of the biggest winners in the next bull run.

Momenteel ligt hij onder een sterke resistance, maar als hij hier bovenuit weet te breken, kan de meme coin met nog eens 50% stijgen. Is WIF klaar voor een comeback of zal hij zijn downtrend voortzetten? De huidige crypto hype – die lijkt toe te nemen – geeft dogwifhat een kans om te exploderen in de komende dagen en weken. Gaat dogwifhat verder stijgen? Dit zeggen de on-chain signalen De interesse in meme coins zoals dogwifhat is weer aan het stijgen, een veel-voorkomend fenomeen wanneer de crypto markt stijgt. Wanneer grote cryptomunten stijgen, neemt het vertrouwen en risicotolerantie van investeerders toe. Dit zorgt ervoor dat meme coins, de meest speculatieve crypto’s op de markt, ook stijgen. Dankzij hun volatiliteit, kunnen meme coins veel harder stijgen dan grote cryptomunten. In de onderstaande grafiek van Coinglass is te zien hoe het aantal long posities voor WIF vandaag is toegenomen. Momenteel ligt de verhouding op 1,05, met 51% long-posities. Dit betekent dat WIF vandaag wellicht verder kan stijgen. Op Binance heeft zo’n 80% van het aantal traders een long-positie in WIF/USD perpetuals. Dit is een teken dat traders op Binance rekenen op verdere stijgingen Momenteel lijken bullish traders en investeerders de macht te hebben, wat WIF kan helpen om vandaag een breakout te maken boven een belangrijke resistance. WIF koers klaar voor 50% rally dogwifhat ligt momenteel op een koers van $1,85, maar heeft nog veel in te halen na zijn daling van 28% in de afgelopen maand. Dit is ook positief voor investeerders die vandaag instappen, omdat er minder traders klaarstaan om met winst te verkopen. Dit wordt verder versterkt door de Relative Strength index (RSI) van 47, die aangeeft dat WIF nog momentum aan het opbouwen is. Pas wanneer de RSI boven de 70 stijgt, neemt het risico voor een correctie toe, omdat meer traders dan met (hoge) winst kunnen verkopen. De dogwifhat koers ligt vlak op zijn 30-daagse moving average (geel), een resistance die de meme coin sinds begin december heeft onderdrukt. Een breakout boven $1,85 kan het einde betekenen van de downtrend en het begin van een uptrend. De volgende resistance ligt rond $2,20, gevormd door de piek van begin deze maand en de 200-daagse moving average (blauw). Een stijging naar deze resistance betekent dat $WIF met 18% omhoog kan gaan. Maar een breakout boven dit niveau kan deze stijging uitbreiden tot 50% naar $2,75. Na de hoge verkoopdruk die WIF heeft ervaren, lijkt dit een uitstekend moment om in te stappen, omdat de bodem wellicht al bereikt is. Als het sentiment van de markt vanaf vandaag weer opfleurt, staan er grote stijgingen te wachten voor WIF en andere meme coins. Welke crypto meme nu kopen? De stijging van populaire crypto memes zoals dogwifhat geven aan dat meme coins mogelijk klaar zijn voor een comeback. Dit is niet alleen positief voor grote meme coins met een market cap van $1 miljard of hoger, maar ook voor de kleinere memes. Kleine volatiele meme coins kunnen tijdens een meme coin rally voor hoge winsten zorgen. In dit artikel kijken we naar 3 opkomende meme coins die veel aandacht hebben gekregen van investeerders. Dit, gecombineerd met een nieuwe rally voor meme coins, kan vroege investeerders mogelijk rijk maken in het eerste kwartaal van 2025. Vandaag kun je deze cryptomunten nog kopen tijdens de presale. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) dogwifhat is niet de enige meme coin die deze week is gestegen. Zo maakt ook Pepe een sterke comeback met een stijging van bijna 9% in de afgelopen 24 uur. Dit is positief voor Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE), een van de grootste meme coin presales van het moment. $WEPE heeft tot zover al $50 miljoen opgehaald met zijn presale. Na lancering wordt $WEPE vastgehouden door Diamond Hands, want token holders krijgen toegang tot een exclusieve community. Binnen deze community kun je gebruikmaken van elite trading inzichten. Afhankelijk van de kwaliteit hiervan, kun je veel geld verdienen door $WEPE vast te houden, maar kan de meme coin zelf ook veel waard worden.

Ethereum’s price breaks the $3,400 resistance, rallying to $3,424 as bullish momentum builds ahead of the anticipated Pectra upgrade and political developments.

The world is at a financial turning point, and the lifetime of fiat currencies has arguably come to its useful end. In their place will be digital value of one kind or another, and this is likely to come from the innovative world of crypto. A major pivot point for this new world is the incoming administration of Donald Trump.

This could augur a huge altseason, but this will entirely depend on how intense a potential Bitcoin surge could be. $SOL one of the major beneficiaries TradingView Solana ($SOL) is likely to be a big beneficiary of this altcoin rally, with rumours that the Trump administration could back cryptocurrencies such as $SOL and $XRP. $SOL is in the process of breaking out of its downtrend on the weekly time frame after the price came down to perfectly touch the 0.618 Fibonacci. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI could be about to signal huge upside price momentum, which may be confirmed at this week’s close.

Breakouts are occurring across various coins as traders and investors drive the market upward, anticipating effects from Trump's inauguration. Trump's Influence on Crypto These are unprecedented times. The world stands at a pivotal financial juncture, and the era of fiat currencies might be nearing its conclusion. Taking their place will be digital assets, likely emerging from the innovative realm of cryptocurrency. A crucial factor in this new landscape is the incoming Trump administration. Trump not only supports Bitcoin but also acknowledges the groundbreaking potential of cryptocurrencies, prioritizing them at the national level. Against this backdrop, we turn our attention to altcoins. Significant Breakthrough for Total3 Source: TradingView Total3 represents the cumulative market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, excluding $BTC and $ETH. This chart provides a glimpse into altcoin performance, and it suggests rapid and intense movement. The breakout from the triangle has pushed past the $1 trillion mark, reaching $1.09 trillion. The recent all-time high was set at $1.16 trillion, and it seems poised for further growth. The 1.618 Fibonacci level is positioned at $1.65 trillion. Bitcoin Dominance Stalls at 58.6% Source: TradingView Bitcoin Dominance appears to have hit a ceiling at 58.6%. Should this be confirmed by week's end, a decline to 54% and subsequently 51% may ensue. This scenario could herald a massive altseason, though much will depend on the potential intensity of a Bitcoin rally. $SOL Among the Key Beneficiaries TradingView Solana ($SOL) stands to gain significantly from this altcoin upswing, amid speculation that the Trump administration might support cryptocurrencies like $SOL and $XRP. $SOL is currently making strides to break free from its downward trend on the weekly chart, having touched the 0.618 Fibonacci level. At the chart's base, the Stochastic RSI might be on the verge of indicating a major upward price movement, potentially confirmed by the week's end.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Web3 technology is transforming the digital space, with leaders like Yeti Ouro, Chainlink, and Solana driving innovation and creating more user-friendly ecosystems. Table of Contents Transforming meme coin space: A more functional P2E Yeti Ouro Solana: Esteemed blockchain technology solution provider Chainlink: The oracle of web3 Web3’s vision Industry leaders like Yeti Ouro (YETIO), Chainlink (LINK), and Solana (SOL) are at the forefront of something big; Web3 technology is changing how the digital space operates. Everything is moving towards a balanced, effective, and user-friendly ecosystem. Each of them brings different technological innovations and applications. Transforming meme coin space: A more functional P2E Yeti Ouro The imminent launch of Yeti Ouro’s Play-To-Earn (P2E) gaming platform, is no doubt the most important step in transforming the viral appeal of the meme coin into a utility-driven powerhouse. A key milestone for Yeti was integrating blockchain technology into the tokenized economy by rewarding gaming achievements, allowing for seamless transfer of tokens. P2E has advanced staging mechanisms for coin holders, allowing Yeti to put itself on the map, and finally allowing the company to deliver on its commitment to low transaction speeds. A viral meme coin no more. Solana: Esteemed blockchain technology solution provider Experts predict that Solana’s technical foundation will stand unchallenged over time. Proof of this statement can be drawn from the 50,000 transactions per second the blockchain operates, all at relatively cheaper costs compared to other solutions. This performance benchmark is set to capture Solana’s strongest bullish trend. Currently, SOL price stands at $213.70, with a relatively bullish change of 7.2% in a day. Price behavior in the last few days has displayed that their bullish RSI strategy of above 60 remains relevant. Further, MACD signals also seem positive, and new histogram growth shows that momentum keeps increasing. Support at $175 and $160 became increasingly stronger, while the price faced resistance at stronger levels of $190 and $200. The proof-of-history (PoH) consensus mechanism increases Solana’s appeal, as it allows for dramatically faster validation. As a result, the network aims to further establish leadership in web3 innovation with a heightened focus on adoption within DeFi and NFTs. You might also like: XRP eyes $20, Cardano forms bullish trends, Yeti Ouro takes over P2E market Chainlink: The oracle of web3 Chainlink is crucial to Web3 as it allows smart contracts to interact with off-chain data safely and efficiently. Its technology powers vital use cases in DeFi, NFTs, and even enterprise adoption of blockchain. Currently, Chainlink is priced at $20.20, showing an increase of 8.08 in the last 24 hours. With the RSI sitting at 65, it suggests that the Token is almost overbought, which could signal resistance in the short term although MACD is showing bullish upward buying pressure. Strength supports are found at $19 and $18, with resistances sitting at $21 and $23. Chainlink is integrated into almost all parts of the web3 ecosystem for its pivotal ability to allow blockchain networks access to real-world data. Its emerging cross-chain interchain compatibility is providing even more usefulness, making it highly in demand for blockchain infrastructure. Web3’s vision The range of needs that Yeti Ouro, Solana, and Chainlink fulfill, from P2E gaming to scalability to the incorporation of smart contract data is proof of what blockchain technology is capable of. These projects are at the forefront of web3, leading the change between innovation and its real-world applicability. The scope for these tokens is vast and promising, which means as they evolve, their investment strategies will continue to grow deeply rooted in the advancement of decentralized systems, making them invaluable to the web3 ecosystem.

Bitcoin is holding above $100,000 and altcoins like SOL, ADA, LINK, XRP and LTC are shining as it's not just about a potential strategic bitcoin reserve anymore. Reports suggest Trump could announce crypto as a policy priority. Things are heating up for ether too. A blockchain address associated with Trump's World Liberty Finance (WLF) project snapped up nearly $10 million of ETH this week, according to Arkham Intelligence. And keep your eyes on layer-1 blockchain Near Protocol's NEAR. The token's supply dynamics look bullish, with the ratio of staked to unstaked NEAR rising, according to data source Flipside. Overall, the outlook for the crypto market is bullish, as Wednesday's U.S. CPI report has eased inflation concerns, allowing traders to focus on Trump's swearing-in. On-chain analysis from 21Shares shows there's still plenty of upside left for BTC. That said, consider the possibility of a price drop if a major announcement doesn't materialize on Trump's first day. ""The macroeconomic backdrop remains supportive, with unemployment trending downward, inflation showing signs of easing, and the market riding a wave of enthusiasm tied to Trump’s inauguration,"" Valentin Fournier, an analyst at BRN, said. ""We maintain a bullish outlook for Q1, though a correction could happen this week if the new administration doesn't outline a solid action plan."" Note that BTC is trading at a discount on Coinbase relative to Binance in a sign of weak demand from U.S. investors. Plus, Arkham Intelligence data shows a whale moved BTC worth over $1 billion to Coinbase on Thursday. Transfers to exchanges typically represent an investor intention to sell. And watch out for inflation worries creeping back. The U.S. PPI, which shows price pressures building up in the pipeline, rose above the CPI in December for the first time since 2022. Stay alert!

The token rose 17% to overtake bitcoin cash (BCH) in terms of market cap. Ethereum developers confirmed that the mainnet Pectra upgrade will take place in March, with a series of hard forks planned on Ethereum testnets in February. The upgrade will improve wallet functionality and increase the native staking limit to 2,048 ETH from 32 ETH. This increase means larger stakers like Coinbase and restaking protocols will be able to control fewer validators, reducing complexity. Coinbase currently has tens of thousands of validators. Altcoin whales are aggressively buying solana (SOL) in the lead-up to Donald Trump's inauguration. One particular wallet, reported by Lookonchain , bought $2.49 million worth of SOL and withdrew an additional $3.94 million worth out of Binance. It then deposited a total of 144,817 SOL ($30.4 million) into lending platform Kamino before borrowing $20 million of stablecoins. This is effectively taking a long position on SOL as when the value of the underlying asset rises, the user will have to pay less stablecoin. Derivatives Positioning Litecoin is the best-performing coin in terms of futures open interest growth and positive CVD readings that imply net buying pressure. HYPE stands out as overheated, with annualized funding rates in excess of 100%, according to Velo Data. The elevated funding rate indicates overcrowding in bullish bets. BTC's annualized one-month futures basis on the CME has climbed above 12%, surpassing ETH's 11%. BTC, ETH CME futures open interest, however, remains little changed and well below December highs. BTC, ETH options on Deribit show bias for calls.

Santiment’s recent data indicates a notable increase in whale transactions across different assets, suggesting possible market changes that may be important for investors. But what implications does this increased whale activity have for altcoin investors, and how can they maneuver through the opportunities and risks in this changing environment? Crypto Whale Activity: A Precursor to Market Movement Whale transactions are often a sign of significant price movements, as large investors take positions that can cause ripples in the market. The surge in crypto whale activity across several notable altcoins this week is no exception. Among the top performers in this category, the following assets have seen the most substantial increases, according to Santiment : $DAI (MakerDAO): +800% $DEXE (Dexe Network): +250% $ZRO (LayerZero): +200% $AAVE (Aave): +200% $TEL (Telcoin): +100% $GT (GateToken): +100% $XRP (Ripple): +81% Source: Santiment These significant increases in whale transactions could indicate that key stakeholders are either preparing for profit-taking or positioning themselves to buy the dip. Altcoins that experience heightened whale activity are often primed for potential price reversals. Hence, investors need to be cautious about the timing of their trades to capitalize on these shifts. The Impact of Crypto Whale Activity on Stablecoins The role of stablecoins in these transactions is particularly noteworthy. As Santiment points out, whale activity tied to stablecoins, such as Dai, often precedes a shift into altcoins that commonly pair with these stablecoins, particularly assets based on the Ethereum (ETH) network. For example, Dai is frequently used for ETH-based trades, and its rise in whale transactions signals the potential for larger funds to flow into altcoins within the Ethereum ecosystem. This pattern is an indicator of where the market might be headed, as large players look to move capital into promising altcoins. For altcoin investors, recognizing these trends could provide opportunities for strategic investment and the ability to enter positions before wider market moves. Minotaurus (MTAUR): A New Player on the Horizon Amid the surge in crypto whale activity, a new project gaining attention is Minotaurus (MTAUR), which could become an exciting opportunity for altcoin buyers. Minotaurus is an innovative Web3 gaming token that has been making waves with its presale campaign. The early-stage cryptocurrency in its presale phase, is currently available at 0.00006001 USDT, a 70% markdown from the upcoming listing price of 0.00020 USDT. Minotaurus is not just another token—it’s a project that integrates with the growing casual gaming industry, which is valued at over $15 billion. The MTAUR token serves as a gateway to exclusive game features and enhanced gameplay experiences. By participating in the presale, participants gain access to referral-based opportunities, vesting advantages, and a unique token structure that promotes long-term engagement with the platform. Minotaurus Tokenomics The platform has been audited by reputable companies like SolidProof and Coinsult, which guarantees the token’s integrity and security. This degree of openness, along with the current presale markdown, offers a favorable chance for individuals seeking to expand their altcoin portfolios with a Web3 gaming venture that may provide significant gains. What Does This Increased Crypto Whale Activity Mean for Altcoin Investors? Altcoin investors should take note of the increase in large investors this month. Whale transactions frequently indicate the onset of significant price shifts, and the assets experiencing the largest surges in whale activity, such as MakerDAO’s DAI, Dexe Network’s DEXE, and LayerZero’s ZRO, could be set for upward movement. Nevertheless, it is essential to focus on the larger trends within the market. The emergence of Web3 initiatives, like Minotaurus, may provide investors a chance to explore new cryptos to buy that correspond with the increasing enthusiasm for decentralized gaming and digital experiences. As the casual gaming sector continues to grow and Web3 gains wider acceptance, tokens such as MTAUR could be valuable to explore within a diversified altcoin investment approach. Final Thoughts As the month progresses and more whale activity shapes market sentiment, altcoin investors should stay vigilant, monitoring transactions and trends closely. Recognizing early signals of whale-driven market movements, while also exploring new projects with long-term potential like Minotaurus, could position investors for success in the fast-evolving cryptocurrency space.

The cancellation is speculated to be part of Sony’s decision to scale down live-service titles since the PS5 was released. The game studios will remain operational, and speculation builds over probable staff layoffs. The Japanese media company has been a core stakeholder in the gaming sphere, given its development of PlayStation consoles and other game titles. However, the company recently shifted its approach and scaled down the development of some games in its portfolio. Sony cancels major live-service projects Jason Schreier just reported Sony canceled both Bend Studio and Bluepoint's games. Both were live service. One of them was a live service God of War game…This is unreal. PlayStation's studio mismanagement this generation is embarrassing. pic.twitter.com/LIeoCJ8SoK — MBG (@xMBGx) January 16, 2025 Jason Schreier reported that Sony would be cancelling two major live-service projects that Bend Studio and Bluepoint Games were developing. Bend Studio’s canceled project was a military shooter game, while Bluepoint’s project was a God of War-like live-service game. The Japanese firm will keep Bend Studio and Bluepoint Games open following the cancellation of their projects. The report expects the Bluepoint Games and Bend Studio to be assigned to new projects that will tap into each studio’s strengths. The cancellation of the two projects is not an isolated incident and is linked to Sony’s ambitious goals that were announced in 2022. Sony had previously set a lofty goal that it was going to launch 12 live-service titles by March 2026 to tap into the revenue generated by the genre. However, by mid-2023, Sony’s CFO Hiroki Totoki announced that the company’s goal had been cut to six live-service games by 2026. Totoki stated that the decision was made to ensure the games met gamer expectations while also ensuring they would be playable for a long time. With the cancellation of the two projects in early 2025, Sony’s ability to meet its goal became questionable. The Japanese firm has so far canceled eight live-service games. The Japanese company has dropped Bluepoint’s God of War game, Bend Studio’s military shooter, Bungie’s Destiny spin-off “Payback,” Firesprite’s Twisted Metal project, and Firewalk Studios’ Concord, which closed shortly after launch. Sony also scrapped Insomniac’s Spider-Man live-service game, London Studio’s co-op project, and Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us Online. Sony’s list of upcoming live-service games shrunk further, with only a handful remaining in development. The Japanese video game company is still working on four games, but no further information has been provided on the projects so far. The games under development include a Horizon Zero Dawn multiplayer game, Fairgame$ by Haven, Bungie’s extraction shooter Marathon in 2025, and another Bungie game codenamed “Gummi Bears.” Additionally, while Bend Studio and Bluepoint Games remain open, the company has yet to provide more information on whether layoffs and job cuts will be coming. Gamers speculate on the future of Sony’s Live-service games Gamers online speculated on the future of Sony’s live-service titles after news of the two cancelled projects spread. Many gamers likened Sony to Ubisoft after it added the two projects to its extensive list of cancelled titles, which had seemingly expanded over the last two years. The gamers said they were surprised that Sony pulled the plug after the studios developing the games had sunk in years of effort. The gamers added that Sony had mismanaged the much-anticipated games and they’d only recover in the PS6 generation. “That’s why they barely had games. They kept canceling their games and lost lots of time and resources and doing so. Maybe they are avoiding Concord part 2 and now minimizing their losses.” – Cloud However, some gamers welcomed the news, saying that the Japanese company must have known that the public did not want more poor-quality live-service gamers. This section of gamers stated that only the video game company knew the status of the projects and had made an informed decision to prevent another disaster like Concord from happening. The gamers also questioned Sony’s next move, with emphasis on what would come next for the development staff and the status of future games developed by beloved game studios such as Bluepoint.

Users are advised to resolve issues by updating their details, appealing, or seeking help via Telegram. The team recommends clear, well-lit video submissions for liveness checks, completing all Mainnet Checklist steps, and signing the token acknowledgment to ensure a smooth transition to the ecosystem. ‘Complete This Action Today if Needed’ Pi Network – a controversial crypto project that claims to enable people to mine digital assets directly from their smartphones – officially saw the light of day in 2019. Despite being around for quite a while, its native token remains unavailable for trading. Moreover, the community is still anticipating the launch of its fully operational blockchain and Open Network. Last year, the team assured that the Open Network will be introduced once 15 million users pass necessary Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verifications and migrate to the mainnet (known as the Grace Period) before January 31 . Earlier this month, Pi Network revealed that it is making “excellent progress,” with over 9 million successful migrations. Prior to that, the developers maintained that 14 million people had completed the verification process. However, some users have recently complained that their KYC applications have been rejected for various reasons. Pi Network recently advised those experiencing such issues to “either spend Pi to update their name or appeal to resubmit their KYC application.” “Complete this action today if needed,” the project added. In October, the team gave another option to users struggling with KYC and migration procedures. It urged those to join a dedicated Telegram chat “where there will be mods to answer your questions.” Additional Tips A week ago, Pi Network’s team claimed that KYC verifications and migration to the mainnet might happen faster if users “make sure the video is clear with good lighting” when completing the procedures. “When prompted in the mining app for such additional liveness checks, please take the liveness checks and do not close the popup. Sign the token acknowledgment even if you are still waiting for your KYC results as it is required for anyone to migrate to Mainnet anyway,” the developers advised. Others might have to secure their accounts as required in the Mainnet Checklist. To do so, they should review their application, complete any necessary actions when notified, and finalize their KYC results promptly to prepare for migration.

The U.S. captured a commanding 46% of capital investment, significantly outpacing Hong Kong, which secured 16%. The country also led in deal count, with 36% of global crypto VC deals involving U.S.-headquartered companies. U.S. Dominates Crypto VC in Q4 This crypto VC dominance comes despite what industry leaders have described as a challenging regulatory environment under the outgoing administration. Ryan McMillin, co-founder and chief investment officer at Merkle Tree Capital, attributes the U.S.’s lead to its robust financial market and innovation sector. “There are simply more venture capitalists and limited partners in the U.S.,” McMillin said. He noted a 46% quarter-on-quarter surge in U.S. capital deployment, attributing this spike to the certainty of a pro-crypto Trump administration set to take office. A Pro-Crypto Administration Sparks Optimism With Donald Trump’s inauguration set for Jan. 20 , the crypto industry is optimistic about a shift in regulatory tone. Hundreds of pro-crypto candidates have also secured seats in Congress, signaling the potential for a more supportive legislative environment. McMillin expects this transition to ignite a surge in venture capital activity. “The move from a hostile administration to one that is pro-crypto will be like night to day,” McMillin remarked, referencing the previous administration’s regulatory crackdowns, including Operation Chokepoint 2.0, which targeted crypto firms. “Institutional adoption won’t just stop at Bitcoin and Ethereum. Allocators will explore the entire spectrum of digital assets, including mid-caps, small caps, and venture capital opportunities.” Galaxy’s report echoed McMillin’s optimism, noting that despite regulatory hurdles, U.S. companies continued to dominate the crypto VC landscape. The report also projected increased U.S. dominance under the incoming administration, particularly if key regulatory frameworks—such as stablecoin legislation and market structure policies—are finalized. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a key player in crypto regulation, reported $8.2 billion in financial remedies in its latest annual report, underscoring the challenges faced by the industry. However, the number of enforcement cases by the SEC dropped 26% from the previous year, hinting at a potential easing of regulatory pressures.

New L-2 Solaxy Nets $10M in Funding Frenzy,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/trump-eyes-xrp-and-solana-new-l-2-solaxy-nets-10m-in-funding-frenzy/,"The crypto market seems to be relieved ever since the appointment of Donald Trump as the new POTUS. Frank Chaparro, an early Bitcoin investor, calls this an end of 4 years of regulatory “harassment” and “terror,” which was blatant under the Biden administration. Earlier, banks were issued strict guidelines to stay away from businesses involving cryptocurrencies. This led to a massive debanking movement, where banks deboarded businesses that had anything to do with cryptocurrencies. As per Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist, 30 of his invested startups faced debanking. It’s not like the banks had too much of a choice, either. They would face regulatory harassment if they didn’t do what they were told. This “privatized sanctions regime”, as Andreessen calls it, crippled the entire US crypto market, and growth became stagnant. Startups left the US for better opportunities abroad. However, now the tide seems to be turning. Trump has been very vocal about his pro-crypto stance, which was one of his major election agendas. Analysts expect several crypto-favored laws to be passed, and there have already been early signs of that. Trump appointed ex-PayPal COO David Sacks as the new AI and crypto czar . Not that there’s any second-guessing Trump’s admiration for the crypto market, but he very recently became the first US President to have his visage on the BTC blockchain. However, it’s also expected that the Trump administration would adopt an America-first strategy, where the focus would be more on native American assets such as Solana, XRP, and Ripple. The Solana Sweet Spot This news comes just at the right time – a new Bitwise report expects Solana to surge by more than 3,000% by 2030. This means that the current price of $212 could go all the way up to $6,636, thanks to the “iPhone moment”. Just as iPhone introduced technology to the world in 2007, Solana has built a fast, responsive, and easy-to-use platform, which aims to simplify crypto investments for the average investor. The report also expects Solana’s current market share of 2.84% to surge to 11.36%. There’s good data to back up this claim, too. For instance, SOL saw a 2,800% increase in early 2024. Even in the sluggish 2023 phase, SOL saw a 239% increase in daily active users. As per Bitwise, Solana is also way more efficient than the Layer-2 Ethereum chain. And now, Solana has also introduced its first Layer-2 solution – Solaxy ($SOLX) . If you want a chunk of this Solana frenzy, now might be the right time. Why Can $SOLX Be the Next Big Meme Coin? Solana has been serving the crypto community for a while, and with time, it has been plagued with a couple of issues. The traffic on Solana is way too congested, which leads to slow or failed transactions, which brings in scalability issues. This is where $SOLX comes into the picture. It’s the first-ever Layer-2 solution. It shares the burden of Solana’s Layer-1, leading to smoother operation. $SOLX bundles transactions through batch processing, which translates to lower overall costs and higher throughputs. $SOLX has gained a lot of attention from meme coin investors and influencers and become the hottest presale of January 2025 . It has raised $10.8M in presales, with several rounds still left. Early investors can also benefit from 325% APY staking rewards. The project has reserved 10% of the total supply for listing and another 30% for development, showing the developer’s long-term commitment to the project. 25% of the supply has been kept for rewards and 15% for marketing. This reinforces the project’s objective of building a community-driven meme space. Now that experts have dished out a positive outlook for Solana, Solaxy is all set to ride on the bull wave. Currently available at $0.001602, $SOLX could make you a millionaire in 2025 . However, ensure that you only buy $SOLX from the official Solaxy presale page , as there are a lot of scams around, and you certainly do not want to lose money.

As of press time, Litecoin is changing hands at around $137.34, up 21.5% on the day, CoinGecko data shows . According to blockchain analytics firm Santiment, the rally is driven by Litecoin whales and sharks snapping up roughly 250,000 LTC, valued at around $29 million since Jan. 9. Bloomberg Analysts Confident Litecoin ETF Is Next Litecoin’s surge also followed Canary Capital’s amendment to its S-1 registration form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 15, a move pundits deem a significant step toward regulatory engagement. Canary’s ETF proposal, should it secure SEC’s regulatory green light, Litecoin would join Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as the only other cryptocurrencies with U.S.-approved spot ETFs. The filing elicited comments from Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, with Balchunas pointing to “chatter that the Litecoin S-1 had gotten comments back from SEC,” suggesting that it “bodes well” for projections that Litecoin is likely to be the next major crypto to secure its own spot ETFs. Multiple asset managers have been vying for several different spot crypto ETFs, including ones based on LTC. Canary Capital first filed its Litecoin ETF S-1 statement with the SEC in October 2024. After the amended S-1 filing on Wednesday, the Nasdaq exchange filed the crucial 19b-4 form on behalf of Canary. This is a regulatory filing that formally starts the clock for approval or denial by the SEC. The form says Coinbase Custody Trust Company LLC will custody the ETFs Litecoin. According to Balchunas, the looming leadership change at the SEC as Paul Atkins replaces Gary Gensler as the regulator’s chairman introduces a “huge variable” in the regulatory outlook. Atkins is expected to create a more favorable environment for crypto ETF approvals. In a Jan. 16 post on X, the Bloomberg analyst added that the Litecoin ETF application has met all the requisite requirements and conditions for approval. Litecoin ETF now has all the boxes checked. The first alt coin ETF of 2025 is about to be on the clock. I don't see any reason why this would be withdrawn either given SEC gave comments on the S-1, litecoin is seen as commodity and there's new SEC sheriff in town. https://t.co/DaE7jxlb9s — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 16, 2025 Despite the latest rally, Litecoin remains 68% below its all-time high of $410.26 reached in May 2021, leaving room for growth if the SEC ends up giving its regulatory blessing.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|Litecoin,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|LTC|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-17 12:18:06

Aptos network continues to build decentralized applications and tools for developers. But how about APT’s performance? How high will it go? Is APT a good investment? Let’s explore these questions in our Cryptopolitan price predictions from 2025 to 2031.

The William Alligator trendlines are closing signaling falling volatility, while the relative strength index is now in neutral territory. The MACD histogram indicator signals positive price momentum. Aptos 4-hour chart price analysis Aptos/ USD 4-hour chart. TradingView The 4-hour chart differs from the daily chart with rising volatility while registering positive price momentum on the MACD histograms. If Apto’s price drops, watch the $8.57 level on the chart at the channel’s lower trendline. The cryptocurrency could find resistance near a range of narrow consolidation. Investors should monitor the $10.00 level upon an upside revival. A rally into this area would likely face resistance from an earlier high at the flattening 200-day EMA.

Our analysis shows a neutral market sentiment, while the Fear and Greed Index shows greed among investors. The charts also show APT continues to register rising volatility. Why is Aptos up? Aptos was bullish in the last quarter of 2024. The wider crypto market shared a similar sentiment despite a correction into 2025. Is Aptos a good investment? APTOS’s design prioritizes scalability, reliability, and upgradeability. It is notable for using the MOVE programming language, developed by Facebook and now META. While the current trend is bearish, predictions paint a different narrative. Will Aptos reach $10? Yes, Aptos rose above $10 this year. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will Aptos reach $100? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, Aptos will reach the $100 mark in 2031. Will Aptos reach $1000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that Aptos will get to $1000 before 2031. Does Aptos have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, Aptos will trade higher in years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Recent news: CEO Mohammad Shaikh resigns Mohammad Shaikh, co-founder and CEO of Aptos Labs, has resigned from the top position to “start a new chapter,” with co-founder and chief technology officer Avery Ching taking over as the CEO.

The network disclosed this in a January 17 blog post, noting that it aligns with its mission to build a global onchain economy. According to the post , Base, which has already achieved significant success in less than two years, wants to increase its global footprint in 2025. The network plans to do this by achieving goals such as onboarding 25 million people, bringing 25,000 developers, and increasing the total amount of transactions to one billion by October. The L2 network also intends to improve its scalability by increasing blockspace capacity to 250 million gas units per second (Mgas/s) With ambitious goals ahead, the Base team has already devised a strategy to achieve its targets. The strategy focuses on five key areas: builders, apps, ownership, markets, and decentralization. As part of its strategy to become the preferred platform for builders, Base will now deploy more developer-friendly tools, including OnchainKit improvements, AI agents, and mini-app development tools. In addition, it plans to improve the overall on-chain experience for builders and developers by providing tools that help them earn more, go viral, and generally expand distribution. The blog post reads: “We will nurture a vibrant ecosystem of connected, open onchain apps that grow the number of people using Base. More apps translate to more concrete reasons for every single person to get onchain.” Meanwhile, The Base team also focuses on decentralizing the network and improving its scalability. Thus, it is working on driving transaction costs below 1 cent and speed below 1 second while reaching Stage 1 decentralization by the end of this year. Coinbase targets on-chain with new products Meanwhile, Base’s goals align with Coinbase’s broader target of providing more on-chain products. The publicly traded exchange has been bullish about bringing more people on-chain and recently launched Bitcoin-backed loan products, enabling users to borrow USDC through the Coinbase app and use BTC as collateral. Products like Base, Smart Wallet, and other DeFi-related products from Coinbase highlight how the exchange has built a broad on-chain ecosystem to attract more mainstream investments. Perhaps the best explanation for this comes from the Smart Wallet team lead, Max Branzburg , who noted how the exchange has been iterating over the years and how products are being developed to address people’s ability to come on-chain. He said: “First, it was too hard to get onchain, so we built the @coinbase app. Then, networks were too slow and expensive – so we built @base. Then, wallets were still too complex, so we built the Smart Wallet.” He added that the Bitcoin loan is only the first step in bringing finance fully on-chain, and more Coinbase will make it accessible to millions of people who hold billions of dollars in assets. Coinbase gets criticism for arbitrarily blocking users’ accounts Despite its on-chain ambitions, the exchange has come under fire from some users for arbitrarily blocking their accounts. Ex Coinbase employee Griffin McShane recently called out the exchange on X after his account was temporarily blocked for two months because he was trying to withdraw a deposit. In Coinbase’s email to Griffin, they claimed this was a measure to keep his account safe, as monitoring shows that he is sending crypto to a fraudulent platform or person. However, McShane noted that he has used the same account for years, including when he worked at Coinbase. Although the exchange has now resolved the issue, several users claimed that they had faced the same problem with Coinbase, which resulted in them being locked out of their accounts for months. Meanwhile, blockchain sleuth ZachXBT noted that Coinbase has a major fraud problem that it has failed to address while blocking legitimate users.

Nonetheless, Rexas Finance seems set to become a major player as we prepare for the much-expected 2025 bull run. Rexas Finance stands out among meme coins because it has real-world use cases backed by solid fundamentals and aims to change traditional finance. In contrast, community-driven memes mainly drive PEPE and SHIB. This article details which coin can turn $900 into $9000 in three months. Shiba Inu (SHIB) with The Meme Coin Legacy Despite its popularity, SHIB has struggled to retain its upward momentum. Its short-term potential has been viewed differently by analysts. Some predict an increment of 12x in the next bull run, which might hit $0.0002922 Nevertheless, given current market conditions and SHIB’s colossal market cap, which creates challenging conditions for big price swings, attaining a 10x return over three months may be all it can do. Pepe Coin (PEPE): The Newest Trending Meme Another meme-based cryptocurrency to note is Pepe Coin, inspired by the known internet meme ‘Pepe the Frog.’ Its unique approach has made it popular in terms of social media engagement and viral marketing. PEPE's history, marked by excellent price volatility, is typical for meme coins. According to a recent analysis, PEPE could overtake SHIB in market capitalization before 2025. However, there are uncertainties in the short run. Although a meme coin could experience sharp price increases due to social media frenzy or endorsements from key personalities like Elon Musk, it still needs to do better outside the market buzz. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Rising Coin Set for a 90x Return Rexas Finance's relatively new entry into the space focuses on tokenizing real-world assets like real estate and commodities. This method will make liquid investments accessible even for traditionally illiquid investments. RXS's current selling price in the presale stage is $0.175. However, within five weeks, its value could reach $7 or more, with various estimates suggesting an increase of $15.75, 90x times its current value in twelve weeks. RXS's innovation in tokenizing assets, which has excellent growth potential, is the reason for such optimism. Rexas Finance meets a significant market need by allowing fractional participation in real-world assets, which may lead to widespread adoption. Its high pre-sale ratings and active community indicate investor confidence. Why Can Rexas Finance outdo PEPE and SHIB in 2025? Unlike meme coins such as SHIB and PEPE, Rexas Finance creatively uses blockchain technology to create tangible value. This changing market trend focuses on utility and sustainability as key criteria for investment choices; this is where RXS fits perfectly well. Moreover, regulation should become more pronounced as cryptocurrency markets develop. Without much use, “meme” coins will struggle with increasing scrutiny of regulators in the crypto space. Projects like Rexas Finance are better positioned to thrive under these conditions with strong audit and compliance policies. Rexas Finance (RXS): A wise choice in 2025 The year looks like a crypto market full of opportunities, looking up to the bull run. Pepe Coin and Shiba Inu may bring quick, lucky returns, but their overreliance on speculative enthusiasm constrains their long-term outlook. Alternatively, Rexas Finance (RXS) combines strong fundamentals with creativity and usability. Rexas Finance is the obvious next great opportunity. With an expanding ecosystem, successful pre-sale, and innovative asset tokenization approach, RXS sets itself up as the breakout star of the 2025 bull run. No matter your level of investing skill or newfound knowledge about cryptocurrencies, Rexas Finance offers a perfect blend of stability and explosive growth potential. Final Thoughts Making $9,000 out of $900 within 90 days will be an ambitious target, necessitating evaluating high-potential assets. RXS is the most promising among Shiba Inu, Pepe Coin, and Rexas Finance in reaching this goal due to its innovative approach to tokenizing assets and bullish outlooks. Rexas Finance (RXS) is a convincing option for individuals who want to make life-changing wealth in this bull run. Its originality, due to its focus on asset tokenization in the real world, presale success, and optimistic forecasts, makes it so.

However, Rexas Finance is emerging as a strong contender in anticipation of the eagerly awaited 2025 bull run. Standing out among meme coins, Rexas Finance offers tangible use cases underpinned by robust fundamentals, aiming to revolutionize traditional finance. In comparison, PEPE and SHIB are largely driven by their communities. This article explores which cryptocurrency could potentially turn $900 into $9000 in a mere three months. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and the Legacy of Meme Coins While SHIB has gained significant popularity, maintaining its growth has been a challenge. Analysts have differing views on its short-term potential. Some suggest it could see a 12x increase in the next bull run, possibly reaching $0.0002922. Yet, considering the current market landscape and SHIB’s massive market cap, which makes large price jumps difficult, a 10x return in three months might be the best it can achieve. Pepe Coin (PEPE): The Latest Meme Coin Sensation Pepe Coin, inspired by the famous internet meme ‘Pepe the Frog,’ is another meme-based cryptocurrency worth watching. Its unique style has gained traction through social media buzz and viral marketing. Known for its price volatility, PEPE's history aligns with what is typical for meme coins. Recent analysis suggests that PEPE could surpass SHIB in market cap before 2025. However, its short-term outlook is uncertain. Although meme coins might see rapid price surges due to social media hype or endorsements from figures like Elon Musk, they often struggle outside the excitement of the market. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Emerging Coin Poised for a 90x Gain Rexas Finance, a newcomer in the crypto world, is focused on tokenizing tangible assets such as real estate and commodities. This approach aims to make traditionally illiquid investments more accessible. Currently priced at $0.175 in its presale phase, RXS could soar to $7 or even higher within five weeks, with some forecasts predicting a rise to $15.75—90 times its initial value in twelve weeks. This optimism stems from RXS's innovative asset tokenization, which holds vast growth potential. By facilitating fractional ownership of real-world assets, Rexas Finance addresses a crucial market demand, potentially leading to widespread adoption. Its strong presale performance and vibrant community reflect investor confidence. How Rexas Finance Could Surpass PEPE and SHIB by 2025 Rexas Finance distinguishes itself from meme coins like SHIB and PEPE by leveraging blockchain technology to generate real value. This shift in market trends prioritizes utility and sustainability, making RXS an ideal fit. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, regulation is likely to become more stringent. Meme coins, lacking substantial utility, may face increased scrutiny from regulators. Meanwhile, projects like Rexas Finance, with their solid auditing and compliance frameworks, are better equipped to thrive. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Smart Investment for 2025 The upcoming year is poised to offer ample opportunities in the crypto market, gearing up for a bull run. While Pepe Coin and Shiba Inu might offer quick and fortunate returns, their dependence on speculative enthusiasm limits their long-term prospects. In contrast, Rexas Finance (RXS) combines strong fundamentals with creativity and practical applications. Rexas Finance stands out as a promising opportunity. With its growing ecosystem, successful presale, and innovative asset tokenization strategy, RXS is positioned to be the breakout sensation of the 2025 bull run. Whether you're an experienced investor or new to the crypto scene, Rexas Finance presents a balanced mix of stability and potential for explosive growth. Concluding Thoughts The ambition to turn $900 into $9,000 in just 90 days calls for the identification of high-potential assets. Among Shiba Inu, Pepe Coin, and Rexas Finance , RXS shows the most promise in achieving this target, thanks to its innovative asset tokenization approach and optimistic outlook. Rexas Finance (RXS) stands as a compelling choice for those aiming to create significant wealth during this bull run.

This sharp decline reflects the market’s natural volatility when new integrations are introduced. Binance’s impact on token prices is significant, often influencing substantial market shifts. While SOLV’s price faces short-term challenges, its deeper integration into exchange ecosystem could help stabilize its performance in the long run. The move could ultimately increase liquidity and drive broader adoption, despite the current price fluctuations. Binance Expands Solv Protocol Integration Across Key Services On Jan 17, Binance announced to integrate Solv Protocol into its ecosystem marks a strategic step in increasing accessibility for the token. This move enables users to engage with SOLV through multiple trading and payment options. The introduction of SOLV to Binance’s “Buy Crypto” section allows users to purchase the token through convenient payment methods, such as VISA, MasterCard, and Apple Pay. Additionally, SOLV can now be traded on Binance Convert, providing zero-fee swaps with popular tokens like BTC and USDT. This not only boosts its liquidity but also attracts both new and experienced traders to explore its potential. The platform has also listed SOLV as a borrowable asset on its Cross and Isolated Margin trading platforms, providing traders with more leverage options. Early access to borrowing for VIP users further enhances trading opportunities for high-volume participants. Binance Futures Brings High Leverage Opportunities for Solv Protocol The addition of the USDT SOLV Perpetual Contract on Binance Futures offers traders a unique opportunity to leverage SOLV with up to 75x. This feature is designed for experienced traders, allowing them to capitalize on small price movements for potentially significant returns. One key aspect of this contract is the capped funding rate of ±2.00%, ensuring that the costs of holding positions remain predictable. The funding fee is settled every four hours, providing traders with greater clarity and control over their trades. Additionally, the Multi-Assets Mode allows users to trade SOLV contracts using other assets, such as BTC as collateral. By introducing such advanced features, one of the top crypto exchanges not only boosts the trading potential for Solv Protocol but also provides an opportunity for increased liquidity and market activity. SOLV Price Analysis and Binance’s Influence Solv Protocol price was currently trading at $0.14, reflecting a 35% drop in the last 24 hours. The token’s 24-hour range of $0.137 to $0.2277 highlights its recent volatility. It has a market cap of $218 million and $231.26 million in trading volume in last 24 hours. Binance’s influence on token prices is evident, as seen in past cases like Sonic which surged 13% after gaining expanded support. While SOLV’s price has initially declined, the broader exposure and liquidity provided by its ecosystem could stabilize the token. As trading activity grows across futures, margin, and spot platforms, SOLV may recover its footing and gain stronger market momentum.

Make a Smart Investment Choice - Buy $CYBRO Solana's SOL Coin: Powering a Scalable Blockchain for Decentralized Apps Solana is a blockchain platform built for scalability. It offers a foundation for decentralized applications, known as dapps. Competing with Ethereum and Cardano, Solana stands out with its design focused on faster transactions. Developers can use multiple programming languages, making it flexible for different projects. SOL is the native cryptocurrency of Solana. It is central to the ecosystem, enabling transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network supporters. The SOL coin holds value by supporting the operation of Solana's ecosystem. Unlike some platforms, Solana doesn't use sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. This approach aims to attract developers and investors with its high-capacity network and potential to host products and services with high activity. Conclusion While established coins like SOL show steady progress, their short-term potential seems limited. In contrast, CYBRO emerges as a cutting-edge DeFi platform offering investors exceptional opportunities. By harnessing AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain, CYBRO maximizes earnings for its users. Features such as attractive staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases enhance the user experience. Seamless deposits and withdrawals make interactions effortless.

With tokens like RETARDIO gaining traction, the question arises: can the meme coin craze contribute to a 10x increase in SOL’s value? Amid Solana’s dynamic market movements, JetBolt (JBOLT) is stealing the spotlight with its presale surpassing 270 million tokens sold. Unlike meme coins, JetBolt focuses on innovation, offering zero-gas technology, a SocialFi staking model, and an intuitive Web3 wallet—all designed to redefine blockchain usability. Can meme coins elevate Solana’s value, or will JetBolt’s innovative approach lead the next wave of crypto success? Let’s dive deeper to explore the driving forces behind these two coins. Will Meme Coins Lead to a 10x Increase in Solana’s Value? The rise of meme coins in the Solana ecosystem has sparked debates about whether these speculative tokens could contribute to a substantial 10x increase in SOL’s value. While meme coins bring a unique mix of humor and hype, their role in driving long-term value for Solana deserves a closer look. Recent activity in Solana’s ecosystem highlights the influence of meme coins. For instance, RETARDIO has posted gains of over 15% during the past seven days. However, the speculative nature of these assets was underscored when a trader spent $200,000 in priority fees to snipe a meme coin, only to incur significant losses. This volatility attracts high-risk traders but does not necessarily equate to sustainable value for Solana itself. Price Movements of Solana Meme Coins This Week (Source: CoinMarketCap) From a broader perspective, meme coins can amplify interest in Solana by increasing on-chain activity and attracting retail traders. However, their impact on SOL’s price largely depends on whether they encourage meaningful ecosystem growth. Projects that bring long-term utility—such as decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms or infrastructure advancements—play a far greater role in Solana’s valuation. JetBolt Hits Another Milestone, Turning Heads Across the Blockchain World While Solana’s ecosystem explores the unpredictable tides of meme coin surges, JetBolt (JBOLT) is carving its niche in the crypto space with a very different kind of excitement. Surpassing the 270-million-token mark in its presale, JetBolt continues to gain traction as a project bringing utility, accessibility, and a touch of creativity to blockchain innovation. Despite not being a meme coin, JetBolt has a playful, engaging vibe, complete with a lightning cat mascot that resonates with both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and curious newcomers. This blend of fun and functionality creates a unique identity in a crowded market, making JetBolt as relatable as it is innovative. JetBolt’s appeal lies in its dedication to creating a seamless user experience through cutting-edge technology. Powered by the Skale network, JetBolt’s zero-gas framework is engineered to eliminate gas fees altogether. This feature has the potential to unlock a new wave of adoption for decentralized applications (dApps), enabling users to interact with blockchain technology without worrying about prohibitive costs. JetBolt’s ecosystem is live and operational from day one, featuring standout elements like its SocialFi staking model, wherein users can also earn rewards by building connections and engaging within the JetBolt platform. Add the intuitive Web3 wallet with biometric security, and you have a platform designed for accessibility and ease of use. The ongoing presale offers exclusive perks, including Alpha Boxes that provide up to 25% extra tokens for bulk purchases. These rewards have fueled excitement and encouraged early participation, pushing JetBolt’s token sales to remarkable heights. Final Thoughts: Will Meme Coins 10x Solana’s Value As JetBolt Sells Over 270 Million Tokens In Its Presale? Meme coins can temporarily boost attention and engagement, but Solana’s ability to achieve a 10x price increase hinges on sustained institutional interest, ecosystem development, and the resolution of current challenges, such as inflationary concerns. For now, meme coins add excitement but remain only one piece of a larger puzzle. JetBolt is blazing its own trail, captivating the market with its innovative features and a presale that’s already crossed an impressive milestone of 270 million tokens sold. Although not a typical meme coin, JetBolt embodies meme appeal with its futuristic cat mascot, combined with its vision for blockchain efficiency and usability, making it appealing to a wide range of crypto whales, buyers, and even meme coin enthusiasts.

Instead, his attention is turning to WallitIQ (WLTQ) , a SHIB rival poised for far greater gains. As the Shiba Inu price struggles to meet inflated expectations, the SHIB rival is emerging as a strong contender with its groundbreaking technology and strong market positioning. Heeding the Dogecoin analyst's warning, thousands of investors are racing for a share of this SHIB rival before it sells out. Shiba Inu Price’s $1 Prediction Defies Current Market Standing This Dogecoin analyst, well-known for his objective technical analysis, debunked unverified predictions of the Shiba Inu price hitting $1. He emphasized that the biggest roadblock to the Shiba Inu price of $1 valuation is its enormous supply. 589.3 trillion Shoba Inu (SHIB) tokens are currently in circulation, with a market capitalization of $18 billion at the current Shiba Inu price. A simple calculation will reveal that at $1, the Shiba Inu price would have a market cap of $589.3 trillion—a valuation higher than the total wealth on Earth. This makes the Dogecoin analyst adamant, insisting that there is no chance the Shiba Inu price will rise to $1 if more than 99% of its circulating supply isn't burned. The Dogecoin analyst also suggested that its community shrink its supply by sending them to dead wallets, where they can never be accessed. Theoretically, the Dogecoin analyst believes that this will make the Shiba Inu price rise proportionately to the number of tokens burned. Dogecoin Analyst Reveals WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Path To $18 As investors begin to reject the unrealistic Shiba Inu price prediction, the Dogecoin analyst has suggested a SHIB rival. Projected to reach $18 soon, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has raised almost $7.5 million in its ongoing presale. This SHIB rival has delivered nearly $3.5 million in monthly revenue for consecutive months, feeding investors' trust in its potential for a massive rally. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is a comprehensive wallet for crypto enthusiasts by combining essential functionalities, real-time insights, and an intuitive user interface. For instance, it simplifies the payment process by generating scannable QR codes for wallet addresses. This functionality promotes error-free sharing of wallet details, simplifying the process of receiving payment and eliminating the need for manual input of lengthy wallet strings. Furthermore, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) MVP mobile app provides users with simulated wallets for Ethereum (ETH) and Tether (USDT), offering a risk-free environment to learn and practice wallet management operations. By mimicking real-world processes, new investors can experiment with crypto management without dealing with actual blockchain networks. Moreover, WallitIQ (WLTQ) also provides educational resources for investors' consumption, equipping them with the technical know-how required to stay profitable WallitIQ (WLTQ) also delivers real-time market data through its integration with the Coingecko API. Users can access accurate crypto price updates for information about market movements at all times. This carefully designed display offers users a snapshot of the crypto market's pulse, equipping them with the data to track asset performance effortlessly. To top these, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has completed its smart contract audit by SolidProof , a well-respected smart contract auditing firm. With this achievement, alongside WallitIQ's (WLTQ) potential to hit $18 shortly, thousands of investors hurry for a share of the SHIB rival's 1 billion token supply, buying out its presale allocation in a few days. Conclusion The Shiba Inu price $1 dream has been exposed as a myth, while WallitIQ (WLTQ) solidifies itself as the next big contender in the crypto market. The Dogecoin analyst unflinchingly believes that WallitIQ's (WLTQ) features and massive growth potential makes it a superior investment compared to the Shiba Inu price’s stagnation. This SHIB rival is rewriting the rules, so don't miss the chance to secure a stake in WallitIQ (WLTQ) before it becomes a breakout star. Act now; buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) at $0.0420 today.

Instead, he shifts focus to WallitIQ (WLTQ) , a SHIB competitor that appears to have much stronger prospects. As Shiba Inu struggles to meet lofty expectations, WallitIQ is gaining traction thanks to its innovative technology and solid market position. Heeding the analyst's advice, thousands of investors are rushing to secure their share of this SHIB competitor before it's too late. Why Shiba Inu Reaching $1 Is Unlikely Given Current Market Conditions A renowned Dogecoin analyst, known for his precise technical insights, has dismissed predictions that the Shiba Inu price could reach $1. He points out that the main obstacle is its massive supply of 589.3 trillion SHIB tokens currently in circulation, paired with a market cap of $18 billion at its present price. Simple math shows that a $1 price would imply a market cap of $589.3 trillion, surpassing the total wealth on the planet. This leads the analyst to firmly believe that such a price is unattainable unless over 99% of its supply is destroyed. He also suggests that the Shiba Inu community could reduce its supply by transferring tokens to dead wallets, which are inaccessible. In theory, the analyst believes this strategy could drive up the Shiba Inu price relative to the number of tokens burned. Dogecoin Analyst Forecasts WallitIQ (WLTQ) to Reach $18 With investors losing faith in the Shiba Inu $1 prediction, the Dogecoin analyst has suggested a promising alternative. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is anticipated to hit $18 in the near future, having already secured nearly $7.5 million in its presale phase. This SHIB competitor has consistently generated close to $3.5 million in monthly revenue, boosting investor confidence in its potential for significant growth. WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers a comprehensive solution for crypto users, featuring key functionalities, real-time insights, and a user-friendly interface. It streamlines payments by creating scannable QR codes for wallet addresses, allowing for seamless sharing of wallet information and removing the hassle of manually entering long wallet strings. Additionally, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) MVP mobile app provides simulated wallets for Ethereum (ETH) and Tether (USDT), giving users a safe environment to learn and practice wallet management. By simulating real-world scenarios, beginners can explore crypto management without interacting with actual blockchain networks.

Moreover, WallitIQ (WLTQ) integrates real-time market data via the Coingecko API, giving users constant access to accurate crypto price updates. This well-organized display keeps users informed about market trends, making it easy to track asset performance. On top of all this, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has successfully completed a smart contract audit by SolidProof , a respected auditing firm. With this achievement and WallitIQ's (WLTQ) potential to soon reach $18, a multitude of investors are eager to claim their portion of the SHIB rival's 1 billion token supply, quickly depleting its presale allocation. Conclusion The dream of Shiba Inu hitting $1 has been debunked as unrealistic, while WallitIQ (WLTQ) is establishing itself as a formidable force in the crypto arena. The Dogecoin analyst confidently believes that WallitIQ's (WLTQ) impressive features and immense growth potential make it a more favorable investment than the stagnant Shiba Inu price. This SHIB competitor is changing the game, so seize the opportunity to invest in WallitIQ (WLTQ) before it becomes widely recognized. Act now and purchase WallitIQ (WLTQ) at $0.0420 today.

In this context, two crypto startups received awards and recognition from non-crypto enterprises, crossing the chasm to the real world. Overall, most crypto-related accomplishments for projects and startups are usually limited to the crypto industry and native users. Sometimes, however, these startups cross the chasm, reaching a broader audience and onboarding new users to the crypto ecosystem. One recent example of that was Polymarket , offering a crypto-based prediction market built on Polygon , using USDC , succeeding during the elections. Another recent similar case was with the Avalanche -based game “Off The Grid,” featuring on Epic Games Store’s top free-to-play products. In a macro environment, Donald Trump has declared crypto a matter of national priority, as Bloomberg reported , crossing the chasm. Now, Finbold has discovered two small crypto startups that are also achieving recognition outside of the crypto market this week. These can present a potential growth opportunity in the following months and years if they keep the pace. Hatom (HTM) website won The FWA People’s Choice Award Hatom ( HTM ) a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol developed by the startup Hatom Labs won a non-crypto award this week. The recognition came from The Favourite Website Awards (FWA), winning its People’s Choice Award (PCA) web design competition. “The FWA is an international award platform that honors and rewards web designers, developers and agencies around the world for excellence within the field of web design and development.” – Digitaling decribed This recognition came due to the innovative, interactive, and complex new Hatom’s website designed by Immersive Garden. The agency celebrated the accomplishment on X on January 16, exposing its work with Hatom. This is a big celebration! 🎉 Hatom has been voted Site of the Year 2024!

Hatom, at the same time, offers yield farming possibilities with its lending platform, liquid staking, and HTM booster. The startup is also launching MultiversX first native stablecoin , USH, unlocking more liquidity opportunities in the ecosystem. USH, the first native stablecoin on MultiversX, easily explained.

Yet, the crypto startup leverages the blockchain technology and MultiversX ( EGLD ) capacities to offer benefits and a better experience to its users, showcasing it to its customers. The recent recognition is one step closer to the blockchain technology – and QoWatt solution – crossing the chasm for real-world adoption. Nevertheless, while it is worth keeping an eye on these and other startups achieving non-crypto recognition, it is important to understand that investing in startups is risky and offers a volatile ride forward, with no guarantees of success, despite the growing awareness.

Many believe his pro-crypto policies could lead to a significant price surge for Bitcoin, while debates about adopting a national Bitcoin reserve are gaining momentum. Could this be the beginning of a new financial chapter for the U.S.? Trump’s Administration Sparks Bitcoin Optimism With Trump’s inauguration just around the corner, speculation is growing about how his administration might support cryptocurrencies. Some analysts predict that Bitcoin’s price could rise to $130,000 or even $150,000 if Trump announces crypto-friendly policies. One of the most talked-about ideas is Senator Cynthia Lummis’s BITCOIN Act of 2024 , which proposes the Treasury buy 1 million BTC over the next five years. Supporters believe this move could strengthen the U.S. economy and reduce reliance on traditional monetary systems. Bitcoin Reserve Debate Continues The idea of a national Bitcoin reserve has sparked a mix of hope and concern. Supporters, like Suriname’s presidential candidate Maya Parbhoe, argue that Bitcoin could help countries escape the problems of inflation and reckless fiscal policies. She believes adopting Bitcoin would bring stability and protect citizens’ wealth, comparing its importance to the internet in the 1990s. However, critics warn of potential risks. Nic Carter, a Bitcoin expert, said that while Bitcoin works well for smaller countries like El Salvador, it could destabilize the U.S. financial system. Others, like former New York Fed President Bill Dudley, worry that funding a Bitcoin reserve could increase national debt or cause inflation. Meanwhile, Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, raised a key question calling it a “chicken-and-egg” question. Strategic #Bitcoin reserves debate has become a chicken-and-egg dilemma: Proponents: As the dollar dominance weakens, Bitcoin will become the inevitable alternative—adopt it early. Opponents: Bitcoin threatens dollar dominance—don't disrupt the status quo. pic.twitter.com/ML37q0UPbh — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) December 19, 2024 Should Bitcoin adoption happen because the dollar is losing strength, or will adopting Bitcoin trigger the dollar’s decline? On-Chain Metrics Offer Hope mid the debates, on-chain data is giving Bitcoin fans more reasons to be hopeful.

A mix of the optimistic crypto conditions coupled with whales accumulating half a billion DOGE tokens suggests that its price could extend this rally and tag $1 soon. Dogecoin Climb as Whales Accumulate 550 Million DOGE According to Sanitment data, Dogecoin whales are clearly accumulating and explains why the price may surge to $1 soon. When high net worth investors such as w hales buy, they have the ability to instill confidence and move markets. The chart attached below shows that such investors accumulated over 550 million DOGE between January 1 and today. With Dogecoin price trading around $0.410, these tokens are worth over $245 million. Altogether, whales have bought over 22.49 billion DOGE coins in the past few months. This accumulation is notable because the meme token was in consolidation and is likely to result in a massive move to the upside. Dogecoin Price Whales Dogecoin Price Forecast Using Fibonacci Extension Tool The other chart focuses on the Fibonacci Extension. This tool is added by connecting key swings and identifying key levels. In this case, connecting the highest and lowest levels in November and December shows that the 361% extension lands at $1.0790. That is a sign that the value of DOGE will rally to $1 in the long term. DOGE Price Fibonacci DOGE Reveals A Bullish Pennant Pattern The third chart shows that Dogecoin price is slowly forming a bullish pennant chart pattern on the weekly chart. This pattern’s flag pole started forming in September when it bottomed at $0.0837. It then reached a high of $0.4840 in November. The recent consolidation is part of the formation of the symmetrical triangle pattern. This means that a bullish breakout may happen when the triangle nears its confluence in the next few months. A look back at this chart shows that there is no important resistance from the upper side of the pennant to its ATH. As such, a break above $0.4840 will signal more gains potentially to the all-time high of $0.7447, up by 80% from the current level. This breakout will then lead to a jump to the next psychological point at $1. There is precedence to all this. Bitcoin price jumped to the 2021 high of near $70,000 in 2024, and then moved ahead to get to a new high of $108,000 this year. A key caveat is that this is a weekly chart, meaning that the surge to $1 will likely take time since each bar represents 1 week. Dogecoin Price Chart The bullish Dogecoin price forecast to $1 will become invalid if it drops below the support at $$0.25, the lower side of the pennant.

With this, the price has reached a crucial range, breaking which could reinstate a fresh upswing towards the next ATH. Conversely, a failure could force the BTC price to accumulate below the pivotal range, promoting range-bound consolidation until the next bullish wave. Donald Trump is all set to become the first crypto president and is believed to make crypto stronger than ever, of which afore impact has begun. However, the bull’s seem to have taken a setback as the effort that pushed the price from $75,000 to over $108K is missing during the current upswing. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has now become a $2 trillion asset, which keeps up the bullish hopes for long. Meanwhile, the BTC price has broken from a bearish pattern and a confirmation could attract fresh volumes. Currently, the buying pressure, which was seen in between $99,100 and $99,500, has faded to some extent and hence there could be some chances of a pullback, while $100K will be defended strongly. The BTC price broke above the resistance zone between $98,800 and $99,570 and is heading towards the pivotal range at $103,485. The token has been failing to surpass the levels at $102,436 for over a couple of months and hence a rise above the range has flashed bullish signals. Besides, the price has also broken the resistance of the descending triangle and hence a validation is needed to confirm the flipped trend. As seen in the above chart, the RSI has broken the descending trend line along within the BTC price, and the conversion & base lines of Ichimoku have triggered a bullish crossover immediately after a bearish crossover. However, the drop in volume raises some concerns. The 24-hour trading volume had soared beyond $125 billion, which lifted the token from the consolidated zone around $75,000 to its ATH. Meanwhile, the recent upswing is supported by nearly half of the volume. This suggests the Bitcoin price is rising due to a lack of sellers rather than a rise in the buying volume, which could flip at any moment. Therefore, the traders are required to be vigilant and cautious before entering the trade at the moment.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-17 13:38:46

In addition, a large corporate event such as an acquisition or merger will be settled in stablecoins, the market maker and liquidity provider said in an annual review and outlook . Among its other forecasts: The U.S. will begin consultations to create a strategic bitcoin reserve, with China, the UAE and Europe following suit. A publicly listed company will sell debt or shares to buy ether (ETH), mimicking MicroStrategy's (MSTR) bitcoin acquisition policy. A systemically important bank will offer spot cryptocurrency trading to clients. The predictions follow substantial demand growth last year, which saw over-the-counter (OTC) trading institutional trading volumes more than triple following the approval last January of bitcoin (BTC) ETFs and later arrival of ether (ETH) ETFs. The report attributed the interest to improved regulatory clarity and demand for capital-efficient trading. The average OTC trade size increased 17% and total volume 313%, it said. Derivatives volumes grew by over 300%, driven by institutions searching for more sophisticated yield and risk management instruments. In spot trading, Wintermute noted a record-breaking single-day OTC volume of $2.24 billion, surpassing 2023's weekly record of $2 billion. Shift in Asset Preferences Memecoins were one of the success stories in 2024, seeing their market share more than double to 16%. This was primarily driven in the Solana ecosystem by tokens such as dogwifhat (WIF), bonk (BONK) and ponke (PONKE), though ether continues to dominate. ""We saw record-breaking growth driven by demand for sophisticated products like CFDs and options, reflecting a maturing market that increasingly mirrors traditional finance,"" CEO Evgeny Gaevoy said in the report.

However, over the past few days, the market has gained a significant bullish momentum, rising rapidly toward the $3 level and even breaking it to the upside. While a new all-time high is within reach now, the RSI’s overbought signal should be considered, as it could cause a short-term correction.

The market is now trending higher after a rather lengthy period of consolidation below the 2800 SAT level. As things stand, Ripple is outperforming Bitcoin and could continue to do so.

As the dust settles, major coins limp forward with uninspiring double-digit gains, while meme coins are stealing the show. PNUT’s recent 4,500% surge? FRED’s 6,000% explosion?

Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) is currently trading between $172.64 and $213.70. Over the past week, its price has increased by 6.23%, indicating a short-term upward trend. However, looking at the past month, there's been a slight decline of 3.02%. Despite this, the six-month change shows a substantial growth of 23.80%, highlighting significant long-term potential. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $204.96, which is above the 100-day average of $189.63. This suggests positive momentum in the short term. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 64.23, approaching the overbought threshold of 70. Similarly, the Stochastic indicator is high at 83.52. These indicators imply that SOL might continue to rise, but they also signal that the asset is nearing overbought conditions. If SOL moves upward, the nearest resistance level is at $238.98, which is about a 12% increase from its current upper range. Breaking this could lead to the second resistance at $280.04, representing an increase of over 30%. If the price drops, the nearest support is at $156.86, roughly a 10% decrease from the current lower range. Falling further to the second support at $115.80 would be a decline of approximately 33%. Monitoring these levels could provide insight into SOL's next movements. Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche (AVAX) has seen noteworthy price movements recently. Over the past week, its price increased by 5.90%, indicating short-term bullish momentum. However, looking at the past month, AVAX experienced a decline of 19.06%, showing some volatility in the market. Over the last six months, the coin has grown by 40.54%, reflecting substantial long-term growth. The current price ranges between $33.06 and $42.55, hovering around key moving averages. The 10-day simple moving average is at $39.24, while the 100-day SMA stands at $36.70. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approximately 58, suggesting that AVAX is neither overbought nor oversold. The stochastic oscillator is around 75, which supports the RSI's neutral stance. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is at $48.55. Breaking above this point could signal a potential rise toward the second resistance at $58.05. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $29.56, with a further support at $20.07 if the price falls below that. Traders might watch these levels closely, as moving past them could result in significant price changes. Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot (DOT) has experienced significant price changes recently. In the past week, its price increased by 6.52%, indicating a positive short-term trend. However, over the past month, the price dropped by 17.83%, reflecting some volatility in the market. Looking at the last six months, the price has risen by 13.41%, suggesting potential for long-term growth. Currently, DOT is trading between $6.05 and $7.59. The nearest resistance level is at $8.56. If the price breaks above this point, it could aim for the second resistance at $10. On the downside, the nearest support level is $5.48. A fall below this could see the price testing the second support at $3.94. Technical indicators offer more insights. The 10-day simple moving average is $7.05, slightly above the 100-day average of $6.64. This suggests a recent upward momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 61.48, which is above neutral but below the overbought threshold, indicating room for growth. The Stochastic indicator is at 71.21, and the MACD level is positive at 0.0794. These indicators point toward potential upward movement, but traders should remain cautious of possible volatility. Toncoin (TON) Toncoin (TON) traded between $5.00 and $5.71 this week, rising by 4.56%. Despite this weekly gain, the price fell by 8.42% over the past month and dropped 23.99% over six months, indicating a downward trend in the longer term. The nearest resistance levels are at $6.11 and $6.82. Moving above these points could signal upward momentum. Support levels stand at $4.69 and $3.98; dipping below these might lead to further declines. The Relative Strength Index is at 59.37, approaching the overbought threshold, and the Stochastic indicator is high at 81.89, both suggesting possible price corrections ahead. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are $5.53 and $5.34, showing TON is close to its average prices. The MACD Level is 0.0369, hinting at mild bullish momentum. Given the recent weekly increase but overall declines, TON's price movement remains uncertain. Watching the resistance and support levels could provide insights into future price directions. Conclusion SOL, AVAX, DOT, and TON are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ), targeting 20,000% growth and merging meme culture with sports, offers a unique, community-driven opportunity in the current bull run.

Interestingly, crypto gurus are drawing parallels between this emerging token and XRP during its early days. Approaching Dogecoin performance, Remittix seems to follow a similar path, with its early presale success recording over 20% price surge. Analysts believe Remittix is a 100x rising star that will begin its price rally in 2025, following its listing in big exchanges. Here's why! Remittix: The new crypto with meme appeal and real utility poised for 100x While Dogecoin gained fame largely due to its meme status and celebrity endorsements, Remittix, on the other hand, has a completely different playbook. Instead of banking on memes and conjecture, it is positioning itself within the $150 trillion global cross-border transaction space. Remittix offers payment solutions that allow crypto owners to send fiat to any bank in the world right from their crypto wallets. Remittix leverages local payment networks, connecting them with numerous blockchains to make it a reality. This groundbreaking utility could see Remittix compete with massive corporations like Stripe, MoneyGram, and Coinbase. In contrast to these services, Remittix is seamless, and recipients never need to know crypto is involved. International businesses, for example, can set up accounts and use the platform’s Pay API to accept crypto payments, instantly converting them into fiat. The immutable nature of transactions helps eliminate risks, ensuring smooth operations. This makes it appealing for companies and individuals seeking a safe and fast cross-border payment option. Remittix ranks highly across investor portfolios and has raised over $1 million in its ongoing presale campaign. This has made analysts bullish on RTX tokens and anticipate a 100x price surge in 2025. Dogecoin price predictions: DOGE to continue bullish resurgence In November 2024, DOGE’s price increased by 160%, but it faced resistance near $0.48 and has since retracted to current levels at $0.36. Entering 2025, the recent resurgence in the Dogecoin price follows the DOGE mention at the Donald Trump rally in New York. Elon Musk appeared at the event and was introduced as the Co-founder of the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E). The DOGE mention came as the announcer said the D.O.G.E acronym, which also sounded like an allusion to the meme coin. Despite this mistaken identity, the Dogecoin price seems set on claiming this price momentum as the technical indicators point to a price continuation to a breakout above the resistance level it made in November. Clearly, the Dogecoin price forecast is not straightforward. However, the technical analysis suggests that DOGE could approach $1 by 2025, contingent on broader market trends and increased adoption. Despite its popularity, Dogecoin’s limited utility and inflationary supply model may constrain its capacity to achieve higher valuations without significant technological advancements or widespread commercial adoption. Conclusion While Dogecoin remains a fan favorite, Remittix, the new crypto rival, is carving out a unique position by combining meme coin appeal with real-world utility. Remittix's focus on fast, low-cost transactions, community-driven growth, and long-term scalability gives crypto gurus early XRP vibes, making it one of the most promising tokens to watch in 2025. RTX tokens are available via its crypto presale at $0.0207.

39096699,https://bitzo.com/2025/01/why-this-new-dogecoin-doge-competitor-is-reminding-crypto-experts-of-xrps-early-days,1737121386,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/39096699.jpeg,Why This New Dogecoin (DOGE) Competitor is Reminding Crypto Experts of XRP's Early Days,https://bitzo.com/2025/01/why-this-new-dogecoin-doge-competitor-is-reminding-crypto-experts-of-xrps-early-days,"Even as Dogecoin astonishes market players with a 50% price jump, a fresh crypto contender has emerged, causing a buzz and sparking speculation. Curiously, crypto experts are seeing similarities between this new token and XRP when it first started. Following in Dogecoin's footsteps, Remittix is charting a comparable course, achieving a more than 20% price increase during its initial presale. Experts predict Remittix could be a 100x breakout star, with its price rally commencing in 2025 after major exchange listings. Here's the reasoning! Remittix: A New Crypto Combining Memes with Practical Use, Aiming for 100x Growth Unlike Dogecoin, which rose to fame mostly thanks to its meme status and support from celebrities, Remittix is taking a distinct approach. It is strategically entering the $150 trillion global cross-border transaction market rather than relying on memes and hype. Remittix provides payment solutions that enable crypto owners to send fiat currency to any bank worldwide directly from their crypto wallets. It connects local payment networks with multiple blockchains to make this possible. This innovative utility positions Remittix as a potential competitor to giants like Stripe, MoneyGram, and Coinbase. Unlike these platforms, Remittix operates seamlessly, ensuring recipients remain unaware that cryptocurrency is involved. For instance, international businesses can create accounts and utilize the platform's Pay API to accept crypto payments, converting them instantly into fiat. The immutable nature of transactions reduces risks, facilitating efficient operations. This makes it a desirable choice for both companies and individuals looking for a secure and rapid cross-border payment solution. Remittix is gaining traction in investor portfolios, having raised over $1 million in its ongoing presale. This success has led analysts to be optimistic about RTX tokens, forecasting a 100x price increase by 2025. Dogecoin Price Outlook: Is DOGE Set for Continued Growth? In November 2024, DOGE experienced a 160% price surge, though it hit resistance around $0.48 and has since receded to approximately $0.36. As 2025 approaches, the recent uptick in Dogecoin's price follows its mention at a Donald Trump rally in New York. Elon Musk attended the event, introduced as the Co-founder of the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E). The acronym D.O.G.E was mentioned, subtly alluding to the meme coin. Despite this mix-up, Dogecoin's price appears ready to leverage this momentum, with technical indicators suggesting a potential breakout above the resistance level set in November. The Dogecoin price prediction remains complex. Nevertheless, technical analysis indicates DOGE could reach $1 by 2025, dependent on broader market trends and increased adoption. Despite its popularity, Dogecoin's limited practical applications and inflationary supply may limit its ability to achieve higher valuations without significant technological improvements or widespread commercial uptake. Final Thoughts While Dogecoin continues to hold a special place among fans, Remittix is carving out its own niche by blending meme appeal with tangible utility. Its emphasis on quick, cost-effective transactions, community-driven growth, and long-term scalability is evoking early XRP sentiments among crypto experts, positioning it as a promising token to watch in 2025. RTX tokens are available in its crypto presale at $0.0207.

The flagship cryptocurrency has gained over 3% in the past 24 hours and almost 8% over the past week. Bulls will set their sights on BTC’s all-time high of $108,268 if the price continues to push higher during the ongoing session. Crypto Market Registers Sharp Jump Bitcoin (BTC) crossed $102,000 today as it continues its upward trajectory, buoyed by declining US core inflation and expectations of further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Markets are also anticipating the launch of new spot ETFs and positive developments in the SEC’s case against Ripple. Additionally, Donald Trump’s impending inauguration has also boosted market sentiment. BTC’s market dominance has also registered a substantial jump, while the crypto market cap is up nearly 4% and currently sits at $3.61 trillion. If BTC continues its upward trajectory, it could extend its rally and retest its all-time high of $108,268, opening the doors for a potential move past $110,000. Coinbase To Offer Bitcoin-Backed Loans Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has introduced Bitcoin-backed loans, allowing users to borrow USDC without selling their Bitcoin holdings. The loan feature will be available in all US states except New York. The loans will be facilitated by Morpho, a permissionless, non-custodial lending protocol on Ethereum and Base. The lending product is not new, given users on Base could borrow USDC on Morpho or other decentralized finance (DeFi) services. What’s new is the easy access to Bitcoin-backed loans. Coinbase explained how the loan feature works in a statement, “In under a minute, you can get a loan in USDC without ever having to sell your bitcoin. You can earn over 4% in USDC rewards, send USDC globally for free, and use it onchain. You can also convert USDC to USD 1:1 for free to cover major expenses like buying a car or making a downpayment on your mortgage.” Coinbase also plans to add more assets in the future and will also expand the product’s geographical availability. “We are starting with Bitcoin as collateral, with plans to add more assets in the future. Crypto-backed loans are available to customers starting in the U.S., excluding New York State, with plans to expand to more markets.” How Do The Loans Work? The loans and borrowing process are optimized for speed and simplicity. Users can put their BTC as collateral. The BTC will be converted to Coinbase Wrapped Bitcoin (cbBTC) and transferred onchain to Morpho. The service will allow clients to borrow up to $100,000 in USDC based on their BTC holdings, with the borrowed funds transferred instantly. Loan repayments will also be flexible with no fixed repayment schedule. Liquidation will only occur if the value of the collateral drops below a specified threshold relative to the loan amount. Users will be able to monitor the loan status through the Coinbase app. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) started the year on a high as bullish momentum carried it past the 20 and 50-day SMAs during the first week of January. BTC reached its first peak of 2025 when it crossed $100,000 on January 6 and settled at $102,228. However, momentum waned the following day as selling pressure drove the price down over 5% as BTC slipped below the 50-day SMA. By Thursday the price had gone below the 20-day SMA and dropped to a low of $91,298 before settling at $92,710. Despite the overwhelming bearish sentiment, BTC recovered on Friday, recording an increase of 2.27% and moving to $94,818. However, it fell on Saturday thanks to the 20-day SMA acting as resistance, registering a marginal drop to settle at $94,542. It ended the week with a marginal increase on Sunday, ending the weekend at 94,585. Source: TradingView BTC began the current week facing unprecedented selling pressure as it plummeted below $90,000 to an intraday low of $89,397. However, buyers bought the dip, allowing BTC to reclaim $90,000 and settle at $94,492, ultimately registering only a marginal decline. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 2.19% to move past the 20-day SMA and settle at $96,566. Bullish sentiment intensified Wednesday as BTC surged past the 50-day SMA, crossing $100,000 and settling at $100,050. BTC lost momentum on Thursday as it fell to an intraday low of $97,086 before recovering to settle at $99,799. The current session sees BTC up over 2%, with the price having crossed $102,000 and trading around $102,570. BTC’s RSI currently sits at 62, above the neutral zone, and is pointing upwards, indicating growing bullish momentum. Additionally, the MACD has also flipped to bullish.

Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart On the daily chart, the asset has been struggling to rise above the $100K level over the past few weeks. However, the market is now testing the six-digit territory and is trying to stay above it and rally toward a new all-time high. If the cryptocurrency closes above this level, it is very likely to trend higher in the coming months and potentially reach the $120K mark. The 4-Hour Chart Looking at the 4-hour chart, the market has been consolidating inside a large falling wedge pattern, testing the higher and lower boundaries on multiple occasions. Yet, the asset has finally broken the higher trendline to the upside. Based on classical price action, the cryptocurrency is now expected to move toward the $108K all-time high. Meanwhile, it should also be noted that the RSI is entering an overbought region, which could result in a short-term pullback before further continuation. Sentiment Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Bitcoin Exchange Reserve While Bitcoin’s price is once again breaking above the $100K level, understanding the supply and demand dynamics could provide valuable information. This chart presents the BTC exchange reserve, which measures the amount of Bitcoin held in exchange wallets. As the chart demonstrates, the BTC exchange reserve metric has been dropping aggressively. As this vital metric is a proxy for supply, this decrease in selling pressure can lead to even higher prices in the coming weeks.

Likely restricted to a rally in an ultra-bullish scenario and moderate growth in a realistic scenario, new traders entering the market have to diversify their portfolios with low market cap gems to achieve significant returns in the bull run. Even Toncoin itself is considered a large cap, though many gurus urge investors to look into Toncoin’s relatively untapped ecosystem of decentralized applications. Memes like “Resistance Dog” are far too speculative, as speculators predict that utility gems will steal the spotlight as the bull run progresses, including Elluminex, an all-encompassing DeFi platform that’s yet to officially launch. Read on to learn more about Elluminex. Dubbed The “Solana Killer”: Will Sui Deliver? Sui has experienced remarkable growth in 2024, cementing its position as one of the premier performers in the crypto market at the moment. After an impressive 76% rise in November, Sui reached a new all-time high of $4.91 in December, marking a 38% monthly return. This bullish momentum highlights increasing market confidence in Sui’s potential, with speculators dubbing Sui as the next “Solana killer” that could exceed SOL’s outstanding performance from 2021 in the previous bull run. As a blockchain devised from the remnants of Meta’s very own ambitious “Libra” project, the VC-backed Sui has quickly gained popularity due to its high-performance capabilities and robust potential as a layer-1. In addition, recent integrations with platforms like Backpack and PhantomWallet have amplified Sui’s appeal, simplifying access to its blockchain for a broader audience. With its strong background, expanding ecosystem, and increasing user activity, Sui continues to solidify itself as a key player in the crypto market, making it a standout option for both developers and market participants. Reliance Meets Innovation With Avalanche Avalanche continues to stand out as a top-tier layer-1 blockchain, leveraging its success from the previous bull market and its focus on GameFi. Titles like Off The Grid have drawn attention to the platform, while the GameChain initiative promises to onboard 50 new games by 2025, solidifying Avalanche’s role as a pioneer in blockchain gaming. These developments affirm Avalanche’s capabilities for sustained growth, even as rivals such as Solana, Sui, and Kaspa continue to garner immense popularity. While many cryptocurrencies are bound to go under, Avalanche’s ecosystem remains robust, supported by consistent transaction volumes and strong community engagement. While sporadic Avalanche sell-offs may deter some investors, Avalanche’s focus on gaming innovation and its historical strength during market upswings position Avalanche as a strong contender for Q1-Q2 2025, albeit limited to moderate gains at most. Discover Elluminex: The Low Cap Utility Gem That Could Make You Financially Free This Bull Run Elluminex is set to redefine the decentralized finance landscape as the premier all-in-one DeFi platform on Toncoin’s blockchain. Leveraging Toncoin’s growing popularity, Elluminex will integrate trading, staking, farming, bridging, and asset management into one seamless ecosystem, meaning Toncoin advocates don’t have to flip-flop between platforms for different benefits. At the core of Elluminex’s innovation is its planned decentralized exchange, which will deliver low slippage, high liquidity, and advanced trading features. In combination with a cross-chain bridge, the platform will enable users to transfer assets across blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Sui effortlessly. These features, combined with an upcoming AI-powered portfolio tracker, will empower users with crucial real-time analytics to make informed trading decisions. Elluminex will also introduce staking and farming mechanisms, allowing users to earn passive income through rewards while contributing to the platform’s liquidity. This design, inspired by other successful blockchain products, will help foster a loyal community and stabilize the ecosystem by reducing sell-offs. Uniquely positioned on the fast-growing TON blockchain, Elluminex is bound to take full advantage of Toncoin’s scalability and secure smart contracts. The inclusion of an educational academy further distinguishes Elluminex, as it empowers users with DeFi literacy, enabling them to navigate the ecosystem confidently and securely in time for the bull run For more information about Elluminex (ELX) visit the links below: Website: https://elluminex.com/ Twitter/X: https://x.com/elluminex Telegram: https://t.me/Elluminex Disclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

In an official statement, the platform revealed the recovery updates, freezing the initial portion of stolen assets. WazirX’s recent move highlights the exchange’s progress in recovering funds lost in one of India’s largest cryptocurrency thefts. Zettai, the parent company of WazirX, disclosed its ties with law enforcement, forensic experts, investigative authorities, and legal specialists to track and recover the stolen funds. WazirX Hack: Recovery Efforts Underway While the crypto exchange is successfully navigating the recovery and restructuring procedures in the WazirX hack, founder Nischal Shetty addressed it as “just the beginning.” Adding that the company is fully committed to retrieving the lost cryptocurrencies, he appreciated the users’ support throughout the challenging situation. Further, Jason Kardachi, Managing Director and Co-Head of Global Restructuring Practice, Kroll, commented on WazirX hack’s recovery scheme, stating, Efforts to recover Stolen Assets are fully underway and moving in the right direction – between on-chain forensic work and legal avenues against third parties complicit in the Hack and subsequent dissipation, the company is well prepared to maximise the recovery of Stolen Assets for the benefit of Scheme Creditors under a Scheme. Clients Express Dismay Despite Exchange’s Efforts WazirX and Zettai have been reportedly working tirelessly to bring a resolution to the crypto hack, which affected 15 million investors. Though the platform repeatedly assured its customers about its efforts to restore the funds, the community raised concerns about the hack. In November, WazirX unleashed its Recovery Token scheme intended to settle the affected customers debts. According to the announcement, the exchange intended to airdrop tokens in proportion to creditors on their platform balance. US, Japan, and South Korea Links North Korea to Crypto Heist The exchange’s asset recovery updates came on the heels of the US, Japan, and South Korea linking the hack to North Korea.

The New York Times reported that when Ripple executives met with Trump on January 8, they “advised” him to add XRP alongside Bitcoin in the proposed federal crypto reserve. Did Trump say anything close to yes? Absolutely not. Chatter made rounds around the crypto community today, saying that Trump was “receptive” to Garlinghouse’s suggestions. Several sources, including Ripple Labs attorney Stuart Alderoty and pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton, have dismissed every bit of the speculative comments. So, where did the rumors come from? Well, your guess is as good as ours. Wow, unnamed sources? Here’s a named source: me. The rumors published by this 3rd-tier crypto rag are pure fiction. Completely made up. Wonder who’s behind this? 🤔 — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) January 16, 2025 On the backdrop of the falsified news, XRP, the crypto tied to Ripple, skyrocketed to a seven-year high of $3.40. XRP naysayers are livid that the token is experiencing an upward trend because of Ripple’s association with the White House. And while this maybe true, isn’t the rest of the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin, trading on positives too? It’s harsh to pin XRP’s recent price charge all on Trump. Did Trump and Ripple sign a deal at Mar-a-Lago? Earlier this month, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, attorney Alderoty and Trump had a private dinner at the incoming POTUS’s Mar-a-Lago estate. The New York Times revealed on Thursday that in the meeting, Garlinghouse proposed a creation of a U.S. federal crypto reserve that would include XRP alongside Bitcoin. Ripple did not publicly confirm the news, but Susan Hendrick, Ripple’s senior director of communications, admitted that Garlinghouse had indeed pitched the idea. Unnamed sources slightly twisted Hendrick’s statements, claiming that Trump was “receptive” to the idea; The New York Times did not corroborate Trump’s receptiveness. The unverified sources now claim that it’s Ripple themselves who started the rumors. Since the year started, Brad Garlinghouse has been making a series of cryptic social media posts targeted towards the White House. In one post on X, he hailed 2025 as the beginning of a “Trump bull market” and talked about Ripple’s renewed focus on the US market. But here’s the addendum. 2025 is here and the Trump bull market is real. For Ripple, this is even more personal after Gensler's SEC effectively froze our business opportunities here at home for years. The optimism is obvious and very deserved. Today: ✅75% of Ripple’s open roles are now US-based, while… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 5, 2025 Garlinghouse pointed out that Ripple had shifted 75% of its hiring to the United States and secured more domestic deals in the last six weeks of 2024 than in the previous six months. It does sound like he’s seeking some sort of a “thumbs up.” from the incoming administration. And we haven’t even gotten to Ripple’s donations to Trump’s Inauguration yet. Unverified sources cited by Axios claim donors are giving money to the 47th President, hoping to get something in return. Trump, as we have known for aeons, has an unpredictable nature, so these efforts are all a huge gamble. Again, for a company that has battled regulatory uncertainty under the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for years, the timing of these announcements, are anything but coincidental. But one thing is almost certain; SEC isn’t winning the case against Ripple after January 20. Ripple will thrive, but not entirely because of Trump Netizens see Ripple’s rumored overtures to Trump as vying for favor with the president-elect. But we all know Trump can’t be bought; he would rather pursue his own agenda than anyone else’s, even with money at the table. That said, the company is in the midst of an ongoing battle with financial regulator SEC, led by outgoing chairman Gary Gensler. If a favorable ruling towards the new stablecoin issuer, or even the dismissal of the lawsuit under a new SEC leadership, takes place, XRP will turn “good” in the eyes of investors. Gensler, very much on brand – completely dismissive of the 2024 election and the American public – fully commits to his failed ‘regulation-by-enforcement agenda to the bitter, bitter end. #Sad https://t.co/1FEzB8d13o — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 14, 2025 Pro-XRP lawyer Deaton, through a post on X, noted how XRP’s resurgence has reignited old rivalries and narratives. XRP is outperforming major Bitcoin and Ethereum in the US, which Deaton believes some members of the community hate, what he termed as “crypto tribalism.” “ My God, if XRP gets close to flipping ETH, some people might just lose their minds on CT and YouTube, ” he reiterated. This rivalry isn’t unique to XRP, Deaton explained. “ As BTC goes higher, you will witness people opposed to BTC become angry and jealous and spread FUD…Tribalism is real. ” Let me get this straight: Someone, not present at the meeting, admitted to someone else that he/she was speculating at what COULD’VE POSSIBLY been said at the dinner between @realDonaldTrump @bgarlinghouse & @s_alderoty . 🤔 This is why we have rules of evidence in Court. In… https://t.co/sEGvJ5H3Ql — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) January 17, 2025 The US veteran, however, appreciated the community for backing his efforts of suing the SEC after seeing he wasn’t just fighting for Ripple, it was for the whole crypto industry, “ When people realized my efforts were really about fighting the SEC’s gross overreach—and that I wasn’t a paid plant for Ripple—things did change ,” Deaton remarked. “ People in the industry have been great to me. “ From where we stand, the future of XRP, Trump and Ripple is not entirely clear, but certain individuals are willing to take the company down and alongside it, President-elect Trump’s plans. However, we all know how hard it is to keep the latter down, so maybe, just maybe, Ripple also has its best fighting chance too.

Musk Saves California (MUSKCALI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKCALI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Saves California can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Saves California could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Saves California launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Saves California on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Saves California by entering its contract address – 2mtzeaYqDPLtCemX5jNPuuq8jw65cbgNUXuT3fBra2M2 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

The CPI data shows cooling inflation, pushing the prices of top altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) upward. Interest in DTX Exchange (DTX) , a new DeFi crypto, also skyrocketed. Behind the rising demand are its unique hybrid trading platform—a blend of CEX and DEX—and its potential transformation of the $10 billion global trading scene. Its impending adoption has sparked bullish forecasts, hailed by experts as the next 100x token. DTX Exchange (DTX): The Next 100X Coin? DTX Exchange (DTX) , a new altcoin at the intersection of DeFi and TradFi, basks in the spotlight. Its unique narrative—a hybrid trading platform—and combination of the best elements of centralized and decentralized exchanges drive huge interest and demand. Through its unified blockchain, VulcanX, DTX aims to bridge the gap between TradFi and DeFi. It will be the first crypto-native platform to offer conventional financial instruments like stocks, forex, ETFs and commodities. Some of its key features will include wallet-based trading, non-custodial storage solutions and distributed liquidity pools—a new DeFi project to watch out for. Given imminent adoption, it has been selling out fast in presale, crossing $11.8 million in raised funds in record time. Meanwhile, a token costs just $0.14 in the seventh round of the ICO and is tipped for a 100x upswing after Tier-1 exchange listings. With plenty of room to run as a low-cap with solid fundamentals, it is arguably the best new crypto to invest in, edging out top crypto coins like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH). Solana (SOL): Breakout Above the $200 Resistance The Layer-1 crypto Solana (SOL) has been one of this week’s top gainers. Since falling below $180 on Monday, the bulls have been on a roll. As of press time, the Solana price trades above $205, flipping a key resistance to support. Meanwhile, further gains are anticipated, supported by key indicators like the 10-EMA and 10-SMA. At the same time, experts are optimistic about a good run in Q1. undeadcat1or0, a crypto analyst on X, believes there is plenty of time for Solana (SOL) to hit $420 and $690 before the next token unlock in March. Wifichecks, another expert, sees the altcoin reaching $300 to $320 between the first and second week of February. While it is a good crypto to buy, its large market cap leaves little room for growth, making new altcoins like DTX Exchange (DTX) more appealing. Ethereum (ETH): Is $4,000 Close? Ethereum (ETH) reacted positively to the latest CPI data, soaring alongside the overall crypto market. An inch away from $3,500, a breakout is expected any moment. Flipping this level will undoubtedly boost investors’ confidence, crossing the $4,000 resistance in no time. Following its latest performance, Trader_Matt, a top analyst, sees a rally above $4,100 and its all-time high—$4,800—as a high probability. Tradermayne, also optimistic, expects Ethereum (ETH) to trade above $4,000 in Q1, positioning it among the top cryptos to buy. Meanwhile, these forecasts are supported by key indicators like the 20-VWMA and 9-HMA. However, as the second-largest cryptocurrency, ETH’s upside potential is limited, shifting interest to low-caps like DTX with plenty of room for growth. DTX Exchange (DTX): A More Compelling Crypto Pick Than Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) Given its low market size, DTX Exchange (DTX) has more room to run than Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH). Besides, it boasts solid fundamentals, poised to reshape the global trading scene via a hybrid model. As the bull market unfolds, it is one of the new altcoins to watch out for.

Its rise in popularity can be attributed to its unique hybrid trading platform—a fusion of CEX and DEX—and its potential to revolutionize the $10 billion global trading market. Experts are touting it as the next token with the potential for 100x growth. Is DTX Exchange (DTX) the Next Big 100X Opportunity? DTX Exchange (DTX) is a new altcoin making waves at the crossroads of DeFi and TradFi. Its appeal stems from its unique selling point—a hybrid trading structure that combines key elements of centralized and decentralized exchanges. With its VulcanX blockchain, DTX aims to close the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance. It plans to be the first crypto-native platform to offer traditional assets like stocks, forex, ETFs, and commodities. Some of its standout features include wallet-based trading, non-custodial storage, and distributed liquidity pools—making it a new DeFi project to monitor. As the platform gears up for mainstream acceptance, its presale is moving quickly, having raised over $11.8 million in no time. Currently, tokens are priced at $0.14 in the seventh stage of the ICO, and it's anticipated to see a 100x increase after Tier-1 exchange listings.

Currently, Solana's price is trading above $205, turning a significant resistance into support. Further gains are anticipated, backed by key indicators such as the 10-EMA and 10-SMA. Analysts are optimistic about its performance in the first quarter. undeadcat1or0, a renowned crypto analyst, predicts Solana (SOL) could reach $420 and $690 before the next token unlock in March. Wifichecks, another expert, forecasts the altcoin to hit $300 to $320 between the first and second week of February. While it's considered a solid buy, its large market cap limits its growth potential, making new altcoins like DTX Exchange (DTX) more intriguing. Ethereum (ETH): Approaching the $4,000 Milestone? Ethereum (ETH) has responded well to the latest CPI figures, climbing alongside the broader crypto market. It's nearing $3,500, with a breakout expected soon. Surpassing this level could enhance investor confidence and help break past the $4,000 resistance swiftly. Based on its recent performance, Trader_Matt, a leading analyst, anticipates a surge above $4,100, potentially reaching its all-time high of $4,800. Tradermayne also shares this optimism, expecting Ethereum (ETH) to surpass $4,000 in the first quarter, making it one of the top cryptos to consider. These projections are supported by indicators like the 20-VWMA and 9-HMA. However, as the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum's growth potential is somewhat constrained, directing attention to lower-cap options like DTX, which offer more room for expansion. DTX Exchange (DTX): A More Attractive Option Than Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) With its smaller market size, DTX Exchange (DTX) presents more growth potential compared to Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH).

39096899,https://finbold.com/?p=229339,1737121859,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Here’s how much JD Vance’s Bitcoin investment is up since Trump won,https://finbold.com/heres-how-much-jd-vances-bitcoin-investment-is-up-since-trump-won/,"So far, Donald Trump’s re-election has been a major win for the digital assets industry and for cryptocurrency investors, with the January 20 inauguration poised to further the positive trend. Amidst the strong – if sometimes choppy rally – more than just uninvolved bystanders benefited significantly. Indeed, the incoming Vice President, J.D. Vance , is known as something of a Bitcoin ( BTC ) hodler . As Finbold previously reported in July, 2024, Vance might have held up to $250,000 worth of BTC at the time and early November estimates place the stake as high as $500,000 but no lower than $250,000. Shortly ahead of election day, on November 1, Bitcoin was changing hands at about $69,500, which, assuming the upper bound of the estimate is closer to the truth, the Vice President-Elect owned approximately 7 BTC. Here’s how much J.D. Vance made with his Bitcoin investment since November Donald Trump’s re-election led to a substantial rally for the world’s premier cryptocurrency and took its price to highs above $106,000 by December 17. Such a situation meant that Vance’s Bitcoin holding reached an all-time high value of approximately $742,000 on the day. This means that America’s new second man made about $250,000 in a month and a half – a Vice President’s annual salary. Furthermore, despite the New Year Bitcoin price drop and subsequent market struggles, the latest rally to $102,736 – driven by reports that Trump intends to make cryptocurrency a national priority as soon as he assumes office – means that Vance’s BTC holdings are still worth approximately $720,000 – 44% more than on November 1.

Source: Finbold Trump’s digital assets soar as inauguration day approaches Finally, despite not owning Bitcoin itself – and despite most of his crypto probably coming from teams seeking exposure by interacting with the President-Elect – Donald Trump himself benefited significantly from the digital assets rally. Still, the most interesting facet of his portfolio – and the one that did the most to raise its value from $11 million on January 10 to $17 million on January 17 – is its largest holding, the meme coin Trog (TROG), which enjoyed a 112% rally in the last 7 days.

Table of Contents Change is coming Regulatory shifts – a catalyst for crypto M&A Consolidation – crypto’s evolution under new conditions What do experts think? The road ahead Change is coming The global economy is preparing for a year of intensified dealmaking, with mergers and acquisitions (M&A) expected to surpass $4 trillion in 2025 — the highest level in four years. The projection comes against a backdrop of economic stability and anticipated regulatory shifts, driven by President-elect Donald Trump’s promises of a pro-business agenda, promising deregulation, lower corporate taxes, and eased antitrust enforcement. Antitrust enforcement, in particular, is expected to benefit sectors like technology, finance, and retail, which have historically driven M&A volumes. However, the often-overlooked crypto industry could also find itself at the centre of this activity. The crypto sector, valued at over $3.6 trillion as of Jan. 17, has historically seen minimal consolidation compared to traditional industries, largely due to regulatory uncertainty. Hence, it is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these broader economic tailwinds. Let’s understand how. Regulatory shifts – a catalyst for crypto M&A In M&A, regulation is often the deciding factor between stagnation and growth. Under the Biden administration, crypto companies faced a challenging environment marked by heightened scrutiny and restrictive policies. The SEC, led by Gary Gensler, pursued aggressive enforcement, leaving many firms cautious about expansion or acquisitions. However, with President-elect Trump’s promise of deregulation and a leadership overhaul at the SEC, the crypto sector could witness its first major wave of dealmaking. The potential impact of regulatory changes can be understood by examining recent trends in traditional markets. In 2024, leveraged buyouts surged by 35%, reaching $600.8 billion, as private equity firms capitalized on improved financing conditions and reduced oversight. These deals often target undervalued companies, providing a framework for how similar activity could unfold in crypto. For instance, smaller crypto exchanges or blockchain infrastructure firms struggling under regulatory pressures could now become attractive targets for acquisition. Moreover, the global rise in M&A volumes — up 15% year-on-year to $3.45 trillion in 2024. The U.S., which accounted for $1.55 trillion of this activity, saw a notable increase in deal sizes, with 37 transactions exceeding $10 billion. In the crypto context, this could translate into major crypto players pursuing acquisitions to consolidate market share, diversify offerings, or enter new regions. The implications extend beyond acquisitions. Regulatory clarity also sets the stage for long-awaited crypto IPOs. The IPO market underperformed in 2024, with $110.6 billion raised globally, but a shift in SEC policies could reverse this trend. Companies like Ripple ( XRP ), Kraken, and Circle, the company behind USDC ( USDC ), which have long sought public listings, might finally find a path forward. Consolidation – crypto’s evolution under new conditions Consolidation marks a key transition for industries moving from fragmented competition to structured maturity. In 2025, the crypto industry could enter this phase. Hunter Horsley, CEO at Bitwise Asset Management, in a recent tweet, noted, “The big may get bigger, and the middle may shrink,” referring to the ability of dominant players to leverage their market power in a deregulated environment. Trump administration may unfreeze M&A. Large corporates — mag 7, etc — may finally be able to wield their market cap. Amazon could buy Instacart. Google could buy Uber. etc etc The big may get bigger, and the middle may shrink. If that happens, I think it will accelerate… — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) January 5, 2025 If companies like Amazon or Google can easily pursue acquisitions such as Instacart or Uber, it will induce a broader trend where the largest players consolidate resources while mid-sized firms struggle to keep pace. For crypto, the implications are twofold. On the one hand, the conceptual appeal of decentralization — the foundation of crypto — could gain greater relevance. As large corporations grow more centralized, consumers may gravitate toward decentralized finance platforms as an alternative to systems they perceive as overly controlled. On the other hand, the sector could experience its own wave of consolidation. Crypto giants might target smaller, regionally focused competitors to increase their global footprint, enhance liquidity, or acquire cutting-edge technology. To understand this, we can look at patterns in traditional markets. In the early 2000s, search engines, once numerous, coalesced as Google emerged as the dominant player, acquiring smaller competitors to refine its offerings and consolidate market share. Similarly, in crypto, larger players like Binance or Coinbase might leverage acquisitions to strengthen their dominance, streamline services, and expand into underserved regions. Much like the broader fintech trend, where companies such as Stripe acquired smaller firms like Bridge for $1.1 billion to enhance their infrastructure. Major crypto stablecoin issuers might pursue similar moves to secure better scalability and compliance solutions. Stablecoins have become a key component of the crypto economy, with lifetime transactions exceeding $233 trillion as of Jan. 17. However, when excluding “inorganic” activity, such as transactions by bots and automated systems, the total volume is over $17 trillion. As a result, major stablecoin issuers like Tether ( USDT ) or Circle may seek to acquire smaller providers to boost their dominance in cross-border payments or tap into specific geographic markets where adoption is growing. The potential for consolidation in crypto is vast, but its implications go beyond market efficiency or competitive advantage – where the industry begins to align with broader economic trends while retaining its unique focus on decentralization. What do experts think? To understand the potential impact of M&A activity on the crypto industry under the Trump administration, crypto.news spoke with Lucas Zhang, a private equity investor and CEO of EPAL. Loosening regulatory constraints Zhang began by addressing how the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice might adapt their approach to reviewing crypto mergers. “With a pro-business administration, we’re likely to see a more lenient stance on mergers, particularly in innovative industries like crypto.” This leniency, he noted, would likely hinge on how deals contribute to broader goals such as job creation, global competitiveness, and blockchain’s role in securing financial systems. Zhang also talked about cross-border payments as a key area that might influence how regulators evaluate the strategic value of crypto-related mergers. “Blockchain’s decentralized nature reduces fraud and streamlines international transactions—traits that align with modern economic priorities.” The risk of monopoly A more relaxed regulatory environment also raises concerns about monopolistic behaviour in crypto, particularly in concentrated sectors like exchanges, stablecoins, and custodial services. Zhang pointed to giants’ dominance in key regions as a cautionary example. “In the APAC region, Binance has faced scrutiny for dominating the exchange market, which raises concerns about its control over global liquidity and its potential to stifle smaller competitors. In the EU, the growth of stablecoins like Tether has led to questions about the systemic risk they could pose, particularly as their dominance in the market could reduce diversity in the financial ecosystem.” To address this, Zhang proposed a balanced approach, inspired by Japan’s regulatory framework, as a model for U.S. regulators. Zhang noted. “A country like Japan offers a good example of how regulators can strike this balance. Japan has developed a relatively balanced regulatory framework for cryptocurrency, promoting innovation through clear, supportive laws while ensuring that platforms adhere to strict anti-money laundering (AML) and consumer protection standards.” Startups: hope or hostage? For startups, Zhang stressed that M&A activity is a double-edged sword. He said: “On the positive side, acquisitions can provide startups with capital, resources, and access to larger markets, allowing them to scale more effectively. However, there is also a significant risk of consolidation stifling innovation.” However, he also warned of the risks. “On the other side, Dominant players might acquire smaller firms merely to neutralize competition, reducing diversity in the ecosystem.” Some platforms, especially those centred on AI and decentralized infrastructure, show how smaller companies can still innovate and grow in a more consolidated industry. However, regulators need to ensure that these startups have the space to continue innovating and expanding, even as larger players gain more market power. Strategic targets Zhang identified blockchain infrastructure providers, web3 platforms, and compliance solutions as the most likely acquisition targets for traditional financial institutions. “These firms are prime targets because they offer the technology and frameworks needed to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the emerging blockchain ecosystem. By acquiring such companies, institutions can accelerate their digital transformation, gain access to cutting-edge decentralized technologies, and ensure they meet the growing regulatory demands of the crypto space.” For example, compliance technologies that streamline onboarding and improve transaction monitoring are particularly valuable as institutions seek to integrate blockchain solutions. Zhang also noted the growing appeal of AI-powered platforms in the crypto space. “Innovations that enhance operational efficiency and expand service offerings will naturally attract interest, especially as institutions look to modernize their operations.” The road ahead Regulatory clarity under the Trump administration is expected to unlock new confidence among investors, particularly in high-growth crypto sectors like decentralized finance and blockchain infrastructure. With clearer rules, venture capital and private equity firms can move decisively, channelling resources into technologies that bridge traditional finance and decentralized systems. This influx of capital could drive innovation, scalability, and broader adoption. However, the risks of unchecked consolidation loom large. When dominant players absorb smaller competitors, market diversity shrinks, leaving innovation vulnerable to stagnation. Over-centralization could also amplify volatility as the industry becomes reliant on a few major entities for liquidity and infrastructure. The challenge lies in maintaining equilibrium. Effective oversight must encourage investment and collaboration without undermining the decentralization ethos that makes crypto unique.",Feature|Exclusive|acquisition|Donald Trump|Regulation|United States,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-17 13:51:51

Therefore, it’s important we take a meaningful look into its role in our great state of California.” Proof of Workforce, led by its founder Dom Bei, will be advising Chen’s policy team, working on education and community engagement, and researching how Bitcoin can support and rebuild California’s infrastructure and communities. “Bitcoin’s Genesis story has deep roots in California,” commented Bei. “A huge part of that Genesis Story is an innovative network, designed to protect the time, energy, and value of everyday, working people. Bitcoin isn’t partisan, it's uniquely Californian.” This isn’t Proof of Workforce’s first time helping onboard governments in California to Bitcoin. Last summer, Proof of Workforce partnered with the City of Santa Monica to open an official Bitcoin office . Since opening, the office has seen “an overwhelming amount of interest”, according to the city’s Mayor Lana Negrete. Santa Monica’s City Manager has also stated that other cities have reached out to learn more about their Bitcoin endeavors.

In South Korea, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has issued a suspension notice to Upbit, one of the country's largest exchanges, over alleged Know Your Customer (KYC) violations. Meanwhile, trading platform eToro has reportedly filed for an initial public offering (IPO) in the United States, aiming to raise its valuation to over $5 billion. Upbit Faces Suspension Over Alleged KYC Violations: South Korea’s FIU Takes Action South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), under the Financial Services Commission (FSC), has issued a suspension notice to Upbit, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the country. The notice, reported on Jan. 16 by Naver, alleges severe violations of Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols by the exchange. This move could have far-reaching implications for the South Korean crypto ecosystem and beyond. The FIU claims Upbit committed between 500,000 and 600,000 breaches in its KYC processes, citing issues identified during the company’s business license renewal review in late 2024. The reported violations prompted the regulator to propose strict punitive measures, including a six-month suspension of new user registrations. However, the restrictions would not impact existing customers. Upbit has until Jan. 20 to provide feedback on the proposed sanctions before the FIU makes its final decision on Jan. 21. This timeline leaves little room for maneuvering as Upbit faces potential operational disruptions. Under South Korea’s Special Financial Transactions Act, KYC violations carry fines of up to 100 million Korean won (approximately $68,600) per infraction. If the FIU's findings are upheld, the penalties could amount to a staggering $34.3 billion, based on the reported number of breaches. Furthermore, the FIU also accuses Upbit of conducting transactions with unregistered crypto service providers, a direct violation of the same law. Such infractions emphasize the heightened scrutiny local crypto exchanges face amid South Korea’s tightening regulatory framework. Since its inception in 2017, Upbit has grown into a leading global cryptocurrency exchange. With an average daily trading volume of $7.5 billion, according to CoinGecko, the platform dominates South Korea’s digital asset market and is a key player internationally. Any suspension could disrupt its momentum and potentially shake investor confidence in the South Korean crypto market. The crackdown on Upbit comes against the backdrop of South Korea’s increasingly stringent approach to regulating cryptocurrency operations. The Special Financial Transactions Act mandates strict KYC compliance to combat money laundering and fraud. Authorities are also focused on ensuring that local exchanges do not engage with unregistered crypto service providers. Upbit’s case is not isolated. The country’s crypto industry has been under intense scrutiny, with regulators keen on enforcing compliance across all players. This regulatory environment has already led to several exchanges ceasing operations or facing penalties. Parallel Legal Developments: Bithumb’s Former Chair Acquitted The Upbit saga unfolds alongside the ongoing legal troubles of South Korea’s cryptocurrency industry. On the same day the suspension notice was reported, Lee Jung-hoon, former chairman of Bithumb, was acquitted in an appeal trial concerning a 2017 customer data breach. The incident, which exposed sensitive data of over 31,000 users, had cast a long shadow on Bithumb’s operations. Lee’s acquittal marks a milestone in the lengthy legal battle but also shows the challenges faced by South Korea’s top crypto exchanges in navigating regulatory and legal hurdles. The suspension notice against Upbit has sent ripples across the South Korean crypto community. As of now, neither Upbit nor the FSC has issued a public statement regarding the allegations or the proposed sanctions. The final decision on Jan. 21 will likely determine the immediate future of Upbit’s operations and could set a precedent for how regulatory authorities handle similar cases. For now, the focus remains on Upbit’s response and its ability to address the FIU’s concerns effectively. Industry experts believe the case highlights the importance of robust compliance measures in an increasingly regulated global crypto landscape. The FIU’s move against Upbit signals a critical juncture for South Korea’s cryptocurrency market. As regulators enforce stricter compliance requirements, crypto exchanges must adapt quickly to avoid severe penalties and maintain market confidence. With billions of dollars at stake and the potential for industry-wide ripple effects, all eyes will be on the FIU’s final decision and Upbit’s next steps. This unfolding story is a stark reminder of the complexities and risks inherent in operating within the evolving cryptocurrency regulatory environment. eToro Reportedly Files for $5 Billion IPO in the United States: A Major Move Toward Global Expansion Cryptocurrency-friendly trading platform eToro has reportedly taken a significant step toward its US market ambitions by filing for an initial public offering (IPO). According to a Financial Times report on Jan. 16, the Israel-based platform has made a confidential submission to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), potentially valuing the company at over $5 billion. This move represents a key milestone for eToro, marking its intention to expand its footprint in the world’s largest financial market. If successful, the IPO could pave the way for a listing on a major US stock exchange as early as the second quarter of 2025. The confidential filing with the SEC allows eToro to work on its public offering privately before disclosing the full details. While the exact valuation is yet to be confirmed, sources close to the matter suggest the platform could achieve a valuation exceeding $5 billion, significantly higher than its $3.5 billion valuation during a $250 million funding round in 2023. Banks such as Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and UBS are reportedly collaborating with eToro on the IPO. Although eToro’s largest market is the United Kingdom, the company sees the US as a gateway to deeper liquidity and a larger pool of investors. CEO and founder Yoni Assia highlighted the advantages of a US listing in a previous statement, saying, “Very few of our global clients would trade UK shares. Something in the US market creates a pool of both deep liquidity and deep awareness for those assets that are trading in the US” By pursuing a US IPO, eToro aims to enhance its global profile while tapping into the immense capital markets of New York, home to some of the world's largest publicly traded companies. Founded in 2007, eToro initially gained traction as a social investment platform, allowing users to trade multiple asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, and commodities. The platform is renowned for its user-friendly interface and “copy trading” feature, enabling investors to replicate the strategies of experienced traders. In 2013, eToro became one of Europe’s first regulated platforms to introduce Bitcoin trading. Over the years, it expanded its cryptocurrency offerings, including major tokens like Ethereum, XRP, and Litecoin. In 2019, eToro brought its crypto services to the US, further solidifying its position as a major player in the global digital asset market. However, the company faced regulatory challenges in 2024 when it ceased trading nearly all cryptocurrencies in the US. This decision followed a settlement with the SEC over allegations of federal securities law violations. Despite these setbacks, eToro has continued to prioritize compliance and innovation, seeking to regain its footing in the US market. eToro’s potential listing comes at a time when global financial markets are navigating macroeconomic uncertainties, but the appetite for technology and fintech IPOs remains robust. If successful, eToro’s US debut would: Boost Market Confidence: A successful IPO at a valuation exceeding $5 billion could signal strong investor confidence in the platform’s growth potential. Strengthen Crypto Adoption: As one of the pioneers in integrating cryptocurrency trading with traditional financial instruments, eToro’s public listing could further legitimize digital assets in mainstream finance. Elevate Industry Standards: The IPO would likely bring increased scrutiny to eToro’s operations, pushing the platform to uphold the highest regulatory and operational standards. Challenges Ahead While the IPO presents immense opportunities, eToro faces challenges, particularly in the regulatory landscape. Its decision to cease crypto trading in the US last year underscores the complexities of navigating SEC rules. Rebuilding its cryptocurrency offerings while complying with stringent regulations will be a delicate balancing act. Additionally, the volatile nature of the crypto market could impact eToro’s valuation and investor sentiment. As global financial regulators continue to crack down on digital assets, maintaining a resilient and adaptable business model will be critical. eToro’s reported IPO filing with the SEC marks a pivotal chapter in its journey toward becoming a global financial powerhouse. By targeting the US market, the company aims to unlock new growth opportunities while enhancing its global visibility. As the platform prepares for its potential debut on Wall Street, its success could set a precedent for other fintech and crypto-friendly companies looking to tap into US capital markets. For eToro, this is more than just an IPO—it’s a bold statement of intent to lead in the future of digital finance. With the listing anticipated in the second quarter of 2025, the financial world will be closely watching how eToro navigates this transformative phase.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-17 14:00:00

Among the top performers is Dogecoin, which has taken the lead in driving meme coins into a bullish phase. Over the past five days, Dogecoin has surged by more than 33%, signaling the potential for a massive rally ahead. Related Reading: ‘Solana Season Is About To Return’ As Price Turns Key Resistance Into Support – Analyst Dogecoin’s impressive performance reflects its longstanding position as the meme coin leader, capturing the attention of retail and institutional investors alike. The surge in DOGE’s price has also begun to influence other dog-themed coins, creating a ripple effect across the market. Analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, pointing out that DOGE is paving the way for related coins like FLOKI to follow its upward trajectory. This resurgence comes amid broader speculation about pro-crypto moves under the new administration, adding to the market’s bullish sentiment. With meme coins gaining momentum and Bitcoin reclaiming key levels, Dogecoin’s rise is part of a larger trend suggesting significant growth in the crypto space. As DOGE continues to push higher, the question remains: can it lead meme coins into another historic rally? Dogecoin Expected To Rise Dogecoin (DOGE) is on the verge of a significant breakout as bullish momentum builds around the cryptocurrency. Investors are eyeing a reclaim of key supply levels, which could signal the start of a massive rally. Market optimism grows by anticipation that Donald Trump, who is expected to prioritize crypto policies when he assumes office, could be pivotal in driving interest and investment in digital assets, including DOGE. Expert analyst Jelle recently shared his insights on X, predicting a surge in DOGE’s value. “With Trump almost back in office, the US Doge department will soon be a reality,” Jelle commented, hinting at potential government-level engagement with cryptocurrency policies that could benefit the coin. This perspective has sparked enthusiasm among the DOGE community, leading to increased trading activity and speculation on upcoming price movements. Additionally, Dogecoin’s rally is influencing the broader category of dog-themed coins, with tokens like FLOKI beginning to gain traction. As DOGE leads, FLOKI and similar assets could follow its bullish trend, further amplifying market enthusiasm. Analysts see these coins as part of a larger narrative of crypto resurgence under a more crypto-friendly administration. Related Reading: Ondo Finance Funding Rate Signals Greed Among Investors – Sign Of Strength? If Dogecoin successfully reclaims critical supply zones, it could pave the way for higher prices in the weeks ahead. Jelle remains confident in the coin’s trajectory, expecting continued upward movement fueled by both technical indicators and macroeconomic developments. As DOGE begins to rise, market participants are watching closely, betting on its potential to drive a broader rally in the cryptocurrency market. Testing Crucial Supply Levels Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at $0.41, a pivotal supply level that holds the key to its next major price move. This level has become a critical battleground for bulls and bears, as reclaiming it as a demand zone could set the stage for a powerful upward rally. Analysts suggest that once DOGE establishes $0.41 as a foundation, the price could surge past last year’s high of $0.48, reigniting bullish momentum. Breaking the $0.48 resistance is expected to open the door to even higher targets, with Dogecoin’s all-time high (ATH) becoming a more achievable goal. Market sentiment remains optimistic, with traders closely monitoring a potential daily close above the $0.50 threshold. Such a move would not only confirm the bullish trend but also signal the beginning of a massive rally that could lead the meme coin market.

As momentum builds, the coming days could mark a turning point for Dogecoin, with investors eyeing a potentially explosive rally.

New Viral ERC-20 Token Yeti Ouro Set To Lead Next Bull Run,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/new-viral-erc-20-token-yeti-ouro-set-to-lead-next-bull-run/,"The post Bitcoin Price Prediction: Will BTC Reach $200K In 2025? New Viral ERC-20 Token Yeti Ouro Set To Lead Next Bull Run appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As we get into 2025 the crypto market is getting more attention with big returns. Two of the biggest are Bitcoin (BTC) the original and Yeti Ouro (YETIO) a new ERC-20 token getting popular in the crypto space. This article will cover Bitcoin’s price prediction and Yeti Ouro investment. Bitcoin Price Prediction: $200,000 In Sight? Bitcoin hit $100,000 on December 5th, 2024. Big drivers were the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and a friendly regulatory environment under President Donald Trump’s administration. Bitcoin price has crept back up past $100k with a current price of $100,044.09 , as of January 16th. Analysts are even more bullish for 2025. Bernstein and Standard Chartered both think Bitcoin could hit $200,000 due to strong institutional demand and favorable market conditions. Why $200,000? Institutional Adoption: Spot Bitcoin ETFs have made Bitcoin more accessible to institutions, more legitimacy and big capital inflows. Friendly Regulations: Pro-crypto policies in the US have been a boost to the industry. Supply and Demand: 21 million coins and growing adoption is pushing prices up. Yeti Ouro: Great Potential For 2025? While Bitcoin is in the spotlight, new tokens like Yeti Ouro are offering big investment opportunities. Yeti Ouro is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, combining meme culture with real utility in the Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming space. At the core of Yeti Ouro’s ecosystem is “Yeti Go”, a P2E racing game. Players use YETIO tokens to join races, upgrade vehicles and earn rewards. This mix of gaming and DeFi is a big draw for gamers and investors. Why Yeti Ouro is Worth Watching Deflationary Tokenomics: Yeti Ouro has a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens and burns tokens regularly reducing supply over time and potentially increasing value. Strong Early Hype: During the presale Yeti Ouro raised almost $1 million, early investors believe. Gaming + DeFi: Yeti Ouro is in the fast growing gaming and DeFi space, very versatile and attractive. Active Community: Active community and responsive dev team. Analyst Predictions Some predict Yeti Ouro could go up 2500% by the end of 2025 and be one of the top altcoin performers. When you look at YETIO’s successful presale and the fact that it’s still early into the tokens launch, it’s clear that there is a lot of upside potential. Combine this with the expectations of a bull run this year and Yeti Ouro is definitely a token that serious investors should consider. The best time to buy into any token is before it starts to rise rapidly in price, so you can take profits before any dips and buy back during the accumulation phases to maximize profits. With that said, memecoins and gamins both remain as strong narratives in the crypto space and the added benefits of actual utility make YETIO a smart choice for an investment in 2025. What To Consider? Both Bitcoin and Yeti Ouro are great but you need to be careful. The crypto market is very volatile and you need to do your research. Diversify your investments and understand each asset’s fundamentals to manage risk and maximize gains. Conclusion As we get into 2025 Bitcoin could hit $200,000 and new tokens like Yeti Ouro can potentially see a lot of growth. Yeti Ouro with P2E gaming, DeFi and deflationary tokenomics is an attractive opportunity. But due diligence and a plan is key to success in this space.

Meanwhile, tech groups TechNet and NetChoice challenged the CFPB’s expanded oversight of digital payment apps, and accused the agency of overreach. Pump.fun, the Solana-based meme coin launchpad, is also facing a class-action lawsuit for exploitative practices and for allowing harmful content. In South Korea, crypto regulations proved to be quite useful after it took its first enforcement action under the Virtual Asset Protection Act. Developer Challenges DOJ's Money-Transmitting Laws Michael Lewellen , a crypto developer and fellow of the advocacy group Coin Center, filed a lawsuit against US Attorney General Merrick Garland, asking for more legal clarity on his new cryptocurrency software, Pharos. The software is designed for non-custodial crowdfunding campaigns, and raised some concerns about potential prosecution under current money-transmitting laws. Lewellen's suit was filed in a Texas federal court on Jan. 16, and requests a ruling that his software does not violate these laws. He also wants to block any future legal actions by the Department of Justice (DOJ). (Source: Court Listener ) The lawsuit alleges that the DOJ expanded its interpretation of money-transmitting laws unconstitutionally by infringing on First and Fifth Amendment protections. Lewellen argues that Pharos, which does not grant him control or custody over users' cryptocurrency, falls outside the scope of money-transmitting regulations. The complaint also draws parallels to cases against developers of crypto mixers, like Tornado Cash’s Roman Storm and Samourai Wallet’s Keonne Rodriguez, who were charged with operating unlicensed money-transmitting businesses and money laundering. Coin Center is a well known crypto advocacy group, and it is backing Lewellen's case due to the growing industry concerns over legal risks faced by crypto developers. In a public statement, Lewellen mentioned the broader implications of the case for crypto innovation in the US. He firmly believes that overreaching interpretations of money-transmitting laws threaten the ability to create non-custodial crypto solutions. The lawsuit was filed after a series of preemptive legal actions by some other crypto companies looking for judicial clarity on regulatory issues. Software firm Consensys sued the SEC last year to declare Ether a non-security, though the case was later dismissed. Similar cases involving Beba and Lejilex asked for rulings to protect their crypto projects from regulatory challenges but faced pushback from the SEC. Attorney General Garland is preparing to step down with President-elect Donald Trump set to re-enter office. His successor, Pam Bondi, is undergoing confirmation hearings. Tech Groups Sue CFPB Two technology trade groups, TechNet and NetChoice, also recently filed a lawsuit against the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), challenging a new rule that expands the agency’s oversight to include payment apps and digital wallets. The rule was finalized in December, and it grants the CFPB supervisory authority over “general-use digital consumer payment applications,” targeting large non-bank financial service providers like Apple Pay, Google Wallet, PayPal, Venmo, and Cash App. Crypto wallets and decentralized wallets are excluded from the rule. The groups argue that the CFPB’s move is an overreach, and NetChoice even called it a “blatant power grab” that threatens innovation, increases costs, and reduces consumer choice. They pointed out that many of the affected companies are already subject to extensive state-level regulation and that the CFPB failed to demonstrate regulatory gaps that would necessitate federal intervention at all. The lawsuit describes the rule as “arbitrary and capricious,” and mentions that it violates statutory requirements. The CFPB defends the rule as a measure to protect consumer data, reduce fraud, and combat illegal debanking through proactive examinations of compliance with federal privacy and fraud laws. However, critics argue that it imposes unnecessary barriers for businesses and consolidates excessive government control over a highly innovative sector. On the same day that the lawsuit was filed, the CFPB fined Block Inc ., the parent company of Cash App, over alleged insufficient fraud protections. The regulator accused Block of directing fraud-affected users to their banks for transaction reversals. Block denied this claim. The enforcement action included up to $120 million in compensation for affected users and a $55 million penalty to be paid to the CFPB’s victim relief fund. This legal challenge was made during a time of heightened scrutiny of digital finance. The CFPB also proposed additional rules earlier this month that could require crypto asset service providers to reimburse users for losses from hacks and scams. Pump.fun Faces Class-Action Lawsuit Regulators are not the only entities facing legal backlash. Burwick Law , a US-based crypto law firm, announced that it plans to pursue legal action on behalf of investors who suffered losses from the Solana-based meme coin launchpad Pump.fun. In a public statement, the firm revealed it spent months working with people who lost large amounts of money through meme coins, rug pulls, and unfulfilled promises on platforms like Pump.fun. The firm criticized Pump.fun and its anonymous creators for profiting from harmful and exploitative practices. More specifically, Burwick alleged that the platform collected hundreds of millions of dollars in fees while hosting inappropriate and harmful content, including depictions of drug use, racism, antisemitism, and violent acts. The law firm also accused Pump.fun of exploiting users under the guise of crypto innovation. Pump.fun is a launchpad that allows users to create and launch meme coins without needing much technical expertise. Its popularity grew quite a bit since its launch, and reportedly saw over 14 million crypto wallets interact with the platform. However, data from analyst Adam Tehc indicates that only about 0.4% of users actually earned profits exceeding $10,000. The platform also faced some serious criticisms, including from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, which banned residents from accessing Pump.fun in December to stop scams. Pump.fun also previously offered a livestream feature, but this was quickly suspended after reports of creators engaging in dangerous stunts to promote their tokens. Burwick Law invited any other affected investors to join its class-action investigation. The firm is also busy with legal action related to Moonbirds and Proof Collective NFTs, as well as the Full Send Metacard NFTs, which it claims offered unrealistic promises of benefits to investors. Virtual Asset Protection Act Sees First Enforcement Action Although they sometimes cause confusion for companies, crypto laws do sometimes protect investors as they are supposed to. South Korea's Financial Services Commission (FSC) recently reported its first case under the Virtual Asset User Protection Act , targeting alleged unfair cryptocurrency trading practices. It was enacted in July of 2024, and mandates local virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to monitor and report abnormal transactions. In this case, suspects were charged with manipulating crypto prices through a ”pump and dump” scheme. The FSC revealed that the price manipulation involved placing multiple buy orders to inflate the value of a crypto before selling off assets in brief intervals, often within 10 minutes. The scheme generated hundreds of millions of Korean won over just a month. Meanwhile, South Korea continues discussions on corporate crypto investment accounts, with the second Virtual Asset Committee meeting addressing potential approvals. Additionally, the FSC is expected to review punitive measures for local exchange Upbit, which is facing allegations of over 500,000 Know Your Customer (KYC) violations in 2024.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-17 14:08:41

During his nomination hearing on Thursday, Scott Bessent told the Senate Finance Committee that, unlike other countries, the US will not gain much from rolling out a digital dollar. “On CBDCs, I see no reason for the US to have a central bank digital currency. In my mind, a central bank digital currency is for countries that have no other investment alternatives.” A CBDC is a digital form of a country’s fiat currency, regulated by a central bank. Bessent says that holders of other currencies, particularly the Chinese yuan (CNY) or renminbi (RMB), have little to invest in. He says this is not the case with the US dollar. “Many of these countries are doing it out of necessity whereas the US, if you hold a US dollar, could hold a variety of very secure US assets.” In 2022, the Federal Reserve issued a discussion paper that examined the pros and cons of a potential CBDC, but the central bank to date has not made any decision to implement a digital dollar. Trump neither supports the idea of pursuing a CBDC. Last year, he told a crowd in New Hampshire that he would block the creation of a central bank digital currency.

This price surge is due to bullish fundamentals, including Donald Trump’s receptiveness to a crypto reserve that would include the coin. Factors Behind The XRP Rally To Its ATH CoinMarketCap data shows that the XRP price rallied to $3.40 yesterday, a price level that represents its current all-time high (ATH) on some exchanges like Binance and Kraken. This price surge has occurred due to several factors, including a report that Donald Trump is receptive to the idea of an America-first strategic reserve. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Above $100,000 Renews Hope, Analyst Reveals The Cycle Top As Bitcoinist reported, this initiative would focus on cryptocurrencies that were founded in the US, including XRP, Solana, and USDC. This is bullish for these coins, as it would lead to greater adoption for them. This news already sparked a bullish sentiment among investors, leading to this XRP price surge. Before now, these investors, especially crypto whales, were accumulating, another factor contributing to the XRP price surge. Bitcoinist reported that this category of investors had bought 1.43 billion coins in two months. This is massive, considering how these accumulation trends always lead to price discovery, which is being witnessed with XRP at the moment. This accumulation trend looks to have intensified on the news of the potential crypto reserve involving XRP. CoinMarketData shows that the coin’s trading volume has surged by 7% in the last 24 hours, with $24.18 billion traded during this period. This surge in trading volume has also contributed to the XRP price rally. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed its opening brief in its appeal against Ripple. However, this development was considered bullish for the XRP price, as the Commission did not dispute Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling that XRP isn’t a security. Why The Price Surge Is Likely To Continue The XRP price surge will likely continue based on its bullish fundamentals and technicals. From a fundamental perspective, Donald Trump is set to take office on January 20, meaning that this crypto reserve, which will include XRP, could come to life sooner rather than later. Trump’s administration is also bullish for XRP because of the possible emergence of pro-crypto Paul Atkins as the next SEC Chair. Related Reading: Can The Dogecoin Price Rally For 3 Months Straight? 2021 Bull Market Performance Says Yes Paul Atkin’s pro-crypto stance has led to predictions that the Commission will likely drop the appeal against Ripple once he takes office. The Commission is also expected to approve the pending XRP ETF applications under Atkins. From a technical perspective, crypto analysts have also provided a bullish outlook for the XRP price. Crypto analyst CasiTrades predicted that XRP will break its ATH and rally to between $8 and $13. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $3.34, up over 7% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The analysts also highlighted advancements in layer-2 Bitcoin technology and increasing institutional adoption of private blockchains , further solidifying Bitcoin’s position as the leading cryptocurrency. Key Drivers of Bitcoin’s Sustained Dominance 1. Strong ETF Inflows Institutional Interest: The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has unlocked new opportunities for institutional investors, driving significant capital into Bitcoin. Increased Accessibility: ETFs provide a simplified avenue for exposure, reducing the technical barriers to entry for traditional financial players. 2. MicroStrategy’s Accumulation Strategy Ongoing Purchases: MicroStrategy continues to acquire large amounts of Bitcoin, cementing its position as a major institutional advocate. Market Confidence: The company’s unwavering commitment to Bitcoin reinforces its status as a reliable store of value. 3. U.S. Crypto Reserves Potential Focus on Bitcoin: Speculation around the U.S. adopting Bitcoin as part of its strategic crypto reserves could significantly boost demand and trust in the asset. Advancements in Bitcoin Technology 1. Layer-2 Solutions Enhanced Scalability: Technologies like the Lightning Network are enabling faster and more cost-effective Bitcoin transactions. Broader Utility: Improved transaction capabilities expand Bitcoin’s use case beyond a store of value to include payments and microtransactions. 2. Institutional Private Blockchains Adoption Trends: Institutions are increasingly turning to private blockchains for secure, scalable solutions, which could indirectly benefit Bitcoin’s broader ecosystem. Challenges for Altcoins 1. Delays in U.S. Crypto Policies Regulatory Clarity: While a clear framework could benefit altcoins, ongoing delays in U.S. crypto regulations may hinder their growth. Market Consolidation: The lack of clarity may push investors to consolidate their portfolios around Bitcoin as the safer and more established option. 2. Competition from Bitcoin First-Mover Advantage: Bitcoin’s established reputation and infrastructure make it a more attractive choice for institutional investors compared to altcoins. Liquidity Dominance: Bitcoin’s superior liquidity and market depth reinforce its position as the preferred asset in times of uncertainty. Market Implications of Bitcoin’s Dominance Factor Impact ETF Inflows Increased institutional participation and price stability. Altcoin Growth Delays Slower innovation and adoption for emerging blockchains. Regulatory Frameworks Consolidation around Bitcoin until clearer policies emerge. Technological Upgrades Improved scalability and utility for Bitcoin as a payment network. Comparison: Bitcoin vs. Altcoins in 2025 Aspect Bitcoin Altcoins Market Dominance 55% Fragmented among hundreds of coins. Institutional Focus High Moderate, pending regulatory clarity. Technological Maturity Advanced (Layer-2 scaling) Innovative but less proven. Liquidity High Lower relative to Bitcoin. Future Outlook for Bitcoin 1. Increasing Institutional Adoption With ETFs and major corporations like MicroStrategy doubling down on Bitcoin, its role as a cornerstone of the crypto market is solidified. 2. Potential Integration into National Reserves If the U.S. adopts Bitcoin as part of its crypto reserves, it could become a global financial asset akin to gold. 3. Continued Technological Innovation Layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network will enhance Bitcoin’s functionality, enabling broader adoption for everyday transactions. Conclusion JPMorgan’s prediction that Bitcoin will maintain its 55% market dominance through 2025 underscores its resilience and institutional appeal. With factors like ETF inflows , technological advancements , and speculative interest in U.S. crypto reserves , Bitcoin is poised to remain the leading digital asset. While regulatory delays may temporarily hinder altcoin growth, Bitcoin’s established position as a store of value and a scalable payment network ensures its continued prominence in the cryptocurrency market.

Key Drivers of Institutional Growth 1. Pro-Crypto U.S. Policies Trump Administration’s Stance: Chen noted that Donald Trump’s inauguration could bring an environment favorable to cryptocurrencies, with clearer regulations and incentives for institutional adoption. Regulatory Clarity: Expectations of a more defined framework may attract institutions hesitant to enter the market due to legal uncertainties. 2. Increased Institutional Interest Consistent Growth: Binance saw a near twofold increase in institutional clients per quarter throughout 2024.

Dogecoin Doge coin ‘s price has seen notable shifts recently. In the past week, it rose by 10.64%, trading between $0.2998 and $0.3851. Over the last month, the price dipped by 5.85%. However, looking at the past six months, Dogecoin has surged by 201.59%. This mix of short-term decline and long-term growth highlights its volatility and potential. The current price is nearing the nearest resistance level at $0.4346. Breaking through this could lead to the second resistance level at $0.5199, indicating a substantial rise. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $0.2640. If the price drops below this, it might test the second support level at $0.1787. Technical indicators show promising signs. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.3775, slightly above the 100-day average of $0.3504. The Relative Strength Index stands at 55.33, suggesting the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. The stochastic value is 62.65, indicating potential upward momentum. Additionally, the MACD level is positive at 0.003679, pointing toward possible bullish movement. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a 4.98% price increase over the past week, moving within the range of $0.00001965 to $0.00002402. This recent uptick indicates potential recovery after a 17.90% drop over the past month. Despite the monthly decline, SHIB’s price has risen by 25.31% over the past six months. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 55.58, suggesting the token is neither overbought nor oversold. The Simple Moving Averages for 10 and 100 days are close, with the 10-day SMA at $0.00002221 and the 100-day SMA at $0.00002147, indicating possible trend consolidation. If SHIB continues to rise, it may test the nearest resistance level at $0.00002651. Breaking this could lead to the second resistance at $0.00003088, which is about a 28% increase from the current price range. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.00001777, and falling to the second support at $0.00001340 would represent a significant drop. With current indicators, SHIB shows potential for growth but must overcome key resistance levels. Conclusion While DOGE and SHIB have achieved success, XYZVerse aims to surpass them with its unique sports-themed meme coin, promising significant growth in the current bull run.

39099824,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=121886,1737128061,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Opposes U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/treasury-secretary-scott-bessent-opposes-cbdc/,"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Opposes U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency Scott Bessent , the Treasury Secretary under Donald Trump’s administration , has voiced his opposition to the creation of a U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) . According to Watcher Guru on X, Bessent stated that the federal government has no justification for launching a CBDC, raising questions about its potential risks and necessity. This statement reflects a broader skepticism toward government-backed digital currencies within Trump’s administration, marking a significant policy stance in the ongoing global debate over CBDCs. Key Arguments Against a U.S. CBDC 1. Lack of Justification Existing Alternatives: Bessent argued that private-sector innovations, such as stablecoins and traditional electronic payment systems, already meet the needs a CBDC would aim to address. Unnecessary Government Role: He emphasized that government involvement in creating a digital currency could disrupt the financial sector without providing clear benefits. 2. Privacy Concerns Surveillance Risks: CBDCs could enable government monitoring of individual financial transactions, raising significant privacy issues. Public Backlash: The prospect of centralized control over digital payments could erode trust in government systems. 3. Threats to Financial Stability Bank Disintermediation: A U.S. CBDC could undermine the traditional banking system by encouraging users to move funds directly to the Federal Reserve, potentially destabilizing banks. Impact on Innovation: Critics argue that a government-backed CBDC could stifle private-sector innovations in digital payments and blockchain technology. Contrasting Views on CBDCs Global CBDC Adoption China’s Digital Yuan: China has already rolled out its CBDC, the digital yuan , to enhance financial inclusion and internationalize its currency. European Central Bank: The EU is actively exploring a digital euro , citing the need for modernization and competitiveness. Proponents of a U.S. CBDC Advocates argue that a CBDC could: Enhance Financial Inclusion: Provide banking services to unbanked populations. Improve Efficiency: Streamline payment systems and reduce transaction costs. Strengthen Dollar Dominance: Maintain the U.S. dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency amid global CBDC adoption. Challenges and Risks of Implementing a U.S. CBDC Challenge Description Privacy Issues Potential for government surveillance of financial transactions. Technological Complexity Designing a secure and scalable CBDC infrastructure. Impact on Banks Risk of undermining traditional banking systems. Economic Disruption Potential unintended consequences for monetary policy and liquidity. Trump Administration’s Stance on CBDCs Under Trump’s leadership, the administration has shown consistent skepticism toward CBDCs: Emphasis on Private Innovation: The administration favors private-sector solutions like stablecoins to drive financial innovation. Regulatory Focus: Instead of pursuing a CBDC, the administration is prioritizing clear regulations for existing digital assets and blockchain technologies. Potential Implications of Bessent’s Opposition For the Crypto Market Stablecoin Growth: The absence of a U.S. CBDC could strengthen the role of stablecoins like USDT and USDC in digital transactions. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): A focus on private solutions could encourage innovation in DeFi platforms and blockchain-based payment systems. For Global Competitiveness Lagging Behind Rivals: Critics warn that without a CBDC, the U.S. risks falling behind nations like China in the digital currency race. Dollar’s Role: The U.S. must ensure the dollar remains dominant in global finance, even as other countries adopt CBDCs. Conclusion Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s firm rejection of a U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency underscores the Trump administration’s preference for private-sector innovation over government-led initiatives. While his stance prioritizes privacy and financial stability, it raises concerns about the U.S. potentially falling behind in the global CBDC race. As the debate over CBDCs continues, the U.S. will need to balance fostering innovation with maintaining its competitive edge in the evolving financial landscape.

BTC, which previously peaked at $108,000 in December 2024, has experienced a near- 15% drawdown , reflecting the impact of shifting macroeconomic conditions. McGlone highlights that maintaining a level above $100,000 is crucial for Bitcoin’s narrative as a store of value , comparable to gold . However, he notes increasing competition from gold, which has been outperforming equities in recent months. Key Factors Behind Bitcoin’s Resistance 1. Federal Reserve Rate Expectations Macroeconomic Impact: The Federal Reserve’s cautious stance on interest rates continues to influence risk assets, including Bitcoin. Market Volatility: Rate hikes or delayed cuts could exacerbate volatility, making it harder for BTC to sustain levels above $100,000. 2. Rising Competition from Gold Gold’s Performance: As a traditional safe-haven asset, gold has been gaining traction among investors during periods of economic uncertainty. Outpacing Equities: Gold’s recent outperformance highlights its appeal, presenting a challenge to Bitcoin’s positioning as “digital gold.” 3. Correlation with the S&P 500 Equity Market Links: Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 remains elevated, tying its performance to broader stock market trends. Economic Headwinds: A weak equities market could further hinder Bitcoin’s ability to break through the $100,000 resistance. Boosts to Speculative Demand Despite these challenges, McGlone identifies several factors driving speculative interest in Bitcoin: 1. Bitcoin ETFs Institutional Access: The growing adoption of spot Bitcoin ETFs has contributed to increased investor demand and liquidity. Market Impact: These products provide an accessible way for institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin, potentially supporting price growth. 2. Bitcoin Halving Supply Reduction: The upcoming Bitcoin halving, expected in 2024 , will reduce mining rewards, creating scarcity and potentially driving prices higher. 3. Political Shifts Pro-Crypto Policies: The anticipation of favorable cryptocurrency regulations under the Trump administration has bolstered market optimism. Key Metrics and Historical Context Metric Value Impact Bitcoin Resistance $100,000 Psychological and technical barrier. December Peak $108,000 Reflects recent speculative demand. Drawdown ~15% Indicates market uncertainty. Gold Price Trend Outperforming equities Competes with Bitcoin as a store of value. Scenarios for Bitcoin’s Price Movement Scenario Factors Breaks Above $100K Positive ETF flows, halving momentum, favorable macro conditions. Fails to Sustain $100K Continued Fed tightening, gold outperformance, equity market weakness. What Investors Should Watch 1. Federal Reserve Announcements Monitor rate decisions and economic forecasts, as these will heavily influence Bitcoin and other risk assets. 2. ETF Inflows The strength of inflows into Bitcoin ETFs could provide a gauge for institutional sentiment. 3. Bitcoin-Gold Dynamics Pay attention to the relative performance of Bitcoin and gold as investors weigh their options for a store of value. Conclusion Bitcoin’s $100,000 resistance represents a pivotal psychological and technical barrier, with broader macroeconomic factors and competition from gold complicating its upward trajectory. While ETFs, the Bitcoin halving, and pro-crypto political sentiment offer strong tailwinds, the interplay between the Federal Reserve’s policies and investor sentiment will ultimately determine Bitcoin’s ability to sustain new highs. For now, the crypto market remains at a crossroads, requiring investors to balance short-term caution with long-term optimism.

Remittix (RTX) , with its innovative blockchain technology, promises to redefine global payments. Could this be the best investment of the year? With experts predicting a 700% surge in just two months, RTX might just be the next big thing in crypto. Can Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) Recover, or Will It Stay Stuck? Staying between $0.0576 and $0.1113, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is finding difficulties recovering from recent declines. At $0.1467, the coin encounters a strong resistance level that makes breaking through unlikely unless momentum significantly changes. Although the RSI (Relative Strength Index) is low at about 24, meaning the coin is oversold, this does not always signal a price rebound is about to occur. It may also be a reflection of buyer low interest. Aiming for the next target of $0.042 seems extremely ambitious considering the present market conditions even if PENGU manages to break over $0.1467. The consistently declining trend of the Simple Moving Averages (SMA) points to poor coin confidence. PENGU can keep lagging behind other altcoins throughout the present market cycle without fresh investor interest or encouraging news. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Nears Key Support, Risks 25% Drop At a crucial level that could indicate either a recovery or additional losses, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is near the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). At $0.000021 right now, SHIB runs the danger of falling below this support, which might cause a 25% decrease and lower the price to $0.000016. Given that it shows the long-term trend, the 200 EMA is absolutely vital. Should SHIB's price drop below there, a negative trend may develop. For instance, SHIB's price declined noticeably in the weeks following its July 2024 plunge below this level. One may imagine a repetition of this situation. On-chain data accentuates the negative perspective. Many SHIB tokens, claims IntoTheBlock, are kept at a loss between $0.000021 and $0.000024. This generates selling pressure since holders might sell to reduce losses. This pushback might make SHIB's rebounding more difficult. Besides, the market momentum-measuring Awesome Oscillator (AO) stays negative. This points to weak purchasing interest, which can aggravate the fall. On the other hand, should purchasing volume rise and SHIB surpass past resistance, it could revert to $0.000033. The token has a difficult journey ahead till then.

Remittix (RTX) , leveraging its groundbreaking blockchain technology, aims to transform global payments. Could this become the top investment of the year? With experts forecasting a 700% increase within just two months, RTX might indeed be the next major player in the crypto arena. Will Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) Overcome Challenges or Remain in a Slump? Stuck between $0.0576 and $0.1113, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is struggling to bounce back from recent downturns. Currently at $0.1467, the coin faces a tough resistance level, making it unlikely to break through unless there's a significant shift in momentum. Although the RSI (Relative Strength Index) is low at around 24, indicating oversold conditions, this doesn't always guarantee an imminent price rebound, as it might also reflect a lack of buyer interest. Considering the current market environment, targeting $0.042 seems quite ambitious even if PENGU manages to break past $0.1467. The ongoing downward trend of the Simple Moving Averages (SMA) suggests a lack of confidence in the coin. Without new investor interest or positive news, PENGU might continue to trail behind other altcoins throughout this market cycle. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Faces Crucial Support Level, Risking a 25% Decline Shiba Inu (SHIB) is teetering near a crucial level that could signal either recovery or further losses, hovering around the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Currently priced at $0.000021, SHIB risks falling below this support, potentially leading to a 25% drop and bringing the price down to $0.000016. The 200 EMA is crucial as it indicates the long-term trend. Should SHIB's price slip below this point, a bearish trend might emerge. For example, after SHIB fell below this level in July 2024, a significant price drop followed in the subsequent weeks, suggesting a possible repeat scenario. On-chain data strengthens the bearish outlook. According to IntoTheBlock, many SHIB tokens are held at a loss between $0.000021 and $0.000024, creating selling pressure as holders may opt to sell to cut losses. This resistance could hinder SHIB's recovery efforts. Moreover, the Awesome Oscillator (AO), which measures market momentum, remains negative, indicating weak buying interest and potentially exacerbating the decline.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogecoin (DOGE) has taken the spotlight with a massive triple-digit rally that propelled it as one of the hottest projects in the current crypto landscape. However, as exciting as this Dogecoin surge can be, it also highlights its highly volatile nature as an asset driven largely by hype and speculation. On the other side of the spectrum, newcomers like Elluminex are quietly building robust DeFi ecosystems, offering a compelling case for investment based on smart solutions rather than just market trends. Built on the TON ecosystem, Elluminex is ready to leverage its 950-million user base, unlocking an entirely new dimension of opportunity through its frameworks. Does Elluminex have what it takes to become the next big thing in DeFi and potentially outshine Dogecoin in terms of gains? Let’s find out. You might also like: Changing early investment opportunities: The role of Premarket access in Defi How Elluminex rewrites the DeFi script Elluminex (ELX) leverages the capabilities of the TON blockchain, which is intimately connected with Telegram’s nearly 1-billion-strong user base. This association not only provides Elluminex with a vast potential market but also positions it uniquely within the DeFi landscape. One of the primary issues in the current DeFi environment is the fragmentation of liquidity. This leads to inefficiency, higher costs, and longer waiting times for transactions. Elluminex addresses this by introducing a unique cross-chain bridge that allows for the seamless transfer of assets between all major ecosystems. This bridge isn’t just about moving tokens; it’s about creating a unified liquidity pool where users can access the best of each blockchain without the hassle of switching between different platforms. Elluminex prioritizes user sovereignty as well as it operates without intermediaries, ensuring that users maintain complete control over their private keys and assets. This approach not only enhances security but also aligns with the ethos of decentralization which is one of the main cornerstones of crypto philosophy. The native ELX token powers all processes within the Elluminex ecosystem, including staking and governance. Post-presale, users will be able to put their ELX to work and receive recurring staking rewards for up to 18% APY. The ELX presale will launch very soon, and early adopters will be able to scoop up tokens at discounted prices. Elluminex is already making headlines even, so keep an eye on the socials and the official website for the next update. Once the presale is live, a massive influx of investors is expected. Dogecoin’s volatile journey Dogecoin has been on a rollercoaster recently and is now trading at $0.40 following a 1.8% intraday decline, with a 24-hour trading volume of $392 million. The recent Dogecoin rally in November can largely be due to Elon Musk’s ongoing endorsements and the buzz around its potential integration into payment systems like X. Additionally, under the upcoming Trump administration, Musk is also preparing to lead the new Department Of Government Efficiency, codenamed D.O.G.E. On the other hand, Dogecoin’s fundamentals aren’t exactly its strongest suit, as it lacks the broad utility that could sustain long-term value. Right now, Dogecoin is facing staunch resistance and a short-term downturn could be on the cards if it fails to maintain this momentum. Investors looking for future-proof projects should consider looking into undervalued projects with untapped potential, such as Elluminex, which is intrinsically more valuable, as it offers a real use case. Conclusion While Dogecoin’s recent price action might tempt investors, the sustainability of such investments remains questionable due to its speculative nature. Conversely, Elluminex represents a forward-thinking approach to DeFi, focusing on solving real-world problems with technology rather than relying solely on market sentiment.

While it is the second largest cryptocurrency in the world by market cap, it has underperformed its main rival, Bitcoin (BTC), over the course of the current bull run, by a pretty significant margin. Compared to prices this time last year, the price of Bitcoin increased by 149.71% — in contrast, ETH has seen a much smaller 38.88% surge in the same timeframe. Since the beginning of the year, BTC has surged by 7.95% — while Ethereum has rallied by a meager 0.22%. At press time, ETH was changing hands at a price of $3,426. BTC and ETH price 1-year charts. Source: Finbold In addition, investors are increasingly turning to altcoins and even meme coins — on account of the impressive returns these two types of digital assets have provided. All in all, Ethereum doesn’t seem to inspire much confidence at the moment. However, as dire as the circumstances might appear at first glance, some analysts believe that this merely means that ETH is undervalued. Over the past couple of days, two noted crypto researchers have turned to technical analysis — and their findings suggest that Ethereum might be preparing for a significant move to the upside. Prominent on-chain analysts believe Ethereum could double or almost triple in price Renowned cryptocurrency technical analyst Ali Martinez took to social media platform X — sharing a chart depicting an inverse head and shoulders pattern in a January 17 post . The inverse head and shoulders is a bullish reversal pattern — in simple terms, it signals the end of a downtrend. ETH inverse head and shoulders chart pattern. Source: Ali Martinez on X In the case of this pattern, resistance is plotted using the two ‘shoulders’, which represent a price point of approximately $4,000 in this instance. With a head and shoulder pattern, the distance between resistance and the lowest point of the ‘head’ is added to that level to provide a price target. Per Matinez’’s chart, the price of Ethereum could surge to as high as $6,750 — a mark equating to a 97.02% upside. Martinez isn’t the only technical analyst bullish on ETH — pseudonymous crypto researcher TradingShot set an even more ambitious $10,000 price target in a TradingView post published on January 17.

Going forward, he believes that the 50-week moving average, plotted as the red line in the chart above, will continue to act as a support level. As bullish as both of these cases are, readers should note that technical analysis, on its own, doesn’t provide a holistic view of future prospects — while indeed possible, neither Martinez’s nor TradingShot ’s conclusions are guaranteed to come to fruition.

With altcoins like PCHAIN on the horizon, more attention has been focused on its AI integration and how its real-world applications are more profitable for both small-scale and large-scale against the next bull run. In this article, we look at how the Dogecoin price would progress as it faces correction risks and how PCHAIN continues to garner more attention with its token presale as it prepares for launch. Will the Correction Risk Continue to Affect the Dogecoin Price? It is no longer news that the Dogecoin price has been trending downward and that the correction risk has impacted its future growth trajectory. Despite its popularity, expert crypto analysts believe that the Dogecoin price will likely face more market corrections due to its reliance on speculative trading and meme-centric appeal. Unlike emerging AI altcoins, which are taking revolutionary approaches to tackling major loopholes in the blockchain sector, Dogecoin, PEPE, and Shiba Inu might keep downscaling, regardless of how massive their community adoption is. What the AI Features PCHAIN Brings As it Continues to Gain the Upperhand with a 43,029% Prediction? Unlike the Dogecoin price, PCHAIN has continued to garner more attention from investors. Its token presale sells at $0.01 to early adopters willing to place a safe bet on his growth trajectory. With its focus on eradicating primitive real estate transaction processes, below is a more detailed explanation of its AI features and how they impact its price as it gains the upper hand with a 43,029% prediction. Smart Contract Architecture: This is an AI feature that automates and manages real estate transactions on a secure blockchain network, including Titles, Deeds, Agreements, Payments, and Escrow Contracts. For users trying to auto-lease and auto-renew their rental properties, its payment contract manages payment requests using its SPV authentication algorithm while storing digital signatures through its E-signature contracts within the platform. Advanced AI Technologies: PropiChain advanced AI technologies offer provisional support and guidance to users as they navigate its platform, offering predictive market analysis that gives real-time evaluation of market trends and identification of emerging patterns. Its AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistance also help users with their queries, filtering and sorting out real estate assets based on price, location, and type. Metaverse Capabilities: Its metaverse capabilities allow international investors to explore and experiment with different layouts and designs of properties remotely in an immersive 3D virtual environment. It also allows investors to actively participate through tours, staging, and meetings, which ensures all parties can stay engaged and responsive, regardless of their physical location. Conclusion While the Dogecoin price faces the risk of corrections, PCHAIN stands out as a technologically advanced and innovative alternative. With its token presale still selling at $0.01, investors can diversify their portfolio by accumulating more tokens before it launches. Having already raised close to three million in his presale, investors can position themselves with as little as $1,000 and up to $100,000 to earn massive rewards of over 12,000x as it continues to gain upper with a 43,029% prediction. Its listing on CoinMarketCap and BlockAudit review is another testament to its growing prominence, indicating a solid sign of the project's potential and the exciting developments ahead. All analysts concurred that PCHAIN is on its way to disrupting the Real Estate market, potentially mirroring the 2021 Solana bull run, so investing early is bound to yield massive returns!

With altcoins such as PCHAIN emerging, there's a growing focus on its AI capabilities and how its practical applications promise better profitability for both small and large investors in the upcoming bull market. In this article, we explore how Dogecoin's price might evolve amid correction risks and how PCHAIN is capturing more attention through its token presale as it gears up for its official launch. Is Dogecoin's Price Still Under Threat from Correction Risks? It's well-known that Dogecoin's price has been on a downward trend, with correction risks affecting its potential for future growth. Despite its widespread popularity, expert analysts in the crypto field suggest that Dogecoin's price may face further market corrections due to its dependence on speculative trading and its meme-based appeal. In contrast to rising AI altcoins, which are taking innovative steps to address major issues in the blockchain space, Dogecoin, along with PEPE and Shiba Inu, might continue to struggle, even with a large community backing. How Does PCHAIN's AI Give It an Edge with a 43,029% Prediction? Unlike Dogecoin, PCHAIN has been steadily drawing more investor interest. Its token presale is available at $0.01, attracting early adopters keen on betting safely on its growth potential. Focusing on transforming outdated real estate transaction methods, here's a closer look at PCHAIN's AI features and their impact on its projected 43,029% increase. Smart Contract Architecture: This AI feature automates and manages real estate transactions on a secure blockchain network, handling Titles, Deeds, Agreements, Payments, and Escrow Contracts. For users looking to automate leasing and renewals of rental properties, its payment contract processes payment requests using an SPV authentication algorithm, while storing digital signatures through E-signature contracts on the platform.

Metaverse Capabilities: Its metaverse features enable international investors to explore and experiment with various property layouts and designs remotely in an immersive 3D virtual environment. It also facilitates investor engagement through virtual tours, staging, and meetings, ensuring all parties remain interactive and responsive, regardless of their physical location. In Summary While Dogecoin's price is prone to corrections, PCHAIN emerges as a technologically advanced and innovative option. With its token presale still priced at $0.01, investors have the opportunity to diversify their portfolios by accumulating tokens before its launch. Having already secured nearly three million in its presale, investors can invest between $1,000 and $100,000 to potentially gain significant rewards of over 12,000x, as it moves forward with a 43,029% prediction. Its presence on CoinMarketCap and the BlockAudit review further highlights its growing importance, signaling promising prospects for the project. Analysts agree PCHAIN is poised to disrupt the real estate market, potentially matching the Solana bull run of 2021, making early investment likely to yield substantial returns!

And it happened just three days before Trump’s inauguration in Washington, where China’s Vice President Han Zheng is set to attend the ceremony. TikTok ban and Fentanyl crisis dominate the discussion Per a report by CNBC, Trump’s transition team has actually been in contact with Beijing for weeks. The president wasted no time detailing the call on Truth Social, calling it “a very good one for both China and the U.S.A.” He added that: “I just spoke to Chairman Xi Jinping of China. The call was a very good one for both China and the U.S.A. It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately. We discussed balancing Trade, Fentanyl, TikTok, and many other subjects. President Xi and I will do everything possible to make the World more peaceful and safe!” Trump and Xi talked about TikTok, the social media platform that’s become a flashpoint in U.S.-China relations. Their conversation comes as the Supreme Court is uphelding a federal law banning TikTok in the United States. The law takes effect on Sunday, leaving little time for negotiation. Trump had previously credited TikTok with helping his campaign strategy. Now, he can either enforce the ban or rethink it entirely. On fentanyl, the stakes are equally high. The U.S. has long pressed China to crack down on the export of fentanyl and its precursors, which have fueled a deadly crisis in American communities. Trump signaled urgency, saying solutions need to start “immediately.” The two men also talked about trade imbalances and tariffs, though details of that remain unshared. EU-China tensions and Trump’s trade warnings Meanwhile, the European Union is considering dropping a trade investigation into China over alleged coercive actions against Lithuania. Lithuania angered Beijing by allowing Taiwan to open a representative office in its capital, prompting China to impose trade restrictions. The EU took the matter to the World Trade Organization in 2022, backed by the U.S. and 17 other countries. But now there’s talk of backing down, which has infuriated Washington. Trump’s team views this as a capitulation to China, with one insider saying it “reinforces the need for stronger transatlantic coordination.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",Economy|TikTok,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-17 15:55:38

At this point, Fundstrat Head of Digital Asset Strategy Sean Farrell announced that he set the Bitcoin price target for the end of 2025 as $175,000. In a recent interview, he said that the rise in BTC will continue and that this year is far from being a repeat of last year. “I think Bitcoin will reach $175,000 this year. My target is not just speculation; it is supported by a good and rigorous macro model that looks at inflows to the Bitcoin network and historical trends.” Farrell added that the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets are extremely sensitive to macroeconomic conditions. Despite the macroeconomic challenges, the analyst believes that the market will inject ample liquidity in 2025 and pointed to several catalysts that will make this happen. “We are at a point where the market is very concerned about trade policy and other macro factors, but I see it as a sell the rumor, buy the news type of situation. Regulatory changes under President Donald Trump will provide tailwinds for BTC and cryptocurrencies.” Farrell is known for his successful predictions. In early 2023, the analyst boldly predicted that Bitcoin would climb to $44,000 while it was hovering around $22,000. This prediction was a level that Bitcoin reached by the end of the year. Again in 2024, he predicted $115,000 for Bitcoin, and the price surpassed $108,000. Now, Farrell is focused on 2025 with an ambitious prediction, aiming for Bitcoin to reach $175,000. *This is not investment advice.

An early Pepe (PEPE) investor, who achieved over 15,000% returns, is now shifting their focus to a new project with promising potential: Remittix.

As of January 16th, the token is priced around $0.000018, with a market cap nearing $7.64 billion. Technical analysis suggests a possible upward trend, with the formation of a falling wedge pattern indicating a likely bullish reversal. Additionally, the appearance of a cup and handle pattern suggests a potential price target of $0.000028, hinting at a possible 65% rise from its current price. Recent whale activity has been a driving force in Pepe's current trajectory. In the past 24 hours, large investors have purchased over 480 billion Pepe tokens, worth more than $8 million, which has contributed to the recent price increase.

The Supreme Court has upheld the law that will effectively ban TikTok on Sunday, January 19. This is set to happen a day before Trump takes office. The decision marks the end of TikTok’s months-long legal fight against a law that essentially forces the ByteDance-owned app to shut down unless it divests its U.S. operations. According to reports , as of Sunday, it will be illegal for app stores and internet hosting services to distribute the social network. TikTok has warned that the app will simply “go dark” on Sunday. However, it remains unclear what exactly will happen once the ban takes effect. Will TikTok shut itself off entirely in the United States? That’s not what users or experts had expected, but one report indicated it may do just that. Will the outgoing President Joe Biden’s administration provide direction? That does not sound likely. Will incoming President Trump intervene? If the list of expected attendees at his inauguration is any indication, it’s likely he’ll try. TikTok’s stay in the US comes to an end According to the Supreme Court ruling , “As of January 19, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act will make it unlawful for companies in the United States to provide services to distribute, maintain, or update the social media platform TikTok unless U. S. operation of the platform is severed from Chinese control.” The ruling adds that “We consider whether the Act, as applied to petitioners, violates the First Amendment.” Last April, President Biden signed a bipartisan bill that said TikTok must spin-off from its China-based parent company or shut down in the U.S. The ban means 170 million Americans could lose access to a platform they use to find entertainment, news, community, and even run a business. Justices said the government’s decision to single out TikTok was justified. They note the law’s focus on “a foreign adversary’s ability to leverage its control over the platform to collect vast amounts of personal data from 170 million U.S. users.” They argued that purpose “neither references the content of speech on TikTok nor reflects disagreement with the message such speech conveys.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",News|TikTok,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-17 16:03:52

Notably, despite the price struggling to gain footing amid a wider crypto market surge over the past few months, the largest memecoin demonstrated remarkable strength, surging roughly 23% in the past seven days. Analysts are now predicting an even bigger move for the crypto asset, which could catalyze a broader memecoin rally. On Thursday, analyst TraderRocko shared one of the most bullish predictions for Dogecoin , utilizing Fibonacci projections to forecast a 150% price surge. He emphasized that current price levels might never be revisited, urging the Dogecoin community to capitalize on the opportunity. “Last chance to buy $DOGE below $0.40… More than 60% chance it hits $1 by the end of Jan,” he tweeted. This sentiment was echoed by analysts BitNull and MickeyBullCrypto, who agreed with the projection while highlighting a bullish triangle pattern, suggesting that a breakout could soon propel the price to new highs. Meanwhile, popular analyst Trader Tandigrade highlighted momentum indicators like the Chande Momentum Oscillator and Relative Strength Index, which suggest significant upward potential. “Dogecoin is set to finish the final stage of the bull run. The Chande Momentum Oscillator (ChandeMO) indicates that $DOGE still has a LONG way to go to reach the top in this cycle. LONG = in north direction, which could happen super-fast,” he tweeted, projecting an ambitious target of $5. Historical comparisons further strengthen these bullish predictions. In a Jan. 15 tweet, Martinez pointed out that DOGE could replicate a 2021-style bullish surge, with several key factors aligning. “During the last bull cycle, DOGE began its second upward leg in the week of January 25, 2021, after a 56% price correction. Over the past few weeks, it has faced a 46% correction. If history repeats, the next rally could start as early as next week,” he stated . Notably, following the 2021 correction, DOGE experienced a substantial surge, suggesting that a similar move now could propel the price to around $4 from its current value. Adding to the bullish sentiment is the spike in whale activity. On Friday, crypto tracking platform Whale Alert reported a transfer of 400 million DOGE ($154 million) between unknown wallets, signaling potential whale accumulation. Moreover, on Thursday, Martinez highlighted that whales had purchased 200 million DOGE in under 48 hours, contributing to the 470 million DOGE accumulated earlier in the week. Beyond speculation, optimism is fueled by expectations of an improved crypto landscape in the U.S. following Donald Trump’s inauguration , alongside rumors of Tesla accepting DOGE as payment and its potential integration into Elon Musk’s X Money platform. These developments point to increased mainstream adoption and the emergence of real-world use cases for the token. At press time, DOGE was trading at $0.4119, reflecting a 9.38% surge in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|Doge|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-17 16:06:58

According to Dan from The Chart Guys, Bitcoin’s sharp recovery is signaling bullish momentum as it tests key resistance levels. Bitcoin briefly dipped under $90,000 on Monday, but two days later, it is trading around $100,000, showing impressive resilience. In an interview with Scott Melker , Dan said that Bitcoin’s failure to remain below the $92,000-$90,000 range is an encouraging sign. “Whenever Bitcoin keeps breaking a level with no follow-through, it often forms a wedge pattern, which could lead to an eventual breakout,” he explained. Currently, Bitcoin is in a crucial phase where it needs to confirm an uptrend by establishing a higher low. Dan suggests that if Bitcoin pulls back, the best case scenario would be finding support above $95,000 before pushing higher to break through the $101,000 resistance. The overall goal for the bulls is to build support levels to solidify Bitcoin’s upward momentum and avoid retracing too much of its recent gains. Dan believes that if Bitcoin confirms a “bull flag,” it could continue to climb toward new highs. However, Bitcoin’s performance isn’t the only story. Altcoins are seeing some excitement too, with XRP showing strong bullish potential. XRP recently bounced from a critical support level and is forming a weekly bull flag. While Bitcoin continues to dominate, altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin in the short term, and the drop in Bitcoin’s dominance is a sign of growing risk appetite in the broader crypto market. Looking ahead, Dan warned that news events could affect market sentiment. The inauguration of the new administration could introduce volatility, and traders should be prepared for potential price swings. If Bitcoin surges rapidly in the days leading up to the event, a “sell the news” scenario could play out, where the price might retrace after initial bullish gains.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-17 16:08:54

39103251,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/wyoming-introduces-bitcoin-strategic-reserve-bill-,1737134755,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/6/39103251.jpeg,Wyoming Introduces Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Bill,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/wyoming-introduces-bitcoin-strategic-reserve-bill-,"Looking to cement Wyoming’s position at the forefront of Bitcoin innovation, freshman Representative Jacob Wasserburger ( @jacob4wyoming ) has introduced the "" State Funds-Investment in Bitcoin Act "" (HB0201), a bill aimed at creating a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve for the state. Following the footsteps of groundbreaking Bitcoin legislation previously passed in Wyoming, this bill seeks to secure the state’s financial future while paving the way for broader national adoption. Wyoming: A Tradition of Innovation “Wyoming has always been a pioneer—from women’s suffrage, to the first national park; from the invention of the LLC, to the frontier of digital assets,” Wasserburger remarked when introducing the bill. “HB0201 ensures that Wyoming remains the leading state for legislative innovation in Bitcoin, while providing our citizens with the long-term benefits of sound money and financial sovereignty.” HB0201 would allow the allocation of a portion of Wyoming’s state funds into Bitcoin as part of a diversified investment strategy. By doing so, the state aims to capitalize on Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation potential while promoting its principles of decentralization and monetary resilience. The initiative aligns with Wyoming’s established reputation as the most Bitcoin-friendly jurisdiction in the United States, a legacy cultivated by laws such as the Wyoming Special Purpose Depository Institution (SPDI) framework, and includes more than two dozen other laws and regulations passed or promulgated since 2018. National Collaboration: Supporting Senator Lummis and President-elect Trump Representative Wasserburger’s ambitions extend beyond Wyoming. The freshman legislator emphasized the importance of supporting efforts by Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis and President-elect Donald Trump to establish a United States Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. “As a proud supporter of Senator Lummis and President-elect Trump’s efforts, I believe Wyoming can play a vital role in this national initiative,” Wasserburger stated. “Building a strategic Bitcoin reserve isn’t just about securing financial strength—it’s about ensuring that both Wyoming and America remain leaders on the global stage.” This collaboration underscores the growing recognition of Bitcoin as a geopolitical asset. Advocates argue that holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset could hedge against inflation, protect against economic instability, and strengthen the United States’ position in an increasingly digital global economy. The Economic Case for a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve At the heart of HB0201 lies an economic argument as compelling as it is revolutionary. Bitcoin, often described as “digital gold,” has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth over the past decade. For Wyoming, a state that has consistently championed financial independence and innovation, the potential upside of Bitcoin aligns with its long-term vision. “We can’t afford to sit on the sidelines while other states, like Texas , Pennsylvania , North Dakota , New Hampshire and others move forward with their own Bitcoin reserve bills,” said Wasserburger. “Passing HB0201 quickly ensures that Wyoming remains the leader among the states, setting the standard for financial innovation and sovereignty. With many other states likely to follow suit, now is the time to solidify our position as the trailblazer in the digital economy and ensure Wyoming stays ahead of the pack.” “Wyoming’s economic future depends on embracing innovation while staying true to our principles of individual liberty and financial independence,” said Wasserburger. “Investing in Bitcoin is not just smart policy—it’s Wyoming’s way of saying we’re ready for the future.” In a time when states are grappling with economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures, Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature offer a stark contrast to traditional financial systems. By adopting HB0201, Wyoming positions itself as a leader not just in Bitcoin regulation, but in integrating Bitcoin into the financial apparatus of state governance.

Could SOL be the top cryptocurrency to purchase right now? At the time of writing, $SOL is trading at $217, slightly below Friday's peak of $220. The upward momentum in SOL's price is largely due to the positive effects of Donald Trump’s victory, as the President-elect is reportedly considering an America-first crypto reserve that would include tokens like Solana and XRP. $SOL / $USD - Update Reclaimed $208 i am back long pic.twitter.com/34VgBkoQjX — Crypto Tony (@CryptoTony__) January 17, 2025 SOL's bullish run has sparked a growing interest in Solana beta projects like Solaxy (SOLX) , which is the first major Solana Layer-2 token. The presale for SOLX has already amassed nearly $11 million, with early investors anticipating potential returns of up to 10x. Could Solana Become a US Reserve Asset? According to the New York Post , Donald Trump is contemplating an executive order to establish an America-first crypto reserve, incorporating assets like XRP and Solana. If the United States decides to recognize Solana as a reserve asset and begins accumulating it, SOL's price could easily exceed the $1000 target set by bullish investors for 2025. Its price trajectory could align with analyst Ali Martinez 's forecast, which suggests SOL might reach $4000 in the coming years after breaking out of a cup-and-handle pattern. However, the likelihood of a Solana reserve remains low. It is uncertain if Donald Trump could establish a crypto reserve solely through an executive order, without legislative backing from the US Congress. Experts also question the feasibility of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Nonetheless, Solana has several bullish narratives that could drive its growth. For example, the chances of a spot SOL ETF are promising, especially with pro-crypto Paul Atkins expected to lead the SEC. Moreover, Solana's inflation reduction proposal might be implemented next week, which bulls believe could transform it into ""ultrasound money."" Not surprisingly, leading traders like Unipcs, known as the Bonk Guy, are confident that SOL reaching $1000 is ""inevitable."" Is It Too Late to Invest in Solana? Investors who have been waiting on the sidelines still have time to buy SOL, despite its recent rise to $220. Having broken out of its recent downtrend and regained crucial monthly and weekly support levels, analyst Jelle predicts a bullish continuation for Solana, with a target of $330. $SOL broke out from the downtrend, and reclaimed the monthly & weekly support level!Super clean price action - ready for higher.First target: $330. Send it. pic.twitter.com/84lmNTYmOY — Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) January 17, 2025 Another well-known trader, Greeny , is even more optimistic and anticipates SOL will rally to its 1.618 Fibonacci level, currently at $416. With Donald Trump’s backing, it presents an appealing long-term investment for spot holders, potentially reaching between $600 and $1000 by 2025. Best Crypto to Buy Now? Solana's bullish momentum has sparked a demand for coins with high upside potential within the SOL ecosystem. So, what's the best cryptocurrency to invest in right now on Solana? One example is meme coins like Popcat and Dogwifhat, which are set for a significant breakout. However, new Solana ICOs might offer even greater potential, as both meme coins have already achieved valuations in the billions—POPCAT has since fallen to $700 million. Solaxy (SOLX) has generated considerable interest during its presale, raising nearly $11 million, with some key opinion leaders (KOLs) labeling it as the best crypto to buy now, fueled by the Solana reserve news. Solana's blockchain is gearing up for a potential ""altseason"" and could see a surge in activity in 2025, especially during the upcoming meme coin supercycle. However, the network has faced challenges such as transaction failures, downtime, and delays during heavy congestion. At one point during 2024's meme coin mania, nearly 75% of non-vote SOL transactions were failing. Solaxy's rollup architecture could be revolutionary—it will batch SOL transactions, execute them off-chain, and update the mainnet, ensuring zero downtime, exponential scalability, and fast, affordable transactions on both chains. Given that SOLX remains a low-cap token despite Solaxy's ambitious plans, it's no wonder that savvy investors are optimistic about its potential, with many expecting returns of up to 10x. Early SOLX investors are already reaping the rewards of its native staking pool, which currently offers a stunning reward rate of over 300% per annum, making it one of the best cryptos to buy now for stakers.

The New York Post reported Donald Trump is mulling signing an executive order for the creation of an America-first crypto reserve, which will feature assets like XRP and Solana. If the United States does declare Solana a reserve asset and starts stockpiling it, the SOL price would easily surpass the $1000 price target the bulls have set for 2025. Its price action would then resemble analyst Ali Martinez ’s projection, who reveals SOL could hit $4000 in the coming years after breaking out of a cup-and-handle pattern. However, the odds do not favour the possibility of a Solana reserve. It is unclear whether Donald Trump could create a crypto reserve with just an executive order, without the support of the US Congress. Experts are even dubious about the possibility of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Nevertheless, Solana has plenty of bullish narratives to rally on. For instance, the odds of a spot SOL ETF are high, with pro-crypto Paul Atkins set to become the SEC chair.

With Donald Trump’s support, it is also an attractive long-term investment for spot holders and could hit anywhere between $600 and $1000 in 2025. Best Crypto to Buy Now? Solana’s bull rally has prompted a strong demand for high-upside coins in the SOL ecosystem. With that in mind, what’s the best crypto to buy now on Solana? For instance, meme coins like Popcat and Dogwifhat are poised for a bullish breakout - although new Solana ICOs may have even higher upside as those two Solana meme coins already have or had a valuation in the billions - POPCAT has since dropped to $700 million. Solaxy (SOLX) has attracted significant interest during its presale and has already raised nearly $11 million, with some KOLs calling it as the best crypto to buy now on the back of the Solana reserve news. Solana’s blockchain is gearing up for a massive “altseason” and could experience significant traffic in 2025, particularly during the upcoming meme coin supercycle. However, the network has struggled with failed transactions, downtime and delays during periods of heavy congestion. For instance, nearly 75% of non-vote SOL transactions were failing at one point during 2024’s meme coin mania. Now, Solaxy’s rollup architecture could be a game-changer — it will bundle SOL transactions into batches, execute them off-chain and publish the state chain back on the mainnet, resulting in zero downtime, exponential scalability and fast and cheap transactions on both chains. Considering SOLX is still a low-cap token despite Solaxy’s ambitious goals, it is no surprise that smart money investors are bullish on its upside potential, with many eyeing up to 10x returns from it. Early SOLX buyers are already benefitting from its native staking pool, which is currently offering a reward rate of over 300% per annum, ranking it among the best cryptos to buy now for stakers.

By 2028, the price is projected to reach $25.92. By 2031, FIL may reach $42.32. Filecoin is a decentralized storage network designed to securely and efficiently store humanity’s most important information. Launched by Protocol Labs in October 2020, it utilizes blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer digital storage marketplace. Users can rent unused hard drive space to earn Filecoin tokens (FIL), the network’s native cryptocurrency. The system operates on a proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime consensus mechanism, ensuring that data is reliably stored over time and that storage providers hold the exact copies they claim. This approach incentivizes a robust and distributed network of storage providers, enhancing data retrieval speeds and security compared to traditional centralized servers. Filecoin aims to reduce the costs of storage services by leveraging the global surplus of storage capacity. As part of the broader Web3 ecosystem, it supports decentralized applications (dApps) and services requiring secure, decentralized data storage solutions, significantly advancing decentralized internet infrastructure.

Filecoin’s historic price sentiment Filecoin price history | Coinmarketcap Filecoin (FIL) started trading in December 2017, a short period after conducting its ICO. Trading started long before the Filecoin mainnet was released. Between December 2017 and May 2020, FIL traded below $30. Then, starting mid-May, the Filecoin price started rising, and the bull trend continued until 01st April 2021, when it hit its highest price of $237.24. After hitting its all-time high in mid-May 2021, Filecoin took a bearish turn, which continued until mid-July when the market turned bullish again. Filecoin (FIL) experienced notable price fluctuations between 2022 and 2023. Starting 2022 at a higher value, FIL’s price declined amidst the broader crypto market downturn. The price fluctuated throughout 2022, influenced by market sentiment, technological developments, and broader economic conditions. Entering 2023, Filecoin (FIL) exhibited a dynamic price trajectory. The year commenced with FIL at $3 in January, experiencing a gradual ascent amid market fluctuations. By mid-year, it surged slightly to $4.32. Filecoin (FIL) started 2024 at $7.65 but saw a steady decline throughout the year, dropping to lows of $3.57 by August and $3.3743 by November. Despite the prolonged decline, FIL showed a brief spike, trading at $8.03 on December 5. As of January 2025, FIL is trading between $4.9 and $5.6",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|FIL|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-17 17:39:39

The efforts have resulted in a surge in funding rates that have spiked to the highest levels in the last twelve months. The Chinese Central Bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), has increased its efforts to curb the rising dollar’s strength against the local currency, which is causing a cash squeeze in the Asian country. The liquidity squeeze has worsened over time, causing a short-term funding rate to surge to its highest level in the last twelve months. China faces a funding squeeze as the government struggles to stabilize the yuan China facing a liquidity crunch as it attempts to defend its currency against a stronger dollar. The cost of borrowing cash through a 7-day interbank repo rate soared to its highest level since October 2023! pic.twitter.com/LzVspGlSj8 — Barchart (@Barchart) January 17, 2025 According to data from Barchart, a financial markets trading and investing tool provider, China is facing a liquidity crunch. The data shows that the cost of borrowing cash through a popular institution funding tool called the seven-day interbank pledged repurchase contracts spiked to its highest level since October 2023. The spread between the central bank’s own reverse repo reference rate and the rate has widened significantly marking the widest point in the last four years. The funding squeeze is a clear indication that the Chinese government is making frantic efforts to stimulate its economy and stabilize its local currency. Last September, the Chinese government unveiled a series of monetary policies aimed at boosting the economy. The monetary stimulus appears to be pushing back against the Chinese currency’s slide which has been fueled by declining yields. The Chinese government pushed more measures this week in solidarity with the yuan including verbal promises to crack down on market disruption and making changes to its capital controls. Last week, the Chinese central bank unexpectedly halted its purchases of government bonds, in a bid to control the ongoing debt-buying frenzy. Zhou Guannan, an analyst at Huachuang Securities commented on the situation saying that the People’s Bank of China is carefully managing the pace of liquidity provision now that currency stability has become a priority. The analyst expressed her uncertainties about how the PBOC will handle the liquidity crisis as the Lunar New Year holidays approach. She estimated that the gap is worth around 1.5 trillion yuan which is about $205 billion at current exchange rates. The U.S. dollar strengthenes against the yuan amid projections of a booming U.S. economy The strengthening dollar has brought the yuan to its knees as many anticipate strong economic data and expectations of inflation policies from the incoming Trump administration. Trump has continuously pledged to hit China with increased tariffs. According to CNBC , the tariff threats have fueled frontloading of trade shipments into the U.S., led by China. Seasonal flows are catalyzing the liquidity squeeze. The demand for cash tends to increase ahead of the week-long holiday, which this year begins on Jan. 28. The Chinese people typically prefer having more cash withdrawing from banks to prepare for spending and traditional gift-giving. Maturities from a PBOC lending facility and tax payments also cause cash outflows from the banking system. Market participants are closely monitoring how far the Central Bank of China will stomach a spike in borrowing costs. This may weigh on corporate debt issuers and banks at a time when cheap funding is required to sustain China’s delicate economic growth. According to a statement by PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng at a forum this week China is expected to utilize its monetary adjustment tools such as interest rates and reserve requirement ratios to maintain ample liquidity in the market. Wee Khoon Chong, a senior market strategist at BNY said the central bank is likely to step up liquidity through a 14-day reverse repo into the festive period. He explained that the central bank is likely to deliver more stimulus via cuts to interest rates or reserve requirement ratios sometime this year. The overnight repo rate has also inflated recently, hitting its highest point since August last year.

Amid this market recovery, ADA, the native token of the Cardano blockchain, has broken out from a bullish price action pattern and is poised for massive upside momentum. ADA Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, ADA appears bullish, as it has broken out from a bullish inverted head-and-shoulders price action pattern on the daily time frame. Following this breakout, the altcoin has cleared its path for a massive rally. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price action and historical momentum, if ADA holds above the $1.15 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 42% to reach the $1.63 mark in the future. However, the current market sentiment and Trump’s inauguration suggest that SOL could easily achieve this predicted target. On the positive side, with ADA’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 63, technical analysis indicates that the altcoin has enough room to soar significantly. Traders’ and Investors’ Rising Interest Besides this bullish outlook, the interest from traders and investors appears optimistic, as they consistently maintain a bullish stance, according to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . At press time, the ADA Long/Short ratio stands at 1.10, indicating strong bullish sentiment among traders. Data further reveals that 53% of top ADA traders currently hold long positions, while 47% hold short positions. This bullishness follows ADA’s breakout from a head-and-shoulders price action pattern.

According to recent data, whales accumulated a significant 100 million ADA tokens on January 15, 2025, and later 30 million ADA tokens on January 16, 2025. This substantial accumulation by whales and long-term holders suggests that the bull run has officially begun and indicates an ideal buying opportunity.

The investors and the analysts are keenly observing this interaction between these two top altcoins by means of reviewing how the possible spikes in the price of XRP can affect other cryptos including Solana. XRP continues to gain attention due to expectations of its new market capitalization achieving even $20 trillion. This prediction has drawn focus despite XRP is currently circulating at a market value, slightly over $187.16 billion. As it is being written down, the price for XRP is $3.23 and in the last 24 hours, it has risen up to 5%. As if to guess how much XRP needs to increase its price to reach $20 trillion, it would need an almost unimaginable rally in the region of over 10,000% and no change in the number of tokens in circulation. How XRP’s $20T Market Cap Rise Could Shape Solana Price Future If XRP achieves a $20 trillion market cap, its price could soar to over $3 per token. This dramatic growth would likely have far-reaching effects on other top altcoins, including Solana. Investors are particularly curious about how Solana’s price might respond to such a monumental shift in the crypto landscape. For a token of such relatively recent inception, as it was launched in Q2 2020, Solana has quickly climbed the ranks of prominent altcoins. Well regarded by its proof-of-history consensus algorithm, Solana provides fast transactions and decentralized finance (DeFi) services. It has been recognized in the blockhain sphere due to its technological benefits and the development of the associated environment. The changes of Solana have been observed to follow various levels of fluctuation of other assets. In the last 30 days, Solana had just a 2% negative correlation with XRP, and in previous months, the correlation reached 30%. Nevertheless, Solana’s link with Bitcoin and Ethereum is moderate, thus indicating its unique price trend. Solana Price Projection if XRP Hits $20 Trillion Currently, SOL price boasts a market cap of $7 billion and trades at around $220. If Solana mirrors XRP’s projected 10,000% rally to a $20 trillion market cap, its price could rise exponentially. This would position Solana as a significant player in the crypto market’s reshaping. A hypothetical 100000% increase will take Solana to a completely different level, well above its worth today. Although such a growth rate is projections, it shows that general market might benefit from XRP success as depicted below. Nevertheless, Solana’s foundation looks quite secure, so its capacity to increase by such a significant degree depends on several factors. Market sentiment Change in ecosystem adaptability and use in decentralized applications will be significant. Also, Solana’s pricing can be affected by competition with other Layer 1 blockchains that brew in the industry. But investors should be wary of these forecast and keep in mind they mostly are speculative in most cases. This is because the current state of the crypto market, market cap fluctuations, and their relations make it difficult to know whether the increase in an asset such as XRP to a $20 trillion market cap will carry along Solana and other assets. Source- CoinMarketCap In conclusion it is feasible that Solana price could see a lot of value additions in case of achieving XRP’s lofty goal. However, the following is important to note that the achievement of this particular result is subjected to certain constraints for instance; market conditions and the competent Solana in the ability to expand its market share.

In a recent statement, he offered a step-by-step guide to managing market volatility and making informed investment decisions. However, of course, it is important to remember that everyone should do their own research and that they can lose their entire investment in the high-risk cryptocurrency environment. “When a bullish wave occurs in the market, especially in altcoins, it usually happens gradually,” il Capo explained, adding: “While certain coins in an ecosystem may be rising aggressively, others may be trending sideways or even retreating. This often leads to FOMO, with investors rushing to move funds into coins that are already rising, only to see the coins they sold start to rise. It’s a frustrating but familiar scenario.” Related News: Bitcoin Price Soars Again: What's Driving the Rise? What Do Analysts Think? To counteract this emotional response, il Capo said it’s important to have a well-thought-out strategy. The key, he says, is to build a diversified portfolio that fits one’s capital, risk tolerance, and market understanding: “The best approach is to build a solid portfolio that includes a mix of large-caps, mid-caps, and micro-caps from different ecosystems. While it’s good to set aside some for trading, the foundation should be a strong holding portfolio that you maintain for most of the alt season. The focus should be on timing when to take profits.” Il Capo also warned against over-diversification and over-trading, urging investors to focus on strong, calculated investments rather than trying to follow every market narrative: “There are many coins, many trends, and many movements, but you can’t catch them all.

In a new letter to FDIC chair Marty Gruenberg, Lummis says whistleblowers claim that the deposit insurer is destroying materials linked to its digital asset activities. Lummis says the whistleblowers allege that FDIC officials are closely monitoring access to the materials so these do not reach the Senate. They also accuse the management of threatening some staff with legal action to prevent them from speaking out. The letter tells Gruenberg and his staff to immediately cease and desist from destroying the materials and to end retaliatory actions. “You are further directed to preserve all existing materials, including documents, communications, electronic information and metadata, relating to the FDIC’s digital asset activities since January 1, 2022 that may be responsive to the Senate Banking Committee’s oversight prerogatives in the coming months.” The senator says the FDIC’s alleged efforts to destroy and conceal materials related to Operation Chokepoint 2.0 are unacceptable and illegal. “If it is uncovered that anyone within the FDIC has knowingly destroyed materials or sought to obstruct the oversight functions of the Senate, it will result in swift criminal referrals to the U.S. Department of Justice.

With his return to the presidency, Donald Trump has positioned himself as a key figure in the Bitcoin conversation. His keynote at Bitcoin 2024 laid out ambitious plans for integrating Bitcoin into the U.S. economy, making him the first U.S. president to openly champion the cryptocurrency in such a way. As his second term begins, the Bitcoin community is eager to see how his promises will evolve into concrete policies, with hopes of a friendlier regulatory environment and a more secure, innovative financial system. The Promises Trump’s speech at Bitcoin 2024 highlighted a series of initiatives aimed at embracing Bitcoin and blockchain technology: Ending the “anti-crypto stance” from previous administrations, with a commitment to revising the approach to regulation. Establishing a Presidential Crypto Advisory Council to shape the national strategy for Bitcoin and blockchain innovation. Rejecting the idea of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Securing and holding government-owned bitcoin, with plans to create a strategic stockpile. Freeing Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road online marketplace, who has been imprisoned since 2013. The removal of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. While Trump’s commitment to Bitcoin is undeniably encouraging for the community, translating ambitious promises into effective policy presents a challenging path forward. His call for removing SEC Chairman Gary Gensler resonated with Bitcoin advocates, many of whom blamed Gensler for restrictive policies. Although it’s unclear if Trump’s influence played a role, Gensler’s announcement of his November departure signals a changing regulatory tide. Trump’s proposal to establish a Crypto Advisory Council holds potential, but its success will depend on bipartisan cooperation and a clear, actionable mandate. Without these elements, it risks becoming a hollow political gesture. Additionally, his opposition to a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) aligns well with privacy advocates and decentralization proponents, and there does seem to be support from within the Republican party for this policy. In regards to Ross Ulbricht, President Trump has many avenues to explore, from a commuted sentence to a presidential pardon. Whether it happens “day one” or within the early days of Trump’s second term, Ulbricht’s freedom is on the horizon . As with any sweeping political vision, enthusiasm must be tempered with pragmatism. Turning promises into actionable policies takes time, especially within the labyrinth of established financial systems. Regulatory reforms move slowly, often hindered by entrenched interests and complex legislative processes. Nonetheless, Trump’s vocal advocacy of Bitcoin marks a cultural shift in American politics. Even if not every initiative reaches full fruition, his presidency could significantly alter public perceptions and policy discourse surrounding Bitcoin, embedding the cryptocurrency deeper into the national conversation. Should political inertia or opposition delay progress, the Bitcoin community has tools to remain proactive and engaged. Active participation in shaping policy will be key—advocating for legislative clarity and innovation-friendly frameworks can help ensure Bitcoin’s potential is realized. Keeping a vigilant eye on regulatory shifts, including how Trump’s administration addresses existing SEC cases and cryptocurrency classifications, will also be crucial. Flexibility and readiness to accept incremental progress could yield meaningful wins, especially in resisting CBDCs and strengthening the government’s bitcoin holdings strategy. Ultimately, Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance represents a historic pivot toward integrating Bitcoin into U.S. governance. While challenges and delays are inevitable, the presence of a Bitcoin advocate in the White House offers unprecedented opportunities. The next few years will test whether America can truly become a beacon for Bitcoin innovation or whether political realities will slow the revolution. Either way, Bitcoin now has a powerful ally at the highest level of government—a hopeful signal for its future trajectory in the United States and beyond. This article is a Take .

The company intends to raise the number of its Class A common shares from 330 million to 10.3 billion. The proposal, which is expected to be put to a vote of shareholders on January 21st, could give MicroStrategy a new method of financing its BTC strategy. . Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy To Authorize 10.3B Shares for BTC Plans Bloomberg has reported that MicroStrategy Inc. plans to boost the number of its Class A common shares from 330 million to 10.3 billion. This is in line with the-company’s strategy of using the funds to finance its ongoing Bitcoin purchase strategy. Michael Saylor, co-founder and chairman of MicroStrategy, holds 47% of the company’s voting power. This strong influence is expected to support the approval of the proposal at the up coming shareholders meeting. According to the experts, the decision will help MicroStrategy to increase the proceeds from the sale of its stock and support the company’s Bitcoin strategy. Earlier this week, MicroStrategy announced boosting its Bitcoin holdings with the acquisition of 2,530 BTC for $243 million. Consequently, this move increased its total holdings to 450,000 BTC. The company acquired Bitcoin at an average price of $95,972 per BTC. This purchase was funded using proceeds from its recent stock sales under a sales agreement, as disclosed in an SEC filing. What the Proposal Means For The Company If the proposal passes, MicroStrategy could rival major corporations such as Amazon and Alphabet in the volume of authorized shares. While Alphabet currently has 300 billion authorized shares, MicroStrategy’s proposed 10.3 billion shares would place it among the largest companies by authorized share count on the Nasdaq 100 Index. Despite concerns about shareholder dilution, analysts believe investors might remain supportive due to the company’s historic returns. Since adopting its Bitcoin strategy in 2020, MicroStrategy’s shares have surged over 2,500%, with BTC prices rising nearly 800% in the same period. According to reports, Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy purchased $22.07 billion worth of Bitcoin in 2024, acquiring 258,320 BTC at an average price of $85,450 per coin. The company recorded an impressive BTC yield of 74.3% during the year. Saylor highlighted that Bitcoin gains translated to $14.06 billion in shareholder value creation. Leveraging Shares to Strengthen Bitcoin Strategy MicroStrategy plans to utilize the additional shares for private transactions, at-the-market equity sales, and convertible note settlements. The company has already raised $21 billion through share issuances under its current plan, with $6.5 billion remaining for future funding. Saylor has stated that the company aims to “build more intelligent leverage” as part of its financing efforts. By increasing authorized shares, MicroStrategy could secure the flexibility needed to continue its Bitcoin purchasing strategy. The shareholder vote on January 21 will determine the approval of the amendments. Alongside increasing Class A common shares. More so, the company seeks to raise its authorized preferred stock from 5 million to 1 billion. Meanwhile, Bitcoin price has continued its bullish rally, surging 10% in the last 7 days and touching $105K. The cryptocurrency’s market cap has crossed $2.06 trillion, reflecting strong investor sentiment. Trading volume has also spiked by 20.44% to $65.9 billion, signaling increased market activity.

The sudden spike in activity follows a long trend of growing influence for the US markets, but also short-term enthusiasm ahead of Donald Trump’s second presidency. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) activity spiked during North American business hours. The most recent spike in activity reflects the enthusiasm for Donald Trump’s second presidency, which is expected to be favourable to crypto investors. While crypto is traded 24/7, the most active hours take cues from traditional stock exchange openings. Some researchers show most cryptocurrencies trade during the business hours of the biggest market centers around the world. The observation of more active US trading coincides with the patterns of FiatLeak, where the USA is the biggest buyer of BTC at almost all hours. Most of the BTC buying is in US dollars, with US-based traders leading the demand. | Source: Fiatleak Crypto markets remain dollarized for their intuitive pricing, with a few exceptions for the Euro and several national currencies. Near-peak M2 money supply is also boosting demand for speculative investments, choosing BTC and ETH for their relative liquidity. The two assets also have robust derivative markets, which also invite localized activity. The overlap of trading hours between Europe and the USA also translates into peak activity for BTC. The time for dramatic price moves roughly coincides with the opening hours of the London and New York stock exchanges. The shift to traditional opening hours is also an indicator of institutional activity, where BTC buying also happens through ETF. The dominance of US-based trading volumes precedes the trend of focusing on ‘Made in USA’ crypto, ranging from local startups to locally mined BTC. DEX activity preserves time zone correlation The activity for BTC and ETH was based on data from centralized exchanges. However, DEX also preserves the trend for higher US-based volumes, which was already visible last year. Solana is one indicator that the market is skewed toward US-based activity. Most of the trading days in 2024 showed a dominance of US volumes on Solana DEX. On the Solana chain, most days saw a predominance of US-based DEX volumes. | Source: Dune Analytics The Solana trend produced meme tokens from multiple regions. However, only a handful of days saw a spike in activity during Asian working hours. London time and EU trading may also shift toward US-based activity, to tap the growing liquidity. Solana DEX volumes on other markets were also significant, but US activity was always the largest on any given day. The English language meme culture and communities translated into a shift to US-based traders for Pump.fun and Raydium tokens. With a market as dynamic as Solana’s DEX, the availability of other traders is key. While DEX are open 24 hours, and some of the trades can be automated, still real traders kept to their local business hours. Another proxy for US-based activity is the fees on Ethereum. Gas prices immediately react to higher DEX usage, especially on the Uniswap universal router contract. US institutions boost demand The trading volumes of BTC and ETH also reflect the inflow of institutions. Another metric, Coinbase Prime’s activity, is one of the footprints of institutions. Significant inflows to Coinbase Prime indicate heightened OTC trading activity. This is the preferred $BTC accumulation method for US institutions. When the whales move, the market feels it. pic.twitter.com/5WCDHxMVhs — Grazi (@grazi) January 17, 2025 The OTC trading volumes are separate from the on-chain and open market activity. Coinbase’s metrics reflect the behavior of both retail and institutional investors. The centralized market, brokerage and custody are capable of serving whale-sized clients. With over 40% of crypto mining activity tied to US-based pools and physical data centers, OTC markets on Coinbase are one of the key venues for realizing profits. Coinbase has shown it has the capacity to absorb high-grade crypto trades. Recently, a whale deposited over $1B worth of BTC to one of the Coinbase addresses, with the potential to realize gains.

39104505,https://coingape.com/?p=234110,1737137324,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,What’s Behind the 883% Surge in Shiba Inu Outflows?,https://coingape.com/whats-behind-the-883-surge-in-shiba-inu-outflows/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen its outflows skyrocket by 883% within the past week. According to data from IntoTheBlock, the substantial increase in outflows occurred between January 15 and January 16, with large holder outflows rising from 647 billion SHIB to 1.11 trillion SHIB. This trend has sparked widespread curiosity about the driving factors behind this massive movement. Shiba Inu Outflows Surge Over 800% The over 883% increase in SHIB outflows seems to be related to trades due to profit taking and market adjustment by the big players. Some investors may have cashed out some of their SHIB tokens when its price dropped to $0.0000196 earlier this week. However, the situation became more interesting when the outflows spike at the same time as the price jump of almost 10% within one day. This means that while some investors were offloading their stakes, there was a great deal of buying interest in the market which soaked up the sell orders. This could be because retail investors or so called smaller whales have bought SHIB at cheaper prices and then the price went up. Shiba Inu Price Recovers with Increased Buying Activity While there were significant outflows, Shiba Inu has made an impressive price reversal. In the last day alone, SHIB has surged from $0.000022 to $0.0000246 on the daily chart which gives it a large green candlestick. SHIB price is up 8.78% in the last 24 hours and has risen by 14% in the past week, suggesting that the market has woken up again. Some of the other metrics like trading volume and volume of transactions by large shareholders have also gone up. This means that the buying pressure has either equaled or has been stronger than the selling pressure during this period. There has been continuous buying pressure for SHIB, meaning that the demand for the token has not waned even with the increase in outflows. On-Chain Data Suggests a Potential for Continued Growth According to on-chain data, large holder inflows, which concern the funds transferred to whale addresses, have increased by 177% over the past week. This trend suggests that some of the bigger wallets may still be buying SHIB. In addition, SHIB has been trading around the Fibonacci retrace level of 0.786, which is a big support zone for price bounce-back. If the price of Shiba Inu goes above the crucial level of $0.00003, market strategists believe that the cryptocurrency could experience an incoming spike. According to the analysts, the price of SHIB has been forming a symmetrical triangle pattern over the last six months. If the price will break this pattern, which is rather probable, a sharp price increase will follow. Analysts Predict a Bullish Run for Shiba Inu Some market analysts believe SHIB price could experience substantial gains soon. CryptoELITE, a market commentator, predicts an 850% price increase if the token breaks out of its current pattern. According to their analysis, SHIB could target a price of $0.00023 during its next major rally. Another expert, Alan Santana, has also set a price target of $0.00023 for SHIB, stating that the token is likely to achieve this level within the year. These optimistic projections are based on SHIB’s current price structure and strong market momentum. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu price is trading at $0.00002413, with bullish sentiment dominating the market.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $13.78. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $35.36 and $40.99, with an average value of $36.56. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, which contributes to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $1.93 Market Cap $2.6B Trading Volume $240.87M Circulating Supply 1.35B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24- High $1.96 24-h Low $1.82 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 15.30% 50-Day SMA $2.14 14-Day RSI 50.98 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 73(Greed) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $1.793089 Optimism price analysis: OP surges with strong momentum Key Takeaways: Optimism (OP) has gained 4.19% in the last 24 hours, reflecting bullish market sentiment. Support is firmly established at $1.82, while resistance stands at $1.96, signalling key price zones to monitor. A breakout above $1.96 could push OP to test the $2.00 level, but traders should watch for potential retracements. Optimism (OP) is trading at $1.93, reflecting a 4.19% increase in the past 24 hours, signaling bullish momentum. The chart shows steady upward price movement with intermittent consolidations, indicating growing investor confidence. The daily low was $1.82, while the high reached $1.96, confirming heightened market activity and a positive trend. A breakout above the current resistance level could accelerate further upward movement. Optimism 1-day price chart: OP shows signs of recovery amid neutral momentum The 1-day price chart for Optimism (OP) indicates a modest recovery, with the token trading at $1.93 after a 4.19% daily gain. The price is attempting to rebound from recent lows, as the chart shows a steady climb from the $1.82 region, signalling growing buying interest. However, OP remains in a broader consolidation phase, struggling to break through significant resistance levels near $2.00. A breakout above this key level could confirm a trend reversal, while failure may lead to a retest of lower support zones. OP shows signs of recovery amid neutral momentum The MACD histogram is hovering near the zero line, with the signal line slightly above the MACD line, indicating weak bullish momentum. The RSI stands at 51.57, just above the neutral 50 mark, suggesting the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. This balance highlights the need for sustained buying pressure to drive a clear directional move. Traders should watch for a potential RSI break above 50 or a more muscular MACD crossover to confirm further upward movement. Optimism 4-hour price chart: OP gains momentum on the chart, resistance looms at $2 The 4-hour Optimism (OP) chart shows a steady upward trajectory, with the token trading at $1.93, marking a 1.47% gain in the last session. This upward movement highlights sustained buying pressure as OP rebounds from recent lows near $1.82. The price has consistently made higher lows and is approaching the $1.96 resistance, a critical psychological level. A successful breakout above $2.00 could trigger further bullish momentum, while rejection may push the price back toward the $1.82 support zone. OP gains momentum on the chart, resistance looms at $2 The MACD displays a positive crossover, with the MACD line at 0.034 above the signal line at 0.025, strengthening upward momentum. Additionally, the RSI is at 64.98, trending in the bullish zone but not yet overbought, leaving room for further upside. These indicators point to growing buyer confidence, with a potential test of $2.00 likely in the near term. Traders should monitor the RSI for signs of overextension and watch the MACD for continuation signals. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 2.22 SELL SMA 5 $ 2.10 SELL SMA 10 $ 1.921 BUY SMA 21 $ 2.03 SELL SMA 50 $ 2.14 SELL SMA 100 $ 1.894 BUY SMA 200 $ 1.7930 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 2.01 BUY EMA 5 $ 2.12 SELL EMA 10 $ 2.25 SELL EMA 21 $ 2.30 SELL EMA 50 $ 2.15 SELL EMA 100 $ 1.984 BUY EMA 200 $ 1.975 BUY What to expect from Optimism Optimism (OP) is trading at $1.93, with a 4.19% daily increase, reflecting strong bullish sentiment. OP demonstrates heightened investor activity with a market cap of $2.6B and a 24-hour trading volume of $240.87M. Despite this growth, the token remains below its 50-day SMA of $2.14, indicating it is yet to regain key moving average levels. A breakout above the current resistance of $1.96 could push OP toward testing the psychological $2.00 level. However, traders should monitor volatility, which is currently at 15.30%, for sudden price swings. Is Optimism a good investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. Developer activity has surged by 45.6% over the past year, indicating strong ecosystem momentum. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up on $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in the price of OP. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and would require an unprecedented level of growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

This renewed sentiment has created an ideal environment for altcoins to thrive, with two standout cryptocurrencies, Chainlink ( LINK ) and Stellar Lumens ( XLM ), showing strong potential to achieve a $25 billion market cap by Q1 2025. Driving the broader market rally, Bitcoin ( BTC ) is trading above $104,000 at press time, following a remarkable 10% weekly surge, fueled by positive US macroeconomic data that has reignited investor confidence in riskier assets. Riding this momentum, LINK and XLM stand out due to their growing ecosystems, strategic partnerships, and favorable market conditions, positioning them as key assets to watch as they edge closer to this significant milestone. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink, currently priced at $24.63 with a market cap of $15.71 billion, is positioned as a strong candidate to reach a $25 billion market cap by Q1 2025, which would equate to a price of approximately $39.19. LINK market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap Analysts have set midterm price targets of $43 and $50, reflecting confidence in LINK’s upward momentum and supporting the plausibility of this milestone. AI projections also lean bullish, with short-term targets between $30 and $35, further supporting the positive market sentiment surrounding Chainlink’s growth trajectory. This optimism is reinforced by surging whale activity , with 1.35 million LINK tokens valued at $31 million accumulated within 24 hours, signaling growing institutional confidence. Furthermore, Chainlink’s ecosystem continues to expand through partnerships, such as its collaboration with 21X to integrate tokenized securities in Europe, and the implementation of the CCIP v1.5 upgrade, which significantly enhances cross-chain interoperability. Additionally, its utility as a universal gas token, offering discounts to high-volume users, has further driven demand within its ecosystem. With macroeconomic tailwinds such as pro-crypto policies and proposed zero-tax initiatives, Chainlink’s fundamentals and market trends strongly support its trajectory toward a $25 billion market cap, offering a compelling opportunity for both investors and traders. Stellar Lumens (XLM) XLM, currently trading at $0.4804 with a market capitalization of $14.63 billion, is also gaining significant attention. To reach a $25 billion market cap, XLM’s price would need to climb to approximately $0.82. XLM market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap Stellar’s expanding partnerships with MoneyGram , Circle, and various central banks have cemented its role in cross-border payments and blockchain infrastructure. These collaborations highlight its influence in the digital finance ecosystem, particularly as the market speculates on the impact of potential crypto-friendly policies. XLM’s trajectory is often compared to Ripple’s XRP , with both tokens benefiting from similar narratives tied to payment solutions and regulatory developments. Additionally, recent analysis positions XLM as a strong buy, with robust RSI metrics and technical indicators signaling sustained bullish momentum for the week, as reported by Finbold. On the derivatives side, data points to a mixed sentiment. While trading volume has dropped 44.26% to $1.15 billion, and open interest declined by 6.04% to $394.09 million, long positions dominate. Binance’s long/short ratio stands at 2.413, and OKX reports a ratio of 1.97, signaling a clear preference for upward price movements. Among top traders, Binance’s long/short ratio of 2.4211 further underscores market optimism . Backed by its fundamentals and bullish sentiment, XLM is well-positioned to achieve a $25 billion market cap, presenting a compelling opportunity for investors and traders alike. As they continue to build on their ecosystems and benefit from favorable macroeconomic conditions, both LINK and XLM stand out as key assets to watch as they move closer to their $25 billion market cap targets in Q1 2025.

Despite the recent volatility, Cardano is still trading higher than it was most of last year. The XRP price, on the other hand, is dependent on its SEC case, its stablecoin, RLUSD, and broader market sentiment. Despite so much bear pressure, the XRP price is fighting through and has been consistently above $3 for the past week. Legacy coins and stronger altcoins will see serious competition from the new token on the block: DTX Exchange. DTX is promising massive gains as its token is powered by its unique hybrid multi-asset trading platform. Built on the VulcanC layer 1 blockchain, DTX Exchange is a force to be reckoned with in the crypto and DeFi space. Cardano to Hit $2 Soon The crypto market might be in a correction phase, but Cardano (ADA) is set to beat many top coins this year. Analysts predict price targets for ADA to be around $1.5-$2 in the first quarter of 2025. There has been higher institutional investor interest in the crypto ecosystem, likely driving Cardano (ADA)’s price higher. As the adoption of Cardano (ADA)’s DeFi projects increases, the token will see more gains, maybe up to $4 by June. The ADA price will be influenced by the positive sentiment from its Layer 2 scaling (Hydra). With eventual ecosystem expansion and sustained retail and institutional investment inflows, Cardano (ADA) will continue its bullish march to the top. Ripple: Opportunity to Make Generational Wealth XRP price has shown fluctuations that might make traders wary, but analysts are hopeful since the forecast points towards an optimistic future for Ripple. With an established use case and massive market cap, XRP is set to rally to new highs soon. Once the SEC case settles, XRP will have more clarity among investors on its regulatory issues, which should boost the XRP price further. A $4 price is expected by March and can be further boosted in Q2 by Ripple Lab’s global partnerships. As a major player in the DeFi sector, Ripple has high institutional interest. It will rise if BTC rises, and if BTC dominance declines, capital will be rotated into XRP. XRP is being adopted widely in cross-border payments, and it should also attract significant trading volume. Global adoption of its RippleNET and ODL by financial institutions like the Japanese banks can mean the price breaks well above its previous all-time high. DTX to be the Best Performing Altcoin Among prominent players, DTX Exchange shines with its brand-new proposition to reposition the current trading markets. Its transformative features and possible whale and hedge fund backing mean DTX could soon be the best trading platform in the crypto market. It promises to allow users to trade over 100,000 currency pairs, including most traditional assets and all crypto derivatives. DTX Exchange will be a feature-rich experience, and its innovative hybrid trading model will offer unmatched scalability, reliability, faster transactions, and low trading fees. DTX holds a distinct advantage over legacy coins like Cardano (ADA) because of its multi-asset support and because this utility powers its token. The DTX coin is $0.14 right now, and analysts predict it will shoot quickly to $1 once it is listed. The presale is in its seventh stage, and investors looking to diversify their portfolios with low-risk, high-yield tokens should consider DTX.

The gesture is in an ‘irreversible and immutable’ showcase of its support for the incoming administration. Trump’s campaign overtly courted the crypto and tech industries. On different occasions, the incoming president has maintained that he believes cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are an integral part of America’s economic and technological future. Industry stakeholders have reciprocated in cash donations to his campaign and inauguration. Now, Mara Holdings has also joined the party with a gesture that cost 1.244 in BTC fees, but holds much more significance because of Bitcoin’s blockchain. Mara Holdings’ tribute to President Trump Mara Holdings, previously known as Marathon Digital Holdings, has paid tribute to the incoming US president ahead of his inauguration ceremony by imprinting his portrait into the Bitcoin blockchain. Mara Holdings mined a portrait of US President Donald Trump for a fee of 1.244 BTC. Source: X (@BitcoinMagazine) However, this is not the company’s first nod to the president. During Trump’s campaign, he expressed a desire for all the remaining Bitcoins to be “mined, minted and made in the USA,” emphasizing the importance of domestic production and control of digital assets. In response, Mara Holdings began to stamp “ made in USA ” on all blocks mined within the country, aligning itself with Trump’s vision. MARA is Team USA, proudly declared in each American-made bitcoin block we mine. #MadeInUSA pic.twitter.com/4mFljYfoMi — MARA (@MARAHoldings) August 12, 2024 Following Trump’s victory in the elections, Bitcoin’s price rose over $100,000 for the first time, sending shockwaves across the market. The stocks of several mining companies experienced a surge, and even Mara Holdings experienced an increase to close at $25.01. Fred Thiel, the CEO of Mara Holdings, has been vocal about the potential growth of Bitcoin mining under Trump’s administration. He, like many other notable enthusiasts, believes that the pro-crypto policies could lead to a flourishing mining industry in the United States. Crypto miners have hit the ground running in 2025 While the cryptocurrency market has had an up-and-down start to 2025, Bitcoin miners have been smiling to the bank (or their preferred digital wallet). In a research report put together by JP Morgan, 12 of the 14 Bitcoin mining companies the Wall Street banks track posted better performances than the world’s largest cryptocurrency in the first two weeks of 2025. “Miners earned $54,900 in daily block reward revenue per EH/s over the first two weeks of January.” analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote. The report also noted that Bitcoin has increased about 56% since the halving event in April 2024 and 44% since the US presidential election in November. The leading crypto is also up 134% year-on-year. Miners especially welcome these positive market trends, as they face challenges in the areas of rising energy costs and increased mining difficulty. The halving event in April reduced rewards from 900 to 450 coins per day, tightening profit margins.

39105907,https://coingape.com/?p=234118,1737140303,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Wyoming Proposes Legislation To Allow State Funds to Invest in Bitcoin,https://coingape.com/wyoming-proposes-legislation-to-allow-state-funds-to-invest-in-bitcoin/,"Wyoming lawmakers have introduced House Bill 0201 (HB0201), a bill that would allow the state to invest public funds in Bitcoin. The proposal limits Bitcoin investments to 3% of qualifying state funds, including the general fund, permanent mineral trust fund, and permanent land fund. Bitcoin as Part of Wyoming’s Financial Strategy The bill permits the Wyoming State Treasurer to directly buy Bitcoin or use it to acquire regulated Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs) from registered investment companies. The initiative aims to expand the investment approach of the state and explore the possibilities of Bitcoin as an appreciating asset. According to the sponsor of HB0201, Representative Jacob Wasserburger, the bill will help Wyoming maintain a lead in the area of financial innovation. “In the tradition of great policy-making, it is not only sensible but path-breaking for the state of Wyoming to invest in Bitcoin,” he said. The bill also provides for the security of Bitcoin investments by providing rules for the safe custody of the investments and annual performance reports. This move comes as Wyoming leads the pack in embracing digital assets having enacted more than two dozen blockchain and crypto-friendly laws since 2018. Wyoming’s Blockchain Leadership and National Implications Wyoming also has a friendly legal stance toward blockchain and cryptocurrency by legal means, such as the adoption of the Special Purpose Depository Institution (SPDI) charter. This framework allowed the regulated banks in the state to engage in the handling of digital assets which made Wyoming one of the most friendly states to crypto in the United States. The proposed Bitcoin reserve is in line with the efforts by Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis and President-elect Donald Trump to develop the United States Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Lummis has previously expressed support for Bitcoin as a reserve currency saying that it has the potential of enhancing the value of the US dollar and the economy. The Freshman Representative Wasserburger stated Wyoming’s backing of this national initiative, saying that “accumulating strategic Bitcoin reserve is not only a matter of financial power but also establishing American supremacy in the digital economy.” The proposed bill makes Wyoming an example for other states, including Oklahoma, which is considering its own Bitcoin reserve legislation. Oklahoma State Representative Cody Maynard introduced the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act this week to protect state funds while embracing innovation. Transparency and Accountability in Bitcoin Investments HB0201 also provides for tough measures to enhance accountability and transparency in the handling of Bitcoin investments. The state treasurer must file annual reports on the returns of Bitcoin investments, the management of assets, and the market price of the holdings. In addition, the treasurer will be empowered to make regulations to enhance the security of the investments and their efficient management. This bill seeks to address risks by only allowing the state to invest in Bitcoin a proportion of its resources, while also testing out its viability as a sound asset. This aspect of the focus on transparency can be attributed to the state’s effort to protect public assets while embarking on sophisticated financial management. This proposal from Wyoming is in sync with President-elect Trump’s positive view on Bitcoin and the increasing adoption of Bitcoin, XRP, SOL, and USDC as reserve currencies. Trump’s campaign emphasized positioning the U.S. as a global cryptocurrency leader, and his victory spurred optimism in the crypto market with Bitcoin hitting an all-time high.

However, while Cardano dominates headlines, Lightchain AI , an emerging blockchain project, is quietly gaining momentum. With its innovative solutions and a successful presale that has already raised $10.6 million, Lightchain AI is carving out its place in the industry. Could this under-the-radar project be the next big thing in blockchain innovation? Cardano’s Legacy and Current Challenges Cardano, started in 2017 by one of the folks who helped make Ethereum, Charles Hoskinson, has made a name for itself as a well-known blockchain site using a clear and study-based way. Its growth is divided into five clear steps: Byron (base), Shelley (sharing power), Goguen (smart deals), Basho (growing big), and Voltaire (rules). Even with its careful growth, Cardano has met hard spots. The first start of smart tasks had trou͏bles, especially when the first shared app, Minswap, had to close because of deal fixing problems. Also, getting along with other block chains is a big problem, since smooth work together is key for making a united system. Plus, the dependency on an in-depth study and checked building way, while keeping strength, has caused slower use than more quick rivals. Lightchain AI Innovation Beyond the Spotlight While Cardano focuses on its steady expansion, Lightchain AI is taking bold steps to address blockchain inefficiencies head-on. Unlike Cardano’s broader focus, Lightchain AI targets specific industry pain points, such as secure data sharing and dynamic scalability, making it an attractive option for enterprises with complex requirements. A standout feature of Lightchain AI is its ability to offer customized blockchain solutions that integrate seamlessly into existing infrastructures. This flexibility allows businesses in industries like healthcare, finance, and AI to adopt blockchain technology without disrupting their workflows. Moreover, Lightchain AI’s commitment to energy-efficient operations and enhanced privacy mechanisms aligns with the growing demand for sustainable and secure blockchain platforms. These unique features, combined with its presale success, position Lightchain AI as a serious competitor to established projects like Cardano. Cardano vs. Lightchain AI Cardano may be taking its time expanding, but Lightchain AI is showing the world that blockchain innovation can be both fast and precise. With a sharp focus on tailored solutions and real-world applications, it’s carving out a competitive edge in an ever-growing market. For investors, Lightchain AI is more than just another project—it’s a chance to get in early on something truly game-changing. By blending cutting-edge blockchain technology with real utility, it’s quietly building momentum. Don’t be surprised if Lightchain AI emerges as the next big thing, ready to rival even giants like Cardano.

Santiment says that multiple altcoin projects are seeing a massive increase in whale transactions, including the stablecoin Dai ( DAI ), issued by Maker. According to Santiment, the increased buying of DAI is a bullish signal, indicating that investors are probably going to soon use the stablecoins to accumulate altcoins. “For stablecoins, increased activity is typically a good sign that large levels of funds are being prepared to be swapped for altcoins that are common with that stablecoin’s trading pair. For example, Dai (shown three times on this countdown [below]) is commonly associated with ETH-based assets.” Santiment shares a top-10 list of altcoins with a market cap of at least $500 million that are seeing the largest increase in whale transactions so far this week: “MakerDAO DAI on BNB: +800% DeXe Network DEXE: +250% LayerZero CORE on Optimism: +200% Aave (AAVE) on Polygon: +200% MakerDAO DAI on Arbitrum: +182% Telcoin (TEL): +100% GateToken (GT): +100% Ripple XRP: +81% MakerDAO DAI on Polygon: +182% Ondo Finance (ONDO): +59%.” Source: Santiment/X Santiment also warns that large whale buys of altcoin projects could trigger market volatility. “Assets seeing high whale activity are significantly more likely to see price reversals, as key stakeholders make moves commonly around profit taking or dip buying moments.” Lastly, Santiment reports that payments altcoin XRP is witnessing massive network activity as its value surges. “XRP has just reached a new seven-year high, crossing a $3.39 market value for the first time since January 2018. With this rise, we have just seen 2,365 $100,000+ XRP transactions in the latest eight-hour span, the highest spike since December 3rd.

BRETT, or Based Brett, is a meme cryptocurrency launched in February 2024 on the Base blockchain, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. Inspired by the character Brett from Matt Furie’s “Boys’ Club” comic series, BRETT aims to engage users through humor and community interaction. It has quickly gained popularity, boasting a market cap exceeding $1 billion and a total supply of 10 billion tokens, with a fixed supply ensuring scarcity. BRETT operates on a renounced contract, meaning the creator cannot alter its supply or functionalities, which fosters a decentralized governance model driven by community engagement.

The price is moving towards the upper Bollinger Band at $0.1539, which points to potential resistance at this level. Moving forward, the RSI is at 50.05, which means that the coin is in a neutral position, but with room for upward movement if momentum strengthens. The 20-day SMA at $0.1281 acts as immediate support, which also means that buyers are stepping in at this level. Moreover, a successful break above $0.1539 could push BRETT toward the next resistance level of $0.16. However, a failure to hold $0.1281 could see a drop to $0.102.

BRETT cryptocurrency, a meme coin on the Base blockchain, has gained popularity due to its community-driven nature and fixed supply, which enhances scarcity.

The firm has reportedly earned $700 million in profits from its Bitcoin investments since 2022. On Friday, blockchain data analytics firm Arkham confirmed that SpaceX’s BTC holdings had grown in value by $695.24 million since November 29, 2022. As confirmed by market activity, the Bitcoin stash, which the company reportedly keeps on Coinbase Prime, hasn’t been touched in the last three years. SPACEX IS UP $700M ON BITCOIN SINCE 2022 pic.twitter.com/CRPjiPmabx — Arkham (@arkham) January 17, 2025 The data also shows that in the last year, the reserves have garnered a net profit of more than 130%, buoyed by Bitcoin’s rise past $100,000 after Donald Trump was declared the winner of the US elections in November. Elon Musk-led companies’ Bitcoin balance sheet history According to a report published on the Wall Street Journal, SpaceX first recorded $373 million in Bitcoin holdings on its balance sheet in 2021. By the end of the year, which coincided with a market bull run, the company held 25.6k BTC, when the coin was priced at $46,000 per coin. SpaceX bitcoin holdings – Source: Wall Street Journal In May 2022, the company sold approximately $450 million worth of the crypto at a loss, as BTC’s price had slumped to $20,000. The aerospace giant then decided to hold onto its remaining Bitcoin reserves, which now stand at about 8.9k coins. Electric car manufacturer Tesla, another one of Musk’s companies that is closely linked with SpaceX’s crypto strategy, had its BTC holdings firstly spotted in March 2024 through Arkham’s on-chain analysis . Reuters cited a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing that revealed Tesla acquired $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin in January 2021. During the year, for about three months, the company briefly accepted BTC payments for its vehicles. Tesla sold portions of its portfolio twice: first in 2021 and again during the 2022 bear market, unloading $936 million worth of Bitcoin as the asset’s price dipped below $40,000. As of the time of this writing, Tesla holds about 11.5k coins, valued at just over $1.1 billion, per Arkham monitoring. The car manufacturer’s acceptance of Bitcoin as a payment method ended in May 2021, with Musk resonating the halt to environmental concerns about the crypto’s mining process. “We are concerned about the rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,” Musk stated on X. Stablecoins streamline SpaceX’s global operations In other news, Silicon Valley venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya said that SpaceX converts payments for its Starlink satellite internet services into stablecoins to avoid foreign exchange risks. Speaking in an All-In podcast on YouTube in December, Palihapitiya explained that the company employs this strategy primarily in countries with underdeveloped traditional financial systems. “When they aggregate payments in long-tail countries, they don’t want to take the foreign exchange risk or deal with sending wires,” he narrated, “ Stablecoins would allow us to chip away all of this decrepit infrastructure that the banks use to sort of slow down and tax a process that should never have been taxed.” Palihapitiya advocated for stablecoins as a primary cross-border transaction method in the US, because they would charge far less compared to traditional finance entities like Stripe.

BTC Proponent Calls It Impossible,https://cryptopotato.com/can-ripple-xrp-reach-100-this-cycle-btc-proponent-calls-it-impossible/,"TL;DR XRP jumped 43% in a week, nearing its all-time high, with analysts eyeing $4–$8 targets amid rising adoption and US political shifts. One skeptic dismissed $100+ predictions as unrealistic due to market cap limits, calling XRP a “distraction” compared to Bitcoin (BTC). ‘XRP is a Distraction’ Ripple’s XRP has been flying high in the past week. Its price jumped from $2.30 (on January 10) to almost $3.40 on January 16. Thus, the asset stood just 1% away from its all-time high registered at the start of 2018. Currently, XRP is worth approximately $3.31 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a staggering 43% increase on a seven-day scale. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Key drivers behind the significant rally include increased whale activity, excitement over political shifts in the USA, rising network adoption, and others. For more insights, further details are available here . The massive resurgence has given analysts the opportunity to speculate that the coin’s price may pump to unseen and even ridiculous levels. The popular X user EDO FARINA , for instance, said he would not sell his XRP holdings before the valuation reaches $100. On the other hand, the Bitcoin proponent Rajat Soni claimed that such optimistic predictions come only from people with “undiagnosed mental disability.” The finance expert explained that XRP’s potential price explosion to $100 would require its market capitalization to skyrocket to $10 trillion. Soni’s calculations are based on the total supply of XRP, which is almost 100 billion tokens. Multiplying the $100 price to the circulating supply of 57.5 billion coins will mean that the asset’s capitalization needs to soar above $5.5 trillion, which is still quite unrealistic (to say the least). To put things into perspective, the entire market cap of the crypto industry is less than $4 trillion (as of press time ). In addition, Soni said even bigger optimists suggest that XRP’s valuation could reach the astonishing $1,000 per coin. “XRP is a distraction. Stick to Bitcoin,” he concluded. Some Realistic Forecasts While $100 per coin might indeed seem like an outrageous target, many analysts have recently set somewhat optimal predictions (considering XRP’s bull run). One example is the X user CRYPTOWZRD, who believes the asset could be poised for a short-term rise to a new all-time high of $4 and then an increase to $8. Dark Defender also weighed in , envisioning a rally toward $3.6239 and $4.5503. “XRP has some work to do, but we will get there soon ,” the analyst added.

The crypto venture capital firm will bear the brunt of the financial penalty, paying $30 million in fines, while Moro will personally be liable for a $500,000 penalty. In addition to the fines, both DCG and Moro agreed to a cease-and-desist order. Neither DCG nor Moro admitted to any wrongdoing. Moro is currently the chief strategy officer at INX. The charges stem from DCG and Genesis’ response to the collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) – Genesis’ second-largest borrower – in the summer of 2022, which blew a billion-dollar hole in Genesis’ balance sheet. “We are pleased to have concluded an extensive investigation process that was limited in its findings and focused on the social media posts and communications made by our former operating subsidiary, Genesis Global Capital,” a spokesperson for DCG told CoinDesk. “DCG has always strived to conduct its business with the highest integrity, and we believe our actions related to Genesis were consistent with that approach.” Regulators, including the New York Attorney General (NYAG) Letitia James, had accused DGC and Genesis, its wholly-owned crypto trading subsidiary, of working together to cover up the enormous hole by falsely claiming that DCG had absorbed Genesis’ losses. What DCG had allegedly done was issue Genesis a promissory note – essentially an IOU meant to create the appearance of liquidity – pledging to pay Genesis $1.1 billion over the course of 10 years at 1% interest. DCG has denied that the promissory note was a sham. “It is vital that companies and their officers speak truthfully to the investing public, especially in times of financial instability or turmoil. The Commission found that DCG and Moro fell short in that regard,” said Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, in a Friday statement . “Rather than being transparent about Genesis’s financial condition and DCG’s efforts to ensure Genesis’s continued operation, DCG and Moro painted a misleadingly rosy picture.” The SEC and the Department of Justice reportedly began investigating DCG in 2023 . James’ civil case against DCG is ongoing. She is seeking $3 billion in penalties .",Policy|DCG|Genesis Capital|Three Arrows Capital|Michael Moro,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-17 19:21:24

Pepe (PEPE) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, PEPE, with today’s price surge, has broken out of a descending triangle price action pattern and cleared its path for a massive rally. However, this breakout during the current bullish market sentiment is more favorable for PEPE holders. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price action and historical price momentum, if PEPE holds its gain and closes a daily candle above the $0.000020 level, it could soar by 38% to reach the $0.000027 mark in the coming days. At present, PEPE is trading above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame, indicating an uptrend. Meanwhile, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still below the overbought zone despite a notable gain, suggesting that the asset has enough room to soar in the coming days. Current Price Momentum Today, January 17, 2025, with an impressive price surge, the meme coin is trading near the $0.000020 mark. Additionally, considering its impressive price momentum and bullish outlook, traders and investors have shown strong interest and confidence in the meme coin, resulting in a 30% jump in trading volume.

Dit nieuws heeft de crypto-markt nieuw bullish momentum gegeven, terwijl ook andere bekende crypto’s grote prijsbewegingen vertonen. De aankomende inauguratie van Trump lijkt dit positieve sentiment verder te versterken, wat de kans vergroot op verdere prijsstijgingen. In dit artikel gaan we dieper in op de factoren die de prijsbewegingen aandrijven en benoemen we drie crypto’s met veel potentieel. Trump overweegt Bitcoin reserve voor VS De cryptocurrency-industrie lobbyt bij aankomend president Donald Trump en regeringsfunctionarissen om miljarden dollars aan Bitcoin aan te schaffen voor een nationale crypto-reserve. De voorstellen, opgesteld door het Bitcoin Policy Institute (BPI) voor Trump-functionarissen, stellen dat zo’n reserve het land zou kunnen beschermen tegen economische volatiliteit en tegelijkertijd investeringen in hernieuwbare energie zou kunnen bevorderen. Maar het belangrijkste punt dat ze benadrukken is dat als de VS zwaar investeren in Bitcoin, het land de ‘lijn kan vasthouden’ van de door het Westen geleide wereldorde en de economische macht en geopolitieke invloed van China kan tegengaan. Na een gedetailleerde opsomming van de manieren waarop de VS achterloopt op China, stelt het rapport voor om een Strategische Bitcoin Reserve van 1 miljoen munten te creëren en legt het een reeks prognoses uit over hoe de VS het fonds zou kunnen gebruiken om politieke invloed uit te oefenen als de waarde van de valuta stijgt van de huidige waarde van net iets boven de $100.000 per Bitcoin naar tussen de $500.000 en $1,5 miljoen per munt. Dit nieuws heeft dan ook geleidt tot hernieuwd bullish momentum van BTC: Bitcoin koers opnieuw boven $100.000 Met het bullish herstel op de cryptomarkt heeft Bitcoin voor de tweede keer in 2025 de $100.000 grens overschreden. De prijs bereikte een piek van $102.088 in de afgelopen 24 uur, en de bull run wint geleidelijk aan momentum. Te midden van het herstel bieden toenemende institutionele steun en groeiende bullish speculatie aanzienlijke opwaartse potentie. Zal een doorbraak op het niveau van $102.557 leiden tot een nieuwe recordprijs, nu de inauguratie van Donald Trump in de buurt lijkt te komen? In de 4-uurs grafiek toont de BTC prijsactie een voortzetting van de bullish trend na een kleine hertest van de 20-daagse Moving Average (MA). Dit resulteerde in een 24-uurs low van $97.319. Echter, met het ‘Morning Star’ patroon heeft het bullish herstel de prijs naar $101.446 gebracht. Bovendien begon het herstel met een RSI-divergentie rally rond de $90.000 en voltooit nu een ‘rounding bottom’ patroon. De neckline van het ‘rounding bottom’ patroon ligt bij de $102.557 supply zone. Met het voortdurende herstel hebben de ‘golden crossover’ tussen de 50- en 200-daagse EMA’s, evenals de positieve crossover tussen de 100- en 200-daagse EMA’s, weer positieve uitlijning hersteld. Bovendien nadert de 4-uurs RSI nu de ‘overbought’ grens, wat volgens technische indicatoren een hoge kans op een breakout rally aangeeft. Welke crypto’s gaan pumpen? Door de lekken rondom Trump en de crypto-reserves is Bitcoin weer boven de $100.000 gekomen. Daarnaast lijkt de aankomende inauguratie het bullish momentum alleen maar verder te versterken. Ook in altcoins werden grote bewegingen waargenomen, zelfs groter dan bij Bitcoin. Dit biedt kansen om van deze ontwikkelingen te profiteren. We zullen hieronder drie coins, die nog in een presale zitten, benoemen, die naar onze mening veel potentieel hebben Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) vertegenwoordigt een innovatieve meme coin die is toegewijd aan een duidelijk doel: kleine handelaren in staat stellen winstgevend te zijn. De tactieken die door grote Wall Street-spelers worden gebruikt, belemmeren vaak het succes van kleinere handelaren.

Als reactie hierop presenteert Solaxy een schaalbaardere solution die dit probleem aanpakt. Het project heeft met succes bijna $11 miljoen opgehaald in de presale. Deze prestatie kan worden toegeschreven aan de aard van SOLX als een multi-chain token, die verbindingen tussen de ecosystemen van Ethereum en Solana faciliteert.

DCG Settles SEC Lawsuit for $38 Million As per the lawsuit filing , DCG has already submitted an Offer of Settlement as part of the proceedings and has agreed to pay $38 million as part of a settlement in the lawsuit filed by the SEC. “In mid-June 2022, a large borrower defaulted on a margin call, which compromised GGC’s business. Yet, Digital Currency Group negligently engaged in conduct that misleadingly downplayed the impact of that default and overstated what Digital Currency Group did to help GGC in the aftermath,” the filing read. DCG has settled the charges but did not admit or deny the allegations. Notably, the SEC’s filing reveals that Three Arrows Capital, a major crypto hedge fund, owed $2.4 billion in loans to Genesis. Despite knowing Genesis would lose at least $1 billion due to Three Arrows’ collapse, DCG and Genesis continued to downplay the financial threat, misleading investors about the situation. SEC Alleges DCG Misled Public About Genesis’ Financial Health The SEC alleged in its complaint that DCG executives instructed employees and its subsidiary Genesis to publicly downplay financial issues and present a strong image of the lending firm’s condition in summer 2022. Genesis falsely claimed its balance sheet was strong, despite facing over $1 billion in losses from Three Arrows Capital’s collapse. Additionally, Genesis’ former CEO falsely stated that the firm had “shed the risk” of Three Arrows’ default. The SEC claims DCG failed to take appropriate action to prevent these misleading statements. The SEC’s penalty on DCG has sparked debate, with some critics saying it’s more of a reaction than a solution. Also, the SEC’s action against DCG highlights the growing focus on ensuring transparency and accountability in the cryptocurrency industry.

The announcement was made by CEO Brian Armstrong in a blog post shared exclusively with Axios on Friday. Coinbase has publicly supported the concept of a national Bitcoin reserve for the first time, just ahead of Donald Trump’s second presidential inauguration and Armstrong’s scheduled appearance at the World Economic Forum. As a public company with a market value of $73 billion, Coinbase positions itself as the leading voice in the cryptocurrency industry. Often considered the industry’s de facto spokesperson in Washington, Armstrong has taken a bold, confrontational approach to dealing with regulators, inspiring other industry leaders to do the same. Over the past two years, Coinbase has played a significant role in shaping crypto policy. The exchange was a major funder of Fairshake, a political action committee that was influential in recent congressional elections. Coinbase also supports the advocacy group Stand With Crypto, which has brought together more than two million people to support pro-crypto initiatives. Related News: The Country That Slowly Accumulated Massive Bitcoin Without Drawing Attention May Have Sold Some, According to Onchain Data In a blog post, Armstrong called on global leaders and policymakers to embrace cryptocurrencies as a way to accelerate economic freedom. He outlined four key priorities: Passing Pro-Crypto Legislation: Armstrong emphasized the need for laws that encourage crypto firms to remain headquartered in their home countries. Creating Strategic Bitcoin Reserves: Armstrong described the digital economy as the next global arms race and urged nations to prepare by holding Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Creating Special Economic Zones for Digital Assets: Proposed the establishment of zones that would foster innovation in the crypto sector, potentially through regulatory sandboxes. Improving Government Efficiency: Armstrong highlighted blockchain’s potential to streamline government operations, referencing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an initiative humorously named after Elon Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency. The blog post comes as Trump continues to signal strong support for cryptocurrencies, drawing support from Coinbase and other industry leaders. Armstrong reportedly met with Trump privately twice before and after the election, with Trump showing strong interest in crypto-related talks. *This is not investment advice.

In a detailed thread on X, Bons argued that the Internet Computer network is highly centralized and insecure. Bons’ first claim was that Internet Computer depends on at most 40 independent subnets, each responsible for its own security. While Avalanche ( AVAX ) and Polkadot ( DOT ) use a similar technology, their subnets utilize shared security, making them more secure. According to Bons, ICP is highly insecure because it openly lists the data center locations of its nodes, potentially exposing them to attacks. 1/31) ICP is centralized & insecure; ICP is dangerous! You can bring down ICP by only attacking 40 nodes in known & fixed data centers! ICP promises the moon but offers nothing unique Scalability without decentralization is meaningless; ICP's modular design is the problem: 🧵 — Justin Bons (@Justin_Bons) January 17, 2025 You might also like: Polkadot price rare patterns point to a breakout ahead of key events Bons also criticized Internet Computer’s claim of having infinite scalability. He argued that the network’s scalability has limits since all subnets must communicate with one another. Another issue Bons raised concerns ICP’s claim that it has solved the oracle problem using HTTP outcalls, which allow smart contracts to retrieve data from Web2 APIs. He believes this approach is flawed because it relies on centralized tools. These criticisms likely explain why Internet Computer has underperformed compared to other blockchains in the crypto industry. For instance, ICP only hosts a handful of DeFi applications, with a total value locked of $41 million. Its stablecoins market cap is just $5 million , with Tether accounting for 66% of the total. ICP price analysis Internet Computer chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Internet Computer’s price has risen slightly in recent days as most cryptocurrencies rebounded. ICP’s price increased after forming a double-bottom chart pattern at $9.33. This bullish reversal pattern is characterized by two low points and a neckline, which, in ICP’s case, lies at $12.72. The token has moved above the 200-day moving average and the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. Additionally, it has broken above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since November last year. A bullish breakout for ICP will be confirmed if the price moves above the double-bottom’s neckline at $12.72. Such a move could trigger a rally to the next resistance level at $15.60, its November high.

According to a new report by Bloomberg, anonymous people familiar with his plans say Trump is planning an executive order that will prioritize crypto-focused policymaking. The report says the order will likely name digital assets as a national imperative as well as create a crypto advisory council to promote the interests of the industry. The sources go on to say that Trump is also considering including a directive in the executive order that would instruct government agencies to review their crypto policies and possibly freeze all lawsuits involving digital assets. Trump is also considering creating a national Bitcoin ( BTC ) stockpile from the $20 billion worth of BTC the government has already compiled. However, the sources warn that the executive order – which is slated for Monday – isn’t finalized and may change before issued by Trump. As stated by Kara Calvert, vice-president for US policy at Coinbase Global, to Bloomberg, “What I think Donald Trump is going to do is signal that the United States is back and we are ready to lead in this industry. What it’s signaling to other countries is be careful, or you won’t keep up.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

In a new interview with CNBC, Waller notes that recent data suggests inflation is coming down. “If we continue getting numbers like this, it’s reasonable to think that possibly rate cuts could happen in the first half of the year… It depends if — always the big word ‘if’ — if the inflation data continues to come in like it has been. If we don’t, if we get a surprise like we did last year, then we’re going to have to stay on hold until we get inflation coming back down. But I’m optimistic that this disinflationary trend will continue and we’ll get back closer to 2% a little quicker than maybe others are thinking.” The current federal funds rate is 4.33% after a series of cuts from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) that started in September. The FOMC is scheduled to hold its next meeting on interest rates on January 28th. The Fed is not expected to cut rates at that January meeting, and Waller did little in the interview to dispel that notion. The Fed governor did note that a rate cut in March could not “be completely ruled out,” depending on inflation data.

The fund substantially raised its forecast for U.S. growth in 2025 but cut Eurozone expectations. The Financial Times reported that the IMF increased the U.S. economy’s growth forecast for 2025 to 2.7%, up from the previous estimate of 2.2%, and 0.1% lower than last year’s estimate. The economic growth forecast put the U.S. ahead of all the other G7 countries. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, chief economist at the IMF, unveiled forecasts that predicted faster-than-expected growth for the U.S. economy. He added that Trump’s policies could lead to a combination of increased demand and declining supply, possibly reigniting U.S. buying pressures. IMF warns of Trump’s policy risks and predicts continued U.S. growth The IMF updated its World Economic Outlook and October forecast, predicting a 2.1% U.S. economy expansion in 2026. The growth estimates unveiled three days before Trump’s inauguration did not include policy proposals from the incoming administration which the fund could not yet integrate in its forecasts. Trump’s laid out aggressive plans prompted jitters in bond markets that were cautious about excessive deficits and inflation risks. The IMF’s central forecasts assumed a continued easing of global inflation that would permit further rate cuts in big economies. The FT’s analysis signalled that parts of Trump’s agenda could undermine efforts to curb inflation. According to the IMF, proposed U.S. policies such as a looser fiscal policy and deregulation would stimulate demand and increase inflation in the near term. The fund said that while deregulation would boost the U.S. economy over five years by stimulating innovation and removing red tape, dangers of going too far still existed. “Higher inflation would prevent the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates and could even require rate hikes that would in turn strengthen the dollar and widen US external deficits”. -Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, chief economist at IMF IMF forecasts also highlighted the ‘transatlantic divergence’ between the U.S. and big Eurozone economies like Germany which was expected to grow by just 0.3% this year. The wider Eurozone would grow by 1%, significantly slower than the UK’s 1.6% forecast. IMF forecasts surge in China’s economy, debt trap risks loom large Gourinchas emphasized that the Chinese economy was exposed to a ‘debt-deflation-stagnation’ trap if Beijing’s fiscal measures failed to boost demand. He pointed out a scenario where falling prices would boost the real value of debt and undermine activity. China’s economy was expected to grow by 4.6% in 2025, faster than the IMF’s previous expectations. The IMF said that the global economy was now expected to expand by 3.3% in 2025 and 2026, slightly higher than October’s estimates but well below its 3.7% historical growth. Headline inflation was also expected to reduce from 4.2% in 2025 to 3.5% in 2026. The fund, however, noted that the taming inflation could be disrupted by the risks of policy generation. According to the IMF, the risk of renewed inflationary pressures could prompt raising policy rates and intensifying monetary policy divergence by the central bank. Fiscal, financial, and external risks could be worsened if interest rates remained higher for longer than projected. Kristalina Georgieva, managing director at the IMF, highlighted the ripple effects of Trump’s uncertain trade policies. She stated that the uncertainty about the incoming administration’s trade policies were adding to worldwide economic headwinds and were actually expressed globally through higher long-term interest rates. Georgieva noted that despite a decrease in short-term rates, the surge in long-term rates marked a very unusual economic phenomenon. The current scenario, however, painted a picture of economic anxiety where markets and investors braced for potential new trade barriers disruptions.

TRUMP token: Leading in philanthropy within crypto TRUMP is the top-ranked token on the Politifi platform. It has distinguished itself by raising more funds for U.S. Veterans and Child Tracking Prevention than any other cryptocurrency. This focus on philanthropy sets it apart in the crypto space. The token’s unique appeal stems from its commitment to social causes, making it potentially attractive for those interested in combining investment with social impact. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, TRUMP’s focus on charitable efforts may enhance its appeal, especially among socially conscious investors. This dual focus on finance and social responsibility could make TRUMP an engaging option in the current market landscape. Shiba Inu: A unique meme coin with growing utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but operates on the Ethereum blockchain. It was launched in August 2020 by a developer called Ryoshi. Initially, SHIB had a quadrillion tokens. In a notable move, half of the supply was sent to Ethereum’s co-creator, Vitalik Buterin. He donated a large amount to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund, and “burned” 40% of it, increasing SHIB’s prestige. This coin stands out with its use of the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling features like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. SHIB plans to further its utility through a new NFT platform and a DAO-based governance system. Its integration in vast Ethereum applications suggests a promising future. SOL: Solana’s fast and scalable blockchain platform Solana is a blockchain platform designed for scalability, making it suitable for decentralized applications (dapps). It competes with Ethereum and Cardano, offering speed and versatility in development. SOL, the native cryptocurrency of Solana, is essential for transactions and rewarding users within the network. The platform’s design allows for high-capacity operations without sharding or second-layer solutions, which distinguishes it from other networks. This efficiency aims to attract developers and investors interested in high-activity projects. Solana’s capabilities and streamlined architecture suggest strong potential, making SOL an appealing option in the market, especially for those focused on scalability and performance in blockchain technology. Uniswap’s UNI Token: Governance and innovation in DeFi Uniswap’s UNI token is a governance token that allows users to vote on changes within the platform. Launched in September 2020, it plays a critical role in shaping the future of the decentralized exchange. It was introduced to counter competition and to reward user loyalty. A total of 150 million UNI tokens were distributed to past users. Uniswap operates on the Ethereum blockchain, using an innovative automated liquidity protocol since 2018. This setup eliminates the need for order books, enhancing user control and security. Its open-source nature and free token listing set it apart from centralized exchanges. With over $3 billion in assets, Uniswap remains a major player in the DeFi landscape. Conclusion While coins like TRUMP, SHIB, SOL, and UNI show less short-term potential, Catzilla stands out. With presale prices rising from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages, it offers a 700% ROI opportunity. Catzilla combines governance, rewards, and staking to unite crypto enthusiasts, meme fans, and anime lovers in the quest for financial freedom.

He argued that Bitcoin will rise from $250k to $400k this cycle. Becker’s sentiments were shared by Will Clemente, another popular crypto analyst. In his January 16th post on Twitter/X, Clemente argued that BTC will continue to appreciate in market price as soon as more countries adopt a Bitcoin reserve pool. Clemente predicted that Bitcoin has the strength to hit $1 million. He further stated that once countries adopt a strategic reserve for the crypto, it’s only natural for the government to start stockpiling the asset.

Blockware Solutions, in a post shared last December 29th, said that $150k is the “bear case target” for Bitcoin in case Trump decides not to pursue the plans to launch a BTC reserve.

VanEck is also offering a more rosy picture for Bitcoin, saying that this digital asset may hit $180k by the end of the year. Bitfinex suggested that it may reach $200k by mid-2025. According to Becker, the $150k target a few months ago was on target since only a few institutions are invested in the asset. However, in the current landscape of increasing adoption and favorable regulations, a $150k target just doesn’t make sense.

Notably, after hitting a multiyear high of $0.000045 in early March, SHIB entered a prolonged consolidation phase. Despite Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP performing strongly in November and January, SHIB lagged, with investor focus shifting to larger-cap cryptocurrencies amid regulatory uncertainty. However, with Bitcoin (BTC) spearheading another market rally, analysts are increasingly optimistic about a potential capital shift back into altcoins, with particular attention turning to meme coins like SHIB . On Thursday, popular crypto analyst Javon Marks highlighted a bullish triangle pattern on SHIB’s chart, suggesting that the token could be on the verge of a significant breakout after months of consolidation. “ After confirming another Bull Pattern, and a textbook one at that, SHIB remains on our radar for a major continuation towards the larger target level at $0.000081. This target’s currently over 258% away, so a continuation towards it can be huge.” He tweeted. Another prominent analyst, “CryptoElites,” told his 246,000 followers that SHIB might be preparing for an even larger rally. Based on a bullish triangle pattern on the weekly chart, he projected a price target of $0.0023, a potential 100X return from current levels. Elsewhere, analyst “Investing Haven” highlighted key Fibonacci retracement levels, which he believes are crucial for SHIB’s price trajectory. In a tweet, he identified the 50% Fibonacci level as a significant resistance point, while the 38.2% level serves as critical support. According to his analysis, SHIB is showing bullish signs as long as the support holds, with higher lows indicating growing interest from buyers. He stressed that the token’s breakout potential hinges on staying above the key level of $0.0000177, suggesting that this threshold will be crucial for determining whether SHIB can continue its upward momentum. That said, SHIB’s recent developments are also bolstering investor confidence. Among the key drivers is the recent launch of TREAT, a governance and utility token for Shiba Inu’s Layer-3 privacy blockchain. This blockchain aims to enhance privacy and unlock advanced features, further strengthening SHIB’s ecosystem. Additionally, the “Shiba Army” continues to actively burn tokens to reduce circulating supply, potentially boosting scarcity and value. Whale activity, with large transactions indicating accumulation, is another bullish indicator. Meanwhile, this week, Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, shared his vision for Shiba Inu’s future, emphasizing resilience and innovation. According to him, the launch of TREAT is just one piece of the puzzle in expanding the Shiba Inu ecosystem. On Thursday, Kusama’s mention of “building for the future” and the focus on utility memes that offer rewards and unlock new technologies like fully homomorphic encryption suggests a transformative period ahead for SHIB. At press time, SHIB was trading at $0.0000243, reflecting a 9.65% surge in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|SHIB|SHIBA INU,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|SHIB|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-17 20:54:00

In a new thread, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 763,900 followers on the social media platform X that even though the crypto king looks like it’s on the cusp of an impulsive move, it will likely still be outpaced by altcoins in the Ethereum ( ETH ) ecosystem. “Very likely we’ll see a new impulse on Bitcoin in the coming period. However, I think it’s more likely that we’ll see altcoins outperform Bitcoin, especially the ETH ecosystem. Lower yields, weaker dollar, progressive crypto regulation all fueling the market momentum.” According to the strategist, the current crypto cycle is more “complex” than the last, continuing a trend from the previous cycle. Van de Poppe says his strategy will involve maximizing his risk to altcoins as he believes they are about to break out. “I think that this bull cycle is more complex than the previous one. Just like 2021 was more complex than 2017, as everything literally kept going up in 2017. That’s why I’ve got a semi-active trading strategy. For now, I’ll be holding, but I’ll be trading actively on those altcoins making sure that I’m lowering my risk on the way up. At this point: I’d like to be maximally exposed to risk as we’re literally on the start of that upwards move for altcoins.” The top crypto asset by market cap is trading for $104,699 at time of writing, a 5.1% increase during the last 24 hours.

Climbing an impressive 14% since Sunday, the OG crypto was worth $105,681 at press time, per data from CoinGecko. It gained 3.8% in a single session. The crypto market is excited with anticipation as Trump prepares for his second inauguration, reportedly bringing pro-crypto policies into the White House. According to Bloomberg, the administration will name crypto as a national imperative or priority. It is also slated to create a crypto advisory council to advocate for the industry’s policy priorities, said the report. Crypto rallies ahead of Trump’s inauguration Bitcoin isn’t alone in its rise though. XRP skyrocketed to an all-time high of $3.40 on Thursday. Traders expect Ripple’s years-long legal battle with the SEC to end soon, fueling demand. At the same time, options markets signal a surge in volatility. The rally also coincides with a broader rebound in riskier investments, thanks to U.S. inflation data. Lower-than-expected readings for both the Producer Price Index (PPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) have eased fears of aggressive Federal Reserve action. U.S. stocks are also on a tear, notching their best week since Trump’s 2016 election. The S&P 500 rose 1% Friday morning, putting it on track for a 3% weekly gain. The Nasdaq Composite isn’t far behind, with a 2.4% increase, its best performance since December. Still, not everyone is convinced this rally will last. December’s strong jobs numbers left some market participants wary that the Fed could pause its rate-cutting cycle. Bank of America said, “We maintain our view that the Fed cutting cycle is over.” They pointed to strong consumer spending and a resilient economy as reasons the central bank might hold steady on rates.

Trump officially takes office on Jan. 20, and his campaign pledges, coupled with his selection of crypto advocates for key positions in his administration, signal a major opportunity for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and the broader crypto industry. Yoon made these remarks in comments shared with crypto.news on Jan. 17. Yoon views Trump’s inauguration as the beginning of a new chapter where the crypto industry may no longer face the negative consequences of regulation-by-enforcement. This has been a central grievance of the sector over the past four years, marked by actions from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other government agencies. In her commentary, Yoon highlighted that under Trump’s administration, crypto is unlikely to face the same regulation-by-enforcement approach that has defined the SEC’s actions in recent years. With several crypto-friendly figures set to occupy key positions in the new administration, Yoon is optimistic about a more collaborative and constructive environment for the industry. “I am hopeful that the Trump administration will usher in a new age where crypto isn’t handicapped by the current regulation-by-enforcement regime of the current and recent SEC commissioners. Rather, the expectation is that conversations will more likely have the opportunity to be open and beneficial, as opposed to the defensive and guarded nature of recent years,” she noted. Read more: Crypto to be made a national priority in rumored Trump executive order According to the Wormhole Foundation general counsel, Trump’s tapping of Paul Atkins to lead the SEC is also a major boost to the industry. Commenting on the overall crypto sentiment around SEC as Trump takes office, Cathy notes the top priority for the industry is regulatory clarity. “While new rules are considered, the space may be able to rely on favorable no-action relief or perhaps even a regulatory sandbox to allow projects to develop and establish themselves while free from enforcement action.” Clear rules will bolster overall adoption of crypto services and products, she concluded. This bullish take cuts across most of crypto, mainly after Donald Trump embraced crypto during his campaign. Notably, Trump emerged as a “Bitcoin president”, with his major promises to the ecosystem including the vow to end the SEC’s war on crypto. His pro-crypto administration will include Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy and Howard Lutnick. Musk’s comments on crypto, particularly Bitcoin and Dogecoin have helped catalyse the market. Meanwhile, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary Lutnick is the chief executive officer of Cantor Fitzgerald. He’s set to leave the firm , but said at Bitcoin 2024 that he owned BTC.

To read full editions, subscribe . President-elect Donald Trump has made a lot of promises for his first day in office, to the crypto industry and otherwise. With his inauguration just days away, let’s review some of his vows: Increase tariffs Trump’s proposed tariff plans have made headlines for months. In late November, though, he made a new promise: a 10% increase on China, plus 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. The latter two countries quickly signaled they were willing to negotiate. Just this week Trump said that the “External Revenue Service,” a new agency that would be tasked with collecting tariff income, will be created on Monday. We at Forward Guidance are of the belief that tariff increases will happen at a much slower pace, though. Commute Silk Road creator’s sentence Trump in May pledged to commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht, who has been serving a double life sentence plus 40 years since 2015. Ulbricht was convicted on seven federal counts including narcotics conspiracy and money laundering for his role in founding the Silk Road marketplace. Prosecutors also presented evidence during trial supporting allegations that Ulbricht had paid $730,000 in murder-for-hire fees, but he was not charged with this crime. Overturn SAB 121 Trump reportedly plans to reverse the SEC’s controversial SAB 121 guidance, which states that crypto custodians should list custodied assets as liabilities on their balance sheet. President Biden last year vetoed a bipartisan resolution that sought to do just this, arguing the legislation “would inappropriately constrain” the SEC.

Web3Bay (3BAY) is currently a focal point of excitement and interest in the cryptocurrency sector with a remarkable $800,000 raised in its presale and over 215 million tokens sold. Web3Bay’s Blueprint for the E-Commerce Revolution Despite Bitcoin’s validation as ‘digital gold’, it falls short in daily transactions. Web3Bay addresses this by integrating cryptocurrency with online shopping, simplifying and democratizing global e-commerce by eliminating hefty fees and complex bank interactions. Web3Bay’s hybrid payment system allows merchants to accept both fiat and cryptocurrencies, significantly lowering costs and speeding up transactions. This innovation provides a more affordable and quicker alternative to traditional online shops. With already more than $800,000 raised in its presale, Web3Bay is catching the eyes of many. The reduced token prices in the early stages are enticing investors, and upon its full launch, it’s set to bring millions into the crypto-shopping fold. Its user-friendly interface and international functionality position Web3Bay at the forefront of the next crypto adoption wave, offering a universally inclusive shopping experience. Enhanced Security at Web3Bay Instills Confidence In the cryptocurrency realm, security is paramount. Web3Bay addresses this with strong protocols that ensure both buyers and sellers are protected. The platform uses smart contracts for clear, automated transactions, reducing fraud risk and lessening dependency on central authorities. It utilizes multi-signature wallets and conducts regular audits to maintain high-security standards. Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, providing a permanent account of all user activities, which is crucial for trust, especially in a global marketplace. Regular stress tests and code audits boost the platform’s reliability further. Future plans include third-party certifications and more comprehensive AML/KYC processes, reinforcing the security framework necessary for a growing altcoin market. These measures reassure users about the safety of their data and transactions, making Web3Bay a preferred choice among crypto enthusiasts and regular users seeking a dependable platform. Empowering Users Through Decentralized Governance Web3Bay aims to be more than just an advanced marketplace; it seeks to empower its users. Holders of the 3BAY token can influence the platform by proposing and voting on significant updates, which might include new incentives, unique merchant partnerships, or extensions into NFTs and DeFi. Ideas originate in community forums, progressing to formal voting executed through smart contracts, ensuring that every token holder can impact Web3Bay’s direction. This shared governance cultivates loyalty and active participation, which in turn fuels the platform’s growth and attracts more users, enhancing the token’s value. Thus, Web3Bay nurtures a vibrant, community-driven ecosystem ripe for sustained success. Web3Bay: Bridging the Gap Between Crypto & Utility Web3Bay’s promising utility in real-world transactions goes beyond mere buying and selling. It aims to integrate NFT support, loyalty programs, and staking options, marrying traditional retail with Web3 innovations. The enthusiasm shown in the presale, with over 220 million tokens quickly sold, underscores robust market interest. As Web3Bay continues to evolve and introduces more features, its adoption is expected to surge. Envision a world where international sellers face fewer obstacles, transaction costs are slashed, and users dictate platform operations—this is Web3Bay’s vision, positioned perfectly to demonstrate the practical benefits of cryptocurrency in e-commerce at a time when Bitcoin is reaching record highs and revitalizing interest in blockchain applications. Web3Bay isn’t just competing in the altcoin market; it’s setting new standards for online shopping.

Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) could become the next viral memecoin. Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) by entering its contract address – GmW5qPRZ4TfoTw6U1KL9Btxn1uqXJJhieMAfeJk4wkbg – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPAI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-17 21:11:00

Legal Advisory 22-04 , issued by the Office of Government Ethics in 2022, has flown largely under the radar as part of the Biden administration's restrictive approach to crypto. Yet its impact could be profound: it effectively bars anyone holding cryptocurrencies, tokens, or stablecoins from federal service. For an incoming administration that promised to restore American competitiveness in financial innovation, this presents an immediate challenge. Key agencies like Treasury, SEC, CFTC, and the Federal Reserve will need officials who understand both traditional finance and digital assets. But the current ethics guidance forces potential appointees and civil servants to make an impossible choice: divest entirely from the sector or stay out of public service. The irony is striking. A Treasury official can hold investments in JP Morgan while working on banking policy, but they can't hold any amount of bitcoin while working on digital asset regulation. A SEC lawyer can own mutual funds while reviewing securities cases, but they can't hold even $100 in stablecoins. This creates an artificial barrier to recruiting experts precisely when their expertise is most needed. As Senior Director of Industry Affairs at the Blockchain Association, I work with more than 100 member companies at the forefront of financial innovation. Many of our members include professionals with deep government experience who could contribute valuable insights to federal service. Yet under current rules, their expertise remains off-limits unless they're willing to completely divest from the industry they know best. There's a straightforward solution: The Office of Government Ethics should modify its guidance to allow de minimis holdings of digital assets, similar to existing rules for traditional financial instruments. This would maintain ethical standards while opening the door to badly needed expertise. Alternatively, the incoming administration could simply rescind the advisory via executive order - a quick win that would signal a more balanced approach to crypto policy. The stakes are high. As countries like Singapore, Switzerland, and the UAE race to establish clear regulatory frameworks for digital assets, the U.S. government needs officials who understand both the opportunities and risks. Maintaining an overly broad ethics rule doesn't just handicap agencies - it undermines America's ability to lead in financial innovation. For an incoming administration focused on effective governance and American leadership in technology, addressing this barrier should be an early, easy-to-achieve priority. The alternative is watching crucial positions go unfilled or, worse, filled by those with limited understanding of one of the most transformative technologies of our time.",Opinion,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-17 21:13:30

From simplifying global transactions to reshaping how we think about asset tokenization, altcoins like Qubetics ($TICS), Litecoin (LTC), and Stellar (XLM) stand out as leaders in blockchain innovation. These projects go beyond just technology. Qubetics is unlocking the potential of real-world asset tokenization, Litecoin offers fast and reliable payment solutions, and Stellar enables low-cost cross-border transactions. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto investor or a curious newcomer, these are the top altcoins to buy this month . Let’s dive into what makes each of these projects unique and why they’re worth adding to your portfolio. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t just another cryptocurrency—it’s a complete game-changer. With its focus on real-world asset tokenization, Qubetics aims to bridge the gap between traditional assets and blockchain technology. Its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace provides a secure and user-friendly platform where businesses, professionals, and individuals can tokenize assets like real estate, intellectual property, or even physical goods. This innovation allows users to unlock liquidity, fractionalize ownership, and trade assets seamlessly on the blockchain. It’s a practical solution to a long-standing issue in the financial world—making illiquid assets tradable and accessible to a global audience. Qubetics has also partnered with SWFT Blockchain, adding another layer of interoperability and efficiency to its platform. Businesses, especially those managing international portfolios, will find Qubetics a powerful ally in streamlining asset management. The Qubetics presale has already gained significant traction. Now in its 17th stage, the project has raised over $9.7 million, with 421 million tokens sold to more than 14,700 holders. Investors can still grab $TICS tokens at just $0.0501 each, making it one of the top altcoins to buy this month. With its forward-thinking solutions, Qubetics is addressing the challenges that traditional financial systems have struggled to solve. It’s not just about blockchain—it’s about making blockchain work for the real world. Litecoin: The Digital Silver of Cryptocurrencies Litecoin (LTC) has long been considered the “silver” to Bitcoin’s “gold,” and it’s still one of the most trusted and widely-used cryptocurrencies out there. Designed to facilitate fast, low-cost payments, Litecoin offers a practical alternative to traditional banking systems. What sets Litecoin apart is its speed. With an average block time of just 2.5 minutes, Litecoin is significantly faster than Bitcoin, making it ideal for everyday transactions. Whether you’re paying for a cup of coffee or sending money across borders, Litecoin ensures quick and reliable processing. Litecoin’s commitment to innovation doesn’t stop there. Its adoption of new technologies like the Lightning Network has further enhanced its scalability and transaction speed. This means users can send payments instantly without worrying about network congestion or high fees. Beyond its technical advantages, Litecoin has built a solid reputation as a store of value. It’s widely accepted by merchants and platforms worldwide, making it a practical choice for both spending and saving. For anyone looking to diversify their crypto portfolio, Litecoin remains a strong contender and one of the top altcoins to buy this month. Stellar: Simplifying Cross-Border Payments Stellar (XLM) is all about creating a more inclusive financial system. Designed for fast and affordable cross-border payments, Stellar has become a go-to solution for remittance services and financial institutions looking to modernize their operations. The Stellar network is powered by its native cryptocurrency, Lumens (XLM), which facilitates transactions across the globe. With fees as low as 0.00001 XLM per transaction, Stellar makes international payments accessible to everyone, from small businesses to individual users. What makes Stellar stand out is its focus on connecting traditional financial systems with blockchain technology. Through partnerships with banks, payment processors, and even non-profits, Stellar is creating a global payment ecosystem that’s faster, cheaper, and more transparent than anything we’ve seen before. Stellar’s use cases go beyond remittances. It’s also being used to issue and manage digital assets, enabling organizations to tokenize fiat currencies, stocks, and even commodities. This versatility has positioned Stellar as a leader in the blockchain space and one of the top altcoins to buy this month. The Power of Real-World Asset Tokenization Real-world asset tokenization is a concept that’s transforming the financial industry, and Qubetics is at the forefront of this revolution. By tokenizing assets, Qubetics allows users to convert physical or traditional financial assets into digital tokens that can be traded on the blockchain. This technology isn’t just about convenience—it’s about creating new opportunities. Imagine owning a fraction of a high-value asset like a luxury property or a piece of fine art. With tokenization, these possibilities become a reality, opening up investments to a wider audience and enhancing liquidity in traditionally illiquid markets. Qubetics’ Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace makes this process accessible and secure, ensuring that users can tokenize and trade assets with confidence. This innovation is setting a new standard for blockchain applications , making Qubetics a project that’s not just forward-thinking but also practical. Conclusion: Why These Altcoins Deserve Your Attention The crypto market is full of possibilities, but Qubetics ($TICS), Litecoin (LTC), and Stellar (XLM) are truly in a league of their own. Qubetics is revolutionizing asset tokenization, offering solutions that are as innovative as they are practical. Litecoin continues to prove its worth as a fast, reliable payment method, while Stellar is making cross-border transactions accessible and affordable. With over 421 million tokens sold and more than $9.7 million raised, Qubetics’ presale is a rare opportunity to invest in a project with immense potential.

The regulation comes as the block plans to broaden disinformation laws. In 2022, the EU introduced a set of voluntary commitments for tech firms to cut disinformation. These would be made formal and into law under the Digital Services Act (DSA). The tech Google later changed its position Google has argued that these latest requirements are not a good fit for its services, adding that it will not be changing its content moderation policies to comply with the requirement. According to an Axios report, the tech giant wrote to the European Commission’s content and technology head Renate Nikolay explaining its position. In the letter, Google’s global affairs president Kent Walker told the Commission that Google would not be adding fact-checking to its search results and YouTube videos. “It simply is not appropriate or effective for the company.” Walker. Walker also pointed to Google’s existing system, which he believes works just fine, for example, he noted the platform’s successful content moderation during the 2022 elections as proof that its current approach is effective. However, Google had previously signed a set of EU voluntary commitments. The rules are there to reduce the impact of online disinformation, which is being formalized into laws under DSA. Resultantly, Walker said Google will also pull out all fact-checking commitments in the Code before the rules become law in the DSA Code of Conduct. This is not just a Google issue; it is part of a wider conversation about how much control tech platforms should have over the information that is seen online. Tech CEOs scout for support from Trump Google’s decision to withdraw from the voluntary commitments comes as US tech firms’ leaders including Google chief executive officer Sundar Pichai, have been trying to woo President-elect Donald Trump, with Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg urging him directly to combat EU regulatory enforcement. Last week, Meta announced it would stop fact-checking content and reduce its overall policing of speech. Similarly, since Elon Musk took over X (formerly Twitter) in 2022, he’s significantly relaxed the platform’s content moderation policies. Currently, the EU’s Code of Practice on Disinformation commits signatories to work with fact-checkers in all EU countries. This is to make their work available to users in all EU languages and cut financial incentives for spreading disinformation on their platforms. The code also compels companies to make it easier for users to recognize, understand, and flag disinformation, alongside labeling political ads and analyzing fake accounts, bots, and malicious deepfakes that spread disinformation. But the commitments are never legally binding. According to the EU, 40 online platforms have already signed the code including Microsoft, TikTok, Twitch, and Meta although the latter opted out of its fact-checking program in the US. X also pulled out after tech billionaire Elon Musk purchased the platform. The European Fact-Checking Standards Network said many other digital platforms that signed the voluntary disinformation code have been laidback about fulfilling their commitments. It is not clear if all the code’s requirements will be made official rules under the DSA. Lawmakers in the EU have been deliberating on the proposal with the online platforms signed to ascertain which commitments they will agree to follow. The code is not yet known when it will come into effect, but it is expected to come into force next month. As the debate around misinformation continues to heat up, Google’s refusal to comply with the EU’s demands is just the latest chapter in the ongoing conversation about the role of tech companies in managing online content. According to reactions, it seems clear that tech companies are not ready to take on the responsibility of fact-checking themselves, leaving the question of who should police online content still very much up in the air.

This has sparked backlash from the crypto industry, according to an Axios report. Cruz’s move, supported by Sens. Cynthia Lummis , Bill Hagerty, and Tim Sheehy, is part of a broader effort to repeal what Republicans call the “midnight rules” of the Biden administration. These regulations were finalized late last year, and the CRA gives Congress until mid-May to overturn them. CRA resolutions bypass Senate filibusters, requiring only majority votes in both chambers to pass, according to Axios.

This decision comes in response to overwhelming demand, with over 52 million tokens out of the total 100 million supply already sold. The extension offers prospective participants a limited-time opportunity to join the Hyperbridge network, with early buyers still eligible for bonuses. As Hyperbridge expands its reach, this extension provides a final window for supporters to secure their position within the ecosystem. 50% Bonus Already Claimed: Early participants who joined before the initial deadline secured a 50% token bonus, a testament to Hyperbridge’s commitment to rewarding early adoption. 15% Bonus Available: A limited opportunity remains for participants to receive a 15% bonus on their token purchase. “We’ve been thrilled by the incredible support from our community so far,” said Seun Lanlege, Founder of Polytope Labs. “Selling over 52 million tokens is a major milestone, and with the extension, we’re excited to welcome even more relayers into the Hyperbridge network before our Token Generation Event in Q1.” Hyperbridge’s mainnet launch marks a notable advancement in its journey toward transforming blockchain interoperability. The protocol has integrations with many ecosystems, including Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, BNB Chain, zkVerify, Gnosis, Bifrost, and more. The Gateway Token Bridge is already live, enabling secure, scalable cross-chain token transfers, messaging, and state queries. These integrations position Hyperbridge as a key contributor to the advancement of cross-chain applications. Hyperbridge is set to hold its Token Generation Event in Q1 2025, and participants in the IRO will be among the first to receive their tokens, unlocking opportunities to actively engage with the protocol. With its advanced zk-technology and focus on security, Hyperbridge has already seen rapid adoption, supported by integrations across major blockchain ecosystems. The protocol’s hub model ensures scalability and reliability, attracting developers, DAOs, and DeFi projects looking for robust cross-chain solutions. Regarding utility for the Hyperbridge token, $BRIDGE: a minimal BRIDGE token fee is required for transactions. So transactions such as cross-chain messages, storage queries, and state reads will use the token. Tokens collected as transaction fees are used to fund incentives and rewards for both relayers and block producers. Hence the token is planned to have zero inflation. The token will also be used for governance.

39110509,https://blockworks.co/news/solana-under-trump-presidency,1737149400,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,What’s to come for Solana under a Trump presidency?,https://blockworks.co/news/solana-under-trump-presidency,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Donald Trump begins his second term as President of the United States on Monday, and after an expensive campaign season, crypto will finally get its president. Bitcoin gained momentum following Trump’s victory, largely due to his pledge to create a strategic bitcoin reserve that would see the US Treasury Department accumulate nearly 5% of all bitcoin. But Trump taking office may still reap benefits for a less reserve asset and more use case focused network in Solana, industry participants say. SOL is up 19% on the week leading up to Trump’s inauguration. The asset spiked 5% right after the New York Post reported the incoming president is “receptive to the idea” of a second strategic crypto reserve of tokens founded in the US like SOL, XRP, and USDC. On that point, listen: I’m receptive to the idea of playing in the NBA, but that doesn’t mean you’ll see me suiting up for the Knicks this weekend. I think Paradigm’s vice president Alexander Grieve was prescient on the America-first crypto reserve. “View such stories with skepticism until it comes from [Trump] or his staff,” Grieve wrote in an X post yesterday. “And question why such details might be in the press in [the] first place—[and] who might have put them there.” There was other reporting on the Trump-crypto front that felt much more plausible this week however. Reuters reported that under President Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission would “potentially freeze” crypto litigation that does not come with allegations of fraud. The SEC sued Coinbase and Binance in 2023, alleging that the crypto exchanges operated as unregistered broker-dealers for facilitating the trading of SOL, among other tokens. In defining SOL as a security, Gary Gensler’s SEC essentially said that US firms that exchange the token are breaking the law. This is because it has only given out two of its special purpose broker-dealer licenses, and neither of those recipients offer SOL. The SEC already dropped its Solana allegations from the Binance suit, but if the Coinbase enforcement were to also be frozen, then a potential major obstacle to the network’s adoption would be cleared. With Solana’s unregistered security issues seemingly being put to bed, some are already looking ahead to SOL ETFs that would see regulated Solana investment vehicles trade on public stock exchanges. Polymarket bettors give SOL ETFs a 75% chance of being approved in 2025, although Sol Strategies CEO Leah Wald said she doesn’t expect Solana ETFs to be approved “anytime soon” in a recent interview with Blockworks’ Katherine Ross. There’s also arguably a more intangible benefit to come for Solana under a Trump presidency and friendlier regulatory regime. When SOL’s regulatory status was uncertain, developers largely focused on facilitating memecoin trading, which was “effectively a form of protest” against regulatory unclarity coming from the SEC, Titus Capilnean, vice president of go-to-market at Civic Technologies, said. With Trump in office, crypto “may see a shift from pure speculation to utility-driven growth as builders gain confidence to launch more sophisticated applications without fear of regulatory backlash,” Capilnean said. Many US Solana builders have told me over the last year that with regulatory clarity, their products would stand a much better chance of finding product-market fit. Here’s their chance to prove it.

The Dogecoin forecast highlights notable price increases from January to December, signaling bullish growth in this year’s Second Quarter (Q2). Dogecoin Price Prediction From January To December According to CoinCodex’s price projections, Dogecoin is expected to start 2025 with modest growth, reaching a minimum target of $0.352 and a maximum of $0.386 by January. This predicted price suggests a potential Return On Investment (ROI) of approximately 6.7%, as of writing. Related Reading: BONK Price Ready To Surge 1,105% From Here? Analyst Reveals Key Levels To Watch By February, however, Dogecoin is projected to experience a slight fluctuation, dropping to a minimum price of $0.355. It is also projected to see a maximum potential surge to $0.368, marking an 11% ROI. Dogecoin’s most remarkable price run is anticipated to occur during March and April. In March, Dogecoin is forecasted to reach a maximum price of $1, representing approximately 152.07% in ROI. This price increase is expected to be followed by an even more impressive growth in April, pushing DOGE above $1, with an ROI of 168.2%. By May 2025, Dogecoin is expected to stabilize around the $0.74 price level, reflecting a new ATH and a 79.15% ROI surge. The summer months also show a steady growth rate, with June projected to see a maximum Dogecoin price of $0.58 and a minimum of $0.50. This target represents a significant decline from its projected peak in Q1 2025. Moreover, Dogecoin is expected to yield a total ROI of 39.63%. In July and August, Dogecoin’s price could rise to a maximum of $0.70 and $0.67, respectively. These price surges are also expected to generate a significant ROI of 70.9% in July and 64.3% in August. The latter part of 2025 suggests more tempered gains, with September’s Dogecoin price estimates at $0.6, October at $0.58, and November at $0.5, on average. Each month is projected to yield significant ROIs of 56.76%, 53.46%, and 26.78%, respectively. By December, Dogecoin is predicted to close the year at a minimum price of $0.47, a maximum of $0.52, or an average of $49. This reflects a 26.28% ROI; however, it also indicates a significant decline from previous projected highs during the early months of 2025. While CoinCodex predicts Dogecoin’s price from January to December 2025, it also advises taking short positions for the first two months of the year. On the other hand, investors are urged to adopt a buy strategy from March through December, aligning with the anticipated bullish trend.

Based on this predicted range, Dogecoin’s average price target for 2025 is $0.564, marking a potential ROI of 171.52% compared to current market rates.

The punishment is tied to accusations that the crypto conglomerate and its former CEO, Soichiro “Michael” Moro, misled investors about the financial health of its operations. Even though the SEC will soon come under new leadership, the Gary Gensler administration has found time to bring pain to the implicated Digital Currency Group (DCG) and its subsidiary Genesis. The charges originate from the alleged negligence of public disclosures and financial maneuvers following the collapse of one of Genesis’ largest borrowers, Three Arrows Capital (3AC), in mid-2022. How DCG ended up on the SEC’s radar The SEC’s case against DCG is based on the company’s actions after 3AC defaulted on a $2.4 billion loan, which left Genesis with a considerable financial shortfall. The commission claims that DCG executives had prior knowledge that Genesis had suffered losses exceeding $1 billion but worked hard to make things look okay. Part of their efforts to trick investors included approving tweets and public statements that implied Genesis’ balance sheet was “strong” and claimed the risks associated with 3AC’s default had been mitigated. DCG reportedly executed a $1.1 billion promissory note to push the narrative and artificially inflate Genesis’s balance sheet. According to the SEC, while the note created an accounting asset, it did not involve a tangible capital transfer, and its terms were not disclosed to investors. This way, Genesis could report positive equity as of June 30, 2022, even though it was in a precarious financial position at the time. So when the firm fully suspended withdrawals, citing an inability to meet redemption requests a few months later in November 2022, investors were blindsided. By January 2023, DCG had filed for bankruptcy, leaving investors and retail customers with huge losses. The company’s CEO caught some blowback As part of the penalties of its investigation, the SEC also sanctioned Soichiro “Michael” Moro, DCG’s CEO at the time. According to the filing, Moro approved misleading statements and was party to crafting public communications that made light of the severity of Genesis’ financial troubles. The SEC claims Moro personally approved tweets asserting that Genesis had “shed the risk” related to 3AC’s default and that its balance sheet was still robust. The commission maintains both claims were false and DCG could not account for Genesis’s significant financial exposure. Moro also signed the $1.1 billion promissory note on behalf of Genesis, further pushing the misleading narrative to investors. He faces a fine of $500,000 and is barred from engaging in negligent conduct that misleads investors. DCG has had past scraps with regulators In 2023, New York Attorney General Letitia James sued Gemini, Genesis, and later its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), over a Gemini crypto lending program named Gemini Earn. The allegations claim they defrauded over 29,000 New Yorkers and hid $1.1 billion in losses. Genesis, which filed for bankruptcy in 2023, disclosed $10 billion in liabilities and owed $3 billion to its top creditors, including Gemini and VanEck, before it completed its restructuring in August 2024. According to the lawsuit, Gemini was aware right from the program’s inception that Genesis loans were high-risk and concentrated among a small number of third parties—specifically Alameda Research, FTX’s sibling company. Genesis was caught in the FTX fiasco in November 2022 and was forced to file for bankruptcy two months later. Gemini Earn customers lost about $900 million. The attorney general claims Gemini did not alert customers of its risk exposure and that Genesis and DCG failed to assess the quality of the loans they approved. Then, they attempted to conceal losses incurred in mid-2022 when hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and another smaller counterparty defaulted on loans amounting to $1.1 billion.

Hard forks on Ethereum test networks Sepolia and Holesky, and new client releases for the Pectra network upgrade have been scheduled for February. If the hard forks are successful, the mainnet launch will proceed in March. Ethereum developers decided to split the Pectra upgrade into two packages in Sept. 2024 after realizing that it was too ambitious to implement all planned changes at once. The proposed March launch will implement the first Pectra package, with the second package (the Fusaka upgrade) to come later in the year.

Notably, on Thursday, the third largest crypto asset by market capitalization asset reached $3.39, with a market cap of just over $190 billion, following a series of favorable developments in its ongoing legal battle with the SEC. XRP’s explosive growth has also been attributed to renewed optimism about regulatory clarity and increased institutional adoption of RippleNet. Open interest in XRP futures hit a record $7.7 billion, reflecting heightened trading activity. Following XRP’s remarkable surge, some analysts are speculating whether Cardano (ADA) c ould be next in line for a similar breakout. On Thursday, prominent analyst “CryptoBullet” highlighted a striking similarity between Cardano’s current price action and XRP’s recent bullish pattern. “Looks like ADA is going to follow XRP as its printing the same Bullish Pennant,” CryptoBullet tweeted, suggesting that, if the pattern completes its mature move target, ADA could potentially surge by over 400% in the next few weeks. Another expert, “World of Charts,” echoed this sentiment, suggesting ADA could surge toward $2 in the short term if it breaks out of its current bullish pennant. Elsewhere, the analyst “Cardano Hieronymus” suggested that ADA’s price action might mirror its 2021 performance, as the current formation appears to replicate an exact pennant pattern from that time. Notably, in 2021, $ADA skyrocketed from $0.18 to $3.10, achieving an impressive 1,622% surge. Beyond technical indicators, several key fundamentals bolster ADA’s bullish momentum. Notably, the cryptocurrency recently added over $1 billion in market capitalization within a single day, and its price reached $1.11. This growth is attributed to optimism around crypto regulations in the U.S. after Trump assumes office, whale accumulation, and ongoing developments in Cardano’s Layer 2 solutions, which aim to improve scalability, security, and privacy. On Tuesday, technical analyst Ali Martinez revealed significant whale activity, with whales accumulating 100 million ADA in 48 hours, fueling the current upward trend. Later on Thursday, Martinez further reported that whales had added another 30 million ADA in just the last 24 hours. This consistent accumulation throughout the month underscores growing confidence among large investors. As XRP sustains its impressive rally, the crypto community is turning its attention to Cardano, speculating whether history could repeat itself. A decisive breakout above the multi-month resistance at $1.15 might signal the beginning of a major upward trend, potentially driving ADA to a new all-time high. ADA traded at $1.16 at press time, reflecting a 3.86% gain over the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,ADA|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-17 21:35:44

While some coins take a breather (looking at you, Peanut the Squirrel and Goatseus Maximus), others, like BTFD Coin, are rocketing toward the moon with undeniable momentum. The presale game is strong right now, and smart investors know that jumping in early can lead to astronomical rewards. One presale stealing all the headlines? BTFD Coin. With a presale price of $0.000142, over $5.2 million raised, and analysts forecasting a jaw-dropping 4,000% ROI , it’s no wonder people are calling it the best crypto presale to buy now. And let’s not forget its vibrant community, high-APY staking, and P2E gaming ecosystem—all of which make this a meme coin masterpiece. BTFD Coin: The Bullish Pick of the Presale Season When it comes to presales, timing is everything, and BTFD Coin is showing up right on time. With over 64 billion tokens sold and its presale storming into the 13th stage, it’s clear this coin is no fleeting trend—it’s a movement. Analysts predict that BTFD Coin has the potential to deliver life-changing returns for those who jump in early. Here’s the math: Let’s say you invest $4,000 at today’s price of $0.000142. That gets you approximately 28,169,014 BTFD tokens. If the price hits $0.0006 (a conservative target), your investment skyrockets to $16,901. Now, if it surges to $0.006—a whopping 4,000% ROI—you’re sitting on a mind-blowing $169,014. But BTFD Coin isn’t just about the numbers; it’s about creating an ecosystem that resonates with both investors and the community. With its vibrant Bulls Squad —Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull—at the forefront, BTFD Coin is fostering a sense of camaraderie that’s hard to find in the crypto space. Add in its P2E gaming feature and a high staking APY of 90%, and it’s clear why this presale is the talk of the town. The FOMO is real, folks. With each stage of the presale, the price inches higher, leaving early investors with bigger smiles—and bigger bags. Peanut the Squirrel: A Nutty Dip Worth Watching Peanut the Squirrel may be down 4.6% in the last 24 hours, but true crypto enthusiasts know dips often mean opportunities. Currently priced at $0.607899, with a trading volume of $237 million, this quirky coin has carved out a dedicated fanbase. Its market cap of $607.8 million and nearly 1 billion coins in circulation show it has a solid foundation. While Peanut’s latest dip might seem discouraging, seasoned investors see this as a chance to grab more nuts for their stash. The coin’s playful branding and steady market presence make it a strong contender in the meme coin arena. After all, even squirrels need time to gather strength before climbing higher. Goatseus Maximus: A Majestic Dip in the Making Goatseus Maximus, another fan favorite, is currently trading at $0.362709 after a 4.37% dip in the last 24 hours. Its trading volume of $85.8 million and a circulating supply nearing 1 billion coins keep it firmly in the spotlight. With a market cap of $362.7 million, GOAT maintains a loyal following of investors who see long-term potential. GOAT’s name alone inspires confidence—it’s a bold nod to being the “Greatest of All Time.” This coin’s journey may have hit a temporary snag, but every great legend needs a moment of regrouping before charging forward. Its performance over time has shown resilience, making it a meme coin worth keeping an eye on. Why BTFD Coin Stands Out While PNUT and GOAT recalibrate, BTFD Coin is charging ahead, breaking presale records and building a robust ecosystem. The coin’s ability to pair fun and functionality is what truly sets it apart. Its presale success isn’t just a fluke—it’s a testament to its well-planned roadmap and innovative features like staking and the P2E game . And then there’s the community. The Bulls Squad doesn’t just represent the coin; they embody its spirit. Whether it’s Baby Bull’s optimism or Nerdy Bull’s savvy, each character adds a layer of relatability that draws investors in. Combine that with the coin’s ability to deliver jaw-dropping returns, and it’s easy to see why analysts are calling BTFD Coin one of the best crypto presales to buy now. The Final Word: Seize the Bull by the Horns by Joining One of the Best Crypto Presales to Buy Now The crypto market moves fast, and presales like BTFD Coin’s don’t last forever. With its price at $0.000142 and the potential for a 4,000% ROI, now is the time to act. PNUT and GOAT may have taken a short-term hit, but BTFD Coin is all about the long game, and the Bulls are leading the charge. Don’t miss your chance to join one of the most exciting presales of 2025. Connect your wallet, grab your tokens, and prepare for the moonshot. The next stage is just around the corner, and with it, higher prices.

With an extremely tight majority in the House of Representatives, the replacement of the two Florida Republicans is paramount to the party's political agenda in Congress. Crypto super PAC Fairshake — through its affiliate PAC, Defend American Jobs — has begun spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on pro-crypto names in the special elections set to fill the seats. Gaetz was briefly President-elect Donald Trump's pick for U.S. attorney general — the nation's highest law enforcement official — but he resigned from consideration and from Congress as pressures mounted from a House ethics investigation into his alleged payments for drugs and sex (including a report of sexual activity with a 17-year-old). Trump turned to embrace the state's chief financial officer, Jimmy Patronis , as his favored candidate to fill the resulting opening in the House of Representatives. Patronis , who is outpacing a crowded field of Republican rivals in the January 28 primary, is benefiting from about $200,000 in ad spending from Fairshake, the group said. In October, Patronis pushed for putting some state pension money into crypto investments. The PAC also committed about $500,000 to get state Senator Randy Fine to fill Representative Waltz's vacancy. Trump also backed Fine in an endorsement that reportedly scattered a number of potential competitors . The candidate posted on social media site X this week that ""Floridians want crypto innovation!"" Super PACs can buy ads for or against candidates, as long as they're ""independent expenditures"" not approved or coordinated by the candidates. Fairshake spent $139 million to help get 53 allies into the new session of Congress, so one in ten of the sitting lawmakers benefited from crypto-funded ads. ""We are keeping our foot on the gas,"" Fairshake spokesman Josh Vlasto said on Friday. The PAC still has a towering $103 million in funds at its disposal for the next congressional election cycle, putting it far ahead for the 2026 races.

The launch of its beta platform has not only caught the attention of seasoned investors but also sparked a wave of enthusiasm among crypto enthusiasts and AI advocates. RCO Finance’s strategic entry into the crypto AI market The crypto AI market saw significant growth in Q4 2024, with its market cap soaring 220% to $53.4 billion.

This indicates a potential return on investment of over 700% for those participating during the current presale phase. Apart from early access to the beta platform, investors can also benefit from staking RCOF tokens to earn attractive APYs. Additionally, RCOF holders may receive discounts on trading fees and gain access to governing rights over the project’s future direction.

It puts it in the same league as Wall Street tech giants like Amazon and Alphabet. The shareholder vote to approve this proposal is set for January 21, and with Saylor controlling 47% of the voting power, the outcome seems inevitable at this point. If it goes through, Bloomberg reports that MicroStrategy will have more authorized shares than all but four of the largest players in the Nasdaq 100 (Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon). The company has doubled its Bitcoin holdings in less than a year. Now it’s worth over $44 billion, after ten straight weeks of purchases. Saylor’s ambitious bet on Bitcoin Back in October, MicroStrategy announced a $42 billion plan to buy Bitcoin over three years. By using an at-the-market share issuance program and debt sales, the company is reportedly already two-thirds of the way through its $21 billion allotment for stock issuance. While most Wall Street companies would shy away from diluting their shares to this extent, MicroStrategy is leaning in hard. Analysts like Ed Clissold of Ned Davis Research admit this would normally “not be viewed positively” because it dilutes earnings per share and voting rights. But traditional metrics don’t seem to apply to MicroStrategy anymore. Its stock has soared more than 2,500% since it jumped into Bitcoin in 2020, compared to Bitcoin’s own 800% gain. Clearly, the market sees something it likes. But there’s more to the story. Class A shareholders don’t hold much sway here. Most of the company’s voting power lies with Saylor’s Class B shares. This lopsided power dynamic means Saylor can keep steering the company without much pushback. Why investors aren’t pushing back MicroStrategy isn’t facing backlash from shareholders over this plan. Instead, it has become a darling of Wall Street. Hedge funds have jumped in, buying up its fixed-income securities for convertible arbitrage strategies. This demand has allowed the company to issue $6.2 billion in convertibles this year alone, with another $6.5 billion in equity offerings still available under its current plan. But Goldman Sachs analysts believe that MicroStrategy’s appeal as a leveraged Bitcoin play might fade if the company relies too heavily on equity instead of debt. Even Saylor himself has admitted this, calling for “more intelligent leverage” in a December interview with Bloomberg. He added that: “We have $7.2 billion dollars of converts, but $4 billion of them are essentially equity, they’re through the strike price, the call price, and they are trading with a delta of approximately 100%, they are looking like equity.” Meanwhile, he has stayed coy about any direct ties to the incoming administration. When asked if he’s met with Trump, Saylor deflected but admitted he’s spoken with “a lot of people” connected to the administration. He also expressed openness to joining the White House’s crypto advisory council, saying, “If I’m asked to serve, I would probably do so.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",News|BTC|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-17 21:55:30

Table of Contents Rollblock keeps soaring higher XRP poised for a breakthrough Cardano price forecast Solana eyes a much-needed rebound Conclusion As Donald Trump’s inauguration draws closer, things are shaping up for the crypto market. In addition to the appointment of Paul Atkins as the Chair of SEC, another pro-crypto entity, Congressman Tom Emmer has been appointed chairman of the House Subcommittee on digital assets, financial technology, and artificial intelligence. Crypto prices are expected to explode with these new developments. How will this affect XRP, Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and the upcoming crypto Rollblock (RBLK)? Rollblock keeps soaring higher Rollblock’s aim is to transform the $450 billion GambleFi market. It is a crypto casino that leverages blockchain technology to promote transparency and self empowerment. It will also offer a swathe of exciting games, numerous bonuses, rakebacks, and other offers to enrich the experience of its users. Taking things a step further, Rollblock will operate a revenue sharing model. Each week a part of the money it generates will be shared amongst RBLK holders, a strategy that fosters community participation and incentivizes engagement. Due to these features, the Rollblock presale has been a huge success. Over 45 million tokens have been sold, raising $8.5 million. Available at $0.045, RBLK is set to surge this January, with early investors potentially pocketing ROIs exceeding 1,500%. XRP poised for a breakthrough Ripple has seen renewed optimism owing to the incoming pro-crypto government administration. With crypto backers in top government positions, it is likely that the SEC will withdraw its case against Ripple, and this could send XRP on a strong rally. XRP is well-positioned to pass its all-time high of $3.7. According to experts, XRP might break above $3.5 in January and could go as high as $5.85 if the market stays favorable.

Cardano’s status in the crypto space, its massive community, and consistent innovation have been highlighted as factors that could push ADA up. Solana eyes a much-needed rebound Solana is on a path to recovery, having depreciated from its ATH of $263 to $180 levels in the last couple of months. While things are still quiet right now, experts believe a SOL rally will materialize as Donald Trump’s inauguration draws closer. The crypto experts envision SOL hitting $200 before the month ends, buoyed by bullish market sentiments. A sustained rally could see Solana hit $240, with the possibility of eclipsing past its ATH. Conclusion Crypto price forecasts for January are bullish, with ADA, SOL, and XRP expected to rally strongly. However, RBLK is the standout option for the biggest gains. Its presale has been an investor magnet, and for $0.046 a pop, it offers a massive room for appreciation. For more information on Rollblock, visit their website or socials .

The coin is changing hands for $3.277, atop a marginal growth of 0.16%. Just about three months ago, the price of XRP traded flat, around $0.3522. From that price to date, it has skyrocketed by 503%. Many traders with an XRP portfolio are currently “in the money.” However, analysts are optimistic that XRP may retest its 2017 growth rally, in which case, even a 20,000 XRP holding may change someone’s financial future. Is XRP’s 3 Months Rally Enough for Retirement? A 20,000 XRP bought three months ago would have cost approximately $7,084 based on the $0.3522 price floor. Today, that same 20,000 XRP holding would be worth $65,540 at the current price level. Recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey shows the average retirement income per household in the US is slightly less than $28,000. Notably, this figure varies according to different metrics. Drawing on this, an XRP trader who invested 20,000 XRP three months ago might be better than the average American per retirement pot savings. However, when adjusted for inflation, these funds might not be enough to change anyone’s financial future. Many wonder if buying XRP today can change one’s financial future if the historic trend from 2017 plays out. The XRP 2017 Price Rally and Projection According to market Strategist Bobby A, XRP appears to be cutting its percentage point increases by half compared to 2017. The analyst shared data showing XRP’s range-high breakout in 2017, when the coin jumped by 629%. XRP appears to be cutting its percentage point increases in half compared to its 2017 market cycle. From its range-high breakout in 2017, as illustrated by the horizontal black dashed line above, XRP initially appreciated by 629%. From its range-high breakout in 2024, XRP has… pic.twitter.com/Cz7guxjFus — Bobby A (@Bobby_1111888) January 1, 2025 From that point, the coin recorded a series of bullish breakouts with a focal point around its 4.236 extension in the charts shared. With its impressive growth cycles at the time, XRP soared by 1,330%. With the XRP price going parabolic lately, there are speculations on whether it could hit a $5 target . To Bobby A, the coin can even aim to soar high to $15 if it could pull a similar 665% increase. In this scenario, 20,000 XRP units may make a financial difference to an investor. Today, this exact amount will cost $65,540. However, should it repeat the 2017 trend and soar to $15, it would be worth $300,000. This sum, adjusted for cost price, could make a difference for an average investor. The Key Catalysts to Watch Considering its enormous supply, growing from its current price level to 15 dollars is not a small feat. However, Ripple Labs is boosting the role of XRP within its ecosystem through new product offerings. One such product is the RLUSD stablecoin , an asset pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. With the stablecoin, the firm hopes to drive intense payment liquidity, which will indirectly impact XRP trading. Ripple Labs is also working on enhancing the XRP Ledger (XRPL). From upgrades and liquidity pools to Real World Asset Tokenization (RWA), the firm hopes to add more use cases that can fuel XRP’s appeal in the market. Also, the clamor for an XRP ETF product is growing, a product that will open the coin to institutional investors. Beyond all this, there is speculation that XRP could feature in a new altcoin national reserve alongside Solana in the United States. If actualized, this could impact the price of the coin.

Whales Purchase Over $1 Billion in ETH appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The overall cryptocurrency market has shown strong bullish potential ahead of President-elect and pro-crypto advocate Donald Trump’s inauguration, scheduled for January 20, 2025. However, one thing that has been capturing the massive attention of crypto enthusiasts is the recent activity of crypto giants over the past week. Whales Purchase Over $1 Billion in ETH Recently, a prominent crypto expert posted on X (formerly Twitter), revealing that whales have purchased over a billion dollars worth of Ethereum (ETH) in the past week. The expert stated that more than 330,000 ETH, valued at over $1 billion, has been acquired by these crypto whales.

However, experts and analysts are already speculating that the crypto market could experience a significant surge following the inauguration day. In the meantime, there is also a possibility of profit booking as the market has been rising over the past few days. However, only time will tell where the market will head after this upcoming political event. Current Price Momentum and Rising Participation Currently, ETH has crossed the $3,500 mark and is trading near $3,515. It has experienced a price surge of over 5.5% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, it has attracted significant traders and investors, resulting in an 11% jump in trading volume. Ethereum (ETH) Price Action and Key Levels With the impressive price surge, ETH has once again reached the crucial resistance level of $3,500, where it previously experienced a price reversal. According to expert technical analysis, if ETH breaches this resistance level and closes a daily candle above $3,550, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 15% to reach the $4,100 mark in the coming days.
