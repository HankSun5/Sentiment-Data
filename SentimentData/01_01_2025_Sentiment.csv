The reason? Elon Musk. Earlier today, Musk changed his profile picture on Twitter (now X) to an image of Pepe the Frog, a famous internet meme linked to $PEPE. This small action got huge attention and pushed the $PEPE price up quickly. This shows how big names like Elon Musk can influence the crypto market. The sudden price spike has many people asking if this is the start of a new altcoin season. Let’s see what this could mean and which coin might rise next. Is Altcoin Season Starting? Altcoin season is when altcoins (cryptos other than Bitcoin) perform better than Bitcoin. Memecoins like $PEPE often signal the start of such a season. When a memecoin skyrockets, it means more people are jumping into the market, which could lead to other altcoins rising too.Elon Musk’s effect on $PEPE’s price might lead to similar moves in other coins. With more money and interest flowing into the market, other altcoins might soon follow the bullish trend. What Coin Could Rise Next? While $PEPE is in the spotlight now, another coin showing potential is Altura ($ALU). Altura is a blockchain platform leveraging AI technology to revolutionize various industries, especially gaming and digital ownership. Here’s why Altura could be the next big winner. Altura’s Price and Future Potential Altura’s price has been steady recently, but trading volume and interest are growing. The project stands out for integrating AI solutions to enhance user experiences and optimize digital asset management. This forward-thinking approach is gaining traction, making Altura a strong candidate for significant growth. The coin’s price is building a solid base, and experts say it could break resistance levels soon. If it does, $ALU could see a big price jump, possibly over 50% in the near future. Why Altura Stands Out 1. AI Integration: Altura uses AI to create smarter and more efficient solutions, appealing to a wide range of users and developers.2. Innovative Applications: Its AI-powered tools are transforming industries like gaming and digital ownership.3. Market Interest: As people look for the next big opportunity after $PEPE, Altura’s cutting-edge technology makes it a strong contender. Final Thoughts $PEPE’s massive rise today shows how fast the crypto market can react to news and trends. It could also be a sign of more opportunities in altcoins. As attention shifts, Altura($ALU) is one coin that stands out with its innovative use of AI and growing popularity.If you’re exploring altcoin opportunities, keep an eye on Altura. With its focus on AI-driven solutions, it might be the next big winner after $PEPE. Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

As the case progresses, speculation is mounting about how its resolution could influence the token’s future price, with some projecting significant gains. Ripple vs. SEC: Case Developments The legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been a defining factor for XRP since the lawsuit was initiated in December 2020. A pivotal moment occurred on July 13, 2023, when Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security, marking a significant regulatory milestone. This ruling temporarily boosted the token’s market value, although uncertainties lingered. Subsequently, a final judgment was issued in August 2024. However, the SEC filed an appeal on October 17, contesting parts of the earlier decision. According to court schedules, the SEC must submit its opening brief by January 15, 2025, keeping the case in the spotlight. Some observers speculate that the potential appointment of Paul Atkins, a nominee of President-elect Donald Trump as SEC Chair could expedite a resolution. If such a scenario unfolds, the conclusion of the case could have a profound effect on the token’s price trajectory. XRP Price Predictions and Analysis Prominent XRP supporter Digital Asset Investor (DAI) recently explored potential outcomes for XRP’s value post-litigation. Consulting an AI tool, DAI examined historical price patterns linked to the lawsuit’s developments. When the SEC filed charges in December 2020, XRP’s value dropped sharply from $0.50 to $0.17—a 66% decline. Based on this precedent, the AI model suggested a favorable resolution could trigger an equivalent upward move. Given the token’s current price of approximately $2.07, such an increase could push its value to $3.44. DAI emphasized that the case’s conclusion could catalyze renewed investor interest, potentially driving further gains. However, the AI model cautioned that other variables, including market sentiment, broader regulatory trends, and Ripple’s operational progress, could also play a role in shaping the token’s performance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Market Perspectives Other analysts have presented more ambitious forecasts for the asset. In October, EGRAG Crypto proposed that the asset could reach a worst-case scenario price of $6 during the current bull market. Similarly, Alex Clay has suggested it might eventually climb to $10 if favorable conditions align. These projections highlight the significant attention the token continues to receive, not only as a digital asset but also as a key player in regulatory discussions shaping the cryptocurrency market. As the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit moves into its appeal phase, market participants remain optimistic about its potential. While no exact timeline for the case’s resolution exists, its outcome is expected to have a considerable impact on the asset’s value. Whether through regulatory clarity, increased adoption, or improved market sentiment, the token’s future hinges on legal and market developments in the coming months.

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-31 22:25:00

The proposed blockchain would position its native AI16Z token as the base currency for an interconnected ecosystem centered on artificial intelligence. The Proposal A governance forum post shows that the AI platform is exploring the development of a project similar to Pump.fun to facilitate the launch of AI agents. Additionally, the team is considering positioning AI16Z as an L1 blockchain tailored for artificial intelligence applications. Participants in the discussion view the proposed launchpad as a key mechanism to implement “flywheel” tokenomics to increase the value of AI16Z. They proposed several approaches to achieve the goal, including taking a percentage of launch fees, requiring AI16Z holdings for allocation, leveraging the token for initial agent offerings, and pairing agent tokens with it in liquidity pools. Moreover, developers and projects would receive ecosystem funds, revenue-sharing opportunities, third-party launchpad support, and AI16Z’s inherent value. Additionally, buyback and burn strategies funded by platform fees are under consideration to accrue value to the token. To ensure quality and alignment with ecosystem goals, the team is also contemplating a community-driven “curation” process, where supporters would vet projects before launching through mechanisms such as staking and slashing. The post emphasized that the main goal is to create an interconnected ecosystem where various products contribute to one another’s value, all intrinsically tied to the AI16Z token. AI16Z Token’s Rapid Growth AI16Z identifies itself as “the first investment DAO led by AI agents,” leveraging its flagship AI operating system, Eliza, to combine artificial and collective intelligence in making investment decisions. According to CoinGecko data , the token’s market cap has surged past the $1.8 billion mark. At the time of writing, it was trading at $1.69 after earlier hitting a new all-time high (ATH) of $1.77. While about 5.7% below the ATH, its current price is still a massive 380% improvement in the past month. Further, a report by VanEck showed the Web3 ecosystem now hosts approximately 10,000 AI agents, collectively generating millions of dollars in weekly earnings through on-chain activities. The asset manager projects that blockchain networks’ AI agent population could surpass 1 million by the end of 2025. Additionally, recent insights from the Web3 analytics platform Dexu AI reveal that AI-driven technologies, led by AI16Z, generated an impressive 72.2% return over the past month. Previously, the cryptocurrency was one of the poor performers among tokens launched on Binance Alpha, dropping 18.5% of its value before rediscovering its footing. Its uptick may not come as a surprise, with Bitfinex recently hinting that such tokens could change the crypto space as more people use them to execute transactions, optimize their investment strategies, and manage their crypto wallets.

Table of Contents Catzilla’s roar: A game-changing meme coin for the brave Ethereum Conclusion Large Ethereum investors are making significant moves towards a new presale cryptocurrency. This emerging digital asset is capturing attention for its potential to deliver exceptional returns by 2025. Many are eager to uncover what makes this opportunity so enticing. Catzilla’s roar: A game-changing meme coin for the brave In a crypto world dominated by fleeting trends and elusive fortunes, Catzilla arrives as a game-changer. Born from the chaos of meme culture and powered by the ambitions of its community, Catzilla isn’t just another coin — it’s a call to arms for crypto warriors ready to conquer the market. Catzilla’s presale is no ordinary launch — it’s a thrilling 14-stage journey where early believers can claim their stake. Each stage ramps up the excitement and token value, offering up to 700% gains. But here’s the twist: time waits for no one. Only the boldest will secure their piece of this notable opportunity before Catzilla dominates the scene. The crypto spotlight has long been on dog-themed coins, but it’s time for the cats to shine. Coins like MEW and Popcat have already proven that feline-themed cryptos are no joke: MEW climbed an impressive 103.7% in just three months. Popcat leapt to fame with a 157.44% surge. Now, Catzilla is set to take this momentum to unprecedented heights, challenging not just meme coins but the entire market. Forget barking trends — Catzilla’s roar is the sound of future profits. The clock is ticking and the competition is scrambling. With its unique mission, presale, and the proven success of feline-themed coins, Catzilla is primed to wreck the market. Interested investors can join the presale and watch Catzilla roar into history.

Ethereum’s Pectra Upgrade & XRP Price Issues Reviewed,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-offers-instant-usdt-rewards-ethereums-pectra-upgrade-xrp-price-issues-reviewed/,"Success in the crypto world often hinges on the ability to adapt and engage rewardingly. Ethereum is poised to tackle longstanding scalability problems through its imminent Pectra upgrade, potentially cementing its role as a frontrunner in decentralized applications. At the same time, XRP price is working to recover its strength amid wider market challenges, supported by Ripple’s efforts in international payment systems. On the other side, BlockDAG (BDAG) distinguishes itself with its community-centric focus and open financial practices. With a thriving presale and dynamic reward systems like the Refer & Earn feature, BlockDAG not only offers value but also builds trust and community involvement in its expanding network. BlockDAG’s Presale Achievements and USDT Bonuses through Referrals BlockDAG’s presale has notably achieved $174 million in funding across 26 batches. Currently priced at $0.0234, it has attracted global attention from the crypto community. Beyond financial achievements, BlockDAG prioritizes rewarding its community through initiatives like the Refer & Earn USDT program. This effort ensures that active community members receive direct rewards for their contributions. A key highlight of this system is the immediate cashback feature. Notably, both those who refer and those who buy gain equally, each receiving a 6% cashback in USDT (BEP-20) for every qualified transaction. Additionally, rewards are promptly credited post-purchase, which removes any wait or complex procedures, thereby boosting transparency and participation in BlockDAG. The system’s increasing cashback scale for referrers also enhances its attractiveness. For example, cashback begins at 6% for the first purchase through a referral link within a 24-hour window and increases to 7% for the second, 8% for the third, culminating at 10% from the fifth transaction onwards. Meanwhile, purchasers consistently receive a 6% cashback, preserving a fair and balanced approach. Thus, this framework not only benefits community members but also encourages them to promote BlockDAG, fostering growth while ensuring direct benefits for participants. By merging immediate benefits with the chance for greater rewards, BlockDAG shows its dedication to nurturing a dynamic and engaged community. What’s the Upcoming Ethereum Upgrade in 2025? The next major step for Ethereum is the Pectra upgrade planned for 2025, designed to transform how the network handles transactions. This upgrade will implement cutting-edge sharding methods and improve transaction processing, significantly boosting its ability to manage thousands of transactions per second. This enhancement is critical for Ethereum’s role as a primary platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and broader organizational use. Additionally, Ethereum’s shift to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model has already lessened its energy use and promoted staking, increasing its attractiveness. Pectra will further tackle issues like network congestion and high transaction fees, which have been persistent obstacles for users. With these improvements, experts predict Ethereum could reach unprecedented price levels by 2025. XRP Price Drops Amid Economic Fluctuations Recently, XRP has seen a price drop of nearly 20%, influenced by broader economic factors, such as aggressive monetary policies from the Federal Reserve and a strong U.S. dollar. Yet, the long-term outlook for XRP remains positive, with expert projections suggesting a potential rise to $2.56 by the end of 2024 and possibly $4 to $5 by 2029. Ripple’s efforts to transform international payments and the expected regulatory developments are likely to drive these optimistic forecasts. Still, the market’s inherent instability urges a careful approach to XRP. The future success of XRP will rely on Ripple’s strategic ability to overcome these economic challenges and capitalize on its payment technology innovations, reflecting the overall maturity of the cryptocurrency market. Final Verdict! The trajectory of cryptocurrencies will likely hinge on projects that integrate cutting-edge technology with active community involvement and pragmatic solutions. The Ethereum Upgrade is geared towards resolving scalability issues, while XRP aims to enhance the efficiency of international payments amidst economic hurdles. However, BlockDAG adopts a distinct path by engaging its community with clear reward initiatives and a tiered cashback system. This approach builds trust and promotes wider engagement, establishing a benchmark for inclusivity.

The Syrian Center for Economic Research has proposed an ambitious plan urging the transitional government to adopt Bitcoin and other digital assets to address inflation, stabilize its economy, and attract global investments. The plan comes as the nation faces an insane challenge of reconstruction after decades of war and financial devastation. The proposal focuses on using Bitcoin as a lifeline for Syria’s citizens and its crumbling financial system. It suggests a regulatory framework to legitimize the use of Bitcoin for trading, mining, and financial transactions. A blueprint for Syria’s financial revolution But they’re not stopping there. The Syrian pound is set to go digital, backed by gold, dollars, and Bitcoin itself, providing a much-needed anchor for the weak currency. This approach could completely change the financial sector in Syria, where inflation and devaluation have eroded trust in traditional banking. “The central bank will oversee the process, ensuring it operates within a secure and accountable framework,” the proposal says. Another key element of the plan is using Syria’s untapped energy resources for Bitcoin mining. Entrepreneurs will be allowed to mine Bitcoin, but not without oversight. The government intends to prevent monopolies and ensure the environmental and social impact of mining remains in check. Financial institutions are also being brought into the fold. Banks, startups, and currency exchanges will be encouraged to integrate Bitcoin into their operations. This could simplify remittances for the millions of Syrians dependent on funds sent from abroad and offer a lifeline for businesses crippled by years of instability. The proposal also says it wants citizens to retain full self-custody of their digital assets. Privacy and security are apparently front and center, with promises that users can transact freely without fear of interference, all while adhering to local and international laws. Even before Bitcoin legalization became a possibility, crypto was already pretty popular in Syria, though perhaps not always for the right reasons. Groups like Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a key player in the opposition, have been using Bitcoin to fund their operations. HTS has once been linked to al-Qa’ida, and has a history of raising money through crypto donations, despite international sanctions. Its leader, Abu Muhammad al-Jolani, is incredibly controversial. Once a member of al-Qa’ida, he’s since distanced himself from the group and sought to rebrand HTS as a legitimate political force. But no one is believing him. Obstacles and geopolitical twists Now Syria’s financial overhaul faces a mountain of obstacles, starting with international sanctions. These restrictions have long isolated the country from the global financial system, and adopting Bitcoin could provoke further scrutiny. Though some experts believe that’s precisely the point. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature offers a way to sidestep traditional banking systems, much like how Iran and North Korea do. Debt is another issue. The Assad regime left Syria burdened with loans and liabilities, adding another layer of complexity to any financial reforms. On top of that, the infrastructure needed to support a digital economy—think cybersecurity, blockchain expertise, and internet access—remains a huge problem. Geopolitics also complicates the situation. Syria has historically been a chessboard for powerful nations, with Russia and Iran playing major roles in propping up the Assad regime.

In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, meme coins are breaking barriers, and BTFD Coin’s presale is at the forefront. Alongside established favourites like Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW) and Apu Apustaja (APU), the landscape is ripe with opportunities for those ready to seize them. As meme coins transition from being internet jokes to legitimate investment instruments, they’ve become a magnet for those seeking alternatives to traditional investments. Here’s why BTFD Coin’s presale is catching everyone’s eye and how MEW and APU maintain their crypto dominance. BTFD Coin: A New Era of Meme Coin Utility BTFD isn’t just a catchy acronym—it’s a call to action. Short for “ Buy the Dip ,” BTFD represents a mindset that champions opportunity in market downturns. With the presale in its 13th stage, the BTFD Coin has sold over 60 billion coins to 7,000 holders, raising more than $4.7 million. This is your chance to jump in at $0.000142 per coin before the price surges to $0.0006 by the end of the presale. But what makes BTFD a standout in the crowded meme coin space? Play2Earn Gaming: Beta Version Live! The BTFD ecosystem is anchored by its Play2Earn (P2E) game, where players can join the Bulls Squad, a quirky crew of crypto bulls, to complete challenges and rack up rewards. Although the beta version is live without monetary rewards, it’s just the beginning. The full version promises staking options and a seamless blend of fun and utility. Imagine this: You’re smashing through levels as Raging Bull, collecting coins while immersed in a vibrant, haptic-driven experience. It’s not just about playing; it’s about being part of a community that thrives on the thrill of the chase. With token rewards tied to gameplay, BTFD blurs the line between entertainment and investment. Staking Rewards: Lock, Load, and Earn BTFD’s staking program is a game-changer. With 18% of the coin supply allocated for staking rewards, holders can earn an average of 90% APY, fuelling long-term engagement and ecosystem stability. Picture this: Staking $5,000 BTFD coins could grow your holdings exponentially within a year, thanks to the power of compounding rewards. Referral Program: Earn While You Share BTFD incentivises its loyal community through a robust referral programme. Share your unique referral code, and both you and your referrals benefit. It’s a win-win that rewards participation and spreads the word about the project. Top referrers even make it to the leaderboard, earning additional perks at the end of each month. BTFD isn’t just a coin; it’s a movement. Whether you’re drawn by its presale exclusivity or the promise of engaging gameplay, BTFD offers something for everyone. $BTFD, a token inspired by the 1973 crash, presents an opportunity to invest like Warren Buffett. Priced at only $0.000142 in Stage 13, it’s an affordable entry point for potential high returns. The BIG50 bonus offers a 50% bonus on your purchase (e.g., buy 100, get 150) using code BIG50. Now’s the time to stack up on $BTFD and position yourself for potential market success. Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW): The Quirky Underdog If you think the crypto market is saturated with dog-themed tokens, you’re not alone. That’s where Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW) pounces in. Positioned as a playful counter-narrative to dog coins, MEW has carved a niche on the Solana blockchain. It’s not just about feline antics; it’s about delivering value through a vibrant ecosystem. Launched in early 2024, MEW has quickly climbed the ranks with a current market cap of $750 million. Over the past nine months, its value has surged by an eye-watering 828.5%, making it a darling among meme coin enthusiasts. MEW thrives on community engagement.

The token also offers seamless integration with decentralised exchanges, making trading accessible and cost-effective. For those who value charm and innovation, MEW proves that you don’t have to bark to be heard in the meme coin frenzy. Apu Apustaja (APU): The Ultimate Community Coin Apu Apustaja, affectionately known as APU, is a token born from internet culture and driven by its community. Since its launch in March 2024, APU has cultivated a loyal following, leveraging the power of memes to create a robust ecosystem. APU’s charm lies in its inclusivity. With initiatives like the Apu Game and a Book of Lore featuring over 30 chapters, APU invites users to be part of a shared narrative. It’s not just a coin; it’s a story that evolves with its community. For crypto investors seeking a blend of nostalgia and innovation, APU delivers a unique proposition.

Whether it’s MEW’s counter-culture appeal or APU’s community-driven ethos, each project brings something unique. But with BTFD’s P2E game, staking rewards, and referral program, it’s clear why analysts are bullish about its potential. Before the price hike, don’t miss your chance to secure $BTFD coins.

That means the committee behind the proposal has exactly 18 months to collect 100,000 signatures before the proposal can be put to a referendum. The “Bitcoin initiative” aims to include Bitcoin in the central bank’s financial reserves , which some have claimed would hedge the country’s economy from external factors. The “Bitcoin initiative” needs 100000 signatures to move to the next phase The Swiss “Bitcoin initiative” was put forward by 10 people, including Yves Bennaïm, founder of the nonprofit think tank 2B4CH, who led the movement. The initiative aims to incorporate Bitcoin into the country’s financial reserves by advocating for amendments to Article 99 (Clause 3) of the Swiss Constitution, which currently mandates that a portion of the country’s reserves be stored in gold. Proponents have argued that Bitcoin should be treated similarly to gold, saying the asset could boost the country’s autonomy and protect the company’s economy. Now that the Swiss Federal Chancellery has officially registered the initiative, the committee in charge must obtain 100,000 signatures in 18 months. If the signature collection phase is successful, the proposal will be forwarded to the Swiss Federal and then put to a public referendum to decide if any amendments will be made to the Swiss constitution. The US, Germany, and Hong Kong are considering Bitcoin reserves The Swiss “Bitcoin initiative” registration comes at a time when multiple other nations are considering starting their reserves. For starters, Donald Trump proposed a Bitcoin reserve plan at the Bitcoin Nashville Conference 2024. Moreover, Wu Jiezhuang, Chairman of Hong Kong’s Web3 Virtual Asset Development Subcommittee, also advocated for the city to include Bitcoin in its exchange fund, claiming could help bolster financial security. Former German Finance Minister Christian Lindner also advised the European Central Bank (ECB) and the German Bundesbank to integrate Bitcoin into their reserves. He said : The new Trump administration is pursuing an extremely progressive policy on crypto-assets such as Bitcoin. In Washington, there is even consideration of the Federal Reserve including crypto-assets alongside currencies and gold in its reserves. ~ Christian Lindner Nonetheless, Switzerland’s approach to a possible amendment to its constitution could lead to nations following the same process, especially with Trump’s victory making the world optimistic about crypto asset trading and regulation.

With uncertainty surrounding the continuation of Bitcoin’s current trend, speculation remains divided on whether the crypto asset is preparing for another upward breakout or entering a phase of correction. Recent on-chain data suggests that specific metrics, such as the realized price for short-term holders, are providing essential insights into the market’s behavior and potential future direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Key SOPR Metric Holds Steady: Are Long-Term Holders Eyeing Higher Prices? Key Support Level Identified at $81,000 In an analysis recently uploaded on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, an analyst known as Shayan BTC revealed that the realized price metric, particularly for the 1-3 month UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) age band, serves as a critical indicator for assessing investor sentiment among newer market participants. This metric represents the average purchase price of Bitcoin for those who acquired the asset within the last one to three months. A sustained price above this level typically signals bullish momentum, suggesting that recent buyers are confident in holding their positions despite prevailing market volatility. Conversely, if Bitcoin’s price drops below this level, it may indicate potential selling pressure as these short-term holders attempt to limit their losses. According to Shayan, the realized price for Bitcoin’s 1-3 month holder cohort currently stands at $81,000. This level is seen as a vital support zone, acting as a “psychological and technical defense” line for both short-term and long-term investors. Historically, when Bitcoin’s price remains above this threshold, it indicates a resilient market sentiment where recent buyers demonstrate confidence in the asset’s future price potential. On the flip side, a price drop below the $81,000 mark could lead to increased selling activity, primarily driven by short-term holders looking to exit their positions to minimize potential losses. Such a scenario would likely add downward pressure to the market, potentially triggering broader sell-offs. Bitcoin Market Performance Bitcoin has so far given investors a boring holiday season with its lackluster performance. Particularly ever since the past weeks towards the middle of December, Bitcoin has fallen below the $100,000 price mark and has remained below it with little to no upward movement. Over the past two weeks, Bitcoin has now dropped by 10.9%.2% as it remains below the $100,000 price mark. However, its past day performance has been quite interesting. Over this period, BTC has seen a sudden increase of 4% to a current trading price of $95,519, at the time of writing. Interestingly, despite this sudden surge, this price mark puts Bitcoin at a roughly 11.9% decrease away from its all-time high of $108,135 registered in the middle of December.

XRP is reshaping the world of global payments with its swift and cost-effective transactions, while Solana offers a state-of-the-art solution for speedy and reliable blockchain operations. Web3Bay, on the other hand, is carving a unique path in e-commerce, infusing the industry with blockchain’s inherent transparency and decentralization, coupled with a focus on enhancing user experience. The 3BAY token presale is a beacon for substantial returns and vibrant community engagement, exemplifying the profound impact blockchain is having on various industries, with Web3Bay distinguishing itself by concentrating on tangible benefits for users. Web3Bay’s 3BAY Token Presale: A Visionary Promise of 6430% ROI Web3Bay is redefining e-commerce by harnessing the efficiency of digital currencies alongside the communal spirit of blockchain technology. Picture a marketplace where consumers wield control, liberated from the constraints of intermediaries and excessive fees. This vision positions Web3Bay as a formidable contender to traditional e-commerce giants, promising not just a new platform but a movement that rewards its participants financially and functionally. Central to this ecosystem is the 3BAY token, which functions as both the medium of transaction and the voice of the community. The presale price of $0.003 is a golden opportunity for early investors, with each phase of the sale raising the price by 15%, leading to a potential final price of $0.1959. This strategy sets the stage for a potential return of over 6430%, presenting a lucrative opportunity for investors and crypto enthusiasts to shape the platform’s future governance and growth. The adoption of cryptocurrency in online shopping has surged, with a 34% increase in ownership in 2023 alone, reaching an impressive 580 million users globally.

XRP to $50 in 2025: Insightful Forecast or Mere Speculation? XRP is in the spotlight, buoyed by optimistic forecasts projecting its value could soar to $50 by 2025. This enthusiasm is rooted in XRP’s capability to facilitate quick, cost-effective, and scalable global payments, making it highly attractive to financial institutions worldwide. However, the shadow of its ongoing legal struggles with the SEC looms large, potentially stifling its ascent. Despite this, there is a tangible sense of optimism that forthcoming regulatory clarifications, especially with a possible pro-crypto SEC chair, could unlock vast institutional demand, propelling XRP’s market value. Will Solana Achieve a $1,000 Valuation by 2030? Solana has captured the attention of the crypto community with its rapid transaction capabilities and minimal fees, evidenced by its substantial market cap of over $91 billion as of December 2024. Despite experiencing significant price volatility, Solana’s ecosystem has demonstrated robust growth, with its Total Value Locked in DeFi soaring from $1.45 billion in 2021 to more than $6 billion. The vision of reaching a $1,000 valuation by 2030 hinges on ongoing technological advancements, ecosystem expansion, and broader adoption, positioning Solana as a prime candidate for substantial long-term growth. Key Insights The transformative potential of blockchain technology is vividly illustrated through initiatives like XRP, Solana, and Web3Bay. While XRP enhances global payment systems and Solana amplifies scalable DeFi solutions, Web3Bay innovates within e-commerce by integrating blockchain advantages with everyday functionality. These platforms not only pave the way for future industry standards but also provide a lens through which we can reimagine the intersection of technology and practical application in the digital age.

According to a Reuters report , Kwon, who co-founded Terraform Labs, was arrested in Montenegro last March while attempting to board a flight using a fake Costa Rican passport. He had evaded authorities since the May 2022 crash of his TerraUSD and Luna cryptocurrencies. The extradition followed the Montenegro Constitutional Court’s rejection of Kwon’s final appeal. “It was concluded that the majority of the criteria prescribed by law favor the extradition request from the competent authorities of the United States of America. Consequently, the Minister of Justice issued a decision approving the extradition of Kwon Do Hyung to the United States, while simultaneously rejecting the extradition request from the Republic of Korea.” Kwon faces multiple charges in the US, including fraud and conspiracy. He also faces similar charges in South Korea. Kwon’s Terraform Labs created TerraUSD, a “stablecoin” designed to maintain a constant $1 value. Its collapse triggered a wider crypto market downturn and left thousands of investors with significant losses. US prosecutors allege Kwon misled investors about the stability of his digital tokens. If convicted, he could potentially face decades in prison.

The firm said it was giving its customers a New Year’s gift by cutting prices on the visual reasoning AI model, at a time when price wars continue to rage in China’s domestic AI services market. Alibaba implements price cut for the third time in 2024 According to South China Morning Post , Alibaba’s announcement, coming on the last day of 2024 is not the first, but the third AI price cut by the cloud unit this year alone. This also comes as competition heats up with similar initiatives implemented by TikTok parent company ByteDance as Chinese tech firms seek to attract users in a crowded market. The Hangzhou-based Alibaba’s cloud computing division made the announcement in a WeChat post its intentions to offer a price cut on Qwen-VL, its visual language model, which is perceived to understand both texts and images. Meanwhile, the e-commerce giant’s shares did not move that much and closed 0.5% higher on the final day of the trading of 2024 in Hong Kong. According to CNBC , the price cuts indicate how the race among China’s tech giants to win more business for their emerging AI products is intensifying. It remains to be seen if the pricing strategy will drive widespread adoption of tech firms’ products and services or if it just ignites a price war that will erode margins within the sector. According to Gurufocus , Alibaba’s strategy could be the masterstroke in this increasingly crowded AI space. The company wants to be the go-to supplier for firms that want to integrate AI into their operations without breaking the bank. Alibaba faces strong competition from peers in China Competition for large language models on the Chinese market has intensified in the past year as each tech giant seeks to stay ahead of the AI race. This follows the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022 to immediate success, which spurred generative AI developments across the globe. Chinese tech firms also intensified efforts to come up with their home grown alternative to ChatGPT, which is not officially available in the Asian country. In the past 18 months, major Chinese tech giants including Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent, JD.com, Huawei, and ByteDance have launched their own large language models as they seek to capitalize on the hype around the AI technology. For these tech firms, price cuts and promotions have become one of the ways to lure users into this cut-throat industry. As for Alibaba, this is not the first time it has cut prices to incentivize businesses to use its products as the firm implemented another price reduction of up to 55% on a wide range of its AI products in February. Alibaba implemented another price reduction in May on its Qwen AI model by as much as 97% to bolster demand for the service. Large language models are AI models trained on huge quantities of data to create humanlike responses to user queries and prompts. These models are the basis for today’s generative AI systems like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. According to CNBC, Alibaba’s large language model efforts are mainly focused on the enterprise segment rather than consumer AI chatbots like ChatGPT. Alibaba revealed in May that its Qwen model is already used by over 90,000 enterprises. The price cut could open more doors for broader adoption.

At the start of the month, reports and crypto forum posters claimed that many traders at Seoul’s most famous fashion market were using the USD-pegged stablecoin as a payment tool. But a reporter from the South Korean media outlet Viewers wrote that the claims of mass USDT adoption at the market were “far from the truth.” Dongdaemun Market Lukewarm on Tether? In early December, posters on popular South Korean crypto forums claimed that “mass crypto adoption” was on its way after merchants at Dongdaemun started using USDT for “international transactions.” USDT’s market cap over the past seven days. (Source: CoinGecko) Multiple posters claimed that they had seen vendors taking USDT payments or even paying for goods using Tether at the market. The market, a series of multi-story buildings in East-central Seoul, is a hotspot for fashion and textiles in the capital. Comprised of 30 shopping malls and several outdoor markets, as well as wholesale markets, the area is particularly popular among Chinese shoppers. These include wholesale buyers who purchase items in South Korea for resale in Mainland China. The reports from earlier this month claimed that it was this group in particular that was driving USDT adoption, paying South Korean market vendors in Tether for their wholesale purchases. On one popular thread, South Koreans wrote that “friends who do business with Chinese customers “use USDT a lot.” Another claimed they had “bought items” for USDT at the market, while others still claimed that “about 10%” of wholesale trade at the market was now conducted using USD-pegged stablecoins. However, Viewers reporter Hwang Bo-ram said multiple vendors and traders at Dongdaemun Market claimed that cash, not crypto, is still their currency of choice. Dongdaemun Market in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: Neaners [CC BY 2.0]) ‘Still Too Early for Stablecoins’ Hwang wrote that while the general public is becoming more familiar with stablecoins, “many of the interviewees” the media outlet spoke to said it “is still too early to use them in real transactions.” But these same interviewees “agreed” that it was “possible that stablecoins” could “connect the conventional economy with the world of blockchain in the future.” The vendors hinted that cash transactions, unlike transactions on blockchain networks, are virtually untraceable. Presumably for tax purposes, many traders appear keen to leave as little trace as possible of their transaction records. Lee (given name withheld), a Dongdaemun-based men’s clothing trader of 20 years, told the media outlet: “There have been stories about crypto adoption here before. But the reality is, [stablecoins] are not used much in the market, contrary to the reports. Traders are quite change-averse. And they hate leaving behind evidence of their transactions. That’s why most transactions are carried out in cash here.” Shopping malls at Dongdaemun Market in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: Martin Röll/Großmarkthallen [CC BY-SA 2.0]) Age a Factor? Lee said there was another reason vendors are still uncertain about adopting stablecoins and Bitcoin (BTC) . The vendor explained: “Dongdaemun merchants are not likely to use crypto in peer-to-peer transactions because they tend to use agents to process payments on their behalf. I don’t know what will happen in the future. But I think that most won’t use stablecoins for the time being because of tax-related issues.” Park (given name also withheld), another Dongdaemun-based vendor at “a medium-sized trading company that targets Chinese customers,” said: “Most fashion traders were born in the 1950s and 1960s, so I think it is [difficult for them] to use cryptocurrency.” Regardless, it appears that there is no smoke without fire. In a December 24 article published in Weekly Dong-a , a leading mainstream media magazine, a tech journalist wrote: “While cryptocurrencies were mainly used for illegal transactions in the past, they have recently been actively used in the import and export of general goods such as clothing, textiles, and electronics.” Dongdaemun Design Plaza in Jung-gu, central Seoul, is celebrating the return of the holiday season with its annual media art festival, which drew up to 620,000 visitors last winter. https://t.co/1PEEc3PJ0o — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) December 19, 2024 Smartphone Payments on the Rise The same article also included the sub-headline “Payment with cryptocurrency at Dongdaemun Market.” This prefaced a section on USDT and other stablecoins. Myung-hee (surname withheld), a part-time employee at a popular Dongdaemun shopping mall, told Cryptonews.com : “The stall I work out does not accept USDT or any other token. However, I do see a lot of Chinese customers paying using their smartphones around the area, with local vendors accepting the payments on their own handsets. I have no idea if these are crypto transactions or not – I really couldn’t say.” Dongdaemun to expand green belt to help Seoul become future city https://t.co/PD9MOY5uHv — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) October 24, 2023 Another author claimed on December 23 : “If you look around Dongdaemun, it’s easy to see Chinese traders or small import/export businesspeople paying with cryptocurrencies stored in their smartphone wallets instead of dollars, yuan, or Korean won.” USDT is also exceptionally popular in China and other BRICS nations , despite Beijing’s wide-ranging crypto crackdown. In 2019, Chainalysis wrote that Tether “dominates in China.” It called the stablecoin “the de facto fiat in Chinese trading.” The post South Korea: Dongdaemun Market Vendors Deny ‘USDT Pay Adoption’ Reports appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|News|Adoption|South Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|USDT,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2024-12-31 23:30:00

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Crypto watchers suggest choosing Remittix while under 2 cents could be like buying Solana under $1. Table of Contents Solana holders flock to Remittix’s PayFi solution Solana could offer less returns than Remittix Remittix: The crypto presale of the year According to experts, investing in Remittix (RTX) at under 2 cents could be one of the best crypto plays of 2025. Remittix’s presale is reminiscent of the early days of Solana (SOL) when the altcoin sold for less than $1. With its transformative PayFi ecosystem and growth potential, Remittix might become the next big thing in the crypto market. As early investors saw huge gains with Solana, buying Remittix now could lead to similarly remarkable returns as the project snowballs. Solana holders flock to Remittix’s PayFi solution Remittix seeks to transform the finance market with groundbreaking technology, following in the footsteps of Solana. While Solana’s relevance fades, savvy traders are flocking to Remittix’s PayFi solution, which will support flawless cross-border trading. Remittix will enable users to make crypto-to-fiat payments globally. The platform will use its native RTX token, allowing any cryptocurrency to be converted instantly into fiat and deposited into a recipient’s bank account no matter their location. Unlike traditional platforms like Stripe and Wise, Remittix will drive global crypto adoption by eliminating the limits of crypto or fiat transactions. The protocol will offer a simple and fast process that differentiates it from the competition. Every transaction on Remittix will be processed through a fully audited smart contract, ensuring 100% security and eliminating slippage. Remittix also prioritizes transparency, giving users access to immutable public ledgers. In addition to these payment advantages, Remittix will provide real-world utility by offering staking rewards. Long-term RTX holders can earn up to 8% APY annually, while VIP-tier investors can receive an impressive 18% APY. Currently priced at $0.0167, RTX tokens offer an ideal entry point for investors looking to get in early before Remittix reaches the Solana level. You might also like: Analysts says SHIB and PEPE’s big gains are over, but Remittix 5,880% rally is just beginning Solana could offer less returns than Remittix Like much of the wider crypto industry, Solana’s price is down. This week, Solana dropped from $200 to $188 as sellers embraced the cautious sentiment that has prevailed. However, technical indicators, such as the 200-EMA ($175) and 200-SMA ($167), suggest that a comeback is possible. There are forecasts that Solana could reclaim the $200 mark in the coming days. Some crypto experts forecast that Solana will reach between $475 and $520 in this cycle, making it one of the top altcoins. Despite these optimistic predictions, Solana’s upside potential appears to be limited when compared to newer altcoins like Remittix. These tokens deliver much higher returns, regularly beating 100x after their presale ends. Remittix: The crypto presale of the year During a crypto rally, it’s easy to make gains, but when these rallies eventually end, a market correction can lead to losses. For those who bought Solana above $190, the current price drop is a painful reminder. As many crypto projects face declines, Remittix, with its unique features and growth potential, is quickly becoming a leading presale token of the year. As investors swap Solana for Remittix, analysts forecast a massive 4,500% gain for RTX by 2025. For more information on Remittix, visit their website or socials .

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump the Grinch can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-31 23:31:00

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-01 00:16:44

The Cardano (ADA) market analysis showcases interesting profitability metrics, underlining strength despite market volatility. Meanwhile, recent Litecoin price trends correlate with a surge in network activity, demonstrating growing user trust. BlockDAG (BDAG) captures the limelight, predicted as the next crypto to explode. Its instant USDT referral system, rewarding up to 10% cashback for referrers and 6% for buyers, enhances user participation and fuels expansion, benefiting the entire community. Coupled with an unprecedented presale that garnered over $174 million, BlockDAG solidifies its role as a pivotal force in broadening adoption and sparking widespread interest. Exploring Cardano’s Profitability and Market Prospects The Cardano (ADA) market analysis sheds light on notable profitability trends despite the asset facing current price challenges. IntoTheBlock data indicates that 60.9% of Cardano addresses, totaling 2.68 million, are still profitable with prices at $0.90, marking a 9.75% rise over the last 30 days despite fluctuations. On the flip side, 34.95% of addresses, roughly 1.54 million, are at a loss. This scenario unfolds amidst ADA’s significant 70% fall from its peak. While some analysts project a bullish surge to $6, others warn of potential further declines. This Cardano market analysis points to the critical nature of well-informed decisions amid varying market forecasts. Examining Litecoin’s Resilience and Network Activity The resilience of Litecoin’s price is evident, stabilizing around $105 after a recent drop to $86. This pricing aligns with notable metrics, like an average of 401,000 daily active addresses on the Litecoin blockchain in 2024—up nearly 10% from 2023’s average of 366,000. While these figures fall short of the peak of 1.37 million addresses seen in January, the consistent activity underscores strong user engagement in Litecoin’s efficient and affordable transactions. Moreover, miners’ growing confidence, mirrored in rising hashrates, suggests that despite the pricing hurdles, the robust network activity and increased miner participation may hint at potential growth ahead. BlockDAG Enhances Community Engagement with New USDT Referral Rewards BlockDAG’s recent USDT referral system offers a direct and significant way to reward its ecosystem’s participants. Referrers receive up to 10% immediate USDT cashback for multiple purchases through their referral links, while buyers enjoy a 6% cashback on their purchases. Participants must ensure their wallets are compatible and able to accept BEP-20 USDT tokens to join this program. This system of reciprocal incentives increases involvement and bolsters ties within the expanding BlockDAG community. By providing real rewards, it motivates members to actively promote the network’s growth, nurturing a culture of shared advantage and cooperation. Such referral-based engagement is crucial to BlockDAG’s strategy for broad adoption. As the top crypto presale currently, it has collected over $174 million and issued more than 17.6 billion BDAG coins. The referral initiative is key to speeding up BlockDAG’s crypto presale efforts, enhancing visibility, and drawing in fresh faces to the community. Every new member enhances BlockDAG’s presence and practical use, paving the way for reaching its ambitious $600 million presale goal. The coin’s value has skyrocketed by an impressive 2,240%—from $0.001 in its first presale phase to the latest price of $0.0234 in batch 26—continuing to draw interest. The community has grown to over 170,000 holders, a number expected to surge as more join through the referral system. With its momentum still building, many see BlockDAG as the next crypto to explode, making this an ideal time to get involved in this pioneering layer 1 project. The Bottom Line The cryptocurrency market is ripe with opportunities for substantial growth among leading entities. Cardano’s market analysis reveals strong profitability despite price fluctuations, while Litecoin’s price shows consistent results supported by a boost in network activity. BlockDAG steals the spotlight with its new instant USDT referral system, rewarding referrers with up to 10% cashback and buyers with 6%. This strategy has significantly expanded its community, now boasting over 170,000 members. With a groundbreaking presale that has already exceeded $174 million and a phenomenal 2,240% increase in value, BlockDAG cements its position as the next crypto to explode in 2025, sparking significant excitement for its forthcoming developments.

Report Predicts $8,000 ETH Price",https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-to-outperform-bitcoin-in-2025-report-predicts-8000-eth-price/,"According to a recent report by Steno Research, Ethereum (ETH) is poised to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) in 2025. This outlook is attributed to historical trends and the anticipated impact of favorable cryptocurrency regulations following Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s victory in the November election. Will 2025 Be The Year Of Ethereum? While the overall cryptocurrency market surged to unprecedented heights this year – reaching an all-time high (ATH) total market cap of $3.9 trillion – Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has lagged behind in terms of price performance. Related Reading: Ethereum Rejected At $4,000 Resistance Again: What Lies Ahead For ETH? However, Steno Research’s report suggests Ethereum could finally achieve a new ATH in 2025, driven by increased institutional investment and supportive regulatory developments. The report predicts that ETH could climb to at least $8,000 in the upcoming year. Bitcoin is also expected to hit a new ATH of $150,000 in 2025, but Ethereum may more than double from its current price of $3,400. Additionally, the ETH/BTC trading pair is forecasted to rise from 0.035 to 0.06 within the next 12 months. The weekly chart below illustrates ETH’s declining performance against BTC since September 2022. However, the pair is now hovering near a crucial support level at 0.035, with expectations of a rebound to the 0.06 level, which was last seen in February 2024. Steno Research’s optimistic forecast for Ethereum underscores a potential bullish momentum for altcoins in 2025. Mads Eberhardt, an analyst at Steno Research, stated: This expectation is partly based on the argument that Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential victory is more favorable for altcoins than for Bitcoin. The report adds that Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) – a metric used to gauge the proportion of the total crypto market cap commanded by BTC – is expected to tumble to as low as 45% from its current level. The following weekly chart demonstrates BTC.D’s sustained uptrend since September 2022, rising from a low of around 39% to a peak of 61%. However, recent price action suggests a lower high has been formed, signaling a potential sharp decline to around 45%. DeFi Activity To Rebound In 2025 The report further predicts a resurgence in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity within Ethereum’s ecosystem in 2025. Specifically, the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications is expected to hit a new high of $300 billion next year. Related Reading: DeFi Exploits Plunge 40% In 2024, But Centralized Exchange Losses Soar – Report Renewed interest in DeFi could further drive higher altcoin prices in 2025. Notably, ETH jumped 10% following Trump’s November election victory, as improved sentiment surrounding DeFi regulations boosted market confidence. In addition, strong inflows attracted by spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) further strengthen the bullish case for ETH heading into 2025. At press time, ETH trades at $3,417, up 3% in the past 24 hours.

Dogecoin’s Price Potential: Ascending to Ethereum or Tether’s Market Cap Dogecoin, the whimsical crypto star, is stirring conversations about its potential ascent. Currently standing at a $46.4 billion market cap, speculation abounds on what could happen if it matched Ethereum’s $226 billion or Tether’s $84 billion caps. Such a jump could catapult its price from today’s $0.066 to $1.62 or $0.60, respectively, assuming the supply doesn’t bulge. Yet, these optimistic forecasts hinge on widespread adoption and favorable market shifts, illustrating the volatile yet thrilling nature of cryptocurrency investments. Shiba Inu’s Value Surge with Dogecoin’s Market Boom Shiba Inu, alongside Dogecoin, dominates the meme coin arena, holding significant sway over its $95.54 billion market. Predictions now focus on the ripple effects of Dogecoin’s potential market cap doubling to $93 billion, which could see its price spike to $0.13 and similarly energize Shiba Inu’s valuation. Currently, with a $12.4 billion cap, Shiba Inu could see its value soar, doubling its current market stance. This prospective surge from $0.000021 to $0.000042 illustrates the interconnected fates of these meme titans, driven by community engagement and speculative fervor.

The pseudonymous trader known as Altcoin Sherpa tells his 236,500 followers on the social media platform X that he’s still accumulating the Solana ( SOL )-based memecoin Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ). “I’m filling a bit around $0.80ish, approaching my buys. Total buys = some at $1, more at $0.80, and I also moved some other buys to $0.65 in case they come. I want my average to be around $0.80 or lower though. Still think this is a good meme and I’m hopeful it doesn’t pull a goat/act/etc after being listed.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X FARTCOIN is trading at $0.81 at time of writing. The 136th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down more than 11% in the past 24 hours but up around 4,000% in the past two months. The memecoin launched in late October. Altcoin Sherpa says there’s a catch, however. “Frankly I am a bit scared that this trade is a bit too consensus, to be honest. It’s a fantastic meme and hits many incredible narratives but it seems almost ‘too’ obvious. But still gonna fire and add.” In terms of Ethereum ( ETH ), the analyst says he’s still uncertain. “ETH is the gateway to alt season but there’s no true clarity on it… yet. If BTC breaks either the range high or low, I suspect this goes lower.

The Cardano (ADA) market analysis indicates promising profitability metrics, demonstrating durability despite fluctuations in prices. Similarly, the latest Litecoin price trends correspond with increased network activity, showing growing user trust. However, BlockDAG (BDAG) captures the most attention, expected as the next crypto to explode. Its quick USDT referral program rewards up to 10% cashback to referrers and 6% to buyers, fostering participation and growth, and benefiting the community collectively. With a groundbreaking presale that garnered over $174 million, BlockDAG is becoming a key player in promoting broader adoption and development. Cardano Market Insights: Profits and Predictions The Cardano (ADA) market analysis showcases significant profitability trends despite recent price dips. According to IntoTheBlock data, 60.9% of Cardano addresses, approximately 2.68 million, are still profitable with the price at $0.90, reflecting a 9.75% rise over the last 30 days amidst volatility. In contrast, 34.95% of addresses, or about 1.54 million, face losses. These statistics are in the context of ADA’s 70% fall from its peak value. Some analysts predict a potential rally to $6, while others warn of possible declines. This Cardano market analysis emphasizes the need for careful decision-making given the differing forecasts. Insights into Litecoin’s Price and Network Activity Litecoin’s price resilience is evident, trading around $105 after a recent low of $86. This price trend is supported by significant metrics, such as an average of 401,000 daily active addresses on the Litecoin blockchain in 2024, nearly 10% above the 2023 average of 366,000. Though this is below the peak of 1.37 million addresses in January, the consistent activity underscores strong interest in Litecoin’s efficient and economical transactions. Miners’ confidence is also growing, as shown by the rising hashrates. Despite the price challenges, the solid network metrics and increasing miner engagement suggest a potential for future growth in Litecoin’s market. BlockDAG Introduces Instant USDT Rewards for Community Engagement BlockDAG has unveiled its new USDT referral system, a simple yet significant method for rewarding active participants in its ecosystem. Participants referring others receive up to 10% USDT cashback for multiple purchases made via their links, and purchasers get 6% cashback for each transaction. Users must ensure their wallet addresses are compatible and can accept BEP-20 USDT tokens to engage with this program. This reciprocal reward model encourages active involvement and strengthens the ties within the growing BlockDAG community. The system aims to promote a cooperative culture by providing tangible benefits, thereby enhancing the network’s expansion. The implementation of this referral system is pivotal in BlockDAG’s strategy for widespread acceptance. Marking the largest crypto presale so far, the initiative has raised over $174 million and has distributed more than 17.6 billion BDAG coins. The referral initiative is crucial for propelling the presale’s momentum, increasing visibility, and drawing new members into the ecosystem. Each new member enhances BlockDAG’s visibility and functionality, aiming for a crypto presale goal of $600 million. As the coin’s value has rocketed by 2,240%—from $0.001 in its first presale batch to $0.0234 in the latest—BlockDAG is rapidly attracting attention. The community has grown to over 170,000 holders, a number set to increase as more users join through referrals. With ongoing strong momentum, many market analysts predict it as the next crypto to explode, making it an ideal time to get involved with this advanced layer 1 project. The Bottom Line The cryptocurrency market continues to reveal diverse growth opportunities among key players. The Cardano (ADA) market analysis highlights robust profitability despite current price volatility, while the Litecoin price showcases sustained performance bolstered by increased network activity. BlockDAG steals the spotlight with its new instant USDT referral system, providing up to 10% cashback for referrers and 6% cashback for buyers, which has significantly expanded its community, now boasting over 170,000 members. With an unprecedented presale that has already exceeded $174 million and an impressive price increase of 2,240%, BlockDAG establishes itself firmly as the next crypto to explode in 2025, generating significant excitement for its future prospects.

Among the vast sea of blockchain projects, some stand out as the best crypto to join this week due to their unique value propositions and significant growth potential. Qubetics Token , a rising star in the blockchain ecosystem, has been generating buzz with its record-breaking presale and innovative features. On the other hand, Polkadot and Near Protocol have already cemented their positions as go-to networks for scalability, interoperability, and decentralised solutions. Let’s dive into these three groundbreaking projects and explore what makes them irresistible to savvy investors. Qubetics: Transforming Blockchain Accessibility Qubetics is more than just a cryptocurrency; it’s a transformative project that aims to make blockchain technology accessible to businesses, developers, and everyday users. The Qubetics presale is in its 15th stage, having already sold over 392 million $TICS tokens to 12,700 holders, raising an impressive $8.4 million. Priced at just $0.041 per token, $TICS offers an enticing entry point, with analysts predicting explosive growth that could see its value reach $15 post-mainnet launch—a staggering 43,711% ROI. One of Qubetics’ standout innovations is its Multi-Chain Wallet , designed to simplify the management of assets across multiple blockchains. Picture a business streamlining cross-border payments or a professional securely managing NFTs and DeFi investments—all from one wallet. The Multi-Chain Wallet ensures that users can easily send, receive, and store assets, cutting through the complexity that often hinders blockchain adoption. Consider investing $65,000 during the presale at $0.041 per token. With that investment, you’d receive approximately 1,900,584 $TICS. If $TICS reaches $15 as predicted, your portfolio could skyrocket to $28,508,760, illustrating the life-changing potential of early investment in Qubetics. As the crypto space becomes increasingly competitive, Qubetics’ emphasis on usability, real-world applications, and a thriving ecosystem positions it as one of the best crypto to join this week. Polkadot: Leading the Interoperability Revolution Polkadot has gained recognition for addressing one of the most significant challenges in blockchain technology: interoperability. By enabling multiple blockchains to connect and share data, Polkadot fosters a more cohesive ecosystem where decentralised applications (dApps) can thrive. At the heart of Polkadot’s architecture is the Relay Chain, which ensures security and consensus across its network. Parachains, or custom blockchains optimised for specific use cases, enable developers to build innovative solutions without the limitations of siloed networks. From DeFi platforms to gaming applications, Polkadot’s versatility has made it a favourite among enterprises and developers. Polkadot’s ability to support seamless cross-chain communication is more than just a technical feat; it’s a glimpse into the future of blockchain collaboration. For investors, this means Polkadot is well-positioned to play a pivotal role as blockchain technology continues to integrate into mainstream industries. Near Protocol: Scalable Solutions for the Decentralised Web Near Protocol is a next-generation blockchain designed with scalability, usability, and developer accessibility in mind. It employs a unique sharding technology, Nightshade, which ensures that the network can handle thousands of transactions per second without sacrificing security or decentralisation. Near’s user-centric approach sets it apart in the blockchain space. By offering human-readable account names and onboarding solutions that simplify wallet creation, Near is lowering the barriers for new users and developers alike. Its developer-friendly ecosystem has attracted a diverse range of projects, from DeFi protocols to gaming and social dApps, making it a versatile platform for innovation. For those considering investments, Near Protocol offers a compelling opportunity to support a blockchain that prioritises scalability and mass adoption. Its commitment to creating a user-friendly decentralised web ensures that it remains relevant as the industry evolves. Qubetics: The Undisputed Star of the Show While Polkadot and Near Protocol have demonstrated their strengths as blockchain leaders, Qubetics brings something uniquely innovative to the table. Its Multi-Chain Wallet is more than just a tool; it’s a gateway to simplifying complex blockchain operations, enabling seamless interaction with assets across multiple networks. Imagine a freelancer receiving international payments in crypto without worrying about conversion or compatibility issues. That’s the level of convenience Qubetics aims to deliver. Additionally, the Qubetics ecosystem focuses on real-world asset tokenisation, offering individuals and businesses the ability to digitise assets like real estate, art, and commodities. This opens new doors for liquidity and democratises access to traditionally exclusive investment opportunities. Conclusion: Embrace the Future Choosing the best crypto to join this week requires a careful evaluation of each project’s potential to deliver long-term value. Polkadot’s leadership in interoperability and Near Protocol’s emphasis on scalability and user experience make them strong contenders. However, Qubetics’ combination of early-stage investment potential, innovative features like the Multi-Chain Wallet, and real-world applications make it a standout choice. With $TICS tokens priced at $0.041 and poised for exponential growth, now is the time to secure your stake in this promising project. The Qubetics presale offers a rare opportunity to be part of a movement that’s not just about blockchain—it’s about reshaping how we interact with technology and the world. Seize this chance to be at the forefront of innovation. Join the Qubetics presale today and watch your investment grow alongside the future of blockchain.

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-01 01:45:39

The XRP price has shown resilience and potential for explosive growth, prompting traders to explore altcoins to watch that might mirror its trajectory. Among these promising digital assets is RCO Finance (RCOF) , an altcoin that not only aims to disrupt the DeFi space but also holds the potential for significant returns as the market gears up for a new wave of investment. XRP Price Surge in 2024: A Turning Point for Altcoins? The XRP price journey in 2024 was nothing short of extraordinary, marking a year of transformative growth for the digital asset and the broader altcoin market. Starting the year at $0.62, the XRP price experienced a meteoric rise, hitting an all-time high of $2.89 on December 3. This remarkable surge stemmed from Ripple’s innovative strides, particularly the launch of the RLUSD stablecoin, which reinvigorated investor confidence in XRP’s utility. However, the latter half of December brought a market correction, with the XRP price settling at $2.14 by December 27. Analysts are optimistic, seeing XRP’s consolidation as a setup for further bullish momentum. This XRP price movement has ignited momentum across the market, sparking interest in several altcoins to watch as promising investment opportunities emerge. Altcoins to Watch for 2025 RCO Finance (RCOF): Revolutionizing Decentralized Finance RCO Finance (RCOF) is capturing attention as an altcoin with the potential to replicate XRP’s success. This Ethereum-based token is designed to revolutionize decentralized finance by integrating artificial intelligence into its trading platform. RCO Finance positions itself as a forward-thinking player in the crowded DeFi market by providing users with sophisticated tools to access real-world assets without intermediaries. Tron (TRX): Scaling New Heights in the Altcoin Ecosystem Tron (TRX) has solidified its position as a leading blockchain platform, renowned for its high transaction throughput and minimal fees. TRX is trading at approximately $0.26, with projections indicating a potential rise to $0.40 in the near term, driven by robust support levels and favorable market conditions. Analysts anticipate that TRX could surpass the $1 mark by 2025, contingent on sustained network growth and increased adoption. Tron’s expanding ecosystem and strategic developments make it one of the noteworthy altcoins to watch in the coming year. Stellar (XLM): Bridging Finance with Blockchain Stellar (XLM) continues to make significant strides in facilitating cross-border transactions and enhancing financial inclusion. Currently, XLM is trading around $0.345, with forecasts suggesting a potential increase to $0.45 by the end of 2024, reflecting a 17% appreciation. Further projections estimate that XLM could reach approximately $0.70 by 2025, driven by the network’s growing adoption and integration into mainstream financial systems. Stellar’s commitment to flawless, low-cost transactions positions it as one of the compelling altcoins to watch as the market expands. Why Investors Prefer RCO Finance RCO Finance is one of the very few assets to make it to the top lists of investor’s altcoins to watch for a number of reasons. Rapidly emerging as a standout player in decentralized finance (DeFi), RCOF is captivating investors with its innovative features and user-centric approach. The AI-powered Robo Advisor is at the heart of its appeal, an advanced tool designed to tailor investment strategies to individual users’ financial goals and market conditions. This feature democratizes access to trading techniques, allowing investors to trade confidently and make significant profits. Another compelling aspect of RCO Finance is its commitment to diversification. Unlike many platforms that limit users to a narrow range of digital assets, RCO Finance offers an extensive selection of over 120,000 financial instruments. This includes traditional assets, such as stocks and bonds, alongside altcoins and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate and commodities. Such diversity improves portfolio resilience and empowers users to explore various investment avenues without the hassle of converting currencies. RCO Finance stands out with its KYC-free environment, providing user privacy and accessibility. The platform also integrates with Fireblocks to deliver improved system security. Additionally, RCOF altcoin smart contracts are audited by SolidProof, providing investors with assurance of the platform’s secure and reliable assets. The Lucrative RCOF Altcoin Presale The RCO Finance token presale presents a unique opportunity for investors to participate in a project that blends AI technology with decentralized finance. Currently, in Stage 4, the RCOF token is priced at $0.0778, with over 50% already sold. Analysts project that the RCOF to list at $0.6, representing a staggering 700% ROI. Investors participating in the presale stand to gain from the anticipated token appreciation and access to RCO Finance’s suite of AI-powered trading tools. Moreover, they have access to staking rewards, private ETF funds, trading discounts, and governing rights. With ideal conditions to mirror the remarkable XRP price movements in 2024, RCOF is positioned to outperform Tron (TRX) and Stellar (XLM) in market performance.

Binance Trading Volume Drops As Sellers Take Control,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/warning-signs-for-bitcoin-binance-trading-volume-drops-as-sellers-take-control/,"Amid Bitcoin continuous correction in recent weeks, there has been a significant drop in BTC’s trading volume on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange raising concerns about the implications for the market. A CryptoQuant analyst has highlighted in a report that both spot and futures trading volumes for the BTC/USDT pair have witnessed a sharp decline. This reduction in activity suggests weakened buying power and decreased liquidity, two critical elements in maintaining price stability in the cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Now Worst Since Mid-October: Reversal Signal? Trading Activity on Binance Signals Caution for Bitcoin Traders The analyst known as Crazzyblockk disclosed that the drop in trading volume is particularly important as centralized exchanges like Binance play a pivotal role in balancing supply and demand dynamics. A decline in trading activity typically indicates reduced demand, leaving the market more vulnerable to price swings. With fewer active buyers, any significant sell-off could trigger rapid price declines, amplifying volatility across the broader Bitcoin market. Crazzyblockk urges caution, advising traders to avoid impulsive decisions. The analyst wrote: Given the current market conditions, it is advisable to exercise extra caution and avoid making impulsive decisions. Even small shifts in buying or selling pressure could lead to significant volatility in the Bitcoin market. Adding to this concern is the observation that Binance’s taker buy-sell ratio has tilted toward sellers. This metric, which measures whether aggressive buyers (takers) are purchasing or selling more actively, suggests that sellers currently dominate market activity. Taker Buy-Sell Ratio Hints at Market Sentiment Shift The taker buy-sell ratio is an essential indicator for understanding market sentiment, especially on Binance, which handles a significant portion of global Bitcoin trading. Crazzyblockk has reported a noticeable shift in this ratio over recent weeks, with sellers becoming increasingly dominant. When sellers aggressively fill more orders than buyers, it signals bearish sentiment and raises the likelihood of continued downward price movement. This shift follows weeks of weak buyer activity, suggesting that bullish momentum has stalled. However, it remains unclear whether this pattern will persist or reverse in the coming days. Crazzyblockk noted: If this trend persists and the inclination remains toward sell contracts, a deeper market correction could be anticipated. However, a resurgence in buyer activity might stabilize prices and restore confidence among market participants. Despite these concerns, it is worth noting that the current situation can be seen as a potential buying opportunity, especially for long-term investors.

However, it is still advised to remain cautious and avoid speculative trading strategies in the current market environment.

The good news? The answer is a definite yes! By choosing projects built on solid foundations, practical technology, and real-world applications, you can unlock remarkable potential for gains. This guide aims to simplify the complex crypto market and help you identify the top altcoins to invest in for 2025. Let’s examine 5 top altcoins that are not just fleeting trends—they are setting the direction for the future of cryptocurrency and promise significant rewards. Top Altcoins to Invest in for 2025 for Major Profits Here’s our list of top altcoins to consider for 2025: Web3Bay ($3BAY): Revolutionizing E-Commerce Blockchain Ripple ($XRP): Speeding Up Global Payments Polkadot ($DOT): A Leader in Multi-Chain Technology Chainlink ($LINK): Connecting Smart Contracts to Real-World Data Dogecoin ($DOGE): Community-Powered Crypto Usage Now, let’s explore what makes these projects unique and why they could be crucial for your 2025 portfolio. Web3Bay (3BAY): Revolutionizing E-Commerce Blockchain A new era for E-Commerce with Blockchain Web3Bay is causing a stir in the crypto market by transforming e-commerce using blockchain. This decentralized platform fosters a limitless marketplace where buyers and sellers unite without middlemen. Integrating cryptocurrency with conventional payment methods like PayPal, Web3Bay is bridging the old and new commerce worlds. Currently, 3BAY tokens are available at just $0.003 during the presale, with a 15% price rise at each subsequent stage. Early participants could see profits exceeding 500x once the platform fully launches. With 28 presale stages and a finite amount of tokens, Web3Bay presents an early investment chance in a venture poised to reshape global commerce. Web3Bay’s standout features include its innovative hybrid payment system, decentralized governance, and low transaction costs. Sellers, particularly in developing areas, can reach global markets without the hurdles of conventional banking, placing Web3Bay among the top altcoins to invest in. Key Characteristics: Supports both crypto and fiat in a hybrid payment model. Decentralized management via a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). Smart contracts for secure and reliable transactions. Extra benefits such as a 5% discount for using $3BAY tokens for payments. If you seek a project with substantial real-world impact and potential for rapid growth, Web3Bay should be at the top of your list. Ripple (XRP): Speeding Up Global Payments Ripple remains at the forefront of overhauling worldwide financial systems. XRP, Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, enables quick, affordable, and secure international payments, favored by banks and financial entities. Ripple’s blockchain technology processes transactions in 3-5 seconds at minimal costs, far surpassing traditional banking processes. It’s partnered with over 300 entities, including giants like Santander and American Express, and is making significant inroads in the $156 trillion global payment sector. With improving regulatory conditions and increasing adoption, Ripple stands out as a top altcoin to invest in, presenting a lucrative opportunity for both individual and institutional participants. Polkadot ($DOT): A Leader in Multi-Chain Technology Polkadot tackles a critical issue in blockchain technology: allowing different blockchains to interact without hurdles. This capability has fostered a cohesive environment where decentralized apps (dApps) flourish. Polkadot offers a shared security model and customizable parachains, enabling developers to create scalable and secure blockchains for varied needs. Its native coin, DOT, is crucial for governance, staking, and bonding, promoting a decentralized, community-focused framework. As blockchain technology expands, Polkadot’s emphasis on scalability and interconnectivity solidifies its place among the top altcoins to invest in for enduring value. Chainlink ($LINK): Connecting Smart Contracts to the Real World Chainlink has become a pioneer as a decentralized oracle network, integrating smart contracts with external data, essential for sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi), insurance, and supply management. Its decentralized setup ensures data reliability and security, vital for blockchain applications. The LINK coin fuels the network and provides staking opportunities. With advancements like the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and increasing use across leading blockchains, Chainlink stands as a preferred choice among the top altcoins to invest in. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Community-Powered Crypto Usage Originally a playful creation, Dogecoin has risen to become a widely recognized digital currency, supported by a dedicated community and endorsements from celebrities like Elon Musk. DOGE offers swift transaction capabilities and minimal fees, suitable for everyday transactions such as tips and small payments. Its recent adoption by Tesla and other entities underscores its practical utility. Though speculative elements present risks, Dogecoin’s strong community backing and rising practical uses present it as a noteworthy option among the next biggest altcoin choices. Why These Altcoins Are Noteworthy These altcoins bring distinct features and solutions to real challenges. Web3Bay is transforming e-commerce, Ripple is redefining international payments, Polkadot is improving blockchain interaction, Chainlink is linking blockchain with tangible data, and Dogecoin marries community spirit with practical use. Focusing on coins with solid foundations and potential for growth positions you for notable returns by 2025. Final Insights: Top Altcoins to Invest In As the crypto market progresses, the top altcoins are those combining practical applications, forward-thinking technology, and a clear future vision. Web3Bay stands out with its innovative approach to e-commerce and appealing presale options. Ripple, Polkadot, Chainlink, and Dogecoin also offer unique advantages, making them great additions to a diversified crypto portfolio. Whether experienced or new to cryptocurrencies, these altcoins could provide significant growth opportunities. Don’t miss the chance to invest in ventures that are defining the future of the cryptocurrency world. With Web3Bay at the forefront, now is the ideal time to secure your involvement in the upcoming phase of crypto innovations.

Crypto analysts are recognizing Shiba Inu’s potential ascent, driven by new features such as Shibarium and ShibaSwap. Dogecoin advocates, meanwhile, are citing historical trends, predicting a potential increase to $18 should patterns from 2017 and 2021 recur. BlockDAG (BDAG) is capturing robust interest as the BDAG X1 app exceeds 300,000 active users and its ecosystem grows. Its leading miners, the X1 and X10, are boosting presale figures, confirming BlockDAG’s X Series as one of the best crypto miners available. Shiba Inu Price Target Predict Surge The 2025 Shiba Inu price target is rife with speculation, with some analysts predicting as much as a 1,000% increase. Currently valued at $0.00002168, SHIB remains under its October 2021 high of $0.00008616. Yet, new advancements could lead to notable rises. The forthcoming Shibarium aims to speed up transactions and cut costs, enhancing daily usability. ShibaSwap is also expanding its network utility. Though forecasts differ, some suggest SHIB might reach $0.0002913 if it gains broader adoption and if market conditions are favorable. The committed “Shiba Army” continues to support the token’s robustness, pushing towards the high price target. Why is Dogecoin Prediction Showing Similar Past Trends? The Dogecoin forecast for 2025 is attracting attention as current trends resemble past cycles. Crypto analyst @krisspax noted, “The Dogecoin 4-year pattern is unfolding this cycle… Next up, parabolic growth. Are you ready for $DOGE?” Dogecoin is echoing its past, with 2017 and 2021 trends indicating potential explosive rallies. A recent TD Sequential indicator has sparked further optimism. Analysts believe DOGE could see a rally of up to 5,000%, possibly hitting $18 if it mirrors its historical performance. This Dogecoin prediction emphasizes the currency’s lasting appeal and its capacity for significant growth. As historical data suggests, DOGE is a top choice for those expecting the next market upswing. BlockDAG’s BDAG X1 App Hits Over 300K Active Users BlockDAG’s X Series has been recognized as the best crypto miner as it continues to attract attention, with the BDAG X1 app exceeding 300,000 active users. This achievement highlights the rapid adoption of the platform and the growth of its ecosystem. BlockDAG’s presale has been particularly successful, generating over $174 million and distributing more than 17.6 billion coins at $0.0234 each in this phase. Early participants have achieved a 2,240% ROI, showcasing the project’s high potential. Devices like the X10, X30, and X100 miners, favorites within the community, have been pivotal to this success, with 15,127 units sold, bringing in $6.1 million. These miners utilize keccak-256 technology, enhancing security and decentralization while ensuring scalability. BlockDAG also provides ‘Block rewards,’ which decrease over time, offering ongoing incentives for community participation. A recent AMA session revealed plans for a 2025 mainnet launch, placing BlockDAG among the top crypto presales available. The AMA underscored that custom miners, produced in collaboration with leading manufacturers, will be shipped before the mainnet launch in 2025, offering early mining opportunities to users. BlockDAG’s emphasis on accessibility, cutting-edge technology, and long-term profitability makes it a key player in the blockchain industry. Its expanding ecosystem and community-centric strategy set it up for future success, making it an appealing choice for those eager to tap into the next wave of blockchain development. BlockDAG is poised for a major launch and ongoing expansion. The Bottom Line As we head towards 2025, the excitement builds with Dogecoin prediction signaling a potential historic rally, and the Shiba Inu price target suggesting substantial growth as advancements in the ecosystem could foster widespread adoption. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is reshaping the domain of crypto mining. BlockDAG’s remarkable growth, marked by the BDAG X1 app’s 300,000 active users and a robust crypto presale , positions it at the forefront of the industry. With custom miners and a strategy focused on community engagement, BlockDAG stands out as a top choice for miners looking to seize significant opportunities in the evolving cryptocurrency market.

Related Reading: Altcoins To Explode In Early 2025: Analyst Says “Grand Finale” Is Around The Corner Bitcoin Sees End-On-Year Slowdown Bitcoin has struggled to hold the mid-zone of its one-month price range as the crypto market experiences an end-of-year slowdown. In December, BTC surpassed the $100,000 barrier for the first time, reaching a new all-time high of $108,353 mid-month. Over the last 30 days, the flagship crypto has moved between $90,000 and $108,000, hovering between $96,000 and $102,000 for most of the month. Nonetheless, Bitcoin has registered a 10.5% decline since hitting its ATH, failing to hold the $98,000 level over the last two weeks. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization saw a brief recovery on December 25 but quickly lost its Christmas rally gains. Since then, BTC’s price recorded its deepest retrace since the start of December. Bitcoin fell below the crucial $92,000 support zone on Monday, dipping to $91,530 before recovering, raising concern about BTC’s monthly close. However, New Year’s Eve started with a 4.2% surge throughout the morning, fueling end-of-year optimism about a price rebound. The cryptocurrency’s price moved from $92,000 to $96,000 before retracing to the $95,000 support zone. As the BTC’s price climbed, crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that the TD Sequential showed a buy signal on the 12-hour chart, potentially signaling a New Year’s Day price bounce. ‘All Is Well’ For BTC’s Rally Martinez suggested that “a sustained close above $94,700 could lead to a rebound to $97,500.” As the analyst previously pointed out, this level is one of BTC’s most significant support zones, and reclaiming it is key for the cryptocurrency’s short-term rally. On the contrary, “losing $92,500 as support will invalidate the bullish signal,” Martinez added. Losing this level could also send BTC to the $70,000 level based on the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) chart. The analyst has stated that a 25% crash to the $70,000 mark is possible, as the URPD chart shows minimal support below the key support wall. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Large Consolidation Trend Points To Possible Price Explosion To $8,000 Meanwhile, James Van Straten noted that “all is well” despite BTC’s current price action. The analyst highlighted that “this cycle as with the previous three cycles for BTC, all saw corrections at this point after the halving,” adding that the “corrections are starting later and finishing later. Maybe, to do with elongated cycles.” As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,949, a 1% increase in the daily timeframe.

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump the Grinch can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-01 03:13:00

While Bitcoin and Hedera have earned their places as staples in the crypto space, the latest entrant, Qubetics (TICS), is rapidly gaining attention. With its innovative solutions and promising presale, Qubetics is on track to become one of the best altcoins to buy today for those looking to make a strong play in the crypto market. Bitcoin and Hedera have long been considered safe bets for investors, serving as alternative investment instruments to traditional assets like stocks and bonds. But the recent rise of projects like Qubetics, with its focus on decentralisation, privacy, and blockchain scalability, makes it clear that the future of crypto is all about evolution. In this article, we’ll dive into the key milestones of Qubetics, while also looking at how Bitcoin and Hedera have become tried-and-tested go-to projects for investors in 2024. Qubetics: A New Dawn in Blockchain Investment When it comes to the best altcoins to buy today, Qubetics is making waves. Currently in its 15th presale stage, Qubetics has raised over $8.4 million and sold more than 392 million $TICS tokens to over 12,700 holders. At a current price of $0.041 per $TICS token, investors are in for a 10% price surge when the presale ends this weekend. This explosive growth is driving even more attention towards Qubetics, especially with analysts predicting that the price could skyrocket to $1 or even $5 after the presale ends, offering investors massive returns on their initial investment. For those looking at a scenario where they invest $200 in Qubetics at the current presale price, they would purchase approximately 5,841 $TICS tokens. If the price per token rises to $1 after the presale ends, that $200 investment could potentially turn into $5,841—a jaw-dropping 2820% return on investment. And if $TICS reaches $5 post-presale, that same $200 investment could soar to $29,207, offering an ROI of 14,503%. But Qubetics isn’t just about profits. The project’s integration of a decentralised VPN and privacy features is truly revolutionary. Imagine a world where businesses, professionals, and individuals no longer have to rely on centralised providers for online security. Qubetics offers a decentralised VPN that ensures users’ data remains private, secure, and under their control. For businesses handling sensitive client data or for professionals who need to maintain privacy in their daily operations, this technology is a game-changer. It also paves the way for individuals who are concerned about surveillance and data leaks to take control of their privacy. In the digital age, privacy is more than a luxury—it’s a necessity. With decentralised VPN solutions from Qubetics, users can browse securely without the risk of being tracked, offering unparalleled protection for financial transactions, communications, and more. It’s clear that the Qubetics ecosystem isn’t just another crypto project—it’s an all-in-one solution for the future of blockchain, privacy, and decentralisation. Bitcoin: The Pioneer of Crypto Investments Bitcoin has been the king of cryptocurrencies since its inception in 2009. As the best altcoin to buy today for many seasoned investors, Bitcoin continues to capture the imagination of those seeking an alternative investment asset class. With its limited supply of 21 million coins and its reputation as a store of value, Bitcoin has proven itself as a reliable hedge against inflation, often compared to gold. The rise of Bitcoin as a mainstream investment vehicle has been nothing short of phenomenal. Over the years, it has evolved from a niche, tech-savvy asset to a recognised financial instrument, with institutional investors and major corporations now jumping on board. Tesla, MicroStrategy, and even Square have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, signalling confidence in its long-term value. For retail investors, Bitcoin represents a way to diversify away from traditional financial markets while tapping into the growing adoption of digital currencies. Bitcoin’s market position is also strengthened by its network security, which is powered by miners that ensure its decentralised nature. The Bitcoin blockchain’s proof-of-work mechanism has made it one of the most secure networks in the world, which is one of the reasons it has remained the leading cryptocurrency despite competition from altcoins. Moreover, the growing number of Bitcoin ETFs and institutional funds indicates that this altcoin is here to stay. For investors looking at Bitcoin today, the currency’s value has surged to new heights, reaching over $107,000 in recent months. However, Bitcoin’s volatility has raised concerns for some, but this only adds to its allure for high-risk, high-reward investors. As an alternative to traditional investments, Bitcoin offers a unique asset class with the potential for significant gains—and, for some, it’s quickly becoming a hedge against traditional market instability. Hedera: A Fast, Scalable, and Green Alternative While Bitcoin has secured its position as the ultimate digital gold, Hedera is emerging as a top contender for investors looking for best altcoins to buy today that combine speed, scalability, and sustainability. Hedera’s innovative approach to blockchain technology has made it a fan favourite among those who care about both performance and the environment. Unlike Bitcoin’s proof-of-work, which requires significant energy consumption, Hedera operates on a proof-of-stake model, making it one of the most eco-friendly blockchains out there. This is crucial in a world that is becoming increasingly aware of its environmental impact. Hedera’s consensus algorithm, the Hashgraph, is not only faster but also more secure than traditional blockchain networks, allowing for high throughput with low latency. One of the things that sets Hedera apart is its focus on scalability. While many blockchain networks suffer from congestion and slow transaction speeds, Hedera has been designed to handle thousands of transactions per second (TPS), making it ideal for enterprise-level applications and real-time use cases. Hedera has partnered with several large companies, including Google, IBM, and Boeing, to implement its technology in real-world applications, further solidifying its position in the crypto space. For investors looking to diversify their portfolios, Hedera provides a strong alternative to Bitcoin. Its market position has been growing steadily, and it has carved out a niche as a blockchain that is not only fast and scalable but also environmentally conscious. As more enterprises look for scalable solutions, Hedera’s HBAR token is poised for continued growth. For those who believe in the future of sustainable blockchain technology, Hedera is one of the best altcoins to buy today. Conclusion: Why Qubetics, Bitcoin, and Hedera Should Be on Your Radar As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, projects like Qubetics, Bitcoin, and Hedera are offering exciting investment opportunities for both seasoned investors and newcomers alike. Qubetics, with its innovative decentralised VPN and high ROI potential, stands out as one of the most promising presales in the market today. Meanwhile, Bitcoin remains a safe haven for those looking to hedge against traditional market fluctuations, while Hedera is carving its own path as a fast, scalable, and eco-friendly blockchain solution. For those looking to diversify their portfolios and explore the best altcoins to buy today, Qubetics, Bitcoin, and Hedera are all worth keeping an eye on. Whether you’re in it for the long-term gains or simply looking for a unique investment opportunity, these three projects offer something for every type of investor. Don’t miss out—consider diving into Qubetics’ presale before it ends, or add Hedera and Bitcoin to your investment portfolio as part of your broader strategy. The future of crypto is unfolding, and the time to act is now.

Imagine holding Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) in its infancy and watching it skyrocket into the stratosphere. For many, it was a life-changing opportunity—one that turned a few hundred bucks into massive fortunes. But here’s the thing: history has a funny way of repeating itself. Here’s BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a new meme coin smashing records in its presale phase and gearing up to take the crypto world by storm. BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a movement. With over $4.7 million raised in its presale so far, this project brings together play-to-earn gaming, staking rewards, and a passionate community that’s hungry for success. Let’s dive into why BTFD Coin is the best new meme coin presale you can’t afford to miss. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolution in Action BTFD Coin is on a mission to redefine how we see dips in the market. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this meme coin is all about turning downturns into opportunities. Its presale has been nothing short of explosive, raising over $4.7 million and hitting significant milestones in record time. The current presale price is $0.000142 per coin, but this won’t last long—the price will jump to $0.0006 after the presale ends, making early investors the real winners. Here’s what makes BTFD stand out. Its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game’s beta version is already live, allowing players to experience the thrill of earning rewards in an immersive crypto gaming world . Though the beta doesn’t offer rewards yet, it’s just the tip of the iceberg for what’s coming. The staking system is another game-changer, offering a whopping 90% APY to those who hold their tokens long-term, creating an exciting passive income stream. The presale structure is designed to reward early adopters with unbeatable entry prices. Over 60 billion BTFD coins have already been sold, and with over 7100 holders, the momentum is undeniable. But BTFD isn’t just about numbers. Its community, known as the Bulls Squad, embodies the spirit of turning setbacks into comebacks. They’ve created a movement around the mantra “Buy The F***ing Dip,” ensuring no one gets left behind in the chase for financial freedom. Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY): A Missed Opportunity for Many CHILLGUY, a meme coin sensation, started as a light-hearted nod to internet culture but quickly became one of the most talked-about cryptos. With an all-time high of $0.62, it’s no surprise that early investors made a killing. Launched during the peak of the meme coin frenzy, CHILLGUY leveraged its “Chill Guy” mascot and vibrant community to create a cultural phenomenon. The coin’s journey has been nothing short of dramatic. From being endorsed by major influencers like MrBeast to securing listings on Binance and KuCoin, CHILLGUY climbed the ranks at lightning speed. Its high-volatility market trends saw fortunes made overnight, but for those who hesitated, it was a classic case of “what if?” Legal challenges, including copyright claims from the original “Chill Guy” creator, added to the rollercoaster ride. Yet, despite these hurdles, CHILLGUY continues to thrive. Its vibrant community and cultural relevance keep it in the spotlight, and traders still see potential for further gains. As of now, CHILLGUY is trading at approximately $0.34077, reflecting both its resilience and its speculative appeal. But for those who missed out on CHILLGUY’s early days, the regret lingers. What if you could go back in time and buy-in before the surge? While time travel isn’t an option, the next best thing is already here—BTFD Coin offers a fresh chance to ride the meme coin wave. How BTFD Coin is the Best New Meme Coin Presale BTFD Coin isn’t just another project riding on hype. It’s built on solid foundations, with features that set it apart from competitors. Its maximum supply of 173 billion coins ensures scarcity, while its staking and gaming ecosystems provide real utility. The presale, now in its 13th stage, is selling fast as investors scramble to secure their slice of the pie. The BIG50 bonus is the highlight of this presale. One of the most exciting aspects of BTFD Coin is its accessibility. The presale is designed to cater to all kinds of investors, whether you’re putting in $10 or $10,000. And with staking rewards of 90% APY, your holdings have the potential to grow exponentially. Conclusion Missed CHILLGUY? Don’t let history repeat itself.

TRX’s return to the 10th position by market capitalization has brought a sense of revival to the community, yet its price continues to struggle, down over 43% from its newly established peak and stuck around the $0.25 level for nearly two weeks. Despite this, Tron’s monthly revenue has steadily increased. Tron Tops Revenue Rankings According to the latest findings by Lookonchain, the Tron network has seen a significant surge in revenue over the past 30 days, reaching approximately $330 million – an increase of 39.7% compared to the previous month. As a result, revenue climbed to $764.11 million over the past 90 days. In the third quarter of 2024, Tron recorded a significant revenue surge that can be attributed to the rapid success of SunPump, its token launcher platform tailored for meme coins. SunPump gained traction starting August 16, with activity skyrocketing in the two weeks that followed. Zooming out, this growth has contributed to more than 115% year-on-year rise in the network’s total revenue for 2024, which now stands at $2.12 billion. This is further validated by CryptoDep’s data, which shows Tron topping the blockchain revenue charts for 2024. This placed Tron ahead of Ethereum, which trails behind with $2 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, Solana, despite its impressive 3,028% growth trend and $90.9 billion market cap, remains far behind Tron in revenue generation. Similarly, Base and other emerging blockchains, such as Arbitrum, with $44.7 million, and Optimism, with $37.9 million, lag significantly behind. A Bullish Reversal For TRX? Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency market as a whole turned bearish post-Christmas, with TRX suffering significant losses. The holiday season has been a lull for the crypto, but it could soon find a local bottom.7 Resistance zones are anticipated at $0.40 and $0.49.

However, the people were speechless when an investor sold millions worth of NFTs for just $175. The user left people in both the non-fungible token industry and crypto industries curious, and some even created controversy about it. Investor Sold 5 Pudgy Penguin NFT For Just $175 According to ApeVentureVCs founder XEER , an anonymous investor, has solved five of the Pudgy Penguin NFTs at just $175, leaving people in shock. This is because the same tokens would have been worth millions, as a single Pudgy NFT costs 21 ETH or $116.9k at the current Ethereum price , not the $35 the person has sold. Further, XEER cleared that the investor has sold Pudgy Penguins #5222, Pudgy Penguins# 5996, Pudgy Penguins#2009, Pudgy Penguins#7743, and Pudgy Penguins#1550 NFT collections, collectively for just $175. Interestingly, the NFT trader is now facing $3.7M of losses. In his X post, XEER mentioned that the person must have mistaken 35 USDC for 35 ETH. Interestingly, curiosity is increasing among the non-fungible token and crypto community. People Say It Is a Tax Scam As the person is anonymous, there is no clarification as to why the investor has sold his millions of Pudgy Penguin NFT for this low. However, some community members commented that this might be a tax scam, as no one could understand why someone would make this mistake. Out of these people, someone suggested that the person must have negotiated outside the market, which is why he sold at low to avoid taxes. Another called it a tax invasion, as the person will rebuy the same non-fungible tokens again. However, still, the motive is still unclear. Tax evasion. These kind of sales should be reversed or instant canceled. — Bitcoin Runes Hub – $DOG OKX (@Bitcoinruneshub) December 31, 2024 What’s In There For You? Pudgy Penguin is a famous NFT token collection that was launched in 2021. Over the years, it has grown in popularity and even became one of the most traded collections. This is why the recent Pudgy Penguin NFT sale has left people speechless, as investors sold 5 Pudgy NFTs for just $175 instead of $3.7M. Interestingly, a crypto token called Pudgy Penguin (PUDGY) has gained additional traction in the crypto market. More importantly, it trades at only $0.03286, which is more reasonable for beginners looking to connect with the NTF collection without investing millions. People can also look for opportunities where investors sell at just $175, as this investor did. However, careful measures should be taken before investing in crypto and non-fungible tokens.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE.

Why Buying the Dips Is Always a Smart Move The year 1973 taught the world an important financial lesson: markets recover, but only those who seize opportunities during downturns reap the rewards.

With meme coins like BTFD Coin leading the charge, the current bearish trend is a golden opportunity. BTFD literally stands for “Buy the F***ing Dip,” so it’s designed for moments like these. Don’t wait for the market to rally—position yourself now and thank yourself later. Bottom Lines The best new meme coin presales to invest in today offer a mix of fun, community, and serious earning potential.

On Wednesday, January 1, SHIB price soared roughly 1% intraday, struggling to reach the $0.0001 level. In turn, crypto market enthusiasts are now anticipating whether the token could achieve gains ahead, primarily in the wake of broader market trends and ecosystem developments. Here’s Why Shiba Inu Price Unable To Reach $0.0001 In an unprecedented turn of events, the meme coin Shiba Inu has garnered significant scrutiny, primarily as investors speculate over the token’s future potential. As per the latest market data, the leading dog-themed meme crypto has encountered substantial hurdles. Notably, the SHIB burn rate has witnessed a sluggish performance in recent days, with only 55.54 million coins burnt in the past week. Interestingly, this feat marks a much lower burn rate as compared to past chronicles. The waning burn rate, in turn, lines with the sluggish performance, underscoring that the circulating supply has not taken a drastic hit. Further, even the intraday burn rate witnessed only a 55% uptick, aligning with the asset’s sluggish performance. Altogether, the recent decline in burn activity has significantly impacted Shiba Inu’s price. On the other hand, recent market trends further rationalize the coin’s price volatility. Notably, the broader crypto market faces immense heat moving into 2025, in tandem with the broader trends and a holiday sentiment brewing. Notably. investors continue showcasing a low-risk appetite, aligning with the crypto seeing downside pressure in the market. Besides, despite recent ecosystem developments, such as the SHIB Metaverse launch and the looming TREAT token launch , the token is yet to show its potential in this bull cycle. What’s Ahead For The Meme Coin? At the time of reporting, SHIB price traded at $0.00002015, up marginally by 0.4% over the past day. Its 24-hour low and high were $0.00002052 and $0.00002178, respectively. Notably, the current volatility falls in line with the broader market trend following the U.S. Fed’s hawkish stance on rate cuts. Nevertheless, long-term prospects for the asset continue to reflect bullishness, indicating more price gains ahead. Notably, as the Shiba Inu community has seen remarkable advancements in recent days, such as the Metaverse launch and the looming TREAT token launch, market participants remain optimistic about future movements as the coin enjoys enhanced market visibility. In addition, a recent SHIB price analysis by CoinGape revealed that a $0.0001 target is achievable for the token despite the broader market turmoil as of now. A rally to the abovementioned price target is possible by January 2025, given that the market has recovered and SHIB has leveraged its strong market technicals. Market watchers continue to eye the coin for further price shifts.

However, technical analysis suggests an ongoing reaction at the lower boundary of a potential triangle pattern. Here’s a breakdown of the current situation and what to watch for moving forward. At the time of writing, XRP is up by more than five percent and is trading at $2.12 level. Key Reaction at Lower Boundary XRP has shown a mild response to a trend line that has now touched three times. While this trend line is important, it doesn’t yet confirm the completion of a clear pattern. The current movement could be part of a deeper wave within a larger Elliott Wave triangle. Current View: Sideways Triangle in Progress The analysis over the past few weeks remains largely unchanged. XRP appears to be in the midst of forming a wave 4, with the price action potentially following a triangle structure. Since triangles are fragile patterns that can change unexpectedly, it’s essential to stay alert to key levels for any shifts in the market structure. Critical Levels to Watch: Resistance and Support Support Levels: $1.95 and $1.90 (key downside levels) Resistance Levels: $2.42 (key level to watch for potential rejection) The $2.42 level is particularly relevant as it aligns with the potential C-wave target. Historical price patterns suggest that the C-wave often mirrors the length of the A-wave, with the 61.8% extension level playing a critical role. What to Expect Next If XRP reaches the $2.42-$2.45 range, it could face major resistance. Additionally, the trend line in this area might prevent further upside. While there’s no guarantee that XRP will reach this zone, it’s a key area to watch. A rejection at this level would suggest the structure is nearing its completion, potentially leading to an upward breakout. On the other hand, an impulsive move down could shift the focus to a more bearish outlook, with support levels between $1.39 and $1.80 becoming more relevant.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-01 05:45:20

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-01 06:04:00

Back in 2012, when Ripple’s founders created XRP, stablecoins didn’t exist, and the global payments market was wide open for innovation. At the time, Ripple was deciding whether to focus on smart contracts or payments. In the end, Ripple chose to focus on cross-border payments, which he thinks made sense given the size of the market and the lack of stablecoins back then. In 2019, Coinbase listed XRP and promoted it as a way to send money internationally fast and cheaply. Later that year, MoneyGram started using XRP for transfers. But just 18 months later, the SEC filed a lawsuit, claiming that all XRP—regardless of how it was purchased—was an unregistered security. I do not believe one can properly estimate the damage to Ripple’s business caused by the sweeping nature of the SEC’s complaint against Ripple and XRP. You have to remember, in 2012, when @Ripple founders created XRP, stable coins did not exist and the cross border payments… https://t.co/eGailTGshP pic.twitter.com/UyX3KUycbW — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) December 31, 2024 After the lawsuit, Coinbase delisted XRP, and MoneyGram switched to using XLM instead. But Deaton asks, is there really a legal difference between using XRP or XLM for payments? However, XLM’s creator, Jed McCaleb, is also a co-founder of Ripple. Deaton argues that the SEC’s lawsuit is way too broad. He also points out that many of the people who pushed for the case against Ripple later worked for Ripple’s competitors. “But when you look at the circumstances surrounding how this case was filed, including the massive conflicts of interests, and the fact that people behind the lawsuit went on to help or work for competitors of Ripple/XRP, you don’t have to be a fan to call it out,” he concluded. Ripple Vs SEC Saga Continues: The legal fight between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has greatly impacted XRP since the lawsuit began in December 2020. A key moment came on July 13, 2023, when Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security, which was an important regulatory decision. However, the SEC appealed on October 17, challenging parts of the ruling. The SEC is required to submit its opening brief by January 15, 2025, keeping the case in the public eye.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XLM|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-01 06:19:49

The British Financial Conduct Authority has failed to remove all illegal crypto ads as nearly half of flagged promotions still online, the Financial Times has learned , citing data obtained through a freedom of information request. Between October 2023 and October 2024, the FCA issued over 1,700 alerts about illegal crypto ads, apps, and websites. However, less than 55% were taken down. The FCA has the power to fine or prosecute companies that break new rules requiring crypto ads to be approved by the regulator or an FCA-authorized business, the report notes. Despite this, no penalties have been issued so far. Instead, the watchdog has focused on so-called “finfluencers,” influencers on social media who promote risky financial schemes. The regulator brought criminal charges against nine people, including reality TV stars, and is interviewing 20 more under caution. “Ultimately, unless a very real and present threat of legal action is visible to both the [tech] platforms and to authorized crypto asset exchanges which issue noncompliant ads, we’re unlikely to see any change.” Ex-FCA chair Charles Randell You might also like: U.K. to unveil crypto, stablecoin rules early next year The British regulator plans to finalize broader crypto regulations by 2026. As crypto.news reported earlier, the framework will address issues such as market abuse, trading platforms, lending, and stablecoins, with consultations beginning in late 2024. Matthew Long, the FCA’s director of payments and digital assets, stressed the need to tackle market abuse while building a fair and transparent system for crypto traders. With 12% of U.K. adults now owning crypto, the FCA plans to develop balanced regulations, though the details are still unclear. Long said the regulator aims to create rules that consider the “unique characteristics of crypto” and serve the best interests of investors.

MOODENG’s journey is a textbook example of what happens when community love meets market strategy. The token’s current price hovers around $0.00010463, with a market cap of $350.94 million. Its resilience and cultural relevance make it one of the most talked-about meme coins of 2024. If you’d invested in MOODENG during its initial presale, you’d be sitting on a small fortune today. But for many, the chance to buy in passed unnoticed, leaving would-be millionaires lamenting their hesitation. MOODENG’s success underscores one critical lesson: timing is everything. And while it’s still a solid investment, the window to maximise returns has largely closed. But don’t fret—BTFD is here to offer you a second chance at crypto glory.

The MSTR stock ended the year with 332% gains outperforming Bitcoin’s 118% gains in 2024. As the firm plans to issue a massive 10 billion in equity, market analysts are weighing how it would impact the stock price amid a massive supply surge. MicroStrategy And Its Plans to Issue 10 Billion MSTR Stock As said, MicroStrategy outperformed Bitcoin in 2024 by a margin of 3x, however, the MSTR stock witnessed strong selling pressure throughout December last month. From its all-time high of $473 in November 2024, the company’s stock has corrected 40% so far ending 2024 under $300 levels. This hasn’t stopped the business intelligence firm from buying more Bitcoins. Earlier this week, the company announced its final Bitcoin purchase of 2,138 BTC , worth $209 million, for the year 2024. Now that the company plans for equity dilution from 330 million to 10 billion, analysts are skeptical as to what will happen to the MSTR stock price moving into 2025. To approve this equity dilution, Michael Saylor has proposed a MicroStrategy shareholders vote for the equity dilution. MicroStrategy’s business model revolves around an aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy: Borrow at low interest rates: Using 0% convertible notes to raise capital. Buy Bitcoin: Driving its price higher. Sell new shares at a premium: Raising funds to purchase even more Bitcoin. Repeat the cycle. This approach has made Bitcoin integral to MicroStrategy’s operations. However, the proposed share count increase highlights a critical tension. Some critics argue that the move could dilute existing shareholders, reducing their value per share. On the other hand, if the shareholders reject the proposal, the firm would lose its ability to buy Bitcoin on leverage, undermining its core strategy. This puts the company in a “lose-lose” position. Despite concerns, the odds of the proposal passing appear high. Michael Saylor himself controls 46.8% of the voting power. With support from just 4% of remaining shareholders, the measure could gain approval. Markets are pricing this likelihood into the stock’s current performance. Analysts Take on the Stock Performance Commenting on the recent MSTR stock decline, Sino G., Co-Founder and COO at 21st Capital, pointed to the company’s Market Net Asset Value (mNAV), which is highly sensitive to Bitcoin’s sentiment and price momentum. MicroStrategy stock is known to outperform during Bitcoin bull runs due to its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. However, this sensitivity works both ways, explains Sino G. He wrote: In bullish markets: mNAV expands, amplifying stock gains. In bearish or sideways markets: mNAV contracts, leading to sharper declines in $MSTR. Recent stagnation in Bitcoin’s price has dampened upside momentum, leading to a contraction in mNAV and a subsequent pullback in MSTR stock price. Some investors had hoped MSTR could decouple from Bitcoin’s bearish phases, believing its strategy had evolved to mitigate downside risks. However, Sino G warns that this optimism is misplaced. He wrote: “MicroStrategy is not immune to Bitcoin downturns. The stock remains highly correlated with Bitcoin sentiment, and sideways or bearish trends in the cryptocurrency will likely result in mNAV contractions.” Investors might want to approach MSTR bets with caution and without falling into the FOMO trap. As Bitcoin continues its uncertain trajectory, MSTR’s performance will remain closely tied to the cryptocurrency’s market sentiment.

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAI.

Proposed by a coalition of ten Swiss crypto advocates, including Tether’s Vice President of Energy and Mining Giw Zanganeh and Swiss think tank 2B4CH founder Yves Bennaïm, the initiative needs 100,000 signatures to advance a constitutional amendment mandating the Swiss National Bank to hold Bitcoin alongside gold as part of its monetary reserves. The proposal was initially submitted on Dec. 5 and officially registered in Switzerland’s Federal Gazette on Dec. 31, marking the beginning of an 18-month window to solicit the required signatures. With Switzerland’s population at approximately 8.9 million, 1.12% of citizens must back the petition for it to succeed. If this threshold is reached, the proposal will proceed to the Swiss Federal Assembly, the nation’s bicameral parliament, for review. Dubbed the initiative ‘For a financially sound, sovereign and responsible Switzerland,’ it specifically targets Article 99 Paragraph 3 of the Swiss Federal Constitution. The proposed amendment seeks to add the clause: “The National Bank builds up sufficient monetary reserves from its own earnings; part of these reserves are made up of gold and Bitcoin.” You might also like: Swiss Bitcoin advocates launch campaign to include BTC in National Bank reserves In the past, a similar initiative launched by 2B4CH in 2021 was postponed due to timing concerns and a lack of widespread public and institutional support. At that time, the idea of nation-states strategically holding Bitcoin was still in its infancy. This time around, preparations appear more structured, with Bennaïm and his team working on the organizational groundwork and necessary documentation since April 2024. The Swiss National Bank, however, remains cautious about cryptocurrencies. In a November statement, Chairman Martin Schlegel emphasized that while digital assets like Bitcoin have seen significant growth, they still represent a “niche phenomenon” and face limitations due to their volatility, energy-intensive nature, and ties to illicit activities. Meanwhile, Switzerland’s Financial Market Supervisory Authority is concerned about the money laundering risks associated with cryptocurrencies. Yet, crypto adoption in Switzerland tells a different story on the ground. For instance, the Swiss city of Lugano is at the forefront of Bitcoin adoption. The city not only hosts the annual “Plan ₿” Bitcoin conference, attracting crypto enthusiasts from all across the globe, but has also embraced Bitcoin for tax payments since December 2023. Switzerland also houses the renowned Crypto Valley , a web3 and blockchain hub located in Zug. The region is home to over 1,200 blockchain-focused companies, including 13 unicorns valued at over $1 billion.

This marks a significant recovery and growth, as the reserves stood at just $7 billion in June 2023. Therefore, the latest figure reflects a nearly fivefold increase over six months. Such a surge typically indicates increased buying pressure which, in turn, suggests a strong investor confidence and activity in the market. As per the on-chain analytic platform’s data , current reserve levels, holding steady at around $30 billion, indicate continued market positioning by investors that would potentially support sustained demand and market strength. All Eyes on Bitcoin’s Next Stop This development coincides with Bitcoin’s potential breakout above $120,000, driven by strong market fundamentals and Binance’s increasing stablecoin reserves. Analysts believe that BTC, currently trading below $94,000 after a 13% correction from its $108,300 all-time high, could peak at $120,000 in January. Meanwhile, QCP Capital highlighted that Bitcoin’s spot market has faced notable challenges, with thinner liquidity creating gaps and any recent recovery attempts capped by persistent selling pressure. Momentum in the world’s largest crypto by market cap has waned significantly as the year ends, exacerbated by $1.8 billion in net outflows from spot ETFs since December 19 and a slowdown in MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin purchases. This weak price action mirrors broader market sentiment, as major indices like the S&P 500 and NASDAQ have experienced sharp declines amid heightened uncertainty around global trade heading into 2025. Despite the sluggish close, the asset manager said that Bitcoin remains a standout performer in 2024, up 120% and outpacing stocks and gold. Looking to Q1 2025, QCP anticipates institutional asset reallocation in January as a key catalyst for the crypto. With broader institutional adoption, including university endowment funds, Bitcoin’s dominance is expected to grow, stabilizing spot price movements and aligning volatility dynamics more closely with equities. Additionally, QCP predicted stronger demand for downside puts for hedging and increased covered call selling on topside gains. Bitcoin Holder Trend Even as Bitcoin faced pressure, Glassnode’s data revealed that Short-Term Holders (STHs) are still, on average, in a favorable position and hold an unrealized profit of over 7.9%. This suggests that many recent buyers entered the market below the current price levels, with their aggregate cost basis resting at $86,600. This price level is shaping up to be a key region of interest, as it may serve as both a psychological and technical indicator for local price momentum. Last week, CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju also shed light on a growing trend of Bitcoin whales accumulating the crypto through privacy transactions. Over the past two years, CoinJoin transactions have tripled annually, resulting in increased activity in anonymous transfers.

Will crypto be allowed?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/elon-musks-payment-system-x-crypto/,"We just got confirmation that some time in 2025, Elon Musk will be launching X Money, a payment system built to transform X (formerly known as Twitter) into an “everything app.” That kind of app combines social media, payments, and possibly cryptocurrency into one chaotic, and perhaps world-changing experiment. If anyone can pull it off, it’s Elon—love him or hate him. The question now though is: will crypto finally get a seat at the table? Linda Yaccarino, X’s CEO, dropped the news on New Year’s Eve 2024. She also announced extras like X TV and Grok, Elon’s AI baby, to complete the all-in-one fantasy app. A billion users and one dollar sign So X hit one billion users in December. Elon himself confirmed it, though only about 40% of them are truly active, mostly during major events. Still, one billion is no joke. That’s a massive base for a payment system, especially one Elon is positioning as a potential rival to WeChat. If you’re not familiar, WeChat dominates China by letting users do everything from messaging to shopping to transferring money—all without leaving the app. Elon has been eyeing that model for years. The first big hint that X Money was in the works came in November when a dollar sign icon mysteriously appeared on Joe Rogan’s profile. But let’s not forget licensing. X Payments LLC has secured money transmitter licenses in 33 U.S. states, a critical step to operate legally. But New York (America’s Finance Capital) is still a problem. Without a license there, X Money won’t be able to operate in one of the biggest financial markets in the world. The crypto card Now, onto the most interesting part: crypto. Will Elon let X Money handle cryptos? It’s a million-dollar question, and all signs point to a resounding… “probably.” Elon has always had a soft spot for Bitcoin and Dogecoin, so if he does integrate crypto, it’s likely gonna be one of them. There’s also chatter about stablecoins like USDC (USD Coin). Coinbase’s CEO, Brian Armstrong, thinks that USDC could be a perfect fit for X Money. Thanks to their stability, they’re ideal for everyday transactions. Meanwhile, in 2021, Elon pulled the plug on Bitcoin payments for Tesla, blaming the environmental effects of mining. He said at least 50% of Bitcoin’s energy usage needed to come from renewable sources for him to allow it for payments again. Well as we reported before, miners have now hit 56.7%. Regions like Quebec, Iceland, and Texas have gone green, using hydro, geothermal, and solar energy to clean up Bitcoin’s image. This progress could be Elon’s motivation to bring Bitcoin into X Money. See the timing couldn’t be better. President Donald Trump is set to retake the Oval in about two weeks, and his administration is stacked with pro-crypto allies. Trump himself loves crypto and has become quite cozy with Elon—they even spent New Year’s Eve together. As of press time, they’re still together at Mar-a-lago. But this isn’t just about Elon’s love for innovation or his ego (though let’s not pretend that’s not part of it). X Money could change the world. Peer-to-peer payments will likely be a core feature, similar to Venmo or PayPal . The difference? X Money has the potential to introduce crypto into everyday transactions, something no major social platform has done successfully.

In a new interview on the Julia La Roche Show, the macro guru says he has “very high conviction” that policymakers in the US will weaken the dollar this year in an effort to rebuild the country’s defense industrial base. Last month, Gromen said that the US realized it was facing a national security crisis after being defeated by Russia in Ukraine. The investor noted the Department of Defense is now willing to debase the dollar to revive America’s ability to manufacture armaments. Now, Gromen says he sees policymakers turning the money printers back on in a huge way to pay for the labor and materials required to revitalize the defense industry. “Ultimately, that goes right back to, ‘Hey, we need to stop XYZ components – China, Vietnam, Mexico, whatever. We’re going to bring it back here. We need to spend $100 million. We don’t have the labor.’ Who cares? Print it. ‘The labor’s going to go up.’ We don’t care, we have a printing press. Print it. ‘Well, we’re short the steel.’ Don’t care, print it. They’ll just print the money.” Gromen says he expects the newly printed dollars to find their way into Bitcoin and other risk assets. “They’re going to pay to get it done, and they’re not going to let the bond market yields rise to try to stop it. And so ultimately, that cash is going to flow into equities, into Bitcoin, into gold.” The macro guru says Bitcoin will emerge as the biggest winner should the government print more money. “The S&P will probably double, Bitcoin will probably be you know 5x, gold will probably be two, three, 4x.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

While SOL is doing well in the current market, ETH is dropping towards the $3,000 level. Meanwhile, the new PropFi token is emerging as a great opportunity to secure 100x profits in 2025. This new crypto project has already raised over $3.2 million in its public presale. Can it be the next 100x altcoin? Let’s find out! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Solana Sees Positive Capital Inflows Amid Bullish Reversal Signs Glassnode data shows a consistent positive net capital inflow for Solana since early September 2023. With only minor outflows during this period, Solana achieved a peak inflow of $776 million in new capital per day in mid-2024. Besides, in late December 2024, SOL traded around $188 , marking a monthly drop of over 17%. Solana shows signs of a bullish reversal as it breaks out of a downward channel. Analysts highlight the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level as providing strong support. In addition, the SOL price is now nearing the 0.618 retracement level at $197. If momentum continues, the Solana coin could hit $254 or more in 2025. Meanwhile, crypto experts are favoring a new crypto coin as it promises 100x profits. Ethereum Sees Selling Pressure as Its DeFi Coin Price Remains 30% Below Its ATH After making a monthly high of $4,072 , Ethereum is in a downtrend and was trading around $3,380 in late December 2024, with a slight price decrease of 0.40% in the past month. The ETH DeFi coin price is still 30% down from its ATH of $4,890, which it achieved 3 years ago. In addition, Ethereum is showing signs of bearish momentum. A bearish engulfing candle has formed on the daily time frame, with price action remaining below a downward trend line, which signals sustained selling pressure for ETH. Analysts advise against taking trades on ETH unless it sweeps $3,000 liquidity and reclaims levels above this key support. Traders are urged to remain cautious on the ETH DeFi coin as bearish indicators dominate the charts. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE FXGuys Introduces a PropFi Platform With Innovative Programs and Rewards FXGuys ($FXG) is a leading PropFi project that offers innovative solutions for traders and investors.

38378486,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=635562,1735720302,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38378486.jpeg,"Wall Street ends 2024 in a bad mood, even after a historically outstanding year",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wall-street-2024-bad-outstanding/,"Wall Street just wrapped up 2024, and let’s just say the mood wasn’t exactly festive. Investors were expecting the famous “Santa Claus rally” to close out the year with a bang, but that didn’t happen. Historically, this rally—the last five trading days of December and the first two of January—pushes the market up about 1.3%. Not this time. The S&P 500 slumped through the final three trading days of the year, dragging down the five-day stretch into the red. This sour finish has everyone talking. The S&P 500 still managed a 24.1% gain for the year though, its second consecutive annual surge over 20%. That’s only happened twice in history now, the last time being in 1998. The index added $10 trillion in market cap this year alone. The Nasdaq outshined its peers with a 28.64% gain for the year, while the Dow posted a more modest 12.88%. But no one’s popping champagne. December’s lackluster performance has some analysts worried about a rough start to 2025. Santa skips Wall Street as 2025 arrives Without the rally, all eyes are on January. Here’s why it matters: January is like a crystal ball for Wall Street. Jeffrey Hirsch, CEO of Hirsch Holdings and the guy behind the Stock Trader’s Almanac, calls the first five trading days of the month an “early warning system.” If the market’s up, the rest of the year usually follows suit. This little trick has been right in 14 of the last 18 post-election years. But it’s not just about those first few days. January as a whole is a big deal. According to Hirsch, a strong January almost always means strong annual gains. His “January Barometer” claims an 83.3% accuracy rate since 1950. But when the month flops? The rest of the year usually isn’t much better. December’s weak finish already has people nervous. The Federal Reserve isn’t helping matters either. Inflation is still running hot, and their latest projections show rate cuts in 2025 will not be as aggressive as everyone hoped. Or even at all. That reality check hit the S&P 500 hard in early December, triggering its worst single-day drop in months. Tech takes the crown, but risks pile up If you had to pick a winner in 2024, it was tech, no question. As we’ve reported , the so-called “Magnificent Seven”—Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, Nvidia, and Tesla—basically carried the market. Nvidia skyrocketed 171%, and Apple notched a tidy 30% gain. Both hit record highs this year. AI mania played a huge part, with investors betting big on the tech sector’s ability to reshape industries. And why won’t they? The returns are wild, though not everyone’s buying the hype. Skeptics are comparing today’s tech boom to the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s, warning that these valuations might be too good to last. It wasn’t all good though. Industrial materials stocks had a brutal year. China’s sluggish economy and lingering fears of a U.S. recession spooked investors, leaving this sector in the dust. Even within the tech-heavy S&P 500, volatility was a problem. Stocks took a beating in August, with losses spreading beyond just the tech giants. Still, sentiment stayed surprisingly upbeat for most of the year. Bank of America reported that fund managers had the highest net long exposure to the S&P 500 in over 20 years by December. Retail investors were just as optimistic, with Deutsche Bank noting record-high enthusiasm for stock market gains heading into 2025. Trump, rate cuts, and Bitcoin Politics played a huge role in 2024’s market story. President Trump’s re-election sent stocks soaring in November, thanks to promises of tax cuts and deregulation. Bank stocks were the big winners here. JPMorgan jumped 41%, while Goldman Sachs shot up 48% by year’s end. Tesla, boosted by Trump ally Elon Musk, ended the year up 62%. The Fed also stepped in, cutting interest rates by a full percentage point since September. It was the first rate cut cycle since the pandemic, and it gave the market a much-needed boost. Meanwhile, Bitcoin stole the spotlight from the traditional markets with a record-breaking year. The apex surged 119%, smashing past $100,000 for the first time. It was the best investment asset of the year . But Citi’s U.S. economic surprise index slipped in December, signaling that growth might be slowing. Treasury yields are high, the dollar is strong, and the amount of money circulating in the economy isn’t growing fast enough. Analysts are already warning that 2025 could bring an economic contraction. That won’t be good for Bitcoin.

Syria, a nation still recovering from the fall of the Assad government, is getting ready for a drastic financial reform: the legalization or Bitcoin ( BTC ). To combat inflation, stabilize the country’s economy, and draw in foreign investment, the Syrian Center for Economic Research has put forth a bold plan that calls on the transitional government to embrace BTC and other digital currencies. https://twitter.com/bamskki/status/1874069183056724121 Following decades of war and economic destruction, the country is now confronted with the daunting task of reconstruction. To give the currency much-needed stability, the plan calls for digitizing the Syrian pound on the blockchain and backing it with BTC , gold, and dollars. Along with encouraging business people to use Syria’s energy resources for mining activities, it also aims to legalize BTC mining and trade under a thorough regulatory framework, guaranteeing stringent control to prevent monopolies and environmental damage. You might also like: Russian Authorities to Legalize Bitcoin (BTC) Mining in Select Areas To streamline remittances and create chances for companies impacted by years of volatility, financial institutions, startups, and currency exchanges will be encouraged to integrate BTC into their offerings. The program highlights privacy and security as fundamental values and stresses Syrian residents’ right to retain complete self-custody of their digital assets. The nation has numerous challenges in spite of these lofty objectives, including foreign sanctions, inadequate technical infrastructure, and the debts incurred by the previous government. The decentralized structure of BTC may enable Syria to evade established banking institutions, a tactic used by other countries under strict sanctions, such as North Korea and Iran. It’s crucial to distinguish between the Syrian Center for Economic Research’s proposal to legalize BTC and the contentious use of cryptocurrencies by terrorist groups like Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham. HTS, previously affiliated with al-Qa’ida, has reportedly utilized digital currencies to fund its operations, raising significant ethical and legal concerns. In contrast, the Syrian Center for Economic Research aims to establish a legitimate, transparent financial system under the supervision of the transitional government, intended to benefit the entire Syrian population rather than specific factions. With varying degrees of success, nations such as El Salvador and the Central African Republic have attempted to legalize BTC. El Salvador has been criticized for economic risks and debt issues despite seeing an increase in tourism and some international investment. In contrast, Syria’s difficulties are made worse by geopolitical complications, necessitating substantial technology investments and international collaboration to succeed. The strategy might establish Syria as a leader in the Middle East in the adoption of cryptocurrencies if it is carried out, but it is doubtful if it will succeed, given long-standing political and financial obstacles.

BTC Stopped at $96K The primary cryptocurrency had a painful end to an otherwise bullish year as it dropped from its latest all-time high of $108,300 to $92,000 within days in the middle of December. Although it bounced off initially and neared $100,000 on a couple of occasions, the bears were quick to intercept the moves and didn’t allow any further gains. Just the opposite, BTC started to lose value in the following days, which culminated on Monday with a plunge to $91,300. This became its lowest price tag in just over a month. The bulls managed to intercept the move and drove BTC to $95,000 later that day and up to $96,000 on Tuesday. However, this was another false breakout and the cryptocurrency is down by nearly three grand since then to just over $93,000 as of now. Its market capitalization has slumped beneath $1.850 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the altcoins remains strong at 54.3%. Bitcoin/Price/Chart. 01.01.2025.

Even more painful declines are evident from Chainlink, SUI, HBAR, and APT. In the case of LINK, the price drop is almost 5%, which has pushed it to under $20. In contrast, XRP has finally charted a minor increase after a tough week , while VIRTUAL, OM, and XMR have gained around 5-7% each.

How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-01 08:55:00

33767162,[object Object],1735722017,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Trump’s Plan To Buy 500,000 Bitcoin Will Pass US Senate, Claims Scaramucci",https://bitcoinist.com/trump-buy-500000-bitcoin-pass-us-senate-scaramucci/,"Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital and author of the upcoming The Little Book of Bitcoin, has voiced his belief that a sizable government purchase of Bitcoin—potentially as much as 500,000 BTC—will advance through the US Senate. Speaking on the Bankless podcast with host Ryan Sean Adams, Scaramucci suggested that top lawmakers are aligning to introduce a strategic Bitcoin reserve, despite the apparent risk to the US dollar’s perceived backing. Will Trump Buy Bitcoin? Scaramucci, who maintains close ties to several legislators, addressed current Senate sentiment regarding a possible government acquisition of Bitcoin and cited broad support for Senator Cynthia Lummis’ bill . “They’ve got the votes. Hagerty wants it. McCormack wants it,” he stated. In reference to whether he thinks the Senate would approve a plan to enlarge the government’s Bitcoin holdings, he affirmed, “I do think so, yes.” Although Senator Lummis’ initial proposal included purchasing up to one million BTC, Scaramucci contended that the final arrangement might be different. “This stuff gets horse traded so you’ll probably have 200,000 BTC won’t get sold—they’ll probably buy another 400,000 or 500,000 Bitcoin over the next ,” he remarked, omitting a precise timeline. He elaborated that Donald Trump will be a significant force behind such a plan: “Trump wants it to happen and he’s got the Senate Banking Committee. Tim Scott wants it to happen—he’s going to be the chair of the Senate Banking Committee.” One of the most significant takeaways from Scaramucci’s remarks is the potential for bipartisan support, even if notable opponents such as Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) have criticized pro-BTC and crypto measures in the past. In referencing earlier legislation, Scaramucci pointed out that “a lot of Democrats voted for the SAB 121 Bill ,” adding: “If you looked at the dispersion of the vote, it was a bipartisan approval of that bill. And by the way, Ryan, if you were below the age of 60 and a Democrat, you voted for the bill. If you were a fossil like Elizabeth Warren or Sherrod Brown, you voted against it.” He went on to name Ro Khanna (D-CA) as a Democrat he believes would likely support a strategic Bitcoin reserve. According to Scaramucci, younger legislators increasingly view Bitcoin through the lens of “digital gold,” making them more open to incorporating it into federal holdings. A central theme in Scaramucci’s argument for a strategic Bitcoin reserve is the comparison to gold. The US currently has around $600 billion worth of gold in its reserves. In his view, dedicating a fraction of that amount to BTC—even to the extent of selling off some gold reserves—could fortify the US economy in an era of digital transformation. “If Bitcoin is digital gold, and we have $600 billion of gold on reserve at our Federal Reserve Bank, you’re telling me we couldn’t put $750 million to $1 billion of Bitcoin on reserve? Is that what you’re saying?” he asked, emphasizing the plausibility of this approach. Scaramucci’s stance extends beyond just holding BTC; he also believes that if China or other major economies move swiftly into Bitcoin reserves, the US could risk losing a strategic advantage. He underscored that the possible sum for a 400,000 or 500,000 BTC purchase might stand at around $70–$80 billion—representing just 1–1.5% of a $6 trillion federal budget, or approximately 30 basis points allocated over five years. “If you put me in that seat and said, ‘Is it in the United States’ national interest to have a strategic reserve in Bitcoin?’ I would say yes,” Scaramucci stated. “And then if you said to me why, I would say three reasons. Number one, I do believe it’s digital gold. Number two, the younger generation is going to live much further in the digital world than me. Number three, we believe, rightly or wrongly, that the Chinese are going to move to buy Bitcoin.” Critics of a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve often argue that building a substantial reserve could undermine global confidence in the US dollar, raising questions about what the dollar is backed by. However, Scaramucci sees it differently, suggesting the US could reinforce the dollar’s standing by staying technologically competitive: “Maybe because I’ve been in the space longer, I think we’re further along,” he reflected. “We’re in a modern society. And Trump wants to make a statement. If we believe that the Chinese are going to move to make [Bitcoin] a strategic reserve asset, then what are we talking about? You’re talking about a small percentage of the budget to buy Bitcoin over five years, which could strengthen the dollar emotionally and put the United States on better competitive footing.” At press time, BTC traded at $93,702.",Bitcoin News|Anthony Scaramucci|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|Donald Trump Bitcoin|Donald Trump Bitcoin News|Strategic Bitcoin Reserve|Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Trump,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-01 09:00:17

Analysts Answer,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/why-has-the-rally-momentum-in-bitcoin-price-lost-its-momentum-analysts-answer/,"Bitcoin has shown resilience by holding above $95,000 despite a decline in global stock indices. This comes as markets assess the outcome of the December 18 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, where Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled a slower pace of quantitative easing through 2025. However, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap is not immune to broader market pressures. On a weekly basis, Bitcoin has been down along with major stock indexes, with a two-week negative return of 11%, according to K33 Head of Research Vetle Lunde. Ethereum (ETH) has fared worse, falling 15% in the same period, pushing the ETH/BTC ratio to 0.036. K33 Research highlighted Bitcoin’s strong correlation with global equity markets, particularly the Nasdaq, in a report published today. BTC’s 30-day correlation with the Nasdaq has risen above 0.50, the first time such a correlation has occurred since late September. Related News: Onchain Data Reveals: This Cryptocurrency Whale Made $49 Million in Profits on One Altcoin Today, Now Buys Another Altcoin The December 18 FOMC meeting was described as a significant turning point for risk assets, including Bitcoin. During the meeting, the Fed revised its 2025 rate cut estimates from four to two. While rate cuts generally boost markets, the reduced number of projected cuts dampened optimism for risk assets. In addition, Powell’s comments during the press conference hinted at potential inflationary pressures from a possible Trump presidency, a departure from the Fed’s message in November. “While the Fed has cut interest rates by 100 basis points since September, the 10-year Treasury note has risen by the same amount, indicating the market expects an inflationary impulse,” Lunde said. Bitcoin’s momentum was further disrupted by significant exchange-traded fund (ETF) outflows and reduced buying activity from major companies like MicroStrategy. Since mid-December, the digital asset has struggled to recapture its previous uptrend, finding support at $91,000, a recent low on Nov. 26. Bitcoin’s weak performance reflects broader market sentiment, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each posting their third 1% decline in eight sessions amid uncertainty surrounding global trade in 2025. Trading volumes on major crypto exchanges also declined, with the seven-day average daily spot volume falling to $3.4 billion, the lowest level since Nov. 5, according to K33 Research. Lunde attributed the slowdown to typical holiday seasonality, exacerbated by reduced activity on ETFs and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). “MicroStrategy’s softening Bitcoin purchases also contributed to lower trading volumes,” he added. *This is not investment advice.

Of the many projects he helped advertise – many of which he is accused of swiftly abandoning – he is most associated with an ill-fated meme coin called Daddy Tate (DADDY). Though DADDY had several periods in 2024 – most notably in July and October – when it performed admirably, it is, nonetheless, substantially down this year. DADDY meme coin performance in 2024 Specifically, on June 14, 2024, the earliest date available in the chart retrieved on December 31 from CoinMarketCap by FInbold, Daddy Tate was changing hands at $0.2407. From there, it waxed and waned on multiple occasions and even recovered near its initial highs on July 5 – to $0.2239 – and on October 15 – to $0.1814 – but its trajectory was generally downward with a series of lower highs. Finally, at the time DADDY data was retrieved, the meme coin was priced at $0.06032 – 74.48% below its original valuation. Such a plunge means that those investors who jumped at the opportunity to back Andrew Tate’s cryptocurrency project with $1,000 would have lost $750 and have $250 left. DADDY all-time price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Why DADDY price might never recover While starting high and rushing to meet the ground is nothing strange for meme coins and other altcoins, there is a particular note of drama to the collapse of Daddy Tate. The worst and most decisive of its downturns – at least to date – can be traced back to a scathing video published by the prominent online sleuth and Youtuber Stephen Findeisen, better known as Coffeezilla. In the video, Findeisen claims to have investigated Andrew Tate’s involvement with cryptocurrencies and argues that, essentially, all of these interactions amount to little more than ‘pump and dump’ schemes .

The expectations for AI agents go beyond the short-term hype, as there are ways in which agents can accelerate all crypto trends. AI agents will go beyond their short-term rally, with the potential to accelerate all crypto trends. Only after a few months as primarily content agents, the newly launched startups are testing the AI’s independent coding capabilities. One of the first tests for independent creation capabilities was ran by AI16Z, one of the leading agents in the past months. AI16Z has the exposure to attract developers, while also posting its own open source code on GitHub. First PR reviewed, commented on, and merged—powered by our @github @ai16zdao agent! 🚀 The only manual touchpoint (for now) was updating the branch and resolving comments to make it mergable. This is just the beginning. Get hyped for what’s next! 🛠️🤖🔥 pic.twitter.com/SNkYnRrxSV — Reality Spiral – ai16z/acc/🧚‍♀️ (@reality_spiral) January 1, 2025 At this point, AI agents are capable of very fast content and code creation, but they still face the bottleneck of attracting other developers and end users. However, a new trend has emerged where AI agents from one ecosystem communicate with each other. All agents from Virtuals Protocol are also connecting on social media and engaging in an AI swarm. This connection network may become a source of value, as competing for human mindshare is still the bottleneck of crypto. Most of the self-directed behaviors are still in the testing stage, but they have the potential to accelerate previous crypto trends, this time performed by AI agents. AI market abandons gimmick tokens The last months of 2024 focused on novelty tokens, which were reportedly the creation of AI language models. This led to the rise of GOAT, FARTCOIN, GNON, and others, which mostly depend on hype and speculative trading. The new year comes with a shift toward utility and infrastructure. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) extended its rally into the new year, peaking at $4.10. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) set new price records above $4.10. | Source: CoinGecko AIXBT, one of the leading crypto accounts, shifted to market analysis and data-gathering. In the past few weeks, AIXBT grew its mindshare and accrued more X followers, surpassing Truth Terminal , the original content-producing AI agent. AI16Z also extended its influence, in preparation for its own AI agent launchpad. The project also hinted at creating its own L1 network. Swarm introduces AI breeding One of the trends that picked up in December and will continue into the new year is the Spore.fun framework. Spore.fun takes the idea of digital genes, which had its first iteration with NFT collections. While the first AI agents were deliberately created and trained by humans, Spore introduces a form of breeding. The project truly integrates all Web3 themes, including a tokenization and fee side, digital genes and breeding, and full ownership of newly bred AI models. Spore also uses existing infrastructure, partnering with leading AI projects, including AI16Z and the ELIZA framework, as well as Phala Network, which offers specialized computation and security for AI agents. AI agents may take a share of human-dominated Web3 activity The AI agent trend also achieves a feat that has evaded crypto projects – fast and iterative product launches, instead of focusing on the technicalities of chains. AI agents use Web3 and tokens in the background, instead focusing on tapping the value of content. AI mutation, breeding, tokens, and interactions are starting to build a new crypto economy, taking on the turf of crypto influencers and traders. The new economy still has relatively low value locked compared to other crypto trends, but expects growth in the new year. AI agents are still only capable of small-scale actions, and cannot compete with the liquidity of DeFi, lending and other human-dominated tools. However, the space is quickly growing. Within days, VIRTUAL rallied to over $4B in market capitalization, while AIXBT is on track to reach $700M after a near-vertical climb. Just like meme tokens accelerated altcoin speculation, AI agents may accelerate the meme space, going through trends even faster than human actors. The value created, however, is still expected to accrue to the top infrastructure tokens. The AI agent trend may also lift up DePIN assets and builders of utility frameworks to make agent activity easier and faster.

In a December 31 update shared by the Juicebox project Free Pertsev and Storm, Buterin donated 50 ETH, valued at approximately $170,000, to aid the embattled developers. This generous contribution constitutes about 25% of the $650,000 raised through JusticeDAO to back their legal battle. Buterin Supports to Strengthen Legal Aid The case stems from allegations that the Tornado Cash mixing service facilitated illicit activities. Dutch authorities arrested Pertsev in 2022 , leading to a conviction for money laundering and a prison sentence of over five years. Pertsev plans to appeal the verdict. Similarly, U.S. prosecutors have charged Storm and Roman Semenov with money laundering, sanctions violations, and fraud tied to their roles in the project. Storm, who is currently out on bail, awaits his trial scheduled for April 14, while Semenov remains at large. The charges largely stem from the U.S. Treasury Department’s 2022 decision to add Tornado Cash to its Specially Designated Nationals list, citing its alleged use by hackers, including North Korean groups, to launder over $7 billion in cryptocurrency since 2019. Industry Criticism and Legal Challenges The sanctions and criminal charges have sparked widespread backlash from the crypto community, with many arguing they unfairly target developers of neutral technology. Buterin’s recent donation follows a previous contribution of 100 ETH (approximately $240,000) to the same cause in October, highlighting his continued commitment to defending the developers. Efforts to crowdfund support have faced challenges, such as GoFundMe’s shutdown of a similar campaign in February. Despite these obstacles, the crypto community has rallied behind the developers, emphasizing the importance of protecting innovation and ensuring due process. The U.S. Treasury faces ongoing lawsuits from advocacy group Coin Center and Tornado Cash users backed by Coinbase, arguing that sanctioning immutable smart contracts overreaches regulatory authority. While a November appellate court ruling found the Treasury had overstepped, it did not influence the criminal proceedings against Storm.

Meanwhile, Hive Digital announced that it will relocate to Texas due to Trump’s pro-Bitcoin policies, and Switzerland made major strides with a proposal to include Bitcoin in its national monetary reserves. Crypto Investors Get Temporary Relief from IRS FIFO Rule The United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) granted temporary relief to cryptocurrency holders on centralized exchanges from a rule that would have mandated the use of the FIFO (First In, First Out) accounting method for tax purposes. Under the initial IRS ruling , if investors did not explicitly select an accounting method, like HIFO (Highest In, First Out) or Specific Identification (Spec ID), brokers would default to reporting sales using FIFO. This method assumes that the oldest cryptocurrency bought is sold first, which could lead to higher capital gains taxes for many taxpayers. Tax experts like Shehan Chandrasekera , the head of tax at Cointracker, warned that the immediate enforcement of the rule could have caused serious financial strain for crypto investors during a bull market. Selling older assets first, often with the lowest cost basis, would unintentionally maximize taxable gains. Mark Thomas , a crypto commentator, pointed out that FIFO could be beneficial only in specific scenarios, like when the sale date is more than one year after the earliest crypto purchase but within a year of the latest purchase, potentially qualifying for long-term capital gains tax instead of short-term. The temporary relief postpones the rule’s enforcement for sales on centralized crypto exchanges until Dec. 31 of 2025. This extension allows brokers more time to implement support for multiple accounting methods. During this period, taxpayers are responsible for maintaining their own records for tax reporting purposes. This update happened after a legal challenge was filed on Dec. 28 by the Blockchain Association and the Texas Blockchain Council against the IRS. The lawsuit argues that the expanded broker reporting rules, which include decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and require brokers to disclose detailed information about digital asset transactions, violate constitutional rights. The expanded requirements are set to take effect in 2027, and will obligate brokers to report taxpayer identities and gross proceeds from crypto and other digital asset sales. Trump Era May Shift Focus Away from Bitcoin In addition to the latest tax developments, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju recently suggested that President-elect Donald Trump’s approach to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will likely depend on the global perception of the United States economy and the strength of the US dollar. According to Ju, store-of-value assets like Bitcoin and gold typically experience price surges when there are perceived threats to US economic dominance . However, the continued global confidence in the US economy and the dollar as a safe haven currency may diminish the likelihood of the Trump administration adopting Bitcoin as part of a strategic reserve. Ju argued that Trump’s focus on projecting US strength and the ongoing inflows of capital into the dollar could reinforce confidence in its supremacy, which could potentially lead to a reversal of pro-Bitcoin policies. Ju also shed some light on a broader trend, particularly in emerging economies, where people increasingly choose the US dollar or dollar-pegged stablecoins over gold or Bitcoin as a safe haven. He specifically pointed to examples like Koreans favoring the dollar due to the weakening won and people in hyperinflation-stricken regions using stablecoins to preserve value. At the Bitcoin MENA conference, Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla stated that the financial system is moving on-chain, with stablecoins poised to improve the utility of the US dollar by combining its reliability with the internet’s speed and connectivity. He also mentioned that stablecoins have become a critical tool for individuals in regions experiencing economic instability. For instance, Turkey grappled with a 67% inflation rate in March of 2024, and has seen the world’s highest rate of stablecoin purchases relative to GDP. Stablecoin purchasing as a share of GDP (Source: Chainalysis) Chainalysis reported in 2023 that over 50% of digital assets sent to Latin American countries like Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, and Mexico were stablecoins. Trump’s Bitcoin Vision Attracts Hive Digital to Texas Bitcoin mining firm Hive Digital Technologies (HIVE) announced plans to relocate its headquarters from Vancouver, Canada, to Texas thanks to President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance. In a statement on Dec. 31, HIVE specifically mentioned the Trump administration’s support for innovation and a favorable regulatory environment for Bitcoin miners as influential factors in the decision. Texas was chosen for its supportive business climate, robust energy infrastructure, and access to skilled talent. HIVE described the US as a global leader in cryptocurrency adoption. The company also sees the depth of US capital markets, with $40 trillion in market capitalization and $500 billion in daily trading volumes, as very essential to its growth strategy. Executive chairman Frank Holmes believes that relocating to the US provides the liquidity, visibility, and valuation opportunities that are necessary for scaling operations. Texas emerged as a hub for Bitcoin mining by hosting major operators like Applied Digital, Galaxy, Bitdeer, Cipher, Core Scientific, Hut 8, Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital, and Iris Energy. The state’s appeal to miners aligns with Trump’s earlier statements advocating for Bitcoin mining to remain in the US. After a meeting with Riot Platforms executives, Trump shared plans on Truth Social about his desire for all future Bitcoin to be mined domestically. Switzerland Moves Closer to Bitcoin Adoption at National Level Meanwhile, a new proposal to require the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to include Bitcoin in its monetary reserves has been initiated by the Swiss federal chancellery. The initiative was launched on Dec. 31, and aims to gather 100,000 signatures to qualify for a public referendum. Giw Zanganeh, Tether’s vice president of Energy and Mining, and Yves Bennaïm, founder of Swiss Bitcoin nonprofit think tank 2B4CH, spearheaded the proposal alongside eight other Bitcoin advocates. The idea was first explored in October of 2021, and gained momentum as Bitcoin's adoption by nation-states became more plausible. The proposal seeks to amend Article 99 Paragraph 3 of the Swiss Federal Constitution to mandate the SNB to build monetary reserves that include both gold and Bitcoin. The proponents of the proposal argue that this measure will contribute to a financially sound and sovereign Switzerland. The campaign was officially registered in Switzerland’s Federal Gazette on Dec. 31, and has until June 30 of 2026 to collect the required signatures. Bennaïm described the timing as ideal due to the increasing relevance of Bitcoin in global financial systems. Bitcoin adoption in Switzerland has seen a lot of growth, particularly in Lugano, where 260 merchants accept the cryptocurrency. The city also hosts the annual “Plan ₿” Bitcoin conference. However, SNB Chair Martin Schlegel has voiced some concerns about Bitcoin’s energy consumption and suitability as a payment method. Globally, other nations are also exploring Bitcoin reserves. In the United States, a bill sponsored by Senator Cynthia Lummis proposes holding Bitcoin in the Treasury’s reserves.

On one front, Buterin has urged Elon Musk to adopt a more measured tone in discussions about free speech and immigration on X, while also voicing concerns over the use of platform moderation tools. Simultaneously, Buterin has extended substantial financial support to the legal defense of Tornado Cash developers. Vitalik Buterin Urges Elon Musk to Moderate Tone Amid Heated H1B Visa Debate Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has called for Elon Musk to adopt a more measured approach in his public discourse following a heated debate on the treatment of foreign tech workers in the United States. Buterin’s comments, shared in a Dec. 31 post on X, were in response to an expletive-laden defense by Musk of immigrant workers employed under H1B visas, a stance that has sparked outrage among some conservative voices. The controversy began when Musk expressed support for hiring foreign tech workers, arguing that immigration contributes positively to the US technology sector. His comments drew sharp criticism from conservatives, who argued that such policies disadvantage native-born workers. The debate quickly escalated, with accusations that Musk’s social media platform was silencing dissenting voices by removing premium features from accounts critical of his position. Musk’s combative tone in defending his stance, coupled with allegations of censorship on X, further inflamed the situation. Critics accused the platform of undermining free speech — a principle Musk has championed since acquiring X in 2022. Musk’s response to these allegations was defiant, but it also reignited discussions about the responsibilities of tech leaders in moderating public discourse. Buterin, a prominent voice in the tech and cryptocurrency space, intervened with a plea for balance. While he commended Musk’s dedication to free speech, he expressed concern over the “tone of discourse” and the alleged use of the “social media banhammer” to stifle dissent. In his post, Buterin stressed the importance of respecting free speech even when it challenges one’s own beliefs. He warned of the dangers of centralized control over public discourse. “The banhammer is controlled by one group today, it will be controlled by another group tomorrow.” Buterin urged Musk to recognize the broader implications of his actions, emphasizing the need for leaders to set a positive tone. He cautioned against fostering an adversarial environment, likening such an approach to a “wartime mode” that stifles innovation and collaboration. Buterin also criticized the concept of the “banhammer” as an ineffective tool for managing public speech, arguing that it often leads to polarization. He described a bleak outcome where public discourse deteriorates into “balkanization,” “monoculture,” or a “constant war of all against all.” Instead, Buterin called for a shift toward constructive dialogue and collaboration, advocating for a brighter and more inclusive approach to leadership. He urged Musk to use his influence on X to foster an environment that benefits humanity rather than deepening societal divides. Musk’s Persona and Response Musk, known for his provocative online persona, recently changed his X name to “Kekius Maximus,” blending internet culture references with the iconic Gladiator character Maximus Decimus Meridius. This whimsical alter ego is emblematic of Musk’s unconventional style, but it has also drawn criticism for undermining the gravity of serious debates. While Musk has not directly responded to Buterin’s remarks, the exchange places the spotlight on the challenges faced by influential figures navigating the intersection of technology, free speech, and societal expectations. The debate between Buterin and Musk shows the complexities of balancing free speech with responsible leadership in an era where social media platforms wield immense power over public discourse. As global leaders in technology, both figures face growing scrutiny over their ability to influence societal norms and set the tone for public conversations. For Musk, the controversy serves as a reminder of the challenges in aligning his platform’s policies with his outspoken defense of free speech. For Buterin, it highlights the importance of measured leadership in fostering a culture of open and constructive dialogue. The ongoing debate over H1B visas and free speech extends beyond X, reflecting broader tensions within the tech industry. As companies grapple with workforce diversity and globalization, leaders like Musk and Buterin play pivotal roles in shaping the narrative. Their exchanges serve as a microcosm of the challenges faced by the tech industry in balancing innovation, inclusion, and accountability. As the discourse unfolds, the tech world — and society at large — will watch closely to see how leaders navigate these contentious issues, setting the tone for the future of public dialogue in an increasingly connected world. Vitalik Buterin Donates $170,000 to Tornado Cash Developers’ Legal Defense Amid Ongoing Trials In addition to reaching out to Musk, Buterin also recently made a substantial contribution to the legal defense fund for Tornado Cash developers Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev, providing critical support in their high-profile legal battles. Buterin’s donation, totaling 50 Ether (ETH) — valued at approximately $170,000 at the time — was announced in a Dec. 31 post by the Juicebox project, Free Pertsev and Storm. This marks a continued effort by Buterin to rally behind the developers, who have faced significant legal challenges stemming from their involvement in the cryptocurrency mixing service Tornado Cash. Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev are at the center of legal controversies surrounding Tornado Cash, a decentralized protocol that allows users to anonymize cryptocurrency transactions. The US Treasury Department sanctioned Tornado Cash in 2022, alleging that it was used by bad actors, including North Korean hackers, to launder over $7 billion in crypto assets since 2019. Buterin’s donation accounts for approximately 25% of the total $650,000 raised through JusticeDAO to support the Tornado Cash developers. Roman Storm, one of the recipients, confirmed the donation, emphasizing its significance ahead of his trial, which is scheduled to begin on April 14. Alexey Pertsev, who was arrested by Dutch authorities in 2022, was convicted of money laundering in May 2024 and sentenced to over five years in prison. He plans to appeal the verdict. Meanwhile, Roman Semenov, another Tornado Cash developer, has been charged by US prosecutors but remains at large. The charges against Tornado Cash developers include money laundering, fraud, and violations of sanctions laws. These allegations have ignited widespread debate within the cryptocurrency community, with many viewing the legal actions as an overreach by regulatory authorities. The US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated Tornado Cash on its Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list in August 2022, effectively sanctioning its operations . The move sparked a backlash from privacy advocates and crypto enthusiasts, who argue that the protocol’s open-source nature and immutable smart contracts make it akin to public infrastructure rather than a controlled entity. In November 2024, an appellate court ruled that the Treasury had “ overstepped ” by sanctioning Tornado Cash’s immutable smart contracts. However, this ruling did not directly impact the criminal cases against the developers. Vitalik Buterin has been a vocal advocate for privacy and decentralization in the crypto space. His donation to the Tornado Cash developers is not the first demonstration of his support. In October, Buterin contributed 100 ETH (then worth $240,000) to the same Juicebox project. Earlier fundraising efforts on platforms like GoFundMe were shut down, leaving JusticeDAO as a primary avenue for financial support. Buterin’s contributions have drawn attention to the broader implications of the Tornado Cash case. In a statement, he stressed the importance of preserving innovation and protecting individuals in the decentralized ecosystem from punitive measures stemming from the actions of malicious actors. Wider Crypto Industry Outcry The sanctions and subsequent criminal charges against Tornado Cash developers have sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency industry. Advocacy groups like Coin Center, along with prominent crypto firms such as Coinbase, have filed lawsuits challenging the Treasury’s actions. Critics argue that targeting developers for creating open-source technology sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the core principles of decentralization and freedom. Coin Center and Tornado Cash users contend that the sanctions infringe upon constitutional rights, such as free speech and due process. The crypto community has rallied behind the developers, calling for clearer regulatory guidelines and protections for individuals contributing to open-source projects. The Tornado Cash saga represents a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry, testing the boundaries between regulatory oversight and the ethos of decentralization. As developers face potential legal liability for creating tools that can be misused, the case raises critical questions about innovation, accountability, and the future of blockchain technology. As the April 14 trial date for Roman Storm approaches, the crypto industry will be closely watching for developments in both the legal proceedings and the broader regulatory landscape. For Tornado Cash, its developers, and the broader crypto community, the legal battles serve as a reminder of the delicate balance between fostering innovation and navigating an evolving regulatory environment.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-01 09:30:00

The relief program will run from January 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025. It will allow holders to use their records or crypto tax software tools to specify which units they are selling rather than being locked into First-In, First-Out (FIFO). IRS allow crypto holders to avoid forced FIFO sales in 2025 The IRS instituted custodial broker regulations a few months ago, set to take effect at the start of 2025. The regulations under Section 6045 required crypto holders using CeFi brokers to specify their preferred accounting method, such as Specific Identification (Spec ID) or Highest-In, First-Out (HIFO); otherwise, their assets will be sold through FIFO. However, by January 1, 2025, most centralized exchanges would still be unable to support Spec ID, meaning some users would have to sell their CeFi holdings exclusively using the FIFO method. Selling under FIFO meant selling the earliest purchased assets first, typically the cheapest, potentially leading to higher capital gains and increased tax bills. To address the issue, the IRS has provided a one-year temporary relief for CeFi users, enabling them to document the specific units sold using their books and records or crypto tax tools. Therefore, holders won’t necessarily be compelled to use FIFO for 2025. Then again, no filing is required to earn the temporary extension; it applies to all users on centralized exchanges. The Internal Revenue Service expects centralized exchanges to have established the necessary accounting methods by 2026. Thus, after December 31, 2025, users must choose their preferred accounting method, or they’ll be forced to sell under FIFO.

They drive the crypto market and create narratives that shape the direction of bull and bear markets. Being on the right side of the trends in blockchain technology can be the catalyst for success. In this article, we will discuss the best blockchain development trends that have not only signaled advancements recently but will also shape the technology’s future development. Table of Contents Expansion of DeFi AI that is decentralized Digital ownership through NFTs Financial inclusion and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) Interoperability between blockchains Green crypto initiatives and regenerative finance (ReFi) Asset tokenization Summing it up Expansion of DeFi By removing middlemen and facilitating peer-to-peer financial services, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has upended established financial institutions. With protocols providing a variety of services, such as lending, borrowing, staking, and yield farming, the use of DeFi has exploded. Without depending on centralized organizations, these platforms give people the chance to generate revenues on their digital assets. DeFi is a key component of the blockchain ecosystem as innovations like automated market makers (AMMs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) improve accessibility and liquidity. Better inclusion and scalability are key to DeFi’s future and keeping it relevant in the blockchain technology market. The user experience is being enhanced and transaction costs are being decreased via layer-2 solutions like Optimistic Rollups and zkRollups. Moreover, DeFi protocols can now function across several blockchains thanks to cross-chain bridges, which improves interoperability and liquidity. We can anticipate that institutional investors will join the DeFi market as regulatory clarity increases, spurring its expansion and opening the door for increasingly complex financial products.

A guide AI that is decentralized By using blockchain technology to disperse processing and data storage throughout a decentralized network, decentralized artificial intelligence (deAI) is poised to revolutionize the way artificial intelligence functions. By allowing people and organizations to utilize machine learning tools while maintaining ownership over their data, deAI improves transparency, security, and privacy in contrast to standard AI systems that are managed by centralized institutions. This change responds to growing worries about concentrated monopolies and data exploitation. Blockchain and deAI integration is opening up revolutionary possibilities in sectors including logistics, healthcare, and finance. For instance, banking companies can utilize decentralized models to jointly detect fraud without disclosing proprietary data, and anonymized patient data exchanged via deAI networks might enhance diagnostics while protecting privacy. These developments enable smaller businesses to participate in historically restricted markets by democratizing access to AI. Decentralized AI can actually become the future of blockchain technology if the current pace of advancement is continued over time. Digital ownership through NFTs Our understanding of ownership has changed as a result of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), particularly in the digital sphere. NFTs were first made famous by digital art and collectibles, but they have now spread to other industries like virtual real estate, gaming, and music. They give purchasers verifiable ownership and scarcity while giving creators new sources of income and a direct line to their audience. By allowing players to earn rewards with actual value, play-to-earn (P2E) games that make use of NFTs are revolutionizing gaming economies. In the future, NFTs have far more promise than just entertainment. Real-world assets such as luxury goods, intellectual property, and real estate are increasingly being tokenized. NFTs can guarantee authenticity and ownership by utilizing blockchain’s transparency and immutability, which addresses problems like fraud and counterfeiting. Furthermore, advancements in NFT interoperability will make it possible for assets to transfer between platforms with ease, opening up new avenues for creativity both inside and outside of the metaverse. Financial inclusion and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) In the financial industry, central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, have gained attention as one of the latest trends in blockchain technology, and 2025 is predicted to be a breakthrough year for them. In order to modernize payment systems and advance financial inclusion, nations in both established and emerging economies are aggressively implementing CBDC projects. A 2024 PYMNTS.com analysis states that 134 countries are presently investigating digital currency projects. CBDCs offer underbanked people a safe and affordable substitute for regular banking. CBDCs have the ability to change economic policy and increase financial literacy by decreasing the need for real currency and improving transaction efficiency. Their incorporation into current financial systems, however, is probably going to lead to contentious discussions around centralization and privacy, particularly in nations where governments strictly regulate monetary systems. Interoperability between blockchains The emergence of new networks and platforms is causing the blockchain ecosystem to become more fragmented. Interoperability—the capacity of several blockchains to exchange data and communicate with one another without any problems—has become urgently necessary as a result. Blockchains can now work together harmoniously because of innovative solutions developed by projects like Polkadot and Cosmos, which promote an integrated ecology. By facilitating the seamless transfer of assets and data between networks, cross-chain bridges significantly improve interoperability. For the upcoming generation of DeFi systems and decentralized apps (dApps), interoperability is essential. It lets programmers create multi-chain apps that take advantage of different blockchains’ advantages. For instance, a DeFi system might take advantage of Solana for fast operations, Ethereum for smart contracts, and Binance Smart Chain for inexpensive transactions. In addition to boosting productivity, this tendency promotes cooperation among blockchain developers, which spurs innovation. Green crypto initiatives and regenerative finance (ReFi) Regenerative finance (ReFi), which uses blockchain technology to finance ecological restoration initiatives, attempts to address the crucial issue of environmental sustainability in the cryptocurrency sector. Beyond sustainability, ReFi actively repairs environmental harm by utilizing financial incentives to accomplish these objectives. Leading the way are projects that use carbon-negative methods and mining operations driven by renewable energy. These technological advances have far-reaching ramifications. ReFi not only has the potential to change how people view blockchain technology, but it also opens the door for cryptocurrency to be integrated with international environmental objectives. ReFi initiatives could be a key component of the future of cryptocurrency with public and private partnerships centered on green technologies.

Tokenization enables smooth transferability, enhanced liquidity, and fractional ownership by converting physical assets into digital tokens on a blockchain. In sectors like real estate, where tokenized properties allow smaller investors to access markets that were previously closed to them, this development is especially significant. By making new financial products possible, the tokenization process is also revolutionizing traditional finance. For instance, security tokens, which are regulated and reflect ownership in a business or asset, offer a legal means of raising money. This movement has the potential to generate enormous value in several sectors as platforms make it easier to issue and manage tokenized assets. Summing it up Blockchain technology is developing at a never-before-seen rate, with cutting-edge developments changing entire sectors and the way we use digital systems. These blockchain trends demonstrate the adaptability and promise of blockchain as a foundational technology, from the revolutionary potential of DeFi and NFTs to the significant breakthroughs in interoperability, sustainability, and enterprise adoption. The potential applications of blockchain seem endless as sectors including supply chain management, banking, healthcare, and entertainment continue to adopt it. The future of blockchain technology trends will be fueled by both smart cross-ecosystem cooperation and technology breakthroughs. To keep blockchain accessible, effective, and inclusive, developers, companies, and governments must collaborate to address issues like scalability, security, and regulatory compliance. Stakeholders can fully utilize blockchain technology to spur innovation, open up new doors, and create a more decentralized and fair digital future by remaining educated and following these trends and maybe coming up with future trends in blockchain technology that outpace the current ones as well.
