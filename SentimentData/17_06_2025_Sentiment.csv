Ben Zhou, the exchange’s CEO, shared details about the project on his X account. Byreal is the name of this new decentralized exchange (DEX) that will start to operate by the end of the month. Announcing Byreal — our first onchain DEX incubated by Bybit, will be LIVE by end of the month. Starting from scratch and now born on Solana. what's special: 1/ CEX + DEX synergy Byreal isn’t “just another DEX.” It’s combining CEX-grade liquidity with DeFi-native transparency.… https://t.co/JU60e4zHQ4 — Ben Zhou (@benbybit) June 15, 2025 Zhou emphasized that Byreal combines “CEX-grade liquidity with DeFi-native transparency.” It will offer low slippage and prevent miners’ manipulation through MEV protection. Byreal will directly compete with leading decentralized solutions within the Solana ecosystem like Raydium, Orca, and PumpSwap. The token’s significant uptick in the past day indicates how excited market participants are for the news as it could attract significant transaction volumes to this blockchain. The news favors a bullish Solana price prediction. Solana Price Prediction: SOL Eyes Retest of $185 After Support Bounce Solana DEX volumes in the past 24 hours stood at $1.8 billion while they rose by 10.2% in the past 30 days to $77.43 billion according to data from DeFi Llama . The above-mentioned three DEXs account for more than three-quarters of that total with Raydium leading the pack with a 29% market share. Looking at the daily chart, Solana (SOL) has bounced for a third time off the $140 level in the daily chart to solidify the importance of this key threshold. Meanwhile, trading volumes in the past 24 hours have nearly doubled. The price has hit a key resistance at $155. This level acted as a ceiling for the price action previously. If SOL breaks out above this threshold and retests it from above it will confirm a clear runway to $185. Momentum indicators favor a bullish outlook as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has jumped above the 14-day moving average. As the Solana network prepares to receive higher transaction volumes from Byreal, the need for a scaling solution like Solaxy (SOLX) is more evident than ever. This is one of the hottest crypto presales of the year and it is about to end. Solaxy (SOLX) Enters Last 2 Days of Its Presale with $52M Raised Solana has struggled to keep up with rising transaction volumes during peak usage periods like January this year when TRUMP and MELANIA were launched. Solaxy (SOLX) is a layer-2 scaling protocol for the Solana blockchain that bundles transactions offline in a side chain to alleviate the mainnet’s burden. The developing team has already launched the Solaxy testnet and will launch the mainnet this month. A block explorer is available so investors can check the solution’s performance in real time before its official rollout. With just 2 more days ahead before the end of its successful presale, this is the last opportunity that investors will have to grab $SOLX at its heavily discounted presale price of $0.001764. This token will see a spike in its demand once the solution is embraced by top wallets and exchanges. In addition, the project offers attractive staking rewards that currently sit at 80%. To buy $SOLX, simply head to the Solaxy website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or SOL or use a bank card to invest.

Shareholders of Japan-listed company Beat Holdings are making waves with an ambitious push: they’re urging the company to raise a substantial ¥799 billion (approximately $5.6 billion) specifically for a significant Bitcoin acquisition . This bold move, reported by The Bitcoin Historian on X, signals a growing appetite among traditional companies, even in Japan’s sometimes cautious market, to embrace digital assets. Why Are Beat Holdings Shareholders Eyeing a Major Bitcoin Acquisition? The primary driver behind this intriguing shareholder proposal is a desire for Beat Holdings to compete directly with the increasingly prominent Metaplanet strategy . Metaplanet, another Japan-based firm, has garnered significant attention recently for adopting a treasury strategy heavily focused on accumulating Bitcoin. This approach mirrors that of pioneers like MicroStrategy in the U.S. Metaplanet’s stock price has seen notable movements tied to its Bitcoin buys, catching the eye of investors and potentially inspiring others in the Japan crypto market . Shareholders advocating for this massive fund believe that a strategic investment in Bitcoin could: Provide a hedge against currency devaluation (like the Yen). Offer significant potential for capital appreciation in the long term. Enhance the company’s balance sheet strength. Attract a new class of investors interested in crypto-exposed equities. Position Beat Holdings as a forward-thinking leader in the digital asset space within Japan. The proposed ¥799 billion fund is earmarked to acquire up to 50,000 Bitcoin. To put that into perspective, 50,000 BTC represents a substantial holding, potentially placing Beat Holdings among the ranks of major corporate Bitcoin holders globally, though still behind giants like MicroStrategy. Understanding the Metaplanet Strategy and Its Influence Metaplanet’s decision to pivot towards a Bitcoin-centric treasury reserve asset strategy has been a significant story in the Japan crypto market . Instead of holding traditional cash reserves that are subject to inflationary pressures, Metaplanet has opted to convert portions of its treasury into Bitcoin. This strategy is predicated on the belief that Bitcoin, with its fixed supply and decentralized nature, serves as a superior store of value in the long run compared to fiat currencies. Key aspects of the Metaplanet strategy include: Treasury Transformation: Shifting from Yen-denominated cash reserves to Bitcoin. Capital Raises: Utilizing various financing methods (like debt or equity raises) specifically to fund Bitcoin purchases. Investor Communication: Being transparent about their Bitcoin holdings and strategy to attract like-minded investors. This approach has not been without its risks, as the price of Bitcoin is volatile. However, for companies like Metaplanet and potentially Beat Holdings, the perceived long-term benefits outweigh the short-term price fluctuations. The success and visibility of Metaplanet’s strategy have clearly served as a catalyst for this bold shareholder proposal at Beat Holdings. What Are the Benefits and Challenges of Such a Large Bitcoin Acquisition? Embarking on a large-scale Bitcoin acquisition presents both compelling opportunities and significant hurdles for a company like Beat Holdings . Potential Benefits: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s limited supply makes it attractive as a hedge against the potential devaluation of fiat currencies. Growth Potential: Historically, Bitcoin has shown significant price appreciation over multi-year periods, offering potential returns far exceeding traditional assets. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin to the balance sheet can help diversify corporate reserves. Attracting Investment: A clear Bitcoin strategy can appeal to a growing segment of investors interested in digital assets. Potential Challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile, which could lead to significant fluctuations in the company’s reported asset values and potentially impact earnings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, particularly for corporate holdings, is still evolving globally and within Japan. Custody and Security Risks: Safely storing and managing a large amount of Bitcoin requires specialized expertise and robust security measures to prevent loss or theft. Accounting Treatment: Accounting rules for holding cryptocurrencies can be complex and may require mark-to-market adjustments that impact financial statements. Shareholder & Board Alignment: Not all shareholders or board members may agree with such a high-risk, non-core investment strategy. The proposal itself highlights that this is being pushed by *some* shareholders. The success of this shareholder proposal will depend heavily on Beat Holdings’ ability to navigate these challenges while capitalizing on the potential benefits. Comparing Strategies: Beat Holdings’ Proposal vs. Metaplanet’s Holdings While both companies are based in Japan and are looking towards Bitcoin, the proposed scale of Beat Holdings’ potential acquisition is noteworthy when compared to Metaplanet’s current known holdings (as of recent reports). Let’s look at a simplified comparison: Company Proposed/Known Bitcoin Holdings (Approx.) Funding Strategy (Proposed/Used) Beat Holdings (Proposed) Up to 50,000 BTC Raising ¥799B fund Metaplanet (Known) Significantly less than 50,000 BTC (specific number fluctuates with buys) Equity/Debt Financing, Treasury Cash Note: Metaplanet’s exact holdings change as they make further purchases. This table is illustrative based on public reports regarding their strategy. The scale of the proposed Bitcoin acquisition by Beat Holdings is ambitious and, if successful, would represent one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holdings outside of MicroStrategy. This underscores the potential impact such a move could have on both the company’s future and the broader perception of corporate crypto adoption in Japan. What’s Next for Beat Holdings and the Shareholder Proposal? A shareholder proposal is just the first step in a potentially long process. For this proposal to move forward, it would typically need to gain traction among a significant portion of shareholders and ultimately receive approval from the company’s board of directors. The board will need to carefully evaluate the risks and rewards, consider the feasibility of raising such a large sum, and assess the potential impact on the company’s core business and overall financial health. Key factors that will influence the outcome include: The level of support among major shareholders. The board’s risk tolerance and view on digital assets. The company’s ability to successfully raise the necessary ¥799 billion fund. The prevailing market conditions for Bitcoin and the broader economy. Regulatory developments in the Japan crypto market . The outcome of this proposal could set a precedent for other Japanese companies considering similar treasury strategies. It’s a story worth following closely for anyone interested in corporate finance, the evolution of treasury management, and the continued integration of Bitcoin into the traditional financial system. Actionable Insights for Investors and Observers For those watching this space, the situation with Beat Holdings and the proposed Bitcoin acquisition offers several points to consider: Monitor Shareholder Activism: Pay attention to shareholder proposals related to crypto adoption in publicly traded companies. This indicates growing investor interest. Track Corporate Treasury Strategies: Observe how companies like Metaplanet and potentially Beat Holdings implement and manage their Bitcoin holdings. This provides real-world examples of corporate crypto adoption. Evaluate Company Fundamentals: When considering investments in companies adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies, look beyond the crypto holdings and assess the strength of their core business. Understand Market Context: Developments in the Japan crypto market and regulatory environment can significantly impact companies operating there. This development underscores that the trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption is not limited to Western markets and is gaining momentum in Asia, driven by factors like inflation concerns and the desire to emulate successful strategies like the Metaplanet strategy . A Bold Vision for Beat Holdings’ Future? The proposal for Beat Holdings to raise ¥799 billion for a massive Bitcoin acquisition is undoubtedly bold. It reflects a significant shift in how some investors view corporate treasury management and the potential role of digital assets. While the outcome remains uncertain, the very existence of such a high-profile shareholder proposal highlights the increasing legitimacy and appeal of Bitcoin as a reserve asset, even in traditional financial circles within the Japan crypto market . It’s a fascinating development that could pave the way for more Japanese companies to explore similar strategies, further bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset world.

The Cardano Foundation reported that a total of 2,004 decentralized applications are developing and expanding their projects within this blockchain as of June 13, 2025. Meanwhile, the number of native assets minted on the Cardano blockchain currently sits at 10.83 million while transaction volumes rose by 0.2% compared to the previous week to stand at 110.40 million. The number of smart contracts – known as Plutus and Aiken scripts – will soon surpass the 140,000 mark. These figures point to Cardano’s robust and continually-expanding ecosystem. Although the network has been criticized in the past for missing out on some top trends in the crypto space like DeFi and meme coins, there are still developers who are betting on the future of this blockchain as the preferred alternative to deploy real-world applications. Minswap is currently the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) in the Cardano network with 30-day trading volumes of $79 million. Meanwhile, Liqwid is the largest decentralized application. It specializes in lending and currently has a total value locked (TVL) of $80.9 million. The combined TVL of Cardano dApps currently sits at $285 million as per data from DeFi Llama. This is a tiny fraction of Solana’s $8.8 billion TVL and just a breadcrumb of Ethereum’s massive $62.9 billion ecosystem. However, the founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson, has always emphasized that his network’s ambitions are centered on powering real-world applications rather than just DeFi apps. Ecosystem growth is robust according to these latest figures and that favors a bullish Cardano price prediction. Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Could Rise to $1 If This Happens Cardano (ADA) recovered during the week after a 4-day losing streak. The $0.600 level seems to have acted as strong support for the price action and could trigger a move toward the $0.7500 resistance in the near term. The price is currently sitting below its short-term and long-term moving averages and these are currently the key resistances to watch for ADA. A breakout above these markers would favor a bullish Cardano price prediction. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) seems poised to send a buy signal if it rises above the 14-day moving average. If the price rises above $0.730 and retests that level from above, this would confirm a bullish outlook that could push ADA to $1. This means an upside potential of 37% for the token. Apart from Cardano, the Bitcoin blockchain is has significant untapped potential for the development of DeFi applications. A new crypto presale called Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) aims to launch a layer-2 scaling solution that will make it possible for these dApps to thrive and unlock trillions of dollars in liquidity that would flow to Bitcoin native protocols. Bitcoin Hype (HYPER) Raises More than $1M in Less Than 15 Days Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) aims to makes the top crypto’s blockchain a suitable home for meme coins, payment platforms, DeFi applications and more. The developing team aims to achieve this through the launch of a robust side chain powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). The solution will act as a bridge between the two blockchains to facilitate cheap and fast asset transfers of BTC tokens. The demand for HYPER, the native asset of this L2, will skyrocket once the protocol is launched and becomes adopted by top wallets and exchanges. To buy $HYPER at its discounted presale price, head to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or BTC for this token or use a bank card to invest.

ADA’s XRP Yields, Bitcoin’s Gold Faceoff, and Qubetics’ 28K Holders",https://thecoinrise.com/top-crypto-coins-to-buy-now-adas-xrp-yields-bitcoins-gold-faceoff-and-qubetics-28k-holders/,"As crypto markets push deeper into 2025, the debate between innovation and resilience has entered a new chapter. Three coins stand at the crossroads of this dynamic moment: Qubetics , Bitcoin, and Cardano. Each represents a different facet of blockchain evolution, from radical privacy tools to resilient network fundamentals and adaptive scalability. Qubetics features a decentralized VPN (dVPN), redefining how Web3 users access and protect digital content. With major updates and a fast-closing crypto presale, it’s attracting both privacy advocates and serious crypto backers. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s standing as a digital asset is being reassessed amid geopolitical uncertainty, as investors increasingly weigh its position against traditional safe havens like gold. And Cardano is leveraging its layered architecture to pivot toward real-world use cases amid scalability debates. With macroeconomic pressures, shifting regulations, and new decentralized solutions emerging, knowing the top crypto coins to buy now is about timing, technology, and tenacity. Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN: Reclaiming the Internet From Central Control The decentralized VPN built into Qubetics is the centrepiece of a broader vision to reclaim internet sovereignty. Traditional VPNs often store logs, can be compelled to turn over data, or suffer from central points of failure. Qubetics changes the equation by distributing trust. Its dVPN operates on a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer blockchain network. There is no singular authority, no centralized control, and no way for governments or corporations to censor or throttle the system. Using multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption, it masks both user identity and routing metadata. Every connection remains anonymous, with a trustless architecture ensuring verifiable privacy. The dVPN also features tokenized incentives. Users can share unused bandwidth in exchange for $TICS tokens, turning idle resources into rewards. This economic layer strengthens participation and builds out a sustainable node ecosystem. By tying its dVPN into broader decentralized applications, Qubetics reinforces the foundation for DeFi protocols, decentralized storage, and dApps that demand censorship-resistant access. As more of the internet migrates toward tokenized systems, tools like the dVPN become foundational infrastructure amid the top crypto coins to buy now. Qubetics Presale Update: A Rising Opportunity Qubetics has entered its final crypto presale phase, Stage 37, offering $TICS tokens at a fixed rate of $0.3370 with just under 10 million tokens left. Over $18 million has already been raised, and more than 515 million tokens have been sold to more than 28,000 buyers. By cutting the total supply from 4 billion to 1.36 billion, Qubetics has engineered immediate scarcity. And by increasing its public sale allocation to 38.55%, it is handing more control to its users. With fewer tokens and a fairer distribution, Qubetics now stands out among the top crypto coins to buy now, especially for adopters prioritizing transparency, utility, and long-term potential. Growth Scenarios: What $6,000 in Qubetics Could Become Qubetics is on the brink of listing, with analysts forecasting an initial token price of $0.40. If a $6,000 investment is made at the current presale price of $0.3370, it secures approximately 17,802 $TICS tokens. Upon listing at $0.40, the value would rise to $7,120—an instant 18.6% gain. If the token hits $1, that same investment is worth $17,802. At $5, it balloons to $89,010. Should Qubetics reach $10 following its mainnet launch, the investment jumps to $178,020. If the $TICS token touches $15, the final value would be a staggering $267,030. With the dVPN as a key use case, reduced total supply, and momentum from its community-driven distribution, Qubetics could very well surpass expectations. Analysts are watching this project not for speculative buzz but for its grounded fundamentals, placing it firmly among the top crypto coins to buy now. Bitcoin: Is the Digital Gold Narrative Slipping? As geopolitical instability surges, traditional safe-haven assets like gold have soared. Gold recently touched $3,450 per ounce, just shy of its all-time high. Bitcoin, often dubbed “digital gold,” hasn’t kept pace. BTC currently trades 5.3% below its May 22 high of $111,800. While that may suggest resilience, some analysts argue that Bitcoin’s safe-haven appeal is weakening. Instead, it behaves more like a risk asset, echoing moves in US equity markets. Analysts explain that Bitcoin continues to mirror tech-heavy indices. As equity futures rebound, Bitcoin could play catch-up. Holding above its $95,000–$100,000 support zone is crucial. If this support holds, retesting $112,000 becomes feasible, with upside potential toward $116,000 and $120,000. However, caution remains. Bitcoin’s volatility and correlation with liquidity cycles make it vulnerable. Its narrative as a hedge against inflation or war-driven instability is under review. As such, Bitcoin holds its place among the top crypto coins to buy now, not as a hedge, but as a high-risk, high-reward macro play. Cardano’s Midnight: XRP DeFi Yield Revolution Cardano founder Hoskinson proposes using Midnight, a privacy‑centric sidechain, to unlock DeFi yields for XRP holders. Midnight leverages Cardano’s extended UTXO model to enable private smart contracts off the base chain. In 2024, Midnight launched a testnet ahead of a mainnet release later this year. Now, XRP holders may bridge assets into Midnight to earn “much better yields” through liquidity provision and farming. Airdrops under the “Glacier Drop” plan will distribute NIGHT and DUST tokens to 37 million wallets, including XRPL addresses. This aligns with Cardano’s broader vision of cross‑chain modular DeFi and positions it as a leading protocol among the top crypto coins to buy now. Midnight uses privacy-enabled smart contracts without altering Cardano’s base layer. Developers will code in the extended UTXO framework, enabling modular execution, transaction privacy, and side‑chain isolation. Bridging tools will facilitate XRP transfers from XRPL into the Midnight environment. Once bridged, assets can access yield‑based protocols similar to staking, lending, or AMM pools. By retaining privacy while enabling composability, Midnight pioneers a new DeFi paradigm blending secrecy, utility, and interoperability, boosting Cardano into the top crypto coins to buy now narrative. Final Words: Timing the Shift, Not Just the Price—Top Crypto Coins to Buy Now Crypto investment in 2025 is less about wild speculation and more about positioning. Qubetics is rewriting the rules of internet privacy through its dVPN. Bitcoin remains a liquidity-driven instrument with macro potential. Cardano continues to gain traction in key institutional sectors by proposing advanced DeFi tech. Understanding the strengths and trade-offs of each coin is essential. The top crypto coins to buy now are no longer defined by hype alone—they are grounded in architecture, traction, and long-term vision.

It operates on a peer-to-peer blockchain network, eliminating central control and increasing privacy through encryption and decentralization. Is Qubetics’ crypto presale still active? Yes, it’s in its final phase with less than 10 million tokens remaining at a fixed price of $0.3370. Why hasn’t Bitcoin followed gold in recent rallies? Bitcoin currently behaves more like a risk asset than a safe haven, making it sensitive to equities and macro liquidity trends. Is Cardano still a good investment in 2025? Its layered architecture, regulatory alignment, and real-world use cases make it a strong long-term bet. What’s the projected return for $6,000 invested in Qubetics now? If the token hits $15 after launch, the return could be around $267,030. The post Top Crypto Coins to Buy Now?

46167873,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=169469,1750116009,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/46167873.jpeg,Revolutionary Step: France Eyes Nuclear Energy Surplus for Sustainable Bitcoin Mining,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/france-nuclear-bitcoin-mining/,"BitcoinWorld Revolutionary Step: France Eyes Nuclear Energy Surplus for Sustainable Bitcoin Mining Imagine a world where the energy powering the future of finance also helps balance national power grids and utilizes clean energy sources. This isn’t science fiction; it’s potentially the future being shaped in France. Recent developments suggest that French lawmakers are seriously considering a groundbreaking proposal to integrate Bitcoin mining operations into the nation’s existing energy infrastructure, specifically by leveraging the significant surplus generated by its extensive Nuclear energy France network. This bold initiative, initially brought to light via reports from sources like @solidintel_x on X, represents a potentially significant shift in how countries view both cryptocurrency mining and national energy management. By tapping into power that might otherwise go unused or be sold at lower rates, France could position itself as a leader in Sustainable crypto mining , addressing common environmental concerns associated with the industry while simultaneously bolstering its own French energy strategy . What’s Driving This Potential Integration of Bitcoin Mining? At its core, this proposal is driven by a confluence of factors related to energy economics and the evolving landscape of digital finance. France boasts one of the world’s most robust nuclear power programs, providing a large percentage of its electricity. While incredibly reliable, nuclear plants are designed to run continuously at or near full capacity. This can sometimes lead to periods of Energy surplus , particularly during times of low demand or high renewable energy production. Managing this surplus effectively is a constant challenge for grid operators. Simultaneously, Bitcoin mining has emerged as a significant energy consumer globally. The process, which involves powerful computers competing to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and secure the network, requires substantial electricity. This energy demand has often drawn criticism regarding its environmental footprint, especially when powered by fossil fuels. The French proposal sees an opportunity in this dynamic: pair the energy-hungry process of Bitcoin mining with the periods of excess clean energy production from nuclear plants. This could provide a consistent, reliable, and potentially low-cost power source for miners, while also offering the grid a valuable, interruptible load that can consume surplus power when needed, helping to stabilize the network. How Does Nuclear Energy France Fit into the Picture? France’s reliance on nuclear power is a defining feature of its energy profile. Unlike many nations, France made a strategic decision decades ago to invest heavily in nuclear technology to achieve energy independence and reduce carbon emissions. Today, nuclear reactors account for roughly 70% of the country’s electricity generation, making France a global leader in nuclear energy utilization. This extensive infrastructure, while providing clean and stable baseload power, also presents unique challenges in grid management. Nuclear plants are not easily ramped up or down in response to fluctuating demand or variable renewable energy input (like solar or wind). This inflexibility means that during periods of low demand, particularly overnight or on weekends, the grid can experience an Energy surplus . Finding ways to efficiently use or store this surplus energy is crucial for grid stability and economic efficiency. Traditionally, managing surplus involves exporting power, storing it (though large-scale, cost-effective storage is still developing), or in some cases, curtailing production (which is inefficient for nuclear). The idea of directing this surplus to energy-intensive operations like Bitcoin mining offers a novel solution that could be mutually beneficial. Exploring the Potential Benefits of This French Energy Strategy Integrating Bitcoin mining with France’s nuclear surplus could unlock several significant advantages, aligning economic, environmental, and strategic goals: Economic Opportunities: Utilizing surplus energy provides a revenue stream for energy producers that might otherwise be lost. It can also attract Bitcoin mining operations to France, creating jobs (though perhaps not as many as traditional industries, given the automated nature) and potentially generating tax revenue. For miners, access to reliable, potentially cheaper, clean energy is a major operational advantage. Grid Stability and Efficiency: Energy-intensive loads like Bitcoin mining can act as ‘flexible demand.’ When there’s an Energy surplus , miners can increase operations, consuming the excess power. When demand from other sectors is high, mining operations can be curtailed or powered down, freeing up capacity. This interruptible load helps balance the grid, reducing the need for costly curtailment or reliance on less flexible power sources. Promoting Sustainable Crypto Mining: This is perhaps the most compelling benefit from a global perspective. By powering mining with clean, low-carbon nuclear energy, France would significantly contribute to reducing the overall carbon footprint associated with Bitcoin mining . This addresses a major criticism leveled against the industry and promotes a model for Sustainable crypto mining that other nations with significant clean energy sources could potentially emulate. Strategic Integration into French Energy Strategy: Officially incorporating Bitcoin mining into the national energy plan acknowledges its growing importance as an industry and provides a framework for managing its energy needs in a controlled and beneficial manner. It signals France’s willingness to engage with emerging technologies and potentially become a hub for clean crypto operations. Reducing Reliance on Fossil Fuels: By providing a clean power source for mining, this initiative indirectly reduces the pressure on fossil fuel-based electricity generation that might otherwise be used for mining elsewhere. What Challenges Might France Face? While the potential benefits are substantial, implementing such a strategy is not without its hurdles. French lawmakers and energy operators would need to carefully navigate several challenges: Regulatory Framework: Establishing clear regulations for how Bitcoin mining operations can connect to the grid and utilize surplus power is essential. This includes defining tariffs, connection requirements, and protocols for curtailment during peak demand. Infrastructure Requirements: While France has ample generation, ensuring sufficient transmission and distribution capacity to transport surplus power to potential mining sites is necessary. Mining facilities also require specific infrastructure, including cooling systems and secure locations. Public Perception: Despite using clean energy, the energy consumption of Bitcoin mining remains a topic of public debate. Educating the public about the ‘surplus utilization’ aspect and the benefits for grid stability will be crucial to garnering support. Market Dynamics: The profitability of Bitcoin mining is highly dependent on the price of Bitcoin and the cost of electricity. While surplus energy might be cheaper, ensuring long-term viability for miners requires stable energy pricing and a favorable regulatory environment. Technical Integration: Seamlessly integrating energy-intensive, interruptible loads like mining farms into the existing grid management system requires sophisticated technical solutions and coordination between grid operators and mining companies. Addressing these challenges effectively will require careful planning, collaboration between the energy sector and the crypto industry, and potentially new policy innovations as part of the broader French energy strategy . Examples and Global Context: Is France Alone in This Thinking? France’s proposal, while potentially revolutionary in its scale due to the nation’s nuclear capacity, is part of a broader global trend exploring how energy-intensive computing, including Bitcoin mining , can be integrated with energy production, particularly surplus or otherwise wasted energy. For instance: Utilizing Flare Gas: In regions with significant oil and gas production (like parts of the US, Canada, and Africa), miners are setting up operations to use natural gas that would otherwise be flared (burned off). This turns waste energy into productive output and reduces methane emissions compared to flaring. Geothermal Energy: Countries with abundant geothermal resources, like Iceland and El Salvador, are using this clean, renewable energy source to power mining operations. Hydroelectric Power: Regions with significant hydroelectric capacity, such as parts of China (though regulations have changed), Canada, and Scandinavia, have historically attracted miners due to low energy costs, though this also presents challenges during dry seasons or peak demand. Capturing Waste Heat: Some innovative projects are exploring using the significant heat generated by mining operations for other purposes, such as heating buildings or greenhouses, further improving energy efficiency. The French approach, focusing on nuclear surplus, adds a powerful new dimension to this global conversation. It highlights the potential for established, large-scale clean energy infrastructure to play a role in the future of digital assets, moving the narrative around Bitcoin mining towards one of efficiency and Sustainable crypto mining . What Does This Mean for the Future of Bitcoin Mining and Energy? If the French proposal moves forward successfully, it could serve as a significant case study for other nations with substantial nuclear or large-scale renewable energy infrastructure that experience periods of Energy surplus . It could: Shift the geographical landscape of Bitcoin mining , attracting operations to regions with favorable clean energy policies. Accelerate the adoption of Sustainable crypto mining practices globally, pushing the industry towards cleaner energy sources. Influence future energy policy, demonstrating how energy-intensive computing can be managed as a flexible, beneficial load on the grid. Potentially stabilize energy markets by providing a consistent consumer for surplus power. This development underscores the dynamic relationship between technology and infrastructure. As the crypto industry matures, its integration with traditional sectors like energy becomes increasingly important. France’s potential move is a bold step in this direction, seeking to harmonize the energy demands of the digital age with the realities and opportunities of existing national energy resources as part of a forward-looking French energy strategy . Actionable Insights for the Reader For those following the intersection of crypto and energy, this French proposal offers several key takeaways: Monitor Policy Developments: Keep a close eye on legislative progress in France regarding this amendment and related energy policies. Policy is a major driver for where Sustainable crypto mining can thrive. Understand Energy Sources: When evaluating mining operations or investments, pay attention to their energy mix. Initiatives like France’s highlight the growing importance of clean and efficient energy sourcing for long-term viability and public acceptance. Recognize Grid Dynamics: The concept of using interruptible loads like mining to manage Energy surplus is a critical aspect of modern grid management. Understanding this can provide insight into future energy infrastructure developments. Consider the Global Context: France is not in isolation. Look for similar initiatives or discussions in other countries with significant clean energy production (hydro, nuclear, large-scale solar/wind). Engage in the Conversation: As these proposals develop, participate in informed discussions about the role of crypto mining in energy transitions and the potential for Sustainable crypto mining models. These insights are crucial for investors, policymakers, energy professionals, and crypto enthusiasts alike, offering a glimpse into how national strategies are adapting to technological change. In Conclusion: A Strategic Alignment for a Greener Future? The proposal by French lawmakers to explore using surplus Nuclear energy France for Bitcoin mining represents a potentially pivotal moment. It’s a strategic move that seeks to align the energy demands of a burgeoning digital industry with the practical realities of managing a large, clean energy infrastructure. By potentially turning an Energy surplus challenge into an opportunity to foster Sustainable crypto mining , France could set a precedent for how nations can integrate energy-intensive technologies into their national French energy strategy in an environmentally responsible and economically beneficial way. While challenges remain, the core idea is compelling: leveraging existing clean energy assets to power the future of finance. This initiative highlights the innovative thinking required to bridge traditional infrastructure with cutting-edge technology, potentially paving the way for a greener, more stable energy future alongside the growth of the crypto economy.

The MP has filed his bill in the Chamber of Deputies, the Portuguese-language media outlet Livecoins reported. Brazilian Crypto Tax: Could Levies Be Scrapped? The bill calls for the removal of the clauses in the tax code that explicitly mention the taxation of cryptoassets. The Brazilian lawmaker Eros Biondini calling for support for his bill on social media. The caption reads: “Fight against the taxation of cryptoassets in Brazil.” (Source: @erosbiondini/Instagram) It also calls for the abolition of a 2023 law that spells out the means of collecting income tax from profits derived from cryptoassets. The bill will first be assessed by a Chamber of Deputies committee. The committee will decide whether or not to pass the bill on to the lower house. From there, it could then move on to the Senate and the office of the President. Both the Senate and the President would have the power to veto the bill. Biondini also claims that new taxes on financial transactions, including foreign exchange and insurance transfers, are ill-timed. He claimed that imposing a new tax burden on the population at “a time of economic fragility” would have negative consequences. The lawmaker noted that the Brazilian tax “burden” reached 32.32% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in FY2024. This is the tax-to-GDP ratio’s highest rate in the last 15 years, per Treasury data. Biondini criticized the government’s crypto policy. He complained that Brazil, “instead of leading” the world in crypto adoption, is now “going against the grain.” He said existing and future crypto tax laws “penalize people who are looking for a legitimate, safe, and sovereign store of value.” Formal Recognition for BTC Savers The crypto-adovocating lawmaker has previously authored a bill that seeks to formally recognize Bitcoin as a strategic store of value in Brazil. This proposal seeks to create tax exemption for BTC buyers and holders. It also seeks to spell out citizens’ rights to become self-custodians of their coins, without having to rely on crypto wallet operators. Méliuz has become the first Bitcoin treasury company in Brazil after shareholders approved the acquisition of $28.4 million Bitcoin. #Méliuz #BitcoinTreasury #BitcoinStrategy https://t.co/v1zZ77GH3h — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 16, 2025 Biondini took to social media last week in an attempt to unite the Brazilian crypto community behind his bill. He suggested that if the topic were to go viral, the lower house would be pressured to reject efforts to boost crypto tax revenues in Brazil. Biondini also called on fellow parliamentarians to back his bill. He explained that it had been designed to defend taxpayers, industry players, and Brazil’s “economic sovereignty.” In November last year, Biondini unveiled a bill proposing the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve . The plan called for the government to convert up to 5% of Brazil’s $372 billion international reserve fund to Bitcoin.

Polyhedra Network ( ZKJ ) token was trading at $0.374, up 47% from its lowest point this week. This jump brought its market capitalization to $101 million, down from last week’s high of $620 million. In an X post, Polyhedra attributed the crash to a series of abnormal on-chain transactions within a short period on the ZKJ/KOGE trading pair.

Data shows that three wallets drained about $7 million in liquidity. In a note to crypto.news, a Bitunix analyst said in a note: “On-chain analysis revealed that three major wallets executed a coordinated ‘liquidity pull + targeted dump,’ first crashing KOGE, then triggering ZKJ’s collapse — a classic bull trap. Warning signs emerged beforehand: LP withdrawals, plunging APYs, and reduced wash trading.” ZKJ token price also crashed as investors braced for an upcoming token unlock. Tokens worth over $10 million will be unlocked on June 19, with the funds allocated to ecosystem and network incentives, foundation reserves, community, and token purchasers.

However, there is a risk that the rebound is a bull trap or a dead-cat bounce, a situation where an asset in freefall bounces temporarily before resuming its downtrend. A good example of this is Mantra ( OM ), whose token plunged by over 90% on a Sunday a few months ago. At the time, the developers blamed the crash on exchange-driven liquidations and insisted that the underlying technology remained strong, triggering a 500% surge shortly after its drop . However, the surge proved to be a dead-cat bounce, and the token eventually resumed its downtrend. ZKJ may follow a similar path as the bull trap fades and existing holders exit their positions. In the note, the Bitunix analyst added: “Confidence in ZKJ has collapsed — without clear capital inflows, a rebound is unlikely. Cease wash trading or arbitrage strategies, and stay alert to tokens with high FDV, suspiciously stable prices, or abnormal rankings.” ZKJ crypto technical analysis ZKJ crypto chart | Source: TradingView Technicals suggest that the ZKJ price may form either a rectangle or a triangle pattern as it consolidates, potentially a bearish flag or pennant.

A prime example currently unfolding involves the intricate dance between the United States and Iran concerning a potential revival of the nuclear deal. While seemingly distant from Bitcoin or Ethereum, shifts in this complex geopolitical situation, particularly regarding energy markets and overall risk sentiment, are worth paying attention to. What Are the Odds of a US-Iran Nuclear Deal Right Now? One fascinating way to gauge the market’s collective sentiment on such complex events is through prediction markets. According to data highlighted by Walter Bloomberg on X, the prediction market platform Kalshi currently places the odds of a US-Iran nuclear deal being reached at around 44%. This figure isn’t just a random guess; it reflects the aggregated bets and predictions of participants on the platform, offering a unique, real-time insight into perceived probabilities based on available information and analysis. Prediction markets like Kalshi allow users to bet on the outcome of future events, ranging from political elections to economic indicators and, yes, even international diplomacy. The price of a contract predicting a specific outcome reflects the market’s perceived probability of that event occurring. A 44% chance suggests that while a deal is far from guaranteed, the market sees a significant possibility of progress compared to times when talks seemed completely stalled. Why Are These Odds Shifting? De-escalation Signals Emerge The movement in the Kalshi odds isn’t happening in a vacuum. Recent reports indicate potential de-escalation signals from Iran. Specifically, Iran has reportedly signaled a willingness to resume talks regarding the nuclear agreement, albeit with a significant condition: the U.S. must avoid involvement in the recent protests within Iran. This condition adds another layer of complexity to already delicate negotiations, highlighting the intertwined nature of domestic politics and international diplomacy. Facilitating these sensitive discussions are Arab intermediaries. Diplomacy often thrives behind closed doors, and the involvement of neutral third parties is crucial in bridging communication gaps and finding common ground between nations with deep-seated mistrust. These intermediaries are reportedly working to pave the way for renewed dialogue, which contributes to the perceived increase in the likelihood of talks resuming, as reflected in the US-Iran nuclear deal odds on Kalshi. How Does This Impact Global Markets, Especially Oil Prices ? One of the most immediate and tangible impacts of shifts in the US-Iran nuclear deal prospects is felt in the energy markets, particularly concerning oil prices . Iran is a major oil producer, and sanctions related to its nuclear program have significantly curtailed its ability to export oil globally. A revived nuclear deal would likely lead to the easing or lifting of some of these sanctions, potentially allowing more Iranian oil to enter the international market. When the possibility of more supply hitting the market increases, it typically puts downward pressure on prices, assuming demand remains constant. This is precisely what has been observed recently; oil prices have reportedly fallen as supply concerns eased following the signals of potential de-escalation and resumed talks. For consumers and economies reliant on stable energy prices, this potential increase in supply is a positive sign, helping to mitigate inflationary pressures linked to high energy costs. Here’s a simplified look at the potential chain reaction: Signal of Talks → Increased probability of sanctions easing Sanctions Easing → Potential for more Iranian oil exports More Supply → Easing of global supply concerns Eased Supply Concerns → Downward pressure on oil prices However, it’s crucial to remember that this is a dynamic situation. Other factors, such as global demand, production decisions by OPEC+, and ongoing geopolitical tensions elsewhere, also heavily influence oil prices. Understanding Geopolitical Risk and its Wider Implications The situation between the U.S. and Iran is a prime example of geopolitical risk – the risk that political decisions, events, or instability in one region can significantly impact global markets and economic activity. Geopolitical risk is a constant factor investors must consider, and it can manifest in various ways: Supply Chain Disruptions: Conflicts or sanctions can interrupt the flow of goods. Commodity Price Volatility: Events in key producing regions (like the Middle East for oil) directly affect prices. Investment Uncertainty: Increased risk can lead investors to pull back from certain markets or assets. Inflationary Pressures: Rising energy or food prices due to geopolitical events can fuel inflation. The ongoing tensions, even amidst de-escalation signals, are underscored by the fact that Israel continues to conduct airstrikes. This highlights the volatile nature of the region and the multifaceted security concerns that complicate any diplomatic progress. Such continued military action serves as a reminder that the path to a stable agreement is fraught with challenges and setbacks, keeping geopolitical risk elevated. Connecting the Dots: How Does This Affect the Cryptocurrency Market ? Now, let’s bring this back to the cryptocurrency market . How does a potential US-Iran nuclear deal , Kalshi odds, and fluctuating oil prices relate to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins? The connection is primarily through macroeconomic sentiment and geopolitical risk . Cryptocurrency, while often seen as a decentralized alternative, is not immune to global market forces. In times of high geopolitical tension and uncertainty, investors often move towards perceived ‘safe-haven’ assets. Historically, this has meant assets like gold or government bonds. The role of Bitcoin as a ‘digital gold’ or safe haven is still debated and tested during such periods. Here are some potential ways the US-Iran situation and related market shifts could influence crypto: Risk-On/Risk-Off Sentiment: De-escalation signals (like potential deal progress) can sometimes contribute to a broader ‘risk-on’ sentiment in global markets, where investors become more willing to invest in riskier assets, including stocks and potentially cryptocurrencies. Conversely, rising tensions or deal collapse could fuel ‘risk-off’ sentiment, potentially leading to outflows from crypto. Inflationary Expectations: As mentioned, easing oil prices can help temper inflation. If inflation concerns decrease, central banks might feel less pressure to aggressively hike interest rates. High-interest rates can make riskier assets like crypto less attractive compared to fixed-income investments. Therefore, anything that eases inflationary pressure (like lower oil) could be seen as a positive signal for crypto in the long run, though the link is indirect. Sanctions and Crypto: While not directly tied to the nuclear deal’s success, the broader context of sanctions against Iran has sometimes led to discussions about crypto’s potential use in circumventing traditional financial systems. This remains a complex and often controversial topic, but geopolitical pressures can sometimes inadvertently highlight perceived use cases for decentralized currencies, even if those uses are debated or illegal. Overall Market Volatility: Geopolitical events inject uncertainty, leading to increased volatility across financial markets. The cryptocurrency market is known for its own inherent volatility, but it can be exacerbated by external macro factors. Watching global indicators, including energy prices and geopolitical developments, provides crucial context for understanding broader market movements that can spill over into crypto. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities? The path to a revived US-Iran nuclear deal is fraught with challenges. Deep mistrust, differing interpretations of past agreements, regional security concerns (like Israel’s actions), and domestic political pressures in both the U.S. and Iran make reaching a comprehensive agreement incredibly difficult. The 44% odds on Kalshi reflect this uncertainty – it’s possible, but far from a sure thing. However, the opportunity lies in the potential for increased stability. A successful deal could lead to reduced geopolitical risk in a critical region, potentially easing pressure on energy markets and fostering a more predictable global economic environment. For the cryptocurrency market , reduced external volatility from geopolitical shocks could allow market dynamics to be driven more by internal factors like technological development, adoption rates, and regulatory clarity. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Investor So, what does this mean for you as a crypto investor? While you’re likely focused on Bitcoin charts and blockchain developments, keeping an eye on major geopolitical events and their impact on traditional markets is a wise strategy. Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources covering international relations and energy markets. Understand how events in key regions can influence global economics. Watch Oil Prices: Significant movements in oil prices can be indicators of broader shifts in supply/demand dynamics and geopolitical stability, which in turn can influence inflation expectations and overall market sentiment relevant to crypto. Understand Risk Sentiment: Pay attention to whether the general market mood is ‘risk-on’ or ‘risk-off’. Geopolitical developments are major drivers of this sentiment shift. Consider Diversification: Geopolitical shocks underscore the importance of a diversified portfolio. While crypto offers unique opportunities, understanding its correlation (or lack thereof) with traditional assets during different types of crises is key. Use Prediction Markets (with caution): Platforms like Kalshi offer interesting data points on market expectations for non-crypto events. While not direct trading signals for crypto, they provide insight into the perceived likelihood of events that *could* impact the broader market landscape. Ultimately, navigating the cryptocurrency market involves understanding not just the technology and tokenomics, but also the wider economic and political forces at play globally. The dance between the U.S. and Iran, tracked by platforms like Kalshi and impacting oil prices and geopolitical risk , is a potent reminder of this interconnectedness. Summary: Global Threads in the Crypto Tapestry The recent signals regarding the US-Iran nuclear deal , reflected in the 44% odds on Kalshi prediction market, highlight a moment of potential, albeit fragile, de-escalation. While Iran sets conditions and regional tensions persist with actions like Israeli airstrikes, the involvement of Arab intermediaries offers a glimmer of diplomatic hope. This dynamic immediately impacts markets, notably causing a dip in oil prices as supply concerns temporarily ease. For participants in the cryptocurrency market , these events serve as a crucial reminder that crypto exists within a global financial ecosystem. Shifts in geopolitical risk , energy prices, and overall market sentiment can influence crypto valuations and volatility. Staying informed about these broader macro factors, even those seemingly unrelated like a distant nuclear negotiation, provides valuable context for making informed decisions in the fast-paced world of digital assets.

According to analyst Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT), the digital asset’s breakout from a long-standing technical formation has already produced a substantial rally. But the next stage of its cycle could soon begin. XRP surged more than 500% between November 2024 and January 2025 after breaking above a 7-year pennant formation that had been developing since 2017. The pattern, highlighted in Michael’s July 2024 analysis, revealed a long-term volatility squeeze that could lead to a sharp directional move. The breakout occurred in late September , validating the prediction, with XRP soaring from around $0.55 to briefly touch the $3.39 level before settling above the $2 mark. XRP has been consolidating for 7 months since it pumped 700% after breaking out of the 7-year pennant, which I predicted. It has now reached the end of its healthy consolidation period. The next major move will begin soon and should align with Bitcoin breaking the 8-year line. https://t.co/D4dWE6powa pic.twitter.com/GSnXsghfbW — Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) June 15, 2025 Consolidation and Structural Strength In his new chart, the analyst emphasized that the asset has now undergone a “healthy consolidation” for approximately seven months, trading mostly sideways but maintaining its position above key psychological levels . “It has now reached the end of its healthy consolidation period,” he said, noting that a new major move is expected soon. The chart shows XRP respecting the upper range of its breakout and maintaining elevated price levels, which the analyst interprets as structural strength. The consolidation, while extended, has not led to any sustained retracements, indicating that selling pressure may be limited. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Context and Next Phase Importantly, Michael connects the next stage in XRP’s price development with broader market trends. He specifically mentions the potential alignment with Bitcoin’s trajectory. The asset’s perceived reputation as Bitcoin’s successor positions it to benefit from the largest cryptocurrency’s growth. XRP’s performance post-breakout has largely followed a predictable pattern of explosive upside followed by consolidation. However, what sets this phase apart is the context, both technical and historical. Breakouts from 7-year structures are rare in crypto markets, which typically experience shorter accumulation and distribution cycles. The sustained move and relative price stability over the last two quarters reflect what could be the foundation for another surge. Looking Ahead XRP is currently trading at $2.18, and whether the asset will maintain this momentum depends not only on its chart structure but also on broader crypto market behavior. If Bitcoin does break its 8-year resistance, XRP may benefit from the liquidity and sentiment shift that usually accompanies such moves.

The social media platform also suspended accounts associated with leaders of the Pump.fun platform on Monday, including the founder Alon. The suspension of the Pump.fun X account triggered mixed reactions from the crypto community. While some were disappointed with the closure, some applauded the move as it will reduce crazy speculation and give a chance to utility coins. Possible Reasons Why Pump.fun Was Suspended on X Today The official reasons why X account belonging to Pump.fun was suspended had not been released at the time of this writing. However, research suggests that Pump.fun uses unauthorized third-party X APIs or black-market X trackers to attract more users. Another possible reason for X account suspension was a potential misuse of the Live Stream feature, which has been controversial in the past year. The X accounts associated with Pump.fun were also likely suspended due to potential fraudulent activities, which include autorug. Meanwhile, a potential incoming regulatory scrutiny by the U.S. SEC could have led to the suspension of the X account belonging to Pump.fun. However, there was no official confirmation from the SEC on an investigation on Pump.fun yet. Market Impact The suspension of the pump.fun’s X account will significantly disorient its short-term market outlook.

Tensions between major regional players can send ripples through economies worldwide. Recently, a significant development suggests a potential shift in the ongoing Iran Israel dynamic, offering a glimmer of hope for reduced hostilities. Understanding the Iran Israel Dynamic For years, the relationship between Iran and Israel has been marked by significant tension and proxy conflicts across the region. This animosity stems from a complex mix of historical grievances, ideological differences, and competing strategic interests. While direct confrontation has been rare, indirect clashes and rhetoric have kept the region on edge, impacting everything from oil prices to investment sentiment in various markets, including how investors perceive regional stability. The recent exchange of direct fire marked a notable escalation, raising international alarm. However, amidst this heightened tension, signals are now emerging that suggest a potential off-ramp. Prospects for De-escalation: What Are the Signals? According to sources cited by The Wall Street Journal, Iran has reportedly expressed an interest in cooling down tensions with Israel. This interest was conveyed through Arab intermediaries, indicating a preference for diplomatic channels rather than continued confrontation. The use of intermediaries is a common tactic in complex geopolitical situations, allowing for communication without direct, formal recognition or engagement between adversaries. Furthermore, a report shared by Walter Bloomberg on X highlighted a specific condition mentioned by Iran for resuming discussions: the United States must remain uninvolved in the conflict. This condition underscores the intricate web of alliances and rivalries in the Middle East, where the role of global powers significantly influences regional dynamics. Let’s break down the key elements of these signals: Channel: Arab intermediaries are being used, suggesting a move towards indirect diplomacy. Goal: Expressed interest in de-escalating tensions. Condition: Resumption of talks contingent on U.S. non-involvement. These signals, while preliminary and requiring careful observation, represent a potential shift from the recent tit-for-tat exchanges. Why Middle East Stability Matters Globally The Middle East is a crucial geopolitical hub due to its energy resources, strategic waterways, and complex political landscape. Instability in this region has far-reaching consequences: Energy Markets: Disruptions can lead to volatile oil and gas prices, affecting global economies. Supply Chains: Key shipping lanes pass through the region, vulnerable to conflict. Refugee Flows: Conflict can trigger humanitarian crises and mass displacement. Global Security: Regional conflicts can attract external powers and fuel international terrorism. Financial Markets: Uncertainty leads to risk aversion, impacting stocks, bonds, and commodities, and yes, even the resilience of the crypto market can be tested by such external shocks. Therefore, any movement towards de-escalation is not just a regional matter but a development with global implications for geopolitics and economic stability. Geopolitics and the Crypto Market While the immediate news is about international relations, it’s important for anyone monitoring global markets, including crypto enthusiasts, to understand the broader context. Geopolitical events, particularly those involving major state actors and potential conflict, can significantly influence market sentiment. Periods of high tension often lead investors to seek safer assets, while signs of stability or de-escalation can foster a more risk-on environment. Although this specific news does not directly involve cryptocurrency, it falls under the umbrella of macro-geopolitical factors that savvy investors track. The interconnectedness of global finance means that developments in the Middle East, or any other volatile region, can indirectly affect liquidity, investor confidence, and market direction across asset classes. Challenges and Considerations Ahead While the signals for de-escalation are positive, several challenges remain: Trust Deficit: Decades of animosity have created a deep lack of trust between Iran and Israel. Conditionality: Iran’s condition regarding U.S. non-involvement is complex and may not be easily met or agreed upon by all parties. Proxy Activities: Even if direct tensions ease, activities by proxy groups supported by Iran in the region could continue to be a source of friction. Internal Politics: Both countries have internal political dynamics that can influence foreign policy decisions. Moving from signaling interest to actual talks and meaningful de-escalation is a long and challenging process requiring sustained diplomatic effort and flexibility from all sides. The role of Arab intermediaries will be crucial in navigating these complexities. Actionable Insight: Stay Informed For those interested in global markets, including the crypto space, the actionable insight here is the importance of monitoring geopolitical developments. Events like potential de-escalation in the Iran Israel conflict, shifts in Middle East dynamics, and broader geopolitics are not isolated incidents. They are part of the global tapestry that influences economic conditions and market sentiment. Staying informed allows for a more nuanced understanding of potential market volatility and risk factors beyond just asset-specific news. Conclusion: A Hopeful Sign for Regional Stability? The reports of Iran signaling a desire to de-escalate tensions with Israel, conveyed through Arab intermediaries and conditioned on U.S. non-involvement, offer a potentially hopeful turning point after a period of heightened direct confrontation. While significant hurdles remain, and the path to genuine regional stability is fraught with challenges, these signals are a reminder that diplomatic off-ramps are always possible, even between long-standing adversaries. Monitoring how these signals translate into action will be critical for understanding the future trajectory of Middle East geopolitics and its potential ripple effects across the globe, including in sensitive markets like cryptocurrency.

The aim? To leverage their influence to persuade former U.S. President Donald Trump to pressure Israel for an immediate ceasefire. This intriguing development, initially reported by Reuters and highlighted by Walter Bloomberg on X, signals a complex web of regional dynamics and strategic bartering. Why Turn to the Gulf States for Iran Ceasefire Efforts? The choice of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Oman as intermediaries is deliberate and reflects the nuanced relationships within the Middle East and with the United States. Each of these nations holds unique standing: Qatar: Often plays a mediating role in regional conflicts and maintains channels with various international actors, including the U.S. and groups involved in the conflict. Saudi Arabia: A major regional power and a close strategic partner of the United States. While relations with Iran are complex, there have been recent efforts towards de-escalation and dialogue. Riyadh’s voice carries significant weight in Washington. Oman: Traditionally acts as a neutral broker in the region, often facilitating backchannel communications between adversaries, including Iran and the U.S. By approaching these specific Gulf states, Iran appears to be seeking multiple avenues to influence U.S. policy towards Israel, hoping that their collective or individual pressure points could be effective. The Nuclear Negotiations Link: What Flexibility Means Perhaps the most striking element of this report is Iran’s reported offer of flexibility in nuclear negotiations with the U.S. in exchange for this diplomatic assistance. This ties two seemingly distinct issues – regional conflict and nuclear talks – together, revealing Iran’s strategic approach to international relations. Flexibility in nuclear talks could encompass various aspects, such as: Willingness to return to the negotiating table regarding the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Potential adjustments to enrichment levels or stockpile limits. Greater transparency or access for international inspectors. Discussion on other related issues like ballistic missiles or regional activities (though historically, Iran has been resistant to including these). Offering this flexibility serves as a potential incentive for the U.S. to consider Iran’s ceasefire request seriously, albeit indirectly through its influence on Israel. It positions the ceasefire as a potentially achievable outcome linked to a major U.S. foreign policy goal: curbing Iran’s nuclear program. Challenges and Opportunities in Middle East Diplomacy This reported request highlights the intricate nature of Middle East diplomacy . While the offer of nuclear flexibility presents a potential opportunity for renewed dialogue between the U.S. and Iran, several challenges exist: U.S. Political Landscape: The request specifically names Donald Trump, who is currently not in office. While he remains a significant political figure, the current administration under President Biden handles official foreign policy. This adds a layer of complexity regarding who Iran believes holds the relevant influence or who they prefer to negotiate with. Gulf States’ Position: While willing to mediate, the Gulf states have their own interests and relationships to balance, particularly their security ties with the U.S. and their complex interactions with both Israel and Iran. Israel’s Stance: Any decision regarding a ceasefire ultimately rests with Israel, which has its own security imperatives and strategic objectives in the ongoing conflict. Trust Deficit: Decades of mistrust and conflict between the U.S., Iran, and regional players create a significant hurdle for any substantial diplomatic breakthrough. Despite these challenges, the willingness of Iran to link nuclear talks to a regional ceasefire, and its outreach to key Gulf states, suggests a potential window for de-escalation and negotiation, however narrow. Understanding US Iran Relations Through This Lens The dynamic between the US Iran relations is a constant factor in Middle East stability. This latest development underscores the indirect pathways often used in their interactions. Instead of direct communication, Iran is reportedly using intermediaries to convey a message and an offer to a former U.S. president. This highlights the lack of direct high-level diplomatic channels and the reliance on regional partners to bridge the gap. The U.S. has consistently stated its goals regarding Iran: preventing nuclear weapon acquisition, countering regional destabilization, and addressing human rights concerns. Iran, conversely, seeks sanctions relief, security guarantees, and regional influence. The reported offer attempts to align Iran’s desire for a ceasefire with a U.S. priority (nuclear talks), demonstrating a strategic attempt to find common ground, even if through a convoluted route involving regional partners and a former U.S. leader. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean? For observers of geopolitical events and those tracking international relations, this report offers several key insights: Interconnectedness: Regional conflicts and nuclear proliferation issues are deeply intertwined in the Middle East. Solutions often require addressing multiple fronts simultaneously. Role of Intermediaries: Third-party mediators like Qatar, Oman, and potentially Saudi Arabia remain crucial facilitators in resolving complex international standoffs where direct talks are difficult. Strategic Bartering: Nations like Iran are willing to use leverage points (like nuclear program flexibility) from one area to achieve goals in another (like influencing a ceasefire). Importance of Regional Dialogue: The involvement of Gulf states emphasizes the growing importance of intra-regional dialogue in addressing shared security challenges and facilitating broader diplomatic efforts. While the outcome of this reported request remains uncertain, it provides a fascinating glimpse into the high-stakes diplomatic maneuvering occurring behind the scenes in the Middle East. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Diplomacy? The report of Iran asking Gulf states to press Donald Trump for an Israel ceasefire, linked to flexibility in nuclear negotiations, is a powerful reminder of the complex, multi-layered nature of Middle Eastern geopolitics. It highlights the critical roles played by regional intermediaries and the strategic calculations involved in international relations. While achieving a lasting ceasefire and resolving nuclear standoffs are monumental tasks fraught with challenges, every diplomatic overture, no matter how unconventional, represents a potential step towards de-escalation and dialogue. Keeping a close watch on the responses from the Gulf states, the U.S., and Israel will be crucial in understanding the potential impact of this intriguing development on the future trajectory of the region.

However, on-chain data suggests that both Bitcoin whales and retail investors still anticipate further upside for the leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Whale And Retail Inflows To Binance Tumble According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Darkfost, Bitcoin inflows to Binance crypto exchange from two distinct cohorts – whales and retail investors – have fallen to their lowest levels in the current market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Upward Momentum ‘Highly Likely’ To Continue, On-Chain Data Shows Darkfost shared the following chart illustrating that Bitcoin whale inflows to Binance have hit their lowest point since 2024. Similarly, retail investor inflows are also at their lowest since 2024, signalling a strong preference to hold rather than sell. The contributor emphasized that this alignment in behavior between whales and retail investors is a “highly constructive signal for the market.” Apart from the consistent inflows observed at the start of the current cycle, Darkfost identified two previous instances when both groups acted in sync. Notably, such periods of aligned behavior have typically coincided with previous market tops. These tops were marked by synchronized BTC inflows into exchanges, leading to a significant uptick in selling pressure and, eventually, market demand exhaustion. Commenting on the recent drop in BTC inflows, Darkfost suggested that market participants may be waiting for clearer macroeconomic cues or are simply exhibiting high conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. They added: Such alignment across investor classes may also reflect broader market confidence, with expectations of further profits ahead. Recent trading setups support the aforementioned outlook. In a separate X post, seasoned crypto analyst Ash Crypto highlighted that a Bitcoin whale had opened a massive $200 million long position with 20x leverage. Should BTC Holders Be Worried? Despite the encouraging dip in BTC inflows to major exchanges like Binance, some analysts warn that a deeper correction may be imminent. For example, TradingView analyst MIRZA recently predicted that BTC could fall as low as $85,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Negative Funding On Binance – A Classic Setup For A Short Squeeze? Similarly, veteran trader Peter Brandt shared a cautionary note, that BTC may see a steep slide in the coming months. Brandt stated that if BTC mirrors the 2021-22 market cycle, then it may risk falling to as low as $23,600. That said, BTC outflows from exchanges continue to rise, depleting available reserves – a dynamic that could result in a supply shock. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $106,920, up 1.8% over the past 24 hours.

From old favourites like Litecoin to newer names like BlockDAG, there’s no shortage of choices. Each coin brings something different to the table. Litecoin offers history and stability. Filecoin builds real utility with decentralised storage. Uniswap powers DeFi’s biggest moves. Then there’s BlockDAG, fresh, fast-growing, and already up 2,660% in value. It’s not just hype. BlockDAG has raised $306 million, sold 22.6 billion coins, and its tech is live. This article breaks down what makes each coin worth watching and why they’re all in the conversation for the top crypto to invest in as the next market cycle takes shape. 1. BlockDAG’s Numbers Show It’s Built for Growth BlockDAG is becoming the top crypto to invest in because it has both the numbers and the momentum. It’s priced at $0.0276 in Batch 29, with a launch price set at $0.05. That alone gives a near 81% upside. But those who bought at $0.001 in Batch 1 are already sitting on 2,660% gains. However, a rare opportunity is still open; BDAG is available at a limited-time rate of just $0.0018 until June 20. This gives new participants one last chance to enter at a price close to Batch 1 and aim for similar high-return potential before the price rises further. So far, 22.6 billion coins have been sold and $306 million raised. This isn’t just hype, it’s backed by progress. BlockDAG’s chain combines DAG tech with Proof-of-Work, aiming to handle over 15,000 transactions per second. It’s EVM-compatible, so Ethereum dApps can shift over without rewriting code. Over 20 exchanges are preparing for listings, and a high-profile U.S. partnership is in the works. The project’s dashboard is another draw; it features wallet functions, real-time leaderboards, and automated bonuses that encourage user growth. With 2 million mobile miners onboard and a loyal user base, BlockDAG is growing beyond early hype. For those looking for the top crypto to invest in with high upside and working systems, BlockDAG checks every box. 2. Litecoin Holds Firm as a Reliable Option Litecoin still deserves a spot among the top cryptocurrencies to invest in. It trades around $86.40, gaining over 3% in a week. While monthly losses show a 16% dip, the coin recently bounced off $82 support, showing it still has legs. Its volume stays high across big exchanges, especially on Binance with active LTC/USDT pairs. Technical charts suggest the coin is building strength again. Despite low whale action since the ETF delay, trading patterns show it might be in a steady accumulation phase. If you’re after a long-time player with strong liquidity and low-risk entry points, Litecoin stays on the list of the top crypto to invest in. 3. Filecoin’s Use Case May Catch Up to Price At $2.53, Filecoin isn’t flying, but it may be underestimated as a top crypto to invest in. It’s up 2.5% in the past 24 hours, though still down for the week. The SEC’s focus on the token brought some unwanted attention, but on-chain stats tell a better story. Filecoin’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (FEVM) has processed over 5,000 contracts. It’s also gaining ground in the DePIN sector, where decentralised storage meets real-world use cases. Derivatives trading volume around FIL sits close to $5 billion, proof that traders haven’t lost interest. If regulators back off, and more builders join the ecosystem, FIL could shift from niche to major player. It’s not loud, but it might surprise people looking for the top crypto to invest in. 4. Uniswap’s Return Could Be More Than a Bounce Uniswap has surged past $7.50 with a 25% weekly gain. That move alone puts it back in the conversation as a top crypto to invest in. But the real story is what’s happening behind the scenes. The recently passed “Uniswap Unleashed” proposal means the V4 version is coming fast. That means better features, more trading tools, and more active users. Volume on Uniswap V2 is already up to $3.4 billion. Whales are also returning, with charts showing strong buys above the $7 mark and potential resistance only around $8.25. If governance improvements keep rolling out and DeFi remains hot, UNI could outperform other decentralised protocols. Final Thoughts on Where to Place Your Bet In a sea of choices, only a few cryptos offer the full package of performance, adoption, and upside. Litecoin continues to show its value as a stable veteran. Filecoin offers a real-world use case with growing traction. Uniswap is proving that strong products and governance matter. But BlockDAG is different; it’s checking every box with clear momentum. With 2,660% gains already locked in from Batch 1 and 22.6 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is proving it’s not just noise. The current $0.0018 price still gives major room for growth. If it hits its $1 target, that’s a huge return. If you’re still wondering what the top crypto to invest in is for 2025, this might be your answer.

The fund is scheduled to begin trading on June 18, 2025, and will be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). This development follows the company’s receipt of regulatory clearance from the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), marking a significant milestone for XRP investors in the region. Canada to Host First Spot XRP ETF in North America The new ETF from Purpose Investments will offer direct exposure to XRP, currently the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Unlike futures-based products, spot ETFs are backed by actual holdings of the underlying asset. This enables investors to gain price exposure without managing crypto wallets or dealing directly with exchanges. The approval from the OSC positions Canada as the first jurisdiction in North America to greenlight a spot XRP ETF. This follows the country’s earlier pioneering efforts in digital asset ETFs, including those based on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Status of Spot XRP ETFs in the United States While Canada is moving ahead, the United States has yet to approve any spot XRP ETFs. Several major asset managers, including Franklin Templeton , WisdomTree , and Bitwise , have submitted proposals to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch similar products. However, regulatory approval remains pending. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bloomberg analysts suggest that the SEC may approve these proposals in the fourth quarter of 2025, possibly alongside other spot-based altcoin ETFs. Market watchers note that the launch of regulated XRP futures by CME Group has improved the chances of spot XRP ETF approval in the U.S., raising expectations to an estimated 88% likelihood by the end of the year. Overview of Existing U.S. XRP ETF Products Although no spot XRP ETF has been approved in the U.S. to date, some alternative ETF products have already entered the market. In April 2025, Teucrium introduced a leveraged XRP ETF, which aims to deliver double the daily return of XRP. Additionally, Volatility Shares rolled out a futures-based ETF in May, offering investors one-to-one exposure to XRP’s performance using regulated futures contracts. These products provide some exposure to XRP for U.S.-based investors, but they differ in structure and risk profile from spot ETFs. Market participants continue to monitor the SEC’s next moves, anticipating broader access to XRP investment options.

There’s been a notable development concerning one specific application that has caught the attention of the crypto market. What’s the Latest From the SEC Regarding Franklin Templeton ? Recent reports indicate that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has taken a step back regarding a key feature in one of the pending spot Ethereum ETF applications. Specifically, news circulating from sources like @PhoenixNewsIO on X, cited by Odaily, suggests the SEC has requested that Franklin Templeton remove the staking component from their proposed Spot Ethereum ETF . This isn’t an outright rejection of the ETF itself, but rather a specific instruction regarding a feature that many applicants included to make their products more appealing to investors. It signals the SEC ‘s continued scrutiny over aspects of cryptocurrency that blur the lines between commodities and securities, particularly crypto staking . Understanding Crypto Staking and Why It Matters for an Ethereum ETF So, what exactly is crypto staking , and why is its potential inclusion (or exclusion) in an Ethereum ETF such a big deal? In simple terms, crypto staking on proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum involves locking up cryptocurrency to support the network’s operations, such as validating transactions and securing the blockchain. In return for staking their Ether (ETH), participants can earn rewards, similar to earning interest in a traditional bank account or dividends from stocks. For an Ethereum ETF , the idea was to potentially stake a portion of the underlying ETH held by the fund. This could offer investors a yield on their investment on top of any potential price appreciation of ETH. This yield component was seen as a significant advantage, potentially making the ETF more attractive compared to simply holding ETH directly or through other non-staking investment vehicles. Potential Benefits of Including Staking in an Ethereum ETF (Now Delayed for Franklin) Potential Yield: Earn passive income on the underlying ETH holdings. Enhanced Investor Appeal: Makes the ETF potentially more competitive and attractive to a broader range of investors seeking yield. Network Participation: Indirectly supports the Ethereum network’s security and operations. Challenges and SEC Concerns Regarding Crypto Staking The SEC ‘s stance on crypto staking has been a subject of debate. One major concern revolves around whether staking services constitute an investment contract, which could classify the staked asset (or the staking service itself) as a security under U.S. law. This has significant regulatory implications. Other concerns might include: Custody Complexity: How the staking process and earned rewards would be managed and secured within the ETF structure. Slashing Risk: Although rare, staked ETH can be penalized (slashed) if the validator node acts maliciously or goes offline, potentially impacting the ETF’s assets. Regulatory Clarity: The overall lack of clear regulatory guidelines specifically for staking services offered to large investment vehicles. What Does This Mean for the Broader Spot Ethereum ETF Landscape? While this specific report is about Franklin Templeton ‘s application, it likely has implications for other applicants as well. Major players like BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and others also have pending applications for a Spot Ethereum ETF , and many had initially included staking features. This request from the SEC suggests a potential standardized approach: the regulator may require all approved Spot Ethereum ETF products to exclude staking initially. This would simplify the regulatory approval process by removing a contentious element and aligning these ETFs more closely with the structure of approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, which do not involve staking. If staking is universally excluded, it could impact the potential returns for investors compared to holding and staking ETH directly. However, it might also pave a clearer path for the ETFs to receive approval, potentially opening the door for broader institutional and retail access to Ethereum exposure through a regulated investment product. Let’s look at a simplified comparison of potential scenarios: Feature Potential Staked Ethereum ETF (Delayed) Likely Approved Non-Staked Ethereum ETF Holding ETH Directly (with Staking) ETH Exposure Yes Yes Yes Potential Yield from Staking Yes (if allowed) No Yes Regulatory Structure Complex/Uncertain Simpler/More Certain (like Spot Bitcoin ETF) Self-regulated Accessibility Via Brokerage Account Via Brokerage Account Via Crypto Exchange/Wallet Custody Risk Managed by ETF Provider Managed by ETF Provider Self-custody risk This table highlights that while a non-staked ETF might lack the yield component, it could be the necessary compromise to gain regulatory approval and offer a familiar, regulated investment wrapper for gaining exposure to ETH. What Does This Ethereum ETF Delay Mean for Investors? Actionable Insights For investors eagerly awaiting a U.S. Spot Ethereum ETF , this news, while potentially disappointing regarding staking yield, doesn’t necessarily mean the end of the road for approval. It could simply be a step in the negotiation process with the SEC to get the structure right. Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights: Patience is Key: The regulatory process is often slow and involves back-and-forth between issuers and the SEC . Delays and requested amendments are common. Focus Shifts to Core Approval: The market’s attention may now pivot more towards the likelihood of *any* Spot Ethereum ETF approval, even without staking, by the key deadlines in May. Understand the Product: If an ETF is approved, understand whether it includes staking or not, as this will impact potential returns. Direct ETH vs. ETF: Consider the trade-offs between holding ETH directly (which allows for staking if you choose) and investing in a potentially non-staked ETF (which offers regulatory structure and ease of access via traditional brokerage accounts). Monitor Regulatory Signals: Keep a close eye on further communications or filings from the SEC and the ETF applicants like Franklin Templeton . While the exclusion of staking might slightly diminish the yield potential compared to direct staking, the primary appeal of a Spot Ethereum ETF for many investors is regulated access to ETH price movements within a familiar investment structure. Conclusion: Navigating the Path to a Spot Ethereum ETF The news that the SEC has reportedly asked Franklin Templeton to remove staking from their Spot Ethereum ETF application is a significant signal regarding the regulatory path forward. It underscores the SEC ‘s cautious approach, particularly concerning aspects like crypto staking that have unclear regulatory classification. This development, while a delay for a desired feature, might ultimately help streamline the approval process for a basic Spot Ethereum ETF product by removing a potential hurdle. Investors should stay informed and be prepared for the possibility that initial U.S. Ethereum ETF s may focus solely on providing exposure to the price of ETH, without the added layer of staking yield. The journey towards regulated crypto investment products is complex, but each step, including these detailed requests from the SEC to applicants like Franklin Templeton , brings more clarity, even if it comes with temporary setbacks for specific features like crypto staking .

The U.S. Senate is gearing up for a crucial vote on the GENIUS Act, a piece of legislation that could fundamentally redefine the role of stablecoins in the American economy. This isn’t just another crypto bill; experts like Wall Street-based asset manager Bernstein believe it has a strong chance of becoming law in the coming months, potentially paving the way for stablecoins to function as true Digital cash and a core part of our Internet payment infrastructure . What is the GENIUS Act and Why Does it Matter for Stablecoin Regulation? At its heart, the GENIUS Act aims to establish a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. For years, stablecoins have existed in a legal grey area, raising concerns among regulators about consumer protection, financial stability, and illicit finance. This proposed US stablecoin law seeks to bring clarity and structure. Here’s what the bill reportedly intends to do: Define Stablecoins as Digital Cash: By classifying stablecoins this way, the bill intends to treat them similarly to traditional currency for certain purposes, potentially boosting confidence and usability for everyday transactions. Promote Mainstream Adoption: A clear regulatory path can encourage businesses and consumers to use stablecoins, knowing they operate within established legal boundaries. This could unlock significant potential for their use in commerce and payments. Limit Non-Financial Firms: The bill is expected to place restrictions on companies primarily outside the financial sector, like retail giants Amazon and Walmart, from issuing their own stablecoins. This measure is likely intended to prevent large corporations from creating private currencies that could challenge monetary policy or create systemic risk outside the regulated financial system. Encourage Partnerships: Instead of issuing their own tokens, non-financial firms would likely be required to partner with regulated stablecoin issuers. This could foster collaboration between tech companies and financial institutions, leveraging the strengths of both while maintaining regulatory oversight. This focus on robust Stablecoin regulation is seen by proponents as essential for integrating digital assets safely into the broader financial system. How Could Stablecoins Become True Digital Cash? Imagine a world where paying online is as simple and instant as handing over physical cash, but digitally. That’s the promise of stablecoins operating as Digital cash under a framework like the one proposed by the GENIUS Act . Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar. This stability is crucial for their function as a medium of exchange. If regulated effectively, stablecoins could offer: Instant Settlement: Transactions can often be settled in seconds or minutes, much faster than traditional banking rails. Lower Costs: Fees for processing stablecoin transactions can be significantly lower than credit card or wire transfer fees, especially for cross-border payments. Accessibility: Potentially accessible to anyone with a smartphone and internet connection, including the unbanked or underbanked populations. Programmability: As digital assets, they can be integrated into smart contracts and automated processes, enabling innovative financial applications. The classification as Digital cash by a potential US stablecoin law like the GENIUS Act would lend significant credibility and legal standing to these attributes, accelerating their potential adoption for everyday transactions. Reshaping Internet Payment Infrastructure: What Does That Mean? Currently, online payments often rely on complex networks involving banks, credit card companies, and payment processors. This system, while functional, can be slow, costly, and sometimes inefficient, particularly across international borders. Stablecoins, if regulated and integrated effectively, could become a foundational layer for the future of Internet payment infrastructure . Here’s how: Peer-to-Peer Efficiency: Stablecoins allow for direct value transfer between parties, reducing the need for multiple intermediaries. Global Reach: Internet-based stablecoin payments aren’t constrained by traditional banking hours or national borders in the same way. Integration with Web3: Stablecoins are native to blockchain technology, making them ideal for integrating payments directly into decentralized applications, metaverses, and other emerging digital environments. Wholesale and Retail Payments: They could facilitate faster, cheaper settlements between businesses (wholesale) and also enable smoother consumer transactions (retail). The vision is that a robust Stablecoin regulation framework, potentially enacted by the GENIUS Act , could unleash the potential for stablecoins to become a seamless, efficient, and widely accessible method for conducting commerce and transferring value online, truly building a new layer of Internet payment infrastructure . The US Stablecoin Law’s Impact: Winners and Losers? Any significant regulatory change creates shifts in the market. The potential passage of the GENIUS Act and its approach to Stablecoin regulation could have varied effects on different players: Potential Winners: Regulated Stablecoin Issuers: Companies already operating within or capable of meeting stringent financial regulations are likely to benefit significantly. They could see increased demand for their services as partners for larger corporations. Businesses Adopting Stablecoin Payments: Companies that integrate stablecoins for customer payments or supply chain finance could benefit from lower transaction costs and faster settlements. Consumers: Could eventually benefit from faster, cheaper, and more accessible payment options online and potentially offline. Potential Losers (or those facing challenges): Non-Financial Firms (like Amazon, Walmart) Wishing to Issue Their Own Tokens: These companies would face direct restrictions and would need to adapt their strategies, likely through partnerships, rather than creating proprietary stablecoins. Existing Payment Processors: While stablecoins might integrate with existing systems, their efficiency and lower costs could put pressure on traditional payment service providers. Unregulated or Offshore Stablecoin Projects: The focus on regulated issuers within the U.S. framework could marginalize stablecoins that don’t comply with the new law. The passage of this US stablecoin law would signal a clear preference for regulated, compliant digital assets, aiming to channel growth through established financial oversight. Navigating the Challenges: What Hurdles Remain for the GENIUS Act? While Bernstein’s optimism is notable, the path to the GENIUS Act becoming law isn’t without potential obstacles. Crafting effective Stablecoin regulation is complex, balancing the need for innovation with financial stability and consumer protection. Challenges could include: Political Divisions: Reaching bipartisan consensus on complex financial technology legislation can be difficult in the U.S. Senate. Balancing Innovation and Risk: Regulators must ensure the law doesn’t stifle technological advancement while adequately mitigating risks like bank runs or illicit use. Defining ‘Digital Cash’ Clearly: The precise legal implications and requirements stemming from this classification will need careful consideration and potentially further regulatory guidance. Enforcement and Oversight: Implementing and enforcing the new rules will require resources and expertise from regulatory bodies. The debate around this potential US stablecoin law highlights the ongoing challenge of integrating rapidly evolving technology into existing legal and financial structures. Actionable Insights: What Should You Watch For? For anyone interested in cryptocurrencies, finance, or the future of online payments, the coming weeks are crucial. Here’s what to keep an eye on: The Senate Vote: The outcome of the vote on the GENIUS Act is the immediate key event. Its passage through the Senate would be a significant step forward. House Action: Even if it passes the Senate, similar legislation would need to pass the House of Representatives and be signed by the President to become law. Monitor progress on companion or similar bills in the House. Industry Reactions: Observe how major players in the crypto space, traditional finance, and tech sectors react to the bill’s progress and potential passage. Regulatory Guidance: If the bill becomes law, watch for subsequent rule-making and guidance from regulatory bodies like the Treasury or financial regulators on implementation details for Stablecoin regulation . Market Response: The market value and adoption trends of regulated stablecoins could react positively to clearer legal status. Understanding the nuances of this potential US stablecoin law is vital for anticipating future trends in Digital cash and Internet payment infrastructure . Conclusion: The impending U.S. Senate vote on the GENIUS Act represents a pivotal moment for the future of stablecoins. By potentially classifying them as Digital cash and laying the groundwork for their integration into Internet payment infrastructure , this proposed US stablecoin law could unlock new levels of mainstream adoption and utility. While challenges remain, the movement towards clear and comprehensive Stablecoin regulation signals a maturing landscape for digital assets. Keeping a close watch on legislative developments is essential for anyone navigating the evolving world of digital finance.

This potential Truth Social ETF filing, initially reported by Bloomberg ETF Analyst James Seyffart on X, marks a significant and perhaps unexpected step into the digital asset space by the company. An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is an investment fund that trades on a stock exchange, much like stocks. ETFs hold assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds, and investors buy shares in the ETF. For cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, a spot ETF would hold the actual underlying asset, providing investors with exposure to the price movements of BTC or ETH without requiring them to directly buy, store, or manage the cryptocurrencies themselves. This simplifies access for traditional investors and institutions. What Does the Truth Social ETF Filing Mean? The core news revolves around Truth Social’s reported application for an ETF that would encompass two of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization: Bitcoin and Ethereum . While the specifics of the filing are not yet fully public, the announcement by a reputable ETF analyst suggests a formal step has been taken towards potentially launching a financial product linked to these digital assets under the Truth Social brand. Here’s a quick breakdown: Applicant: Truth Social (Trump Media & Technology Group) Proposed Asset Class: Dual Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) Filing Body: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Source: Reported by Bloomberg ETF Analyst James Seyffart This isn’t just another company filing for a crypto ETF; it’s a social media platform with a distinct user base and political ties venturing into the complex world of digital asset financial products. The move raises questions about strategy, potential market impact, and the regulatory path ahead. Why a Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF Together? Choosing to file for a dual Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF is notable. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two dominant forces in the crypto market, often seen as complementary rather than competitive by many investors. Consider the differences and why pairing them makes sense for a broad ETF product: Feature Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Primary Use Case Digital Store of Value, Peer-to-Peer Cash Platform for Smart Contracts, DApps, NFTs, DeFi Consensus Mechanism Proof-of-Work (PoW) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) (after The Merge) Market Cap Largest Second Largest Regulatory Status (ETFs) Spot ETFs Approved in US Spot ETFs Pending/Approved in US (as of recent developments) Offering exposure to both allows the ETF to capture different segments of the crypto market and cater to investors interested in either or both assets. Bitcoin is often viewed as ‘digital gold,’ while Ethereum is the backbone of the decentralized web. A dual ETF could appeal to a wider range of investors seeking diversified exposure to the top-tier digital assets through a familiar investment vehicle. Navigating the SEC Crypto ETF Landscape The U.S. SEC Crypto ETF landscape has been a complex and evolving terrain. For years, the SEC was hesitant to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, citing concerns about market manipulation and investor protection. This changed dramatically in January 2024 with the approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs from major financial players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale. The approval of spot BTC ETFs was a watershed moment for the industry, opening the door for massive institutional and retail capital to flow into Bitcoin via regulated channels. Following this, attention quickly turned to Ethereum. As of recent developments, the SEC has also moved towards approving spot Ethereum ETFs, signaling a potential shift in regulatory comfort with major proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies. Any new ETF filing, including the potential Truth Social ETF , must go through a rigorous SEC review process. This involves: Initial Filing (S-1): The applicant submits a registration statement outlining the proposed ETF. Review Period: The SEC reviews the filing, often asking for amendments and clarifications. Decision: The SEC must ultimately approve or disapprove the application within specific timeframes, although these can be extended. Given the SEC’s recent actions regarding spot BTC and ETH ETFs, the regulatory environment is arguably more favorable than in the past. However, a filing from a company like Truth Social, with its unique profile, could still face specific scrutiny or delays. Potential Implications for Trump Media and the Crypto Market What does a move like this mean for Trump Media and the broader crypto space? For Trump Media, launching an ETF could be a strategic business diversification, potentially tapping into the significant interest in crypto investing among certain demographics. It could also be a way to generate revenue through management fees if the ETF is approved and attracts significant assets. From the perspective of the crypto market, a Truth Social-branded ETF could have several implications: Increased Awareness: It brings cryptocurrency further into the mainstream, potentially introducing crypto investing to a new audience who are users of the Truth Social platform. Market Legitimacy: Another ETF filing from a recognized (albeit non-financial) brand adds to the growing list of entities seeking to offer regulated crypto products, further legitimizing the asset class. Political Intersection: This filing uniquely intersects the world of finance, technology, and politics, potentially sparking broader public and political discussions about cryptocurrency regulation and adoption. Competition: If approved, the Truth Social ETF would compete with existing and upcoming spot BTC and ETH ETFs from established financial institutions. The success and impact of this potential ETF would, of course, depend heavily on SEC approval, the structure of the fund, and investor appetite. What Are the Potential Benefits? Should the Truth Social ETF gain approval, several potential benefits could arise: Easier Access for Investors: Provides a familiar, regulated pathway for individuals and institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum through brokerage accounts. Potential for Increased Capital Inflow: A new ETF, particularly one associated with a prominent brand, could attract fresh capital into the BTC and ETH markets. Enhanced Liquidity: As with other spot ETFs, this could contribute to increased trading volume and liquidity for the underlying assets. Mainstream Validation: Another ETF product signals growing acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies into the traditional financial system. What Challenges Lie Ahead? Despite the potential benefits, the path to launching the Truth Social ETF is likely fraught with challenges: SEC Approval Uncertainty: While the environment is more favorable, approval is not guaranteed. The SEC will scrutinize the filing, market surveillance, and potential risks. Regulatory Changes: The regulatory landscape for crypto is constantly evolving, which could impact the approval process or the operation of the ETF. Market Volatility: Bitcoin and Ethereum are known for price volatility, which could impact the performance of the ETF and investor sentiment. Competition: The market for BTC and ETH ETFs is becoming crowded with offerings from major financial players. Attracting assets under management (AUM) will be competitive. Political Scrutiny: Given Truth Social’s affiliation, the filing may attract political attention and debate, potentially adding another layer of complexity. Actionable Insights: What Should You Watch For? For those following the crypto market and this development, here are some key things to watch: Keep an eye on official announcements from the SEC regarding the filing. ETF applications have specific review periods, and any updates or delays will be publicly noted. Observe the market reaction to this news. While initial reports may cause a stir, sustained impact depends on the likelihood of approval and investor interest. Look for any further details or statements from Trump Media & Technology Group or Truth Social regarding their intentions, the structure of the proposed ETF, and their strategy for entering the crypto space. A Surprising Turn in the Crypto ETF Race The filing by Truth Social for a dual Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF is undoubtedly a surprising development in the ongoing race to bring regulated crypto investment products to market. It highlights the increasing mainstream interest in digital assets, even from companies outside the traditional finance sector. While the road to SEC approval is never guaranteed, especially for a novel application like this, the filing itself is a significant event, underscoring the expanding reach and influence of cryptocurrencies in the broader financial and technological landscape. The coming months will reveal how the SEC responds and what this could ultimately mean for Truth Social, Trump Media, and the future of crypto investing.

The Aptos network, known for its focus on scalability and usability, is taking a significant step to strengthen its ecosystem’s integrity. A major development recently announced is the collaboration between the Aptos Foundation and leading blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. This Chainalysis partnership is set to significantly enhance Aptos security and foster greater confidence across the network. Understanding the Chainalysis Partnership with Aptos The core of this collaboration involves the Aptos Foundation sharing information regarding addresses identified as being linked to illicit or risky activities directly with Chainalysis. This data exchange is a critical move in proactive defense against financial crime within the blockchain space. Chainalysis, with its sophisticated tools and extensive database, can then integrate this information to improve its monitoring and tracing capabilities specifically for the Aptos network. Here’s what the partnership fundamentally aims to achieve: Enhanced Monitoring: Allowing Chainalysis to better identify and track potentially problematic transactions and wallets on Aptos. Improved Compliance: Providing businesses and services operating on Aptos with better tools and data to meet regulatory requirements. Risk Mitigation: Helping to flag and potentially prevent funds associated with illegal activities from moving through the network. This move aligns Aptos with industry best practices for security and compliance, demonstrating a commitment to creating a responsible and safe blockchain environment. Strengthening Aptos Security Through Collaboration While Aptos is built with robust technical architecture designed for safety and reliability, the threat landscape in the crypto world is constantly changing. Exploits, scams, and illicit financing attempts are persistent challenges. By integrating Chainalysis’s expertise, Aptos is adding a crucial layer of defense focused on the financial flows on the network. Think of it this way: the core Aptos protocol provides the secure rails for transactions. The Chainalysis partnership adds the intelligence layer that helps identify if the *contents* of those transactions or the *participants* involved might be linked to harmful activities. This proactive sharing of information about suspicious addresses allows for faster identification and potential action against bad actors, making the network inherently safer for legitimate users and applications. The Power of Blockchain Analytics in Combating Illicit Activity Blockchain analytics is the process of inspecting, identifying, clustering, and tracing transactions on a blockchain. Firms like Chainalysis are at the forefront of this field, developing sophisticated software that can analyze vast amounts of on-chain data. Their tools can: Identify addresses belonging to known entities (exchanges, darknet markets, sanctioned entities, etc.). Trace the flow of funds across multiple transactions and even different blockchains. Estimate the risk score associated with a particular wallet or transaction based on its history and connections. Detect patterns indicative of fraudulent activity, money laundering, or sanctions evasion. By leveraging Chainalysis’s capabilities, the Aptos ecosystem gains access to world-class tools for understanding the financial activity occurring on its chain. This is vital not just for security, but also for transparency and accountability, which are key to mainstream adoption. Driving Better Crypto Compliance on the Apt Aptos Network For decentralized applications (dApps), businesses, and service providers building on or interacting with Aptos, regulatory compliance is becoming increasingly important globally. This Chainalysis partnership directly supports efforts to improve crypto compliance within the ecosystem. How does this help with compliance? Chainalysis provides compliance software and services that businesses can use to screen transactions and wallets for risk. With the Aptos Foundation sharing specific illicit addresses, Chainalysis’s data for Aptos becomes more accurate and comprehensive. This means: Exchanges and Wallets: Can better screen deposits and withdrawals to avoid interacting with funds from illicit sources. dApps and Protocols: Can integrate compliance checks where necessary, reducing their exposure to regulatory risk. Institutions: Gain more confidence in the network’s integrity, potentially lowering barriers to institutional participation. Improved compliance coverage makes the Aptos network a more attractive and viable platform for businesses that need to operate within regulatory frameworks, ultimately fostering growth and legitimacy. Enhancing On-Chain Security for a Safer Ecosystem Ultimately, the goal of this partnership is to enhance overall on-chain security on the Aptos network. This goes beyond just tracking illicit funds; it contributes to building a safer, more trustworthy environment for everyone. Key benefits for the ecosystem include: Increased User Trust: Users can feel more confident transacting on a network actively working to combat fraud and illicit activity. Developer Confidence: Developers building dApps can do so with greater assurance that the underlying network is being monitored for harmful uses. Ecosystem Growth: A reputation for strong security and compliance attracts more legitimate projects, users, and investment. Reduced Risk of Exploitation: While analytics doesn’t prevent all exploits, tracing funds post-exploit can aid recovery efforts and deter future attacks by making it harder for attackers to cash out. This collaboration signifies Aptos’s commitment to proactive security measures that protect its community and promote responsible innovation in the Web3 space. What This Means for the Future of Aptos This partnership is more than just a technical integration; it’s a strategic move positioning Aptos as a network that prioritizes safety and compliance alongside performance and scalability. In an era of increasing scrutiny on the crypto industry, demonstrating a commitment to combating illicit activity is crucial for mass adoption and positive regulatory engagement. While challenges remain, such as balancing privacy with security and ensuring the accuracy of data, this step is a significant positive development. It provides a foundation for a more secure and compliant ecosystem, paving the way for broader participation from users, developers, and institutions alike. Actionable Insights For Users: While network-level security is enhanced, always practice good personal security habits (secure wallets, beware of phishing). Be aware that increased analytics can sometimes impact privacy, though the focus is typically on illicit activity. For Developers & Businesses on Aptos: Explore integrating Chainalysis tools or similar compliance solutions into your dApps or services, especially if handling significant value or user funds. Stay informed about evolving compliance requirements. For the Community: Support initiatives that enhance network safety and report suspicious activity through appropriate channels if available. Conclusion: A Safer Horizon for Aptos The partnership between Aptos and Chainalysis marks a vital step forward in strengthening the security and compliance posture of the Aptos network. By combining Aptos’s performant architecture with Chainalysis’s leading blockchain analytics capabilities, the collaboration aims to create a safer environment, combat illicit activity, and enhance crypto compliance for all participants. This focus on building trust through robust on-chain security is essential for the long-term health and widespread adoption of the Aptos ecosystem, promising a more secure future for Web3 innovation on the platform.

The latest to make headlines is Universal Digital, a Canadian publicly-listed company, which has announced a significant pivot in its treasury strategy. They are moving towards a Bitcoin treasury strategy , a decision that signals a growing trend in corporate adoption of the leading cryptocurrency. What Exactly is Universal Digital’s Bitcoin Treasury Strategy? Universal Digital has publicly stated its intention to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy . According to a press release highlighted by Crypto Briefing, the company plans to gradually divest its existing portfolio of various altcoin holdings . The funds generated from these sales will then be strategically reallocated into purchases of Bitcoin (BTC). This isn’t just a simple portfolio adjustment; it represents a fundamental shift in how Universal Digital Bitcoin reserves will be managed, prioritizing Bitcoin as the primary digital asset for their corporate treasury. This move suggests a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its suitability as a reserve asset compared to a diversified basket of altcoins. The gradual nature of the sale of altcoin holdings indicates a planned approach to minimize market impact and manage the transition effectively. By consolidating their digital asset exposure into Bitcoin, Universal Digital aims for a more focused and, in their view, potentially more secure and valuable treasury position. Why the Growing Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? Corporate Bitcoin adoption has become a hot topic in recent years, spearheaded by companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla, who have famously added significant amounts of BTC to their balance sheets. But why are more businesses considering a Company Bitcoin strategy ? Several factors contribute to this trend, particularly in the current macroeconomic climate: Inflation Hedge: Many corporate treasurers are concerned about the devaluation of fiat currencies due to inflation and quantitative easing policies globally. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, is increasingly viewed as a potential hedge against this loss of purchasing power. Store of Value: Proponents argue that Bitcoin serves as a digital store of value, akin to digital gold, offering a durable asset that is resistant to censorship and confiscation, unlike traditional financial assets. Potential Appreciation: While highly volatile, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant long-term price appreciation potential since its inception. Holding BTC offers the possibility of substantial returns on treasury capital, potentially outperforming traditional low-yield investments like bonds or cash reserves. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can provide diversification benefits to a traditional corporate treasury portfolio that might be heavily concentrated in cash, government securities, or short-term corporate debt. Leading Digital Asset: Bitcoin’s first-mover advantage, largest market capitalization, deepest liquidity, and robust decentralized network security make it the most established and widely accepted digital asset for institutional adoption. For companies like Universal Digital, moving towards a Corporate Bitcoin adoption strategy is often a calculated decision based on these perceived benefits, a long-term outlook on the future of finance, and a desire to be at the forefront of digital asset integration. Navigating the Shift: Selling Altcoin Holdings for Bitcoin The core of Universal Digital’s announcement involves selling their existing altcoin holdings . This process requires careful execution and strategic planning. Liquidating potentially diverse altcoin portfolios can present challenges related to market depth, execution risk, and timing. Selling large amounts of less liquid altcoins could potentially impact their price, leading to less favorable execution than anticipated. However, the strategic intent behind divesting altcoin holdings is clear: consolidate value into Bitcoin. This move signifies a strategic focus, shifting away from the potentially higher risk and volatility associated with a broader range of digital assets to concentrate on Bitcoin, which is often viewed as the most secure, liquid, and established cryptocurrency in the space. The decision to move from a diversified altcoin portfolio to a concentrated Bitcoin treasury strategy highlights Universal Digital’s specific risk assessment and long-term vision for its digital asset reserves. Is a Company Bitcoin Strategy Right for Your Business? Key Considerations While Corporate Bitcoin adoption is gaining traction, implementing a Company Bitcoin strategy is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Businesses must carefully consider various factors and assess their own circumstances before taking the plunge. It requires a thorough understanding of the risks and complexities involved: Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin’s price volatility is notoriously high. Companies must have a strong appetite for risk and the ability to withstand significant short-term fluctuations in the value of their treasury holdings. This is perhaps the most critical factor. Regulatory Environment: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally and varies significantly by jurisdiction. Companies need to navigate potential compliance, reporting, and licensing requirements, which can be complex and subject to change. Custody and Security: Securing Bitcoin holdings requires specialized knowledge and robust security infrastructure. Losing private keys means permanent loss of funds. Companies must implement secure custody solutions, whether through self-custody best practices or engaging institutional-grade custodians with strong security track records. Accounting and Tax Implications: Managing Bitcoin on the balance sheet involves complex accounting and tax considerations. Rules vary by region, and businesses often need expert advice to ensure compliance with relevant accounting standards (like GAAP or IFRS) and tax laws. Stakeholder Communication: A move into Bitcoin treasury requires clear communication with shareholders, employees, and the public about the rationale, risks, and strategy behind the decision. Long-Term Vision: A Bitcoin treasury strategy is typically a long-term play, focused on preserving or growing capital over years, not a short-term trading strategy. Companies need conviction in Bitcoin’s future role in the global financial system. Here’s a simplified look at some pros and cons to consider when evaluating a Company Bitcoin strategy : Potential Benefits of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Potential Challenges of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Hedge against inflation and currency devaluation High price volatility and potential for significant losses Potential for significant capital appreciation Evolving and uncertain regulatory landscape Diversification away from traditional assets Complex security and custody requirements Increased visibility and perception as innovative Accounting complexities and tax implications Accessibility and global transferability Public and stakeholder perception risks Universal Digital’s decision reflects their specific risk assessment, strategic goals, and confidence in managing the complexities involved in transitioning from diverse altcoin holdings to a concentrated Bitcoin position. The Broader Picture: The Evolving Landscape of Digital Asset Treasuries The move by Universal Digital Bitcoin strategy is part of a larger narrative surrounding the integration of digital assets into corporate finance. While Bitcoin remains the dominant choice for corporate treasury reserves due to its maturity, liquidity, and perceived security, the broader landscape of digital asset treasury management is slowly evolving. Some companies are exploring stablecoins for operational purposes or yield-generating strategies in decentralized finance (DeFi), though these carry different risk profiles than holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset. However, the focus for treasury strategies largely remains on Bitcoin as the primary non-sovereign, hard-capped asset. The trend towards a Bitcoin treasury strategy highlights a growing confidence among certain corporate leaders in the long-term viability and potential benefits of holding cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets. As the infrastructure around digital assets matures, including institutional custody solutions, clearer regulatory frameworks, and better accounting guidance, we may see even wider Corporate Bitcoin adoption in the coming years. This evolving landscape of how companies manage their digital assets, moving potentially from diverse altcoin holdings to more focused strategies like Universal Digital’s, is one to watch closely as it shapes the future of corporate finance. Conclusion: A Strategic Shift in the Digital Age Universal Digital’s announcement to shift its altcoin holdings into a dedicated Bitcoin treasury strategy is a significant development in the corporate world’s increasing engagement with digital assets. It underscores the growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class for corporate balance sheets and aligns with a broader trend of Corporate Bitcoin adoption seen globally. While challenges exist, including volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and operational complexities, the decision by companies like Universal Digital signals a forward-thinking approach to treasury management in the digital age. Their move to consolidate into Bitcoin from diverse altcoin holdings is a clear statement about their preferred digital asset focus and their belief in Bitcoin’s role as a long-term store of value. This strategic pivot highlights the dynamic nature of corporate finance as it adapts to the possibilities and challenges presented by the digital asset revolution.

Recent reports highlight escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, with a specific warning that could have far-reaching implications. Understanding this geopolitical risk is crucial for anyone navigating today’s interconnected markets. According to information shared by Walter Bloomberg on X, the semi-official Iranian news agency Mehr has reported that Iran is prepared to deliver a “major blow” to Israel. This statement, while brief, carries substantial weight given the historical context and ongoing friction in the region. Such declarations often signal potential shifts in military or diplomatic posture, which in turn can send ripples across international relations and financial stability. Understanding the Potential Market Impact of Iran Israel Tensions Geopolitical events, particularly those involving significant regional powers like Iran and Israel, frequently trigger reactions in global financial markets. Why does this matter for assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies? The primary connection lies in increased uncertainty and perceived risk. When major conflicts or threats emerge, investors often seek to re-evaluate their portfolios. Traditional markets, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities, are typically the first to react. Oil prices, for instance, are highly sensitive to Middle East tension due to the region’s critical role in global energy supply. Gold, historically seen as a safe-haven asset, often sees increased demand during times of political instability. The knock-on effect of these movements, coupled with a general rise in investor anxiety, can influence the broader financial ecosystem, including the crypto market. Here are some potential ways escalating Iran Israel tensions could manifest in market reactions: Increased Volatility: Uncertainty fuels volatility. News of potential conflict can lead to sharp price swings in various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Shift in Investor Sentiment: A risk-off sentiment might emerge, prompting some investors to reduce exposure to perceived riskier assets like altcoins or even Bitcoin, at least initially. Safe-Haven Narrative Testing: Bitcoin has, at times, been presented as a digital safe haven. Geopolitical crises can test this narrative, showing whether investors flock to or away from BTC during times of stress. Impact on Traditional Finance: Significant disruption in traditional markets could indirectly affect the crypto space through capital flows or changes in institutional investor behavior. How Does Geopolitical Risk Influence Crypto Market Volatility? While the cryptocurrency market operates 24/7 and is less directly tied to specific national economies than traditional stock markets, it is not immune to global events. Major geopolitical flashpoints contribute to overall market sentiment and liquidity. High levels of geopolitical risk can lead to: Liquidity Crunch: In times of panic, investors might sell assets (including crypto) to raise cash, leading to downward price pressure. Correlation Shifts: The correlation between crypto and traditional assets might change. Sometimes Bitcoin acts like a tech stock; other times, it shows traits similar to gold. Geopolitical events can influence which correlation dominates. Regulatory Uncertainty: Heightened international tensions can sometimes lead to increased scrutiny or calls for stricter regulation of decentralized assets like crypto, adding another layer of uncertainty. It’s important to note that the relationship between geopolitical events and crypto market volatility is complex and not always predictable. While a major negative event might intuitively suggest a sell-off, counter-narratives (like Bitcoin as a decentralized asset outside traditional control) can also come into play. What Should Crypto Holders Consider Amidst Middle East Tension? Given the potential for increased Middle East tension to impact markets, crypto holders might consider several factors: Stay Informed, But Be Skeptical: Follow reputable news sources for updates on the geopolitical situation, but be wary of sensationalism or FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) specifically targeting the crypto market based on these events. Review Your Risk Tolerance: Understand how potential market swings align with your personal financial goals and risk appetite. Diversification: Ensure your portfolio, both within crypto and across different asset classes, is diversified according to your strategy. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term investors, short-term geopolitical volatility might be viewed as noise or even potential buying opportunities, rather than a reason to panic sell. Security: Regardless of market conditions, always prioritize the security of your private keys and exchange accounts. The report from Mehr, relayed by Walter Bloomberg, serves as a reminder that external global factors can and do influence the financial world. While the direct outcome of the reported “major blow” threat remains to be seen, its potential to amplify geopolitical risk and subsequently affect market dynamics is clear. In conclusion, the news of Iran’s preparedness to deliver a “major blow” to Israel, as reported by Mehr news agency, underscores the ever-present reality of Iran Israel tensions. For the crypto community, this serves as a critical reminder that while decentralized, the market does not exist in a vacuum. Global events, particularly those increasing Middle East tension and geopolitical risk , have the potential to drive significant crypto market volatility . Staying informed, maintaining a clear strategy, and understanding the broader market context are essential for navigating these turbulent times.

Dogecoin Is Currently Trading Inside A Symmetrical Triangle In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared a chart that shows where Dogecoin currently stands from a technical analysis (TA) perspective. Below is the graph in question, showing the trend in the 1-day price of the memecoin. From the chart, it’s visible that the Dogecoin price has possibly been trading inside a triangular channel during the last few months. The channel hasn’t appeared to be just any triangle-shaped one, either, but a special type called the Symmetrical Triangle. Related Reading: Ethereum ETF Frenzy: Inflows Jump 5x While Bitcoin Stalls A Symmetrical Triangle forms whenever an asset observes consolidation between two trendlines converging at a roughly equal and opposite slope. The upper line of the pattern tracks lower highs in the price, and the lower one higher lows. As the asset moves inside this channel, its range becomes narrower with time, until it shrinks down to a point at the apex. Generally, volatile moves are more likely to occur when consolidation tightens, so a breakout of the pattern becomes increasingly probable as the price approaches the tip of the triangle Symmetrical Triangle breakouts can signal a continuation of the trend in the direction of the break. This means that a rise above the pattern can be a bullish sign, while a drop below it may be a bearish one. As displayed in the chart, the 1-day price of Dogecoin has recently been nearing the end of the triangle, a potential sign that a breakout could be imminent. Currently, the memecoin is retesting the lower line, so it will be interesting to see whether the level holds or if this is where a break would finally happen. Unlike the Ascending and Descending Triangles, two other popular types of triangular channels in TA, breakouts are usually considered to be equally probable in either direction for a Symmetrical Triangle. The reason is simple: consolidation occurs in an exactly sideways manner in this pattern. In contrast, the Ascending and Descending types slope upward and downward, respectively, which can bias the breakout direction. Thus, even if Dogecoin is retesting the lower level right now, a rebound and then breakout from the upper line may also still be quite possible. That said, in the event that a bearish breakout does take place, things can be especially troubling for DOGE, as there is another level of importance just nearby.

A significant development is set to unfold on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), potentially opening up a new avenue for traditional investors looking to gain exposure to the world of digital assets. We’re talking about the imminent launch of the first-ever XRP ETF Canada , brought to you by a familiar name in the Canadian investment landscape: Purpose Investments. This news, initially reported by Wu Blockchain, marks a pivotal moment for the XRP community and the broader Canadian crypto market. After receiving final regulatory clearance, Purpose Investments is poised to list an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that will directly hold XRP, offering a regulated and potentially more accessible way to invest in XRP compared to navigating cryptocurrency exchanges. XRP ETF Canada : What Does This Mean for Investors? The approval and subsequent listing of an XRP ETF Canada fundamentally changes how Canadian investors can access the XRP market. Unlike purchasing XRP directly on a crypto exchange, an ETF trades on traditional stock exchanges like the TSX. This means investors can buy and sell shares of the ETF through their regular brokerage accounts, alongside stocks and bonds. The structure of this particular ETF is crucial: it will directly invest in XRP. This ‘physical’ backing means the ETF’s performance is intended to track the price movements of XRP itself, minus management fees and operational costs. This direct investment approach is often preferred by investors seeking genuine exposure to the underlying asset’s price action. The listing date is set for June 18th on the Toronto Stock Exchange . This adds XRP to the growing list of cryptocurrencies that have received ETF approval in Canada, further solidifying the country’s position as a leader in regulated crypto investment products. Understanding the Purpose Investments XRP Offering: Tickers Explained Purpose Investments, known for launching North America’s first Bitcoin ETF, is bringing its expertise to the XRP market. Their new offering, the ‘Purpose XRP ETF’, will be available under three different tickers on the TSX to cater to various investor preferences regarding currency exposure: XRPP (CAD hedged): This ticker is designed for investors who want to minimize the impact of fluctuations between the Canadian dollar (CAD) and the underlying asset’s price (which is typically benchmarked against USD). The hedging aims to isolate the performance based primarily on the price movement of XRP in USD terms, reducing CAD/USD currency risk. XRPP.B (CAD unhedged): This ticker offers direct exposure to the price of XRP in Canadian dollars. The performance will reflect both the price changes of XRP and the exchange rate movements between CAD and USD. This is suitable for investors comfortable with currency risk or those who believe the CAD may strengthen relative to the USD. XRPP.U (USD standard): This ticker allows investors to trade the ETF in US dollars directly on the Toronto Stock Exchange. This is convenient for investors who hold USD or prefer to think about their investment performance in USD terms without currency conversion effects from the CAD side. Providing multiple tickers with different currency options gives investors flexibility in how they manage their portfolio’s currency exposure when they decide to invest in XRP via this ETF. The Significance of a Crypto ETF Canada Listing for XRP Canada has been at the forefront of approving cryptocurrency ETFs, starting with Bitcoin and Ethereum. The addition of an XRP ETF is noteworthy for several reasons: Increased Legitimacy: Listing on a major regulated exchange like the Toronto Stock Exchange lends a layer of legitimacy and validation to XRP as an asset class in the eyes of traditional finance. Accessibility: ETFs are highly accessible investment vehicles. They can be bought and sold easily through existing brokerage accounts, bypassing the complexities sometimes associated with setting up accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges, managing wallets, and understanding private keys. This opens the door for a broader range of investors, including institutions and retail investors who prefer traditional investment structures. Institutional Interest: While retail investors benefit from ease of access, a regulated XRP ETF Canada could also pave the way for greater institutional participation in the XRP market. Many institutional mandates restrict investments to regulated securities, making an ETF an ideal vehicle. Market Depth: The introduction of a regulated investment product can potentially increase liquidity and market depth for XRP by attracting capital from traditional financial markets. This move by Purpose Investments, following regulatory approval, highlights the growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into mainstream financial systems, particularly within the Canadian market. Investing via the Toronto Stock Exchange : Benefits and Challenges Accessing crypto assets like XRP through a regulated exchange like the Toronto Stock Exchange offers distinct advantages: Benefits: Regulatory Oversight: ETFs are regulated financial products, offering investor protections not always available when trading directly on unregulated crypto platforms. Ease of Use: Trading through a standard brokerage account is familiar to most investors. Custody Handled: The ETF provider handles the complexities and security risks associated with storing the underlying XRP. Liquidity: ETFs are generally highly liquid, making it easy to enter and exit positions. However, there are also potential challenges when you decide to invest in XRP this way: Challenges: Management Fees (MER): ETFs charge annual fees (Management Expense Ratio) which can eat into returns over time. These are typically higher for crypto ETFs than traditional equity ETFs. Tracking Error: The ETF’s performance might not perfectly mirror the price of the underlying asset due to fees, operational costs, and trading differences. Lack of Direct Ownership: You own shares of the ETF, not the actual XRP. This means you cannot use the XRP for transactions, staking, or participation in any potential network activities. Trading Hours: ETFs trade only during standard stock market hours, unlike crypto markets which operate 24/7. Investors should weigh these factors when considering whether an ETF is the right way for them to gain exposure to XRP. How to Invest in XRP Through the New ETF For Canadian investors interested in gaining exposure to XRP via the Purpose XRP ETF, the process is straightforward if you already have a brokerage account. On or after June 18th, you will be able to search for the ETF using its tickers (XRPP, XRPP.B, or XRPP.U) on your brokerage platform, whether it’s with a major bank or an online broker. You can then place buy or sell orders just like you would for any stock. Choosing the right ticker depends on your view on currency fluctuations and your preferred trading currency. If you are concerned about the CAD/USD exchange rate impacting your returns, the hedged CAD option (XRPP) might be suitable. If you want pure XRP price exposure in CAD, the unhedged option (XRPP.B) works. If you prefer trading in USD, use XRPP.U. This new option sits alongside direct purchases on crypto exchanges, offering an alternative for those prioritizing regulation, ease of access through traditional finance, and professional custody over direct asset control. Conclusion: A New Chapter for XRP ETF Canada The approval and upcoming listing of the Purpose XRP ETF on the Toronto Stock Exchange is undeniably a significant step forward for XRP within the regulated financial landscape. It provides Canadian investors with a familiar, accessible, and regulated pathway to gain exposure to the digital asset, potentially attracting new capital and increasing XRP’s visibility in traditional markets. While direct ownership offers different benefits, the ETF provides a compelling alternative for those prioritizing ease of access and regulatory compliance. As the Crypto ETF Canada market continues to mature, this listing marks another milestone in the ongoing convergence of traditional finance and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies.

The technical signs like a decline through key moving averages and dwindling volumes are whispering about a market that is waiting on new catalysts. Solana remains one of the leaders on the crypto market but lacking adoption by institutional buyers or a growth in network TVL its elevation can be constrained. In the meantime new DeFi crypto token Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting some traction with a price under 1 dollar as investors seek the next major cryptocurrency that can take off. Mutuum Finance currently at $0.03 is starting to gather serious momentum amongst early investors who have made large bets on its DeFi utility and potential gain. Solana Faces Key Technical Hurdles at $160 Level Solana (SOL) is trading at $152.95 experiencing a minor pullback within a broader market consolidation. SOL is however encountering robust selling at the $160-$161 region which has curtailed multiple breakout attempts in recent sessions even as the token recovers the losses suffered in May. Technical charts show that Solana is lower than its 50-day moving average by a small margin and the volume is declining as well which is a sign of absence of short term momentum. Phase 5 of Mutuum Finance Presale Now Underway The fifth phase of Mutuum Finance presale has started as the platform attracts increasing investor interest. The DeFi solution provided by Mutuum Finance operates as a scalable long-term solution instead of risky meme coins. Investor confidence remains high since Phase 5 of the presale has surpassed $10.6 million total sales and attracted more than 12000 token holders before the following price adjustment. The presale token price has reached $0.03 during Phase 5 of the presale while the launch will bring it to $0.06. USD-Pegged Stablecoin and Audited by CertiK Mutuum Finance will launch its fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Built to survive the collapses of algorithmic models, the stablecoin’s robust construction enables long-term stability and price consistency. Underpinned by open-source smart contracts and the success of a Certik audit the platform offers a safe foundation for digital financial transactions. Mutuum Finance is pairing state-of-the-art lending features with a robust ecosystem charting a definite course for the future of DeFi. Early Investors Reap Rewards as Community Expands As the platform gains traction, Mutuum Finance continues to reward its early backers. Ten lucky investors will be selected to share a $100,000 giveaway prize each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens as a thank-you for supporting the project early on. As Solana (SOL) struggles with the resistance at the $160 mark and the decreasing momentum investors are beginning to turn their attention to high-reward projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Having raised the capital of more than $10.6 million and 12,100+ people already on board MUTM is starting to receive recognition as a DeFi heavyweight yet it trades at only $0.03. The basics of the project such as a fully audited Certik security report a USD-pegged stablecoin and a dual-lending protocol can make it enter the top 20 cryptocurrencies in 2025. With SOL failing to deliver the thrills even at the early-stage projects such as Mutuum Finance are proving to be the popular choices among investors aiming to capture more substantial gains. Get your stake now before the price increases to 0.035 during the next presale stage.

The age‑old question is, can cryptocurrency prevent cross‑border crime? Criminals in early 2024 abducted two ethnic Chinese executives in the Philippines, Southeast Asia. They demanded a ransom of $3.75 million paid in cryptocurrency due to a digital trail too complex to follow, funds too fluid to stop, and technology too fast for law enforcement to catch up. What seemed like the perfect crime backfired after the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, stepped in to help. Their Financial Intelligence Unit worked with law enforcement to track the blockchain, identify the wallets involved, freeze the funds in real-time, and uncover the laundering trail the criminals thought would keep them hidden. This case suggests that cryptocurrency’s publicly accessible ledger might be the key to solving crimes. It dismisses the idea that digital currencies make it easier for people to commit offenses across borders and get away with them. However, it only worked because Binance chose to help, which raises some difficult questions. What happens if other platforms don’t do the same? What if a company refuses to give information, takes too long to respond, or doesn’t have the tools or staff to act fast? And if only a few big exchanges like Binance can freeze crypto or recover ransom money, does that mean they now have too much power to decide when to act, who to help, and how to support police or victims? Users say this control raises issues about fairness, trust, and accountability because it could give private companies more influence than some governments. Abductors launder crypto ransom through casino junkets The captors combined the ransom with other funds to make it untraceable. They sent it to multiple crypto wallets based in other countries through casino junkets because they aren’t well-regulated and can quietly move huge amounts of cash or crypto. The abductors took advantage of the junkets’ secrecy to make the investigation extremely difficult. While junkets look like travel planners or casino VIP services that help rich people travel and gamble in luxury casinos, they help move money behind the scenes. The Philippine law enforcement authorities contacted Binance’s Financial Intelligence Unit to help track the ransom payment of nearly $3.75 million in crypto scattered across several digital wallets. Binance FIU steps in Binance’s FIU team used powerful blockchain analytics tools to track the funds through the public ledger by analyzing their movement, mapping out the wallet addresses involved, and connecting them to real user accounts on the platform. They identified key wallets and accounts suspected to be part of the laundering operation. They froze over $3.5 million worth of crypto tied directly to the ransom payment to prevent the criminals from cashing out or transferring the funds to other platforms. Binance’s FIU helped turn what seemed like a hopeless digital trail into a clear path toward justice and gave law enforcement the breakthrough they needed to understand how the operation worked. Crypto solved the case, but critics say not all platforms are up to the task People have long believed that crypto helped criminals hide and move money without a trace. Still, investigators in the abduction could follow the digital trail and connect the dots because the public blockchain records every crypto transaction. Some users claim the case proves crypto can be useful in bringing criminals to justice, with one official close to the case saying, “Binance’s help was crucial. The funds were highly fragmented, but the blockchain doesn’t lie.” However, critics argue that smaller exchanges or offshore platforms lack the resources and experience to handle these complex investigations and may even ignore law enforcement requests or delay action. They say the case raises concerns about uneven capabilities in the wider crypto industry because its success depended heavily on Binance’s ability and willingness to cooperate with police. Is Binance creating a pattern of success—or just riding a lucky break? Binance’s FIU is a powerful crime-fighting team that works closely with police in high-stakes situations other than abduction in the Philippines. It helped recover over $6 million tied to fake investment wallet scams that had affected dozens of victims in “Operation Fox Hunt” in Thailand. It worked alongside Malaysian local authorities to solve yet another abduction and return more than $1.6 million in ransom paid in crypto. The team has a faster turnaround (responds to police requests within three days) than many expect from corporate investigations. It uses blockchain tools to track funds across wallets or exchanges and freeze suspicious assets before they disappear. Binance fills in the gaps that traditional financial systems and local police departments often struggle with, especially when crimes quickly cross borders and currencies. Binance’s good track record shows what’s possible when private platforms and public agencies work together with urgency and shared purpose. But it doesn’t yet prove that the whole crypto ecosystem is ready, or willing, to help stop crime on this level. The company’s assistance in these high-profile cases was voluntary, based on their internal policies and leadership choices. No global rules force crypto exchanges to cooperate with law enforcement, no consistent legal obligations that require them to freeze funds or share data, and no international body that ensures other platforms follow Binance’s example. Fighting crypto crime takes more than luck Law enforcement agencies worldwide must invest time, money, and training into building teams that understand blockchain and follow digital money trails. They should also work with advanced forensic tools to investigate crimes that now move at digital speed. Without this knowledge, they risk falling behind criminals who are already using these tools to hide their tracks. Crypto platforms, on the other hand, should integrate strict compliance rules, real-time transaction monitoring, freezing protocols, and systems that allow them to respond quickly when police request help. Companies need to build dedicated teams like Binance’s FIU and give them the power and tools to step in fast because delays can mean the difference between saving millions or losing everything. Criminals are also aware that the law is quickly catching up because digital money leaves receipts that investigators can follow, even months or years after a crime. Victims can now hope for better policies and measures to protect their money. However, while Binance proved that crypto could stop cross-border abducting, allowing more people to see it as a tool and not a threat, another deep question arises: Can crypto consistently help stop it?

He argues that increased liquidity, low transaction costs , and staking rewards offer SOL an edge over other cryptocurrencies in the treasury asset space. While Bitcoin remains the dominant crypto treasury asset, popularized by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, Shinske believes Solana offers more efficient, scalable solutions for institutional finance, especially as the industry explores tokenized securities. “With increased liquidity making it easier to raise capital, Solana treasury companies can follow the ‘Saylor playbook’ and raise capital at a premium to NAV, purchase SOL, and increase SOL-per-share,” Shinske said Solana-linked firms surge as Shinske flags $250M capital potential Shinske pointed to several firms poised to benefit from Solana’s cachet. DeFi Development Corp. , a blockchain protocol and SOL treasury company came out as the number one choice. With the firm’s US capital markets access and a crypto-native leadership team, the firm is expected to raise $250 million annually at an average premium of 250% to net asset value (NAV). Nasdaq-listed Upexi Inc., an e-commerce company, was also estimated to raise $250 million yearly, even though it has less presence in the Solana ecosystem. SOL Strategies Inc ., a Canadian operation, is another company on the cusp of getting listed in the US and is anticipated to raise the same amount at a 250% premium. Shinske commended the company’s forward-looking approach toward SOL despite a more passive approach to acquiring SOL on the open market. Those companies’ stock rallied on the news, with DeFi Development surging as much as 19% on Monday. Upexi soared 12%, and SOL Strategies rose 9.4%. Staking edge positions Solana treasury firms for faster growth than Bitcoin peers Unlike Bitcoin, Solana allows token holders to stake their assets directly to validate transactions, earning rewards in the process—without diluting equity. This, Shinske says, gives SOL treasury firms a structural advantage. “Combining staking with treasury operations should result in Solana treasury companies growing SOL/share faster than BTC treasury companies growing BTC/share, all else equal,” he wrote. Although SOL remains more volatile than Bitcoin and currently has a lower total value locked (TVL) than Ethereum, Shinske sees it as a potential frontrunner in the evolving treasury asset market. SOL is currently trading around $157, a 19% drop on the year. By contrast, Ethereum (ETH) is nursing 21% losses and changing hands for $2,644, while Bitcoin is up 14% for the period and is exchanging hands for $107,597. Even in the face of market headwinds, Cantor Fitzgerald’s endorsement puts Solana treasury companies in pole position as a new means of crypto exposure, particularly for the investors who can’t go straight to the source or custody a digital asset themselves.

This is up from the current 25%. This change encourages chip manufacturers to invest more in new facilities before the tax benefit runs out at the end of 2026. It will also boost a subsidy for chipmakers to build factories in the US. Chip makers count on the Senate for the fate of the Chips Act President Joe Biden signed the Chips and Science Act in 2022. This was one of the main pillars of his domestic policy, aiming to use government support to reverse a shift in semiconductor production from the United States to Asia. It offered $39 billion in grants and as much as $75 billion in loans, but the biggest advantage of the law was its 25% tax credit for projects. The biggest beneficiaries include Intel Corp., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Samsung Electronics Co., and Micron Technology Inc. The tax credits are likely the largest portion of Chips Act incentives issued to any company in nearly all cases. In the meantime, Trump has urged repeal of the Chips Act, even if lawmakers of both parties have exhibited little enthusiasm for getting rid of subsidies that lead to high-paying jobs in their districts. On the other hand, in place of the legislation, officials from the administration, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, are renegotiating deals with semiconductor makers to negotiate larger investments without new taxpayer funding. The Senators aim to send the tax bill — which would deliver trillions of dollars in tax cuts for households and businesses — to Trump’s desk by July 4. Additionally, the bill is expected to be revised in the Senate before being put to a floor vote. The House must also approve the final version before it can become law. Trump firmly supports his tariff policies as effective in increasing investment in the US President Donald Trump’s trade war and his push to bring manufacturing back to American shores threaten one of his predecessor’s signature achievements: the Chips and Science Act. The bipartisan law is Washington’s $52 billion effort to boost the American semiconductor industry. This plan aims to lessen the United States’ dependence on Asia for the tiny parts essential to today’s economy, as they are used in everything from smartphones to missiles. The Chips Act has prompted nearly $450 billion in promises to create factories in the United States — nearly $10 in private-sector investment for every $1 spent by the government. Despite this, Trump has complained that the program is a “waste” of taxpayer funds, calling it a “horrible, horrible thing” in remarks to Congress. Additionally, the president maintains that tariffs are more effective than subsidies in spurring investment in the US. He has also hinted he would levy fresh import duties on semiconductors “down the road.” Therefore, according to him, these are enough reasons for the Republicans, who hold majorities in both chambers, to repeal the law. However, there are indications that Trump sees import taxes and direct funding as options that can work together. In support of this, a month after he suggested getting rid of the Chips Act, he signed an executive order to create a new office. This office will manage the Chips Act funds and try to negotiate “better deals” than those made by the Biden administration. This shows he might want to put his mark on the program instead of completely eliminating it. Lutnick urges other companies to follow TSMC’s lead Howard Lutnick said at his January confirmation hearing that he plans to take a look at the Chips Act awards given out under the Biden administration and ensure he receives what he refers to as the “benefit of the bargain.” A new group in the Commerce Department, known as the United States Investment Accelerator, is now taking on the review role. Trump established this office in March with an executive order that “aims to negotiate much better deals” than Biden’s. The main goal for Trump’s team is to encourage more announcements like TSMC’s, which said in March it would invest an extra $100 billion in US plants. This adds to a previous commitment of $65 billion — all without increasing its Chips Act grants. Both Trump and Lutnick believe that the threat of tariffs influenced this decision, while TSMC pointed out that strong market demand drove its growth in the US.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Analysis As Asia begins its trading day, Tron DAO's TRX token is trading flat, up 1%. Crypto traders don't seem to be making much out of a recent announcement that Tron – for all intents and purposes – is 'going public' on the NASDAQ via a reverse merger with SRM Entertainment, a lightly traded Nasdaq-listed toy company that is now rebranding as “Tron Inc.” complete with a TRX treasury strategy. While a blockchain going public might be a little different than what traditional investors are used to, in theory, this might be a stablecoin infrastructure play. The proposed public vehicle would give equity traders access to a network that is home to 30% of all stablecoin transactions ( according to DeFi Llama data ) occur, and where half of all USDT in circulation live . In contrast, while Circle is a regulated issuer of USDC, a fiat-backed stablecoin, Tron Inc. would likely provide investors with indirect exposure to a blockchain network that facilitates a significant portion of global stablecoin activity in both the crypto market and the fast-growing global south, where the population is skeptical of the existing banking system. Unlike Circle, which does not control the infrastructure on which USDC circulates, Tron operates the network itself. This is where the two business models differ: Tron captures transaction fees and on-chain activity directly, whereas Circle’s business model is centered on custody, compliance, and interest income on the reserves backing USDC. On-chain data shows that the Tron network hosts massive whale activities, with a recent note from CryptoQuant pointing out that 59% of May’s USDT volume on Tron came from transactions over $1 million. Tron is also the network of choice for countries where the local populace doesn't trust the existing banking system, from Lebanon to Argentina and Brazil. As CoinDesk reported earlier , users in these emerging and underbanked markets typically equite dollar access directly with using Tether on Tron, rather than thinking in terms of stablecoins or blockchain protocols more broadly. While the market reaction has been muted, investors with experience in fintech or infrastructure plays may recognize the pattern. Visa’s IPO in 2008, following MasterCard’s debut in 2006, allowed public markets to gain exposure to the payment rails of the developed world. The health of the western consumer and their desire to spend pushed fees through the respective networks and dividends into investors' pockets. In China, UnionPay never went public, and so equity investors have pinned their hopes on Ant Group’s long-awaited IPO to access Alipay’s rails just as Tencent's listing gave exposure to WeChat Pay. While some once speculated that virtual yuan infrastructure might power commerce in the global south, that thesis has not materialized. Instead, commerce in underbanked regions is increasingly conducted in stablecoins and largely over Tron’s infrastructure. If that trend holds, Tron Inc. may become the most direct public-market proxy for the payment rails of emerging markets. Hong Kong’s First Solana Public Equity Listing Facilitated by OSL OSL has facilitated what appears to be the first Solana (SOL) treasury allocation by a Hong Kong-listed company, enabling MemeStrategy (2440.HK), a digital asset venture backed by 9GAG, to purchase 2,440 SOL through its platform. The acquisition of 2,440 SOL, worth approximately $370,000, was completed using OSL’s institutional platform, which provided execution, settlement, and custody services. $1.9B Inflows Cement Crypto as 2025’s Risk-On Favorite: CoinShares Digital asset investment products pulled in $1.9 billion last week, marking the ninth straight week of inflows, according to a recent report from CoinShares. That brings 2025’s year-to-date total to a record $13.2 billion, suggesting institutional appetite for crypto remains strong despite geopolitical volatility. While broader markets showed caution, capital rotated into both digital assets and gold, traditionally seen as uncorrelated safe havens, hinting at crypto’s evolving role as part of a macro hedge strategy. Bitcoin led the charge with $1.3 billion in inflows, snapping a two-week stretch of minor outflows. Ethereum followed with $583 million, the highest weekly total since February, and including its strongest single-day inflow this year. Together, the top two crypto assets accounted for over 95% of weekly inflows. But activity wasn’t limited to the majors: XRP reversed three weeks of outflows with $11.8 million in new capital, and Sui continued its hot streak with $3.5 million in inflows, a sign that select altcoins are gaining traction among professional allocators. Regionally, the United States was responsible for virtually all inflows, while Hong Kong and Brazil posted net outflows of $56.8 million and $8.5 million, respectively. These regional divergences underscore the uneven pace of crypto adoption globally, despite total flows reaching historic highs. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin surged past $108,000 with a 3.6% daily gain, showing strong resilience amid Middle East tensions as low exchange reserves and high volume pushed prices toward a key resistance level. ETH: Ethereum jumped nearly 7% to $2,671 as whales accumulated $3.8 billion worth of ETH and spot ETFs recorded 16 consecutive days of inflows, driving strong breakout momentum above key resistance levels. Gold: Gold fell below $3,400 to $3,383 despite ongoing Middle East tensions, as analysts point to a looming U.S. debt ceiling crisis, not geopolitics, as the key driver for precious metals. Nikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.21% in early trade Tuesday as Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed, with investors watching for the Bank of Japan’s policy decision and hopeful signs of de-escalation from Iran. S&P 500: The S&P 500 closed at 6,033.11, up 0.94%, as easing oil prices and hopes that the Israel-Iran conflict will remain contained boosted investor sentiment.

Ethereum is showing fresh signs of strength, pushing for a move past $4,000 as DeFi activity returns. At the same time, Pi Network’s market buzz is cooling after Binance decided not to list the token, despite strong support from users. In the middle of this shift, Web3 ai is drawing serious interest at $0.000422, helped by upcoming tools like its Crypto Lending & Borrowing Advisor. As hype-based coins start to lose ground and more focus shifts to utility-driven platforms, Ethereum’s role in DeFi keeps it high on many watchlists. Still, for those looking for bigger gains from a low entry, Web3 ai stands out. With a growing AI toolset and a forecasted 1,747% return, it is being looked at as a possible best long term crypto choice. Pi Network Stumbles After Missed Listing Chance The Pi Network is losing its recent momentum after the long-expected Binance listing failed to happen. Even with strong backing in community votes, Binance did not move forward, disappointing many PI holders. This result has slowed the PI market reaction, with trading volume falling and less interest showing up across exchanges. Missing a spot on one of the top global exchanges has created doubt about Pi’s progress and future plans. Experts point out that most of Pi’s buzz has come from community excitement, not actual product results. With energy fading, many traders are taking a second look at their positions. Though Pi is still a known name, the lack of real tools or DeFi use makes it harder to hold in a market now focused more on real-world use. As Pi continues to cool down, attention is shifting to projects with clear goals and working products. Ethereum Pushes Higher as $4,000 Level Comes Into Focus Ethereum is showing more signs of growth as it becomes stronger again in the DeFi space. Reports say Ethereum handled over $480 billion in stablecoin volume last month, much of it powered by trading bots. This spike proves Ethereum is still a key platform for DeFi, pulling in users and builders alike. Its supply setup also looks solid. Since the merge, Ethereum burns more than it creates, and this has helped make it one of the most balanced tokens in terms of supply. These signs help support the view that Ethereum could move past $4,000 soon. Chart watchers point to higher lows and strong moving average recovery as signs that Ethereum is building power. For those holding long-term, Ethereum remains one of the most trusted names in crypto. Its strong user base and high developer interest make it a steady option in a wider plan. Web3 ai Attracts Attention with $0.000422 Price and Practical Tools As Pi loses momentum and Ethereum holds firm, Web3 ai is standing out to those searching for the best long term crypto entry point in 2025. Now in Stage 08 of its presale, Web3 ai has collected over $7.8 million and sold 22 billion tokens at a base price of $0.000422. Its appeal isn’t based on hype, but on working tools like the soon-to-launch Crypto Lending & Borrowing Advisor. This AI-based tool is designed to boost returns on platforms such as Aave, Compound, and Venus. It will review live lending rates, compare lock-up times, study platform fees, and send alerts when user collateral is at risk of being liquidated. With its automation layer, it can also reinvest returns into top-performing pools, allowing earnings to grow without constant action. What makes Web3 ai different is how it builds safety into its system. Before recommending any lending platform, it checks for past audits, scans for contract bugs, and looks at failure points. These checks are key in 2025 as many DeFi users still worry about hacks and disappearing liquidity. The Crypto Lending & Borrowing Advisor will support Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon at launch, which are three of the busiest DeFi platforms. Users will get regular suggestions based on their goals, whether they want quick APY gains or slow and steady lending. In a market where making passive income matters more than chasing price spikes, Web3 ai is stepping into a real-world role. Where the Crypto Market Is Moving Next Crypto in 2025 is moving away from hype and toward projects that deliver working features. Ethereum continues to show bullish strength as DeFi use rises and its supply model improves. At the same time, Pi is losing steam as its expected progress falls short and its network lacks real tools. On the other hand, Web3 ai is showing signs of real growth. With a low entry price, working AI tools, and a clear goal for the future, it is gaining attention. With $7.8 million already raised, a 1,747% ROI forecast at listing, and the Crypto Lending & Borrowing Advisor set to launch, Web3 ai is shaping up as one of the best long term crypto choices in this cycle.

Ethereum (ETH) is approaching a breakout that could carry it to $4,000, while Avalanche (AVAX) has dropped under $21, aiming at its previous $15.28 low from March. These movements reflect the ongoing shifts in popular crypto coins. Yet away from the spotlight, a different project is steadily capturing attention. Unstaked, a crypto project powered by AI, has collected over $10 million in its presale so far. With no private allocation, intelligent governance, and a price target of $0.1819 at launch, which is significantly higher than the current $0.011397, Unstaked is becoming a top contender for those tracking emerging high-upside crypto coins. ETH Price Outlook: Is $4,000 in Reach? ETH is currently hovering just below $2,850, a key resistance level at the top of a long-term ascending triangle. Traders are watching this formation closely, as history suggests a breakout could lift prices toward $3,800–$4,000. Looking at wider trends, Ethereum has cleared a major bull flag, which strengthens its upside case. While Bitcoin moves sideways, ETH is gaining on the ETH/BTC chart, often a sign of a broader shift toward altcoins. Chart analyst Titan of Crypto points out that as long as ETH remains above the breakout zone, a rally toward new highs is on the table. In the past day, ETH trading volume jumped by nearly 47%, and RSI readings suggest the rally has room left. A strong close above $2,850 this week could turn the $4K price from a hopeful scenario into a realistic target. AVAX Slides Toward $15 as ETF Decision Gets Delayed Unlike ETH, Avalanche (AVAX) is under strong selling pressure. Its price has dropped 13.49% this week, slipping below the February low of $20.20 and now sitting at $20.07, its lowest in more than three months. This sharp fall is linked to the SEC’s delay in ruling on Grayscale’s AVAX ETF, which is now postponed until July 15. What was supposed to fuel optimism instead created uncertainty. The impact shows in Avalanche’s DeFi data, with total value locked dropping by $108 million in three days, from $1.581 billion to $1.473 billion. Technically, AVAX has exited a descending triangle, consistently posting lower highs since April and failing to hold the $21 level. A fall below $19.50 could pull the price further down to $15.28, nearly wiping out its yearly gains. Currently, over 90% of AVAX holders are in the red, and net outflows from exchanges have surpassed $4.34 million, highlighting weak sentiment. Unstaked’s $0.011397 Presale and 27x Launch Forecast Draw Attention While the top coins ride their respective waves, Unstaked is rapidly gaining traction as one of the most-watched upcoming crypto launches. Its crypto presale has reached stage 20, raising over $10 million and selling 1 billion coins at $0.011397 each. What stands out is the planned listing price of $0.1819, offering a potential 27x upside. Unstaked’s design centers on an AI-based model called Proof of Intelligence, where algorithms adjust network actions in real time. Instead of fixed coding structures or privileged leadership teams, the system evolves through user data, decentralized learning, and feedback-driven loops. The community plays a major role in this process. Decision-making happens through AI-assisted proposals and weighted on-chain voting. Every participant’s input is optimized for better outcomes, showing how the project values true engagement. There is also complete public distribution, no coins are set aside for private buyers or insiders. This approach removes backdoor manipulation and ensures alignment between the builders and the wider community from the start. Unstaked is also running a $1M giveaway, where 20 winners will receive $50,000 each in $UNSD. To qualify, participants must complete various tasks, share socially, and purchase a minimum of $100 in tokens. The campaign spans five months, offering a combination of activity-based rewards and community-driven excitement. With the listing approaching and only a few stages remaining, the pace is picking up. Those seeking strong upside and early access are eyeing Unstaked not only for its pricing potential but for its tech-driven approach. It’s important to note that while the platform’s AI agents are part of the plan, they will only become active post-launch, once the presale ends. In a Nutshell! All in all, Ethereum is gearing up for a potential rally while Avalanche battles continued losses. However, Unstaked is steadily building its story with major presale success. With AI tools, community-powered decisions, and a fully public distribution model, Unstaked brings something different to the crypto market: a clear use case, pricing clarity, and forward progress. As major projects face external headwinds, Unstaked could emerge as the quiet frontrunner in this new cycle.

46176002,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=772327,1750125649,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/46176002.jpeg,"Bitcoin To $140,00 In 50 Days? Bitwise Bets On War Rally",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-to-14000-in-50-days-bitwise/,"Bitwise Asset Management’s European research arm argues that the sharp sell-off that followed last week’s military escalation between Iran and Israel is likely to give way to a powerful relief rally in Bitcoin, echoing the cryptocurrency’s behaviour after earlier geopolitical shocks. In its 16 June weekly newsletter Bitwise Europe points to a “Chart of the Week” that lines up the twenty most significant geopolitical risk events since July 2010 and finds that, on average, Bitcoin was “up 31.2 percent fifty days after the event, with a median gain of 10.2 percent.” According to the authors, “major geopolitical risk events tend to be good buying opportunities for bitcoin and other crypto assets.” The firm’s in-house Crypto Asset Sentiment Index briefly turned negative on Friday—its first dip below zero since May—but had already swung back into slightly bullish territory by Monday morning, a shift Bitwise attributes to renewed inflows into spot exchange-traded products and continued US-dollar weakness. At Bitcoin’s current price of around $107,000, a 31% rally would bring it to approximately $140,000. Missiles Fly, Bitcoin To $140,000? The historical analogue is being tested in real time as markets digest the first open exchange of missiles between Tehran and Jerusalem. The Associated Press reports that Iran has fired more than 370 projectiles at Israel since 13 June, killing at least twenty-four people, while Israel claims to have destroyed over 120 Iranian launchers and says it now enjoys “full aerial superiority over Tehran.” Related Reading: Bitcoin 656% Cyclical Gain Highlights Deep Market Demand – Glassnode The confrontation triggered a textbook flight to safety: gold blasted through $3,430 an ounce on Friday, establishing a fresh record high, while Brent crude spiked and global equities lurched lower. Bitcoin, which had been flirting with its all-time peak near $111,000 early last week, sank as low as $102,600 during the first wave of air-strike headlines before rebounding to the $106,000–107,000 zone. Even after that drawdown, Bitwise notes, the flagship cryptocurrency still out-performed the S&P 500 on a weekly basis thanks to a late-week equity swoon. Bitwise’s thesis rests on three pillars. First is behavioural: previous geopolitical shocks—from Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea to the US–Iran standoff of January 2020—produced knee-jerk liquidations in risk assets, yet Bitcoin’s selling pressure tended to exhaust quickly, setting the stage for a mean-reversion pop. Second is macroeconomic. Related Reading: Bitcoin Future Post Israel-Iran Event: On-Chain Analysis Disputes BTC’s $50K Crash The firm highlights a “pronounced depreciation of the US Dollar,” as the DXY index slid to its weakest level since March 2022 following softer-than-expected inflation prints and another uptick in continuing unemployment claims. Fed-funds futures now imply 1.9 rate cuts by December 2025, loosening global financial conditions and historically favourable for non-yielding, dollar-denominated assets such as Bitcoin. Third is structural demand: US spot Bitcoin ETFs took in a net $1.37 billion last week, while corporate treasuries kept accumulating—Strategy’s Michael Saylor announced the acquisition of 10,100 BTC for $1.05 billion today , and Tokyo-listed Metaplanet disclosed an additional 1,112 BTC purchase that brings its war chest to 10,000 coins. In derivatives, Bitwise flags that the put-call open-interest ratio on Bitcoin options ended the week at 0.61 after dipping to 0.55, while the one-month 25-delta skew flipped decisively into positive territory at +4.87 percent, indicating a premium for upside exposure despite realised volatility languishing around 30 percent. Funding rates on perpetual swaps also remained net long even during Thursday’s risk-off purge, a pattern the firm interprets as “bullish positioning or demand for topside hedging.” Behind the scenes, whales withdrew a net 169,527 BTC from exchanges, and exchange-held reserves fell to 2.92 million coins—about 14.6 percent of supply—further tightening spot liquidity. Sceptics may note that past performance is not predictive and that the explosive rally following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine was fuelled in part by unprecedented monetary stimulus that may not be replicated. Bitwise itself concedes that realised losses spiked to $55.5 million on-chain last week and that momentum in “apparent demand” has softened. Yet the firm argues that the confluence of structural inflows, dollar weakness and depressed sentiment mirrors the set-ups that preceded its historical sample of 31-percent rallies. As the newsletter concludes, “structural demand by both ETPs and corporate treasuries as well as continued macro tailwinds via Dollar weakness and global money supply expansion still support a positive market development for bitcoin and crypto assets.” At press time, BTC traded at $107,239.

Two projects broadcasting both value and vision are Kaspa and Qubetics. While Kaspa’s steady climb is drawing attention from data-driven analysts, Qubetics is charting a different course, aiming to solve blockchain’s biggest bottleneck: interoperability. As projections for 2030 circulate and crypto presales gather steam, these two networks stand out for distinct reasons. Kaspa’s high-throughput consensus and data availability innovations offer tangible performance metrics for price speculation. Meanwhile, Qubetics is advancing as a Web3-aggregated chain, aiming at seamless connections across decentralized systems. This article dives deep into Kaspa price prediction 2030, followed by a comprehensive look at Qubetics’ interoperability feature, token supply update, and real-world forecasts for $TICS post-launch. Kaspa Price Prediction 2030: A Year-by-Year Surge to the $0.70 Mark Kaspa’s evolution has positioned it as a high-performance Layer 1 network focused on scalability without compromising decentralization. Analysts tracking long-term performance suggest the Kaspa price prediction for 2030 may offer surprising strength across all quarters. In January 2030, the minimum projected price for KAS stands at $0.425. Its average price is expected to hover around $0.437, with a potential ceiling at $0.504. These estimates reflect conservative market confidence, boosted by Kaspa’s ability to handle fast confirmation times. February follows with a minor uptick—minimum price predicted at $0.441, an average of $0.453, and a possible high of $0.522. March continues the trend with a base of $0.457 and an average monthly figure of $0.469. If upward momentum holds, KAS may top $0.540. April is forecasted at $0.472 to $0.558, while May climbs slightly higher, averaging $0.502 with a possible peak at $0.576. Mid-year gains seem consistent. June sees projected ranges between $0.504 and $0.594. By July, predictions hit $0.520 at the minimum, $0.535 on average, and up to $0.611 at the high end. August builds on the trend with an average forecast of $0.551. Entering the fall, Kaspa’s value may cross into mainstream speculation territory. September and October are forecasted at maximum highs of $0.647 and $0.665, respectively. November’s forecast jumps to $0.683, while December potentially finishes the year at a high of $0.701. Kaspa’s year-round average price for 2030 is projected to be $0.6167, with a minimum around $0.5999 and a potential annual ROI as high as 830.9%—a figure drawing strong attention across blockchain trading desks and modeling analysts. Qubetics: High Interoperability to Connect Blockchains While Kaspa’s strength lies in speed and scalability, Qubetics is setting its foundation on a more ambitious layer: interoperability. In an area where most blockchains operate in silos, Qubetics is positioning itself as the connective tissue of the decentralized internet. Its architecture supports seamless interactions between blockchains, tokens, and DApps—including legacy giants like Bitcoin. Current chains often struggle to share data or transfer assets without cumbersome bridges or centralized workarounds. Qubetics aims to remove these issues by offering native-level compatibility and frictionless cross-chain execution. By enabling different protocols to speak the same language, Qubetics creates a composable ecosystem where apps can scale and interoperate, regardless of their origin chain. Such a setup doesn’t just aid developers. It creates smoother user experiences across wallets, DeFi protocols, and decentralized identity layers. Qubetics Crypto Presale: Scarcity Meets Acceleration The Qubetics presale is in its final public stage—Stage 37—and momentum is accelerating. With the token priced at $0.3370, over $18 million has already been raised. More than 515 million $TICS tokens have been sold, and the total number of token holders now exceeds 28,000. A major tokenomics update has drastically reduced the total supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion. This redesign enhances scarcity while increasing the public allocation to 38.55%. That shift empowers the wider community, putting more governance and rewards directly in the hands of $TICS holders. With less than 10 million tokens remaining in the final tranche, analysts are forecasting a 20% jump at listing. Qubetics Price Predictions: A $15,000 Allocation in Perspective Allocating $15,000 to $TICS at today’s crypto presale rate of $0.3370 would secure approximately 44,504 tokens. If the listing price rises to $0.40, that portfolio would be worth $17,801—an instant gain of nearly 18.7%. Should the price surge to $1, the same tokens would be valued at $44,504. At $5 per token, the value would spike to $222,520. In more aggressive growth scenarios, where $TICS hits $10 after mainnet and ecosystem integrations mature, the value becomes $445,040. At a post-mainnet valuation of $15, the original $15,000 would translate to $667,560. That’s a 4,349% ROI based on a forecasted mainnet price point, powered by both the scarcity mechanics and the projected utility of its interoperable framework. These forecasts are speculative and depend on market adoption, liquidity conditions, and continued project execution. However, analysts are increasingly confident due to strong presale performance and a transparent development roadmap. Conclusion: A Future Fueled by Cross-Chain Collaboration and Scalable Infrastructure Kaspa and Qubetics are prime examples of the dual trajectory of the blockchain space: one rooted in optimizing internal performance and another focused on external connectivity. Kaspa’s consistent growth and efficient architecture position it as a key contender for gradual, high-confidence value appreciation by 2030. Qubetics, meanwhile, offers a different kind of value—one rooted in network unification. By providing native interoperability across decentralized systems, it lays the groundwork for a truly aggregated Web3 experience. For those tracking both scalability and connectivity, Kaspa and Qubetics represent complementary avenues in a decentralized future.

The deal dramatically reduces tariffs on British exports and expands the US access to key UK markets. The executive order, signed just hours after a brief meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Canada, is expected to “operationalize” the agreement. Central to the deal is reducing the US automotive tariff from 27.5% to 10% for the first 100,000 UK-manufactured vehicles shipped to the American market annually. “This is a very good day for both of our countries, a real sign of strength,” Starmer said, confirming the new terms will immediately take effect. The agreement also shields British exports of jet engines and other aerospace components from US tariffs linked to a national security investigation Trump had launched into the aerospace sector. That exemption hinges on UK commitments to exclude China from sensitive defense and technology supply chains. Tariff relief spurs industry divides as UK bioethanol, steel sectors raise alarm While industries such as automotive and aerospace are celebrating the deal, the agreement has provoked controversy in other sectors. The UK has granted the US a tariff-free quota of 1.4 billion liters of ethanol, equivalent to the country’s entire annual demand. UK bioethanol producers have warned the decision threatens the viability of domestic production. Britain also agreed to enhance market access for American beef and industrial goods in exchange for the US tariff cuts. Negotiations regarding the treatment of UK steel and aluminum are still ongoing. The trade deal promises to eliminate US tariffs on these exports, but technical and legal hurdles have delayed implementation. British officials say they are still working with the US to finalize a quota system that would allow UK steelmakers to sidestep the 25% global steel tariff imposed by Trump under national security provisions. The situation is further complicated by US rules that require steel to be “melted and poured” in the country of origin to qualify for tariff relief—criteria that much of Britain’s steel, which is reprocessed from imported material, does not meet. As negotiations continue, Trump has offered the UK a temporary exemption from his newly doubled global steel tariff of 50%, giving time to resolve the issues. Starmer pushes rapid rollout as UK industries react to landmark US trade deal Under mounting pressure at home to secure relief for industries battered by tariffs, Starmer emphasized the importance of swift implementation. The UK automobile sector, in particular, has applauded the car tariff reduction, calling it a much-needed boost for exports amid economic uncertainty. Despite objections from the UK’s bioethanol industry, the trade pact marks one of the most comprehensive bilateral deals between the two nations in recent years and a shift in transatlantic economic relations. “We just signed it, and it’s done,” Trump told reporters, adding that the agreement reflects a new chapter in US-UK cooperation.

According to a filing dated June 16, 2025, the SEC submitted a status report to the court, requesting that the appeals stay on hold until at least August 15, 2025, when they’ll provide another update. This move comes as Ripple and the SEC continue working through a possible settlement that could reshape the outcome of the long-running case. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP In light of the pending motion for an indicative ruling, the parties have requested that the Second Circuit continue to hold the appeals in abeyance, with the @SECGov to file a status report by August 15, 2025. https://t.co/7oQvL5Rx7U — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) June 17, 2025 Earlier this year, both sides reached an agreement in principle to settle the case, but it requires the district court’s approval to modify the final judgment. Under the proposed deal, Ripple would pay a reduced penalty of $50 million, down from $125 million, with the remaining funds returned to Ripple. The SEC would also agree to lift the injunction against the company. However, a previous motion for this change was denied by the district court in May because it didn’t explain why “exceptional circumstances” justified the modification. Ripple and the SEC have since filed a new joint motion on June 12, providing additional reasons and requesting an indicative ruling from the court. Until that decision is made, both Ripple and the SEC agree it’s best to keep the appeals paused. If the district court grants their request, both sides would then ask the Second Circuit for a limited remand to finalize the settlement. On the flip side, XRP price gained 7% and hit a high of $2.34 before hitting a reverse.

That number marks the highest level since last year. It shows that many traders are using borrowed funds to bet on where Ethereum will go next. Price Tests Multi‑Year Resistance ETH rose about 4.5% in a single session. Based on technical charts, that rally pushed ETH right up to a long‑standing descending trendline. Investors have watched that line for over a year. It sits just above the 50‑week moving average, while the 200‑week average lies just below. If ETH can clear and hold above these levels, it may signal room to run. But weak trading volume could mean bulls need more firepower before taking charge. ETF Flows Show Steady Support US spot funds tied to Ethereum saw a small outflow of $2.18 million on the same day, marking the first net withdrawal in 19 days. Yet weekly inflows still totaled $528.12 million, pushing total assets under management in these ETFs beyond $10 billion. Institutional Backing Expands ETH Reach Major asset managers are also getting more creative with Ethereum. Companies such as BlackRock and Fidelity have begun rolling out tokenized treasury products and stablecoin‑backed funds that link directly to ETH.

They support the notion that Ethereum is not only capable of fueling DeFi tests, but also applications in the real world. Ethereum Drift Remains Steady Before Potential Ripples Meanwhile, market statistics shows Ethereum traded calmly at $2,630 on June 16, showing a 4% increase in the last 24 hours. Futures markets are warming up, with volumes rising steeply as large players pour into ETH-based contracts. Speculative positions usually foretell choppy action. As increasing amounts of money move into leveraged positions, even modest moves in price can cause forced liquidations—sometimes on both the long and short sides. When that occurs, volatility increases. That is to say, today’s tranquil chart can become jagged quickly once those mammoth bets begin to be unravel.

This comes as the network’s on-chain metrics show strength, with staking addresses topping 1.3M. Analysts are watching to see if the internal friction will impact the ADA token’s price. Cardano (ADA) is facing a moment of truth. Once propelled by strong narratives like the promise of $ADA ETFs, the launch of Bitcoin DeFi, and advancements like Midnight, recent discussions have taken a sharp turn. According to analyst Dan Gambardello, the blockchain needs an urgent narrative reset to avoid derailment. Headlines suggest ADA may be sold for underused stablecoins or converted to Bitcoin. These emerging perspectives are gaining traction, yet many in the community, including Gambardello himself, strongly disagree. The concern is that these new directions are not only unconvincing but risk undermining the network’s hard-won progress at a crucial time in the market cycle. Cardano needs a narrative reset, fast!

Weekly inflows into digital asset products reached $1.9 billion, extending a nine-week positive trend. Altogether, inflows during this streak hit $12.9 billion, with year-to-date figures now at a record $13.2 billion. According to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report , Bitcoin bounced back strongly last week after two weeks of minor outflows as it attracted $1.3 billion in fresh inflows. Short-bitcoin funds also registered slight inflows of $3.7 million, although their total assets under management stayed low at $96 million. Ethereum continued its upward trajectory, with inflows of $583 million – the highest since February – including its strongest daily inflow during that time. The latest surge brings Ethereum’s cumulative inflows to $2 billion, which now represents 14% of its total AuM. XRP also saw renewed interest, reversing a three-week outflow trend with $11.8 million in inflows. Sui attracted another $3.5 million. Solana, Cardano, and Chainlink also noted modest inflows of $1.3 million, $0.4 million, and $0.3 million, respectively. On the other hand, multi-asset investment products recorded $14 million in outflows for the fourth consecutive week. Litecoin, too, saw a minor outflow of $0.1 million.

We’re tracking developments regarding the ongoing Iran Israel conflict , a situation with the potential to send ripples through global markets, including the cryptocurrency space. Understanding these geopolitical tensions is crucial for anyone navigating today’s volatile economic landscape. What’s the Latest in the Iran Israel Conflict? According to reports citing Saudi Arabian news channel Al Hadath, relayed via the Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has issued a stark warning. They stated that their attacks will persist unless Israel ceases its own actions against Iran. This declaration underscores a critical point in the current escalation, indicating a potential continuation of hostilities rather than de-escalation. This isn’t just a localized issue; the Middle East conflict has far-reaching implications. Any increase in military activity or rhetoric between these two nations immediately captures the attention of international observers and market participants alike. The history between Iran and Israel is complex and marked by periods of heightened tension, often involving proxy conflicts and regional power struggles. This latest exchange follows a series of events that have brought direct confrontation into sharper focus. The statement from the IRGC is particularly significant because it ties the cessation of their attacks directly to Israel’s actions. This suggests a tit-for-tat dynamic that could be difficult to break, potentially leading to a prolonged period of instability. For investors and analysts, this means factoring in a higher degree of political risk when evaluating market conditions. How Do Geopolitical Tensions Typically Affect Global Markets? When geopolitical tensions rise, financial markets tend to react with uncertainty. This isn’t a new phenomenon; historical events have repeatedly shown that political instability can have a tangible impact on asset prices. Here’s a quick look at common reactions: Safe-Haven Assets: Assets traditionally considered ‘safe havens’ like gold, certain government bonds (like US Treasuries), and sometimes the US dollar, often see increased demand as investors seek refuge from risk. Oil Prices: The Middle East is a major oil-producing region. Any conflict there can disrupt supply or create fears of disruption, leading to spikes in oil prices. This, in turn, can fuel inflation concerns globally. Stock Markets: Equity markets typically react negatively to uncertainty. Sectors perceived as vulnerable to geopolitical risk (e.g., airlines, tourism) might see sharper declines, while defense stocks could see gains. Overall market indices often experience increased volatility. Currency Markets: Currencies of countries perceived as being directly or indirectly involved, or those heavily reliant on affected regions for trade or energy, can experience fluctuations. The current Iran Israel conflict fits squarely into this pattern of risk factors that traders and investors monitor closely. The potential for escalation means these market reactions could be sustained or even amplified depending on how the situation develops. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market Impact? The question on many minds, especially for our readers, is: what is the potential crypto market impact ? The relationship between geopolitical events and cryptocurrency prices is a subject of ongoing debate. Some argue that Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies act as digital safe havens, uncorrelated with traditional financial systems and immune to the direct effects of regional conflicts. The theory is that in times of political or economic turmoil, investors might turn to decentralized assets like Bitcoin as a store of value, especially in regions experiencing capital controls or currency devaluation. We’ve seen instances where local conflicts or economic crises seemed to correlate with increased crypto adoption or price movements in those specific areas. However, the reality is more complex. The crypto market is still heavily influenced by global liquidity, macroeconomic factors, and overall market sentiment. While a major geopolitical shock *could* theoretically drive some investors towards crypto as an alternative, it could also trigger a broader risk-off sentiment where investors sell all ‘risky’ assets, including cryptocurrencies, to move into cash or traditional safe havens. Recent history shows mixed reactions. Sometimes, Bitcoin has rallied during periods of global uncertainty; other times, it has fallen along with stock markets. The narrative of crypto as a safe haven is still being tested and proven over time. With the Middle East conflict involving major regional players like Iran and Israel, the potential for broader economic disruption is significant. This disruption could manifest in various ways, from impacting energy prices to altering trade routes, all of which can indirectly affect investor confidence and market flows, including those into and out of crypto assets. How Can Investors Navigate Rising Geopolitical Tensions? Navigating markets during times of heightened geopolitical tensions requires careful consideration and a focus on long-term strategy rather than panic-driven decisions. Here are a few actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources from various perspectives to get a balanced view of the situation. Avoid relying solely on social media or unverified reports. Understanding the facts is the first step. Review Your Portfolio: Assess your exposure to assets that might be particularly vulnerable to this type of conflict. This applies to both traditional investments and your crypto holdings. Consider Diversification: Ensure your portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes and geographies. This can help mitigate risk if one particular sector or region is heavily impacted. Risk Management: Have a clear risk management strategy. This might involve setting stop-loss orders or reducing leverage if you are trading. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Long-Term Perspective: Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term news cycles. Geopolitical events can cause temporary volatility, but the long-term fundamentals of an investment should be the primary driver of your strategy. Understand Crypto’s Role: While the potential crypto market impact is debated, understand that crypto is still a volatile asset class. It might not behave as a guaranteed safe haven in all scenarios. The statement from the IRGC about the Iran Israel conflict is a reminder that external factors can significantly influence market dynamics. While we focus on the crypto world, it exists within a larger global economic and political context. Looking Ahead: Uncertainty in Global Markets The immediate future remains uncertain as long as the tit-for-tat dynamic between Iran and Israel continues. The statement from the IRGC, as reported, suggests that de-escalation is contingent on Israel’s actions. This puts the ball back in Israel’s court, potentially setting the stage for further responses and counter-responses. The impact on global markets will depend on the severity and duration of any further conflict. A limited exchange might cause temporary jitters, while a more significant escalation could lead to sustained volatility and potentially impact economic growth forecasts. For the crypto market impact , the coming days and weeks will be telling. Will Bitcoin react as a safe haven, or will it follow traditional risk assets? The answer likely depends on the broader macroeconomic environment and the specific nature of the geopolitical events unfolding. In conclusion, the latest development in the Iran Israel conflict , with Iran vowing to continue attacks unless provoked, is a critical piece of news for anyone monitoring global stability and market reactions. The interconnectedness of the world means that geopolitical tensions in one region can have ripple effects far and wide, influencing everything from oil prices to the performance of digital assets. Staying informed and maintaining a disciplined investment approach are key during these turbulent times.

Miners Strengthen U.S. Market Control; BTC Supported According to JPMorgan, U.S.-listed miners now control 31.5% of the global Bitcoin hashrate—the highest share on record. Riot Platforms, Hive Technologies, and CleanSpark lead the charge, with a combined 99% year-on-year increase in hashrate capacity. Meanwhile, network growth stood at 55%.

This shift consolidates institutional infrastructure in North America, supporting the argument that Bitcoin is maturing into a fully fledged asset class. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Bulls Lose Grip at $108,950 Bitcoin is currently trading at $106,647, down 0.52% on the day. The 1-hour chart shows BTC retreating from symmetrical triangle resistance near $108,951.

As the market increases, funding rounds and mergers or acquisitions play a strong role in supporting new ideas, uniting companies and making the industry bigger. The current state of crypto funding Money from venture capital in cryptocurrencies has gone through significant changes, both showing its promise and how much it can fluctuate. Crypto funding rose to record levels in 2021 and 2022, and then experienced a decline in 2023 before signs of rebound appeared. Blockchain companies go through various funding phases, such as seed funding when they start out, and much larger Series C and D rounds when they are more developed. Investors are focusing on DeFi (decentralized finance) projects, marketplaces for NFTs (non-fungible tokens), digital asset exchanges, blockchain infrastructure providers and Web 3.0 gaming platforms. Those who manage significant institutional funds are getting more experienced in understanding crypto investments. Firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and Paradigm have launched crypto funds, and investors like Polychain Capital and Pantera Capital are now noted in the industry. Key trends in crypto funding Infrastructure Support for blockchain infrastructure, scaling options, tools that help blockchains connect and methods for developers to use the technology have received significant investment these days. This evidence indicates that industries recognize that good infrastructure plays a major part in encouraging many individuals to use cryptocurrency. Investment Businesses centered on following the proper rules and serving institutions have seen much investment. Among these are keeping records clean, software for following the rules and technology built for large investors. Real-world application People who invest money now often look for projects that offer more than just a chance to profit from increased prices. This category covers supply chain management, digital identity options and data storage networks that don’t depend on a central system. Geographic diversification There is currently more cryptocurrency involvement around the globe since New York and Silicon Valley are joined by Europe, Asia and places like India, which are receiving significant funding. Mergers and acquisitions – Consolidation in a maturing market Competition has increased, and as the crypto market matures, more M&A (mergers and acquisitions) activities are becoming common. Regulatory pressure, the need to grow bigger, technological advances and the uncertain market are reasons for consolidation in the industry. Strategic acquisitions Many cryptocurrencies and blockchain companies have bought smaller firms to add new features, target other regions or acquire vital technology. Deals are usually based on compliance, advanced trading technology or large user numbers. Talent acquisitions Crypto companies seek to purchase developers and experienced blockchain experts. Since the pool of skilled people in blockchain is small, buying talent and employing people with these skills is popular. Cross-industry integrations Many banks and technology companies are acquiring cryptocurrency firms to integrate blockchain technology into their standard services. This trend shows that businesses outside finance are starting to use cryptocurrency technologies. Notable merger and acquisition transactions Certain deals that have taken place in the crypto mergers and acquisitions market have been very influential in the industry. Such deals point to the fact that transactions in the sector are on the rise and fuel speculation about bona fide business deals. Over the recent past, several large trading platforms have purchased small rivals to assist them in entering new markets or broadening their offerings. Blockchain infrastructure providers have also been consolidated to build more end-to-end solution systems. The overlap between TradFi (traditional finance) and crypto has been handy in that it acts as the point of entry into the digital asset ecosystem by big institutions – without which they would need to build their crypto-related business from scratch. Crypto mergers and acquisitions problems Regulatory uncertainty The dynamics of regulations also create a scenario whereby crypto companies struggle to plan and conduct mergers and acquisitions. Firms must deal with varying legislation across different jurisdictions, which could hinder transaction acceptance. Valuation challenges The vast changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies mean that it is difficult to value them appropriately. Conventional methods of valuing assets do not stand a chance of developing specific aspects of crypto assets, tokenized systems and decentralized protocols. Due diligence complexity To review crypto companies, one must be knowledgeable about blockchain technology, token regulation, smart contract safety and law compliance. Owing to this complexity, transaction time and transaction costs may increase. Cultural difference Crypto companies also tend to believe in a culture of decentralization and community-driven, which is challenging to combine in a typical corporation. The role of tokenomics in funding and mergers and acquisitions A special feature of crypto funding is the use of tokens, which serve purposes such as fundraising, network management and transactions within cryptocurrency systems. Therefore, new ways of raising money have appeared, such as ICOs (initial coin offerings), STOs (security token offerings) and lately, IDOs (initial DEX offerings). Using tokens for funding raises both positive points and challenges. Its cost-effective fundraising and building of user-based communities might be outweighed by the extra regulations and possible disputes between those with crypto assets and those with shares in a business. Adding tokens complicates mergers and acquisition transactions. Acquirers have to look into the economics of the company’s tokens, any possible regulatory outcomes and the responses of the blockchain community to the change in ownership. Examining the possible trends and outcomes Increase institutional participation – As regulations become clearer, more institutional investors may join the crypto funding space, which can lead to larger project funding and better-organized management. Regulatory-driven consolidation – Regulation changes could make it more attractive for large and well-financed companies, leading to more industry concentrations. Cross-chain integration – When it becomes easier for platforms to communicate across blockchain networks, more mergers and acquisition will aim to merge different blockchain systems. Traditional finance integration – Traditional finance and crypto are becoming more mixed as more companies from both areas work and team up. Conclusion The way cryptocurrency companies get funding and merge shows that the industry is changing from its early days to becoming a mature financial field. Even with obstacles such as unsure regulations and markets, investors are becoming more knowledgeable. Infrastructure improvement and involvement with traditional finance ridgelines are likely to continue driving the industry’s growth. You must manage regulations, study each opportunity closely and understand how blockchain and tokens work in this market. As the industry matures, activity related to funding and various mergers may determine the future of cryptocurrencies. Businesses and investors that organize their activities to fit the rules while staying innovative are most likely to win in this shifting market. As more institutions become involved in these processes, deals will become more complex, and financial integration will grow.

Social media platforms, particularly X (formerly Twitter), became the breeding ground for unverified claims suggesting a potential collaboration involving Eric Trump and a public company with ties to the Tron ecosystem. What Were the Eric Trump & Tron Rumors About? Whispers began circulating online, gaining traction rapidly as unconfirmed reports often do in the fast-paced digital age. The core of these rumors centered on the idea that Eric Trump was planning to join or become publicly involved with a company linked to the Tron blockchain project. The speculation didn’t stop there; it specifically suggested this entity would be structured or operate in a manner similar to MicroStrategy MSTR , the well-known business intelligence firm that has made significant headlines for its substantial Bitcoin holdings and strategy. The comparison to MicroStrategy MSTR is noteworthy because it implies a potential strategy focused on accumulating a specific cryptocurrency (presumably TRX or a related asset) on a corporate balance sheet, similar to how MicroStrategy has adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. Such a move by a public company, especially one potentially associated with a high-profile name like Eric Trump, would undoubtedly garner significant attention from both traditional finance and the crypto community. Did Eric Trump Address the Crypto Rumors? Yes, Eric Trump took to the social media platform X to directly address and deny the swirling speculation. In a post that quickly gained attention, he sought to clarify his position regarding the alleged involvement with any Tron -backed public company. This direct denial aimed to quash the rumors before they could spread further and potentially create confusion or misguided expectations within the market or among followers of either Trump or Tron. Understanding Eric Trump’s Stance on Tron and Justin Sun While denying any formal or public involvement with the rumored company, Eric Trump did not dismiss the Tron project or its founder, Justin Sun , outright. On the contrary, his denial post reportedly included words of admiration for both the Tron ecosystem and Justin Sun himself. This nuance is important, as it suggests a general positive view of the technology or the figure behind it, even if there are no current plans for a direct business collaboration of the type being rumored. It’s not uncommon for public figures to express interest in or admiration for various technologies and projects without necessarily being involved in specific ventures. Trump’s comments highlight this distinction, separating personal appreciation from concrete business commitments. The MicroStrategy MSTR Model: Why the Comparison? The comparison to MicroStrategy MSTR is significant in the context of these crypto rumors . MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, pioneered the strategy of making Bitcoin a primary treasury asset for a publicly traded corporation. This approach has been both praised and criticized, but it undeniably set a precedent and provided a template for how a company might gain exposure to cryptocurrency markets through its balance sheet rather than just offering crypto-related services. A hypothetical ‘Tron-backed’ company following the MicroStrategy MSTR model would likely involve: Accumulating a large amount of TRX or a related Tron ecosystem token. Potentially raising capital specifically for this purpose. Operating as a public company, subject to regulatory filings and public scrutiny. The rumor suggested a venture aiming for similar institutional-level adoption or investment focus, but centered around Tron’s ecosystem instead of Bitcoin. The Impact of Crypto Rumors on the Market and Community Unverified rumors, especially those involving well-known personalities or established crypto projects like Tron , can have various effects: Price Volatility: Speculation can sometimes lead to short-term price movements in the associated cryptocurrency (TRX in this case) as traders react to the unconfirmed news. Misinformation Spread: Rumors contribute to a noisy information environment, making it harder for individuals to discern factual news from speculation. Community Sentiment: They can create excitement, confusion, or skepticism within the respective communities (Tron community, crypto enthusiasts). Reputational Risk: For individuals like Eric Trump or figures like Justin Sun , and for projects like Tron , dealing with false rumors requires clear communication to maintain credibility. Eric Trump’s swift denial is an example of how individuals can address such situations to prevent prolonged speculation. Actionable Insights in a Rumor-Filled Landscape For anyone navigating the crypto space, the prevalence of crypto rumors highlights the importance of critical thinking and verification: Verify Sources: Always question information that doesn’t come from official channels (e.g., official company announcements, verified social media accounts of the individuals involved, reputable news outlets reporting on confirmed statements). Be Wary of Social Media Hype: Platforms like X are breeding grounds for speculation. While they can break news, they also amplify unverified claims rapidly. Understand the Players: Familiarize yourself with key figures like Justin Sun and projects like Tron to better assess the plausibility of rumors. Look for Official Denials or Confirmations: Pay attention when individuals or entities directly address rumors, as Eric Trump did. This incident serves as a reminder that not every exciting piece of information shared online, even if it involves prominent names and intriguing comparisons like MicroStrategy MSTR , holds truth. Conclusion: Setting the Record Straight In summary, recent crypto rumors linking Eric Trump to a Tron -backed public company following the MicroStrategy MSTR model were directly addressed and denied by Trump himself. While expressing admiration for Tron and Justin Sun , he clarified that he has no public involvement in such a project. This incident underscores the dynamic nature of information dissemination in the crypto space and the critical need for individuals to rely on verified sources when evaluating news and speculation.

A significant piece of proposed legislation aimed at defining the rules for digital assets, known as the CLARITY Act (officially the U.S. Crypto Market Structure Bill), has reportedly hit a major roadblock in Congress. This development highlights the ongoing struggle to establish a predictable legal framework for the rapidly evolving crypto industry in the United States. What is the CLARITY Act and Why Does it Matter for US Crypto Regulation? The CLARITY Act is designed to provide much-needed regulatory certainty for the crypto space. At its core, the bill aims to clarify which digital assets fall under the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and which belong to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This distinction is critical for businesses operating in the crypto market, as it determines the rules they must follow regarding registration, trading, custody, and more. For years, crypto companies have operated in a gray area, facing enforcement actions and uncertainty due to overlapping or unclear regulatory boundaries. Passing a comprehensive Crypto Bill like the CLARITY Act is seen by many industry participants as essential for fostering innovation, protecting consumers, and preventing businesses from leaving the U.S. market. Why Has the CLARITY Act Reached a Political Deadlock? According to a report by crypto journalist Laura Shin on X (formerly Twitter), the progress of the CLARITY Act has stalled due to disagreements between Democratic and Republican negotiators. The central point of contention revolves around a specific provision related to conflict of interest prevention. Here’s a breakdown of the issue: The Provision: The disputed language aims to prevent conflicts of interest for high-ranking officials and their families, specifically targeting the President, Vice President, members of Congress, and their immediate family members, concerning their involvement with or holdings in the crypto industry. The Sticking Point: Some Republicans are reportedly opposing the inclusion of this specific language. Their concern is that such a provision could be weaponized and used as a political tool to unfairly target or attack certain individuals based on their financial interests or associations. The Result: This fundamental disagreement has led to a Political Deadlock , halting the bill’s movement through Congress despite apparent consensus on other aspects of the Crypto Market Structure framework the bill proposes. This situation underscores the complex political dynamics at play when regulating a novel and often controversial industry like cryptocurrency. While both sides may agree on the need for regulation, the specifics, especially those touching upon political ethics and potential for partisan conflict, can quickly derail progress. The Stakes: What Does This Political Deadlock Mean for the Crypto Market Structure? The inability of Congress to pass a comprehensive Crypto Bill like the CLARITY Act has significant implications for the entire Crypto Market Structure in the United States. Consider these points: Impact Area Consequence of Deadlock Regulatory Certainty Continued ambiguity for crypto businesses, making compliance difficult and costly. Innovation Potential stifling of growth as companies hesitate to build or expand in the U.S. without clear rules. Investor Protection Lack of a clear framework could leave investors vulnerable to scams and fraud without adequate safeguards. Market Competitiveness The U.S. risks falling behind other jurisdictions that are developing clearer crypto regulatory frameworks. Institutional Adoption Large financial institutions may remain hesitant to fully engage with crypto assets due to regulatory uncertainty. This Political Deadlock doesn’t just affect large corporations; it impacts developers building new applications, entrepreneurs starting crypto businesses, and everyday Americans interested in investing in digital assets. The lack of a clear US Crypto Regulation strategy creates an environment of unpredictability that hinders healthy market development. Conflict of Interest: A Common Hurdle in Policy Making The dispute over conflict of interest language isn’t unique to the CLARITY Act or crypto legislation. Provisions designed to prevent officials from personally benefiting from policies they enact are common in many areas of law. However, applying them to a new and rapidly changing asset class like crypto presents unique challenges. Arguments for including such language typically center on maintaining public trust and ensuring that laws are made in the public’s best interest, not for personal gain. Arguments against might focus on the potential for overreach, difficulty in defining what constitutes a conflict in a complex market, or the risk of politically motivated accusations. In the context of the Crypto Bill , the debate likely involves questions about how broadly to define ‘family members,’ what level of crypto holdings or involvement constitutes a conflict, and the enforcement mechanisms for such rules. These are complex ethical and legal questions that can easily lead to a Political Deadlock when partisan lines are drawn. What Happens Next for the CLARITY Act and US Crypto Regulation? With the bill currently stalled, the path forward is uncertain. Potential scenarios include: Negotiation and Compromise: Lawmakers could continue negotiations to find a compromise on the conflict of interest language that satisfies both sides. This might involve refining the scope of the provision or agreeing on specific disclosure requirements instead of outright restrictions. Bill Revision: The bill might need to be revised, potentially removing the contentious provision altogether, though this could face opposition from those who believe the conflict of interest issue is critical. Continued Deadlock: The disagreement could persist, leading to the bill failing to pass in its current form during the current legislative session. This would mean further delays in establishing clear US Crypto Regulation . Alternative Approaches: Congress might pivot to passing smaller, more targeted pieces of legislation, or regulators (like the SEC and CFTC) might continue to rely on enforcement actions and existing laws to govern the space, which is the status quo many in the industry find problematic. The outcome will heavily depend on the willingness of both parties to find common ground. The crypto industry and investors are watching closely, hoping for a resolution that brings much-needed clarity to the Crypto Market Structure . Key Takeaways from the CLARITY Act Deadlock The current Political Deadlock over the CLARITY Act offers several important insights: Establishing comprehensive US Crypto Regulation is a complex, multi-faceted challenge involving not just technical market structure issues but also political and ethical considerations. Disagreements over specific provisions, even seemingly minor ones related to ethics or conflicts of interest, can significantly impede the progress of major legislation like a foundational Crypto Bill . The delay in passing clear laws creates ongoing uncertainty for businesses and investors within the Crypto Market Structure in the U.S. The path to regulation requires bipartisan cooperation, which remains difficult in the current political climate, especially when sensitive issues like political ethics are on the table. Summary: The CLARITY Act’s Uncertain Future The reported Political Deadlock over the CLARITY Act is a disappointing setback for those hoping for swift and clear US Crypto Regulation . The dispute over conflict of interest language highlights the deep divisions and complexities involved in legislating the crypto space. Until lawmakers can bridge this gap, the uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Crypto Market Structure will likely persist, impacting innovation, investment, and the overall growth of the digital asset industry in the country. The fate of this crucial Crypto Bill remains in the hands of negotiators striving to find a path forward amidst significant political disagreement.

Constructing a Parallel Dollar Network: Reframing Payment Architecture While the U.S. dollar has long dominated cross-border payments, the existing system suffers from structural inefficiencies: high transaction costs, slow settlement times, strict regulatory oversight, and widespread financial exclusion. Against this backdrop, stablecoins offer a permissionless, highly liquid, near-instant payment alternative underpinned by blockchain technology and pegged to the dollar. Key advantages include: Instant settlement and real-time clearance enabled by blockchain’s unified transaction structure; Borderless circulation that only requires wallet access and internet connectivity; Integration with multi-chain ecosystems and payment APIs , with tokens like USDT and USDC now deployed across Ethereum, Tron, and Solana; Functioning simultaneously as settlement assets and stores of value , particularly useful in high-inflation economies where they increasingly substitute for local fiat. In effect, stablecoins are forming a more efficient, inclusive, and censorship-resistant on-chain dollar network. Use cases are rapidly expanding—from individual remittances in Latin America, where residents rely on USDT amid currency devaluation, to SME trade settlements in FX-restricted countries. These networks dramatically enhance the efficiency of cross-border payments, digital commerce, and Web3 transactions, while also offering dollar-based financial access to the world’s 1.3 billion unbanked. More Than Payment Tools: Stablecoins’ Role as “On-Chain Shadow Banks” Despite their technical and economic advantages, stablecoins face regulatory, liquidity, and privacy challenges. Their disintermediating nature also raises strategic concerns among central banks and legacy payment networks. Meanwhile, stablecoins are increasingly performing the role of “shadow banks”—effectively acting as on-chain money market funds by transforming fiat deposits into short-term Treasuries while minting on-chain tokens. This architecture enables stablecoins to scale U.S. dollar liquidity across decentralized ecosystems, but it also challenges the traditional monopoly central banks hold over credit creation and monetary issuance. The lack of globally harmonized regulation raises risks related to transparency, systemic liquidity, and user trust. Regulatory Convergence Driving Institutionalization of Stablecoins The growing role of stablecoins in cross-border payments has prompted heightened regulatory attention worldwide. While mature markets such as the U.S. and EU are developing frameworks emphasizing compliance, capital adequacy, and reserve transparency, Asian jurisdictions are exploring hybrid approaches that balance innovation with oversight. HTX Ventures emphasizes that the regulatory certainty and technological neutrality of stablecoins will be decisive in determining whether they can serve as the “dollar infrastructure of the digital age.” Clear policy coordination and cross-border regulatory harmonization will be essential to unlocking their full potential in global finance. HTX Expands Stablecoin Ecosystem, Accelerates Global Payment Strategy As an exchange advocate for stablecoin adoption, HTX is actively expanding its stablecoin offering to fortify its position within the global crypto ecosystem. Since May, HTX has listed six new stablecoins: USD1, EURR, USDR, EURQ, USDQ, and AETHUSDT . Among them, USD1 , issued by World Liberty Financial—an initiative linked to the Trump family—has garnered particular attention amid the evolving U.S. regulatory landscape. HTX was the first platform globally to list USD1 and has expanded its support for BTC/USD1 and ETH/USD1 trading pairs to further enrich its ecosystem. These new listings enhance users’ flexibility in managing assets across multiple chains and currencies, while unlocking new use cases in high-frequency trading, on-chain hedging, and programmable payments. The initiative reflects HTX’s strategic vision to support a robust, multi-rail global stablecoin infrastructure.

Have you been keeping an eye on the Bitcoin network lately? There’s some big news making waves: the Bitcoin Hashrate has just reached an all-time high! This isn’t just a technical blip; it’s a significant development with real implications for the entire ecosystem, especially for those involved in Bitcoin Mining . Understanding the Surge: What is Bitcoin Hashrate? Before we dive into the impact, let’s quickly touch on what the Bitcoin Hashrate actually is. Think of it as the total computational power being used to process transactions and secure the Bitcoin network. It’s measured in hashes per second (H/s), often in massive units like Exahashes per second (EH/s). A higher hashrate means more computing power is competing to solve the complex mathematical problems required to add a new block to the blockchain. This competition directly relates to the Mining Difficulty . The Mining Difficulty is an adjustment made by the Bitcoin network roughly every two weeks (specifically, every 2016 blocks). Its purpose is to keep the average time it takes to find a new block close to 10 minutes. When the hashrate increases, blocks are found faster than 10 minutes, so the difficulty goes up. When the hashrate decreases, blocks are found slower, and the difficulty goes down. So, when the Bitcoin Hashrate hits an all-time high, it inevitably pushes the Mining Difficulty to new records as well. According to recent reports, the network’s 14-day average hashrate has soared to an incredible 913.5 EH/s! This surge is a testament to the continued growth and investment in the Crypto Mining industry. The Double-Edged Sword: High Hashrate and Miner Profitability While a high hashrate is fantastic for the security and robustness of the Bitcoin network – making it exponentially harder for anyone to attempt a 51% attack – it presents significant challenges for individual miners and mining operations. Why? Because the pie (the block reward plus transaction fees) is being split among an ever-increasing number of powerful participants. This intense competition, coupled with the soaring Mining Difficulty , directly impacts Miner Profitability . Miners have to expend more energy and computational power to earn the same amount of Bitcoin. The cost to mine each Bitcoin unit goes up significantly. Reports from sources like The Miner Mag indicate that the expected unit cost of mining 1 BTC is now projected to exceed $70,000! That’s a jump of over $6,000 compared to the first quarter of the year. Let’s break down some of the factors contributing to this pressure on Miner Profitability : Increased Competition: More miners means each miner gets a smaller share of the total block rewards over time, assuming their hashrate remains constant. Higher Difficulty: As difficulty rises, older or less efficient mining hardware becomes obsolete faster, requiring constant investment in newer, more powerful (and expensive) ASICs. Rising Energy Costs: Electricity is a miner’s biggest expense. While some miners secure favorable energy deals, global energy prices can fluctuate, adding another layer of cost pressure. Decreasing Revenue Streams: The primary revenue for miners comes from the block subsidy (currently 3.125 BTC per block after the recent halving) and transaction fees. Recently, fee revenue has dropped significantly, representing less than 1% of the total block reward. This means miners are relying almost entirely on the block subsidy, which just got cut in half. Falling Hash Price: The ‘hash price’ is a metric that estimates the expected value of 1 PH/s (Petahash per second) of computing power per day. This metric fell significantly, hitting around $52 per PH/s before a slight rebound, further highlighting the reduced earnings potential for miners. Why the Unprecedented Surge in Bitcoin Hashrate? You might wonder, if profitability is getting squeezed, why is the hashrate still going up? Several factors are likely at play: Deployment of Newer, More Efficient Hardware: Mining hardware manufacturers are constantly innovating. Newer generations of ASIC miners are significantly more powerful and energy-efficient than older models. Mining operations that invested in these machines are deploying them, adding substantial hashrate to the network. Long-Term Outlook: Many large mining operations take a long-term view. They might accept lower profitability in the short term, betting on future increases in Bitcoin’s price to make their operations profitable over time. Infrastructure Investment: Significant capital has been invested in building large-scale mining facilities in regions with access to relatively cheap or renewable energy. These facilities continue to come online, adding capacity. Geopolitical Factors: As mining decentralizes globally, new regions emerge as mining hubs, contributing to the overall network hashrate. What Does This Mean for the Bitcoin Network? While challenging for miners, an all-time high Bitcoin Hashrate is fundamentally a positive sign for the network itself. It indicates immense security and resilience. The sheer amount of computing power securing Bitcoin makes it the most secure blockchain network in the world. It demonstrates continued confidence and investment in the Bitcoin ecosystem despite price volatility and profitability challenges for miners. Challenges and the Road Ahead for Crypto Mining The current environment presents a clear challenge for Crypto Mining businesses. Those with higher operating costs, less efficient hardware, or unfavorable energy contracts will struggle the most. We could potentially see some less efficient miners shutting down operations if Bitcoin’s price doesn’t increase significantly or if energy costs rise further. This consolidation is a natural part of the mining cycle. However, it also presents opportunities for well-capitalized and efficient mining operations. They can acquire assets from struggling competitors, upgrade their fleets with the latest technology, and position themselves for higher profitability when market conditions improve. Conclusion: Navigating the High Hashrate Landscape The record-breaking Bitcoin Hashrate and corresponding high Mining Difficulty are complex indicators. They signal a robust and secure network but simultaneously highlight significant profitability pressures for miners. As the cost to mine 1 BTC climbs and revenue streams tighten, the efficiency and strategic positioning of mining operations become more critical than ever. The industry is navigating a challenging phase, where only the most adaptable and well-resourced players are likely to thrive in the short term, all while reinforcing the incredible security of the world’s premier cryptocurrency.

According to the latest report from CoinShares, a total of $584 million exited crypto-focused investment vehicles, pushing the two-week cumulative outflows to $1.2 billion. This movement coincides with investor uncertainty surrounding the likelihood of interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve this year, which James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, believes is contributing to waning sentiment in the market. Butterfill attributed the investor pullback to growing skepticism about macroeconomic policy shifts, particularly rate reductions. At the same time, exchange-traded product (ETP) activity hit a new low, with global ETP volumes falling to just $6.9 billion, marking the weakest weekly trading volume since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States earlier this year.

Despite the significant movement of funds out of long Bitcoin positions, short Bitcoin products also recorded outflows totaling $1.2 million. This suggests that investors are not currently betting heavily on downside exposure, opting instead to stay on the sidelines amid uncertain market conditions. Ethereum similarly saw negative flow activity, with $58 million in outflows, continuing the trend of cautious investor behavior across major assets. The report also highlighted geographical breakdowns, noting that the United States led all regions with $475 million in outflows, followed by Canada at $109 million. Germany and Hong Kong recorded smaller outflows at $24 million and $19 million, respectively. In contrast, Switzerland and Brazil stood out as exceptions to the broader trend, bringing in net inflows of $39 million and $48.5 million, respectively. This divergence suggests that local factors or institutional strategies in those regions may be driving different investment behaviors. Altcoins Draw Selective Support While sentiment remained bearish for large-cap assets, some altcoins managed to attract capital inflows. Solana, Litecoin, and Polygon saw modest but notable gains of $2.7 million, $1.3 million, and $1 million, respectively. These inflows may reflect opportunistic positioning by investors seeking exposure to assets that have underperformed recently. Additionally, multi-asset investment products, which spread exposure across various cryptocurrencies, recorded $98 million in inflows. This signals that some investors are using recent price weaknesses to gain diversified access to the market rather than concentrating bets on single tokens. Related Reading: Still Sleeping On XRP?

XRP is finally showing signs of a comeback after breaking key resistance levels. It is also holding above key moving averages. Can XRP Price Go Parabolic? Analyst Egrag Crypto has pushed back against claims that XRP’s cycle top was $3.40. He believes the real peak is much higher and XRP could still surge to between $10 and $27. Any big correction would likely come after XRP hits higher levels. XRP looks set for a solid recovery , but the breakout is not confirmed yet. If it breaks above both the descending trendline and key horizontal resistance, it could rally toward the $3.40 all-time high. XRP has been moving between $2 and $2.65 for several days, showing clear buying near $2 and selling pressure around $2.65. If the buyers can keep XRP above the moving averages, a move toward $2.65 is likely.

VanEck, the first to propose a Solana ETF earlier this year, also submitted an updated filing. In total, eight firms have now entered the race, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. While interest in Solana ETFs has surged, regulatory approval remains uncertain. The SEC recently requested issuers to clarify how they will handle in-kind redemptions , a key operational component for crypto ETFs. The agency is reportedly open to allowing staking features in these products but has yet to signal any timeline for a decision. Analyst Pegs Solana ETF Odds at 70%, With Approval Expected Later This Year Bloomberg analysts have offered cautious projections. In February, ETF analyst Balchunas estimated a 70% chance of approval , though delays are expected. James Seyffart, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, suggested any early approvals would likely not arrive before late June or early July, with a more probable window falling in early Q4 of 2025. Solana, often described as a faster and cheaper alternative to Ethereum, has gained significant traction among both developers and institutional investors. However, its volatility, regulatory uncertainty and security challenges continue to weigh on its path to mainstream adoption. CoinShares’ bid, while not guaranteed to succeed, mirrors the growing appetite for diversified crypto investment products in regulated markets. As the SEC reviews this latest round of filings, issuers and investors alike are watching closely for signals on how the regulator plans to handle the next generation of digital asset ETFs.

The initiative will explore how AI can enhance national security and streamline administrative tasks across military and civilian government operations. Disclosed by the Pentagon on Monday, the one-year contract marks a significant step in OpenAI’s expanding efforts to partner with the federal government . The project is the first under a newly formed division called OpenAI for Government, which consolidates the company’s public sector projects, including a secure version of ChatGPT—ChatGPT Gov—tailored for government employees. In a blog post announcing the contract, OpenAI said the collaboration will focus on identifying ways AI can support tasks such as improving access to healthcare for military personnel and bolstering cybersecurity measures. OpenAI deepens government integration In its statement, The San Francisco-based company said that OpenAI for Government will be the home for their work with federal agencies . The company noted that this pilot with the Defense Department was a foundational part of that mission. The new office will also oversee continuing partnerships with federal agencies such as NASA, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Air Force Research Laboratory, and the Treasury Department. The contract adds to a series of government-facing projects the tech firm is working on. The move follows its 2024 decision to build AI-powered anti-drone systems with defense contractor Anduril Industries. OpenAI positions itself as a trusted AI ally in Washington’s security and ethics push OpenAI emphasized that it remains committed to developing AI technologies that “uphold democratic values.” To that end, the company has recently appointed a former senior Pentagon official to lead its national security policy efforts and added the former head of the National Security Agency (NSA) to its board of directors. The $200 million deal also comes at a time of wider discussion in Washington over generative AI and its application in government. The technology holds out the promise of far greater efficiency and security but has led to questions over transparency, oversight, and civil liberties. The latest development further cements OpenAI’s position as central to the federal government’s AI strategy. As US agencies race to update their systems and keep a technological advantage over everywhere from China to Russia, partnerships with private sector innovators such as OpenAI are ever-critical. For the tech firm, the Pentagon pilot represents both a financial milestone and a strategic leap into sensitive, high-stakes applications of its technology. “We see this as an opportunity to demonstrate the safe, responsible deployment of AI in the service of national interest,” the company said. The pilot program is set to begin immediately, with results from the one-year engagement expected to inform future deployments of AI across defense and civilian agencies. Top tech executives sworn into army reserve as military deepens AI ties Just last week, about four members of the new nerd brigade, officially called Detachment 201, joined the Army Reserve at the rank of lieutenant colonel. This has come as the US military has lately been pushing for closer cooperation with Silicon Valley. With artificial intelligence becoming a key national security priority, the armed forces increasingly turn to tech leaders for their expertise. On Friday, the service swore in Meta’s chief technology officer (CTO), Andrew Bosworth; OpenAI’s chief product officer, Kevin Weil; Palantir’s CTO, Shyam Sankar; and Bob McGrew, an advisor at Thinking Machines Lab who was previously OpenAI’s chief research officer. The press release said these senior tech executives will serve part-time in the Army Reserve as senior advisors, working on targeted projects to help guide rapid and scalable tech solutions to complex problems.

While seemingly distant from digital assets, high-level international discussions like those at the upcoming G7 summit can have significant ripple effects. Reports suggest a potentially pivotal development is on the horizon: a Trump Starmer meeting aimed at finalizing a key agreement. According to recent intelligence, U.S. President Donald Trump and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer are anticipated to use the stage of the G7 summit in Canada to cement a significant Tariff reduction agreement. This move, if finalized, could signal a renewed focus on strengthening trade ties between the two nations and potentially ease some economic pressures. Understanding the Proposed US UK Trade Deal The concept of a comprehensive US UK trade deal has been a topic of discussion since the UK’s departure from the European Union. While various sector-specific agreements and dialogues have occurred, a broad, tariff-cutting deal has remained a significant goal for both sides, albeit one facing numerous complexities and political considerations. Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods. They are often used to protect domestic industries from foreign competition or as a negotiating tool in international relations. Reducing or eliminating tariffs between two countries can lead to: Lower costs for businesses importing goods. Potentially lower prices for consumers on imported products. Increased trade volume as goods become cheaper. Greater economic efficiency by allowing countries to specialize in producing goods where they have a comparative advantage. A finalized agreement between the US and the UK could cover a wide range of goods and services, impacting various sectors from agriculture to manufacturing and technology. The specific details of which tariffs would be cut and by how much are crucial and would determine the true economic impact of the deal. Why Tariff Reduction Matters for the Global Economy The reduction of tariffs, especially between major economies like the United States and the United Kingdom, is not just a bilateral issue; it has broader implications for the global economy . Protectionist measures like high tariffs can slow down international trade, disrupt supply chains, and contribute to inflationary pressures. Conversely, moves towards liberalization and Tariff reduction can: Stimulate economic growth by fostering trade and investment. Enhance competition, potentially leading to innovation and better quality goods. Improve diplomatic relations and cooperation between trading partners. Provide a positive signal to other nations about the potential for trade liberalization. However, tariff reductions also present challenges. Domestic industries that previously benefited from protection might face increased competition, potentially leading to job losses or the need for significant restructuring. Negotiating which tariffs to cut requires careful balancing of national interests and potential economic disruptions. The G7 Summit Stage: Why Here, Why Now? The G7 summit brings together the leaders of the world’s seven largest so-called advanced economies: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The European Union also attends. It serves as a crucial forum for discussing pressing global issues, including economic policy, security, and climate change. Holding the finalization of a significant trade deal at the G7 offers several advantages: High Profile: It provides a global stage to announce a major diplomatic and economic achievement. Political Momentum: Summits often create deadlines and political pressure to finalize agreements that might otherwise languish. Peer Influence: Discussions with other G7 leaders might provide context or even indirect support for the bilateral agreement. Symbolism: Announcing a deal between two key G7 members reinforces the group’s role in shaping global economic norms. For both President Trump and Prime Minister Starmer, securing a tangible agreement like a tariff-cutting deal could be seen as a significant political win, demonstrating progress on international trade objectives. The timing, ahead of potential elections or during periods of economic uncertainty, can also play a role in prioritizing such announcements. Potential Crypto Market Impact: How Trade Deals Influence Digital Assets Now, how does a Trump Starmer meeting about tariffs connect to the volatile world of cryptocurrency? The link is primarily indirect, flowing through the broader financial markets and global economic sentiment. While there’s no direct mechanism linking a US-UK tariff rate to the price of Bitcoin or Ethereum, major geopolitical and economic events influence investor behavior across all asset classes. Here’s how a development like a significant US UK trade deal could potentially influence the Crypto market impact : Investor Confidence and Risk Appetite: Positive economic news, such as a successful trade agreement between major nations, can boost overall investor confidence. When investors feel more optimistic about the global economy, they may become more willing to invest in riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, trade disputes and economic uncertainty often lead investors to seek safer havens. Macroeconomic Stability: Predictable and stable trade relations between major economies contribute to overall macroeconomic stability. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are sometimes viewed as hedges against instability or inflation. However, a stable economic environment can also be conducive to broader market rallies that include digital assets. Currency Strength: Tariff changes can impact the relative strength of currencies like the US Dollar (USD) and the British Pound (GBP). Since many crypto trading pairs involve fiat currencies (e.g., BTC/USD), shifts in currency values can indirectly affect crypto prices and trading dynamics. Inflation Expectations: Tariffs can act as an inflationary force by increasing the cost of imported goods. A reduction in tariffs could potentially alleviate some inflationary pressure. Central banks monitor inflation closely, and their monetary policy decisions (like interest rates) have a significant impact on financial markets, including crypto. News that influences the inflation outlook can therefore indirectly affect the crypto market. Global Market Sentiment: High-profile events at the G7 summit and major bilateral agreements generate headlines and contribute to the prevailing global market sentiment. A positive outcome could contribute to a risk-on environment, while a failure could add to uncertainty. Crypto markets, known for their sensitivity to sentiment, can react to these broader shifts. It is crucial for crypto investors to understand that the impact of a trade deal is typically not a direct, isolated price driver. Instead, it’s one piece of a much larger puzzle, influencing the global economic backdrop against which digital assets trade. Monitoring such developments provides valuable context for understanding broader market movements. What Challenges Remain and What Happens Next? While reports suggest finalization is expected, the path to a completed US UK trade deal is not without potential hurdles. Negotiating the specifics of tariff cuts across numerous sectors can be complex, with lobbying from various industries on both sides. Domestic political considerations in both the US and the UK could also play a role. Even if an agreement is reached at the G7 summit , the process typically involves legal drafting and ratification procedures in both countries, which can take time and face political debate. The true impact will only be felt once the agreed-upon tariff reductions are implemented. For those monitoring the markets, including the crypto space, the key takeaway is to watch not just the announcement itself, but also the market’s reaction and the subsequent economic data that emerges as a result of the deal’s implementation. The focus should remain on how such agreements contribute to or detract from global economic stability and investor confidence. In Conclusion: A Glimpse of Economic Optimism? The potential finalization of a significant Tariff reduction deal between the US and the UK by President Trump and Prime Minister Starmer at the upcoming G7 summit is a notable development in international trade relations. While the direct connection to cryptocurrency prices is tenuous, the agreement’s potential to foster stronger economic ties and contribute to global economic stability is relevant for all market participants. As the leaders meet, the world will be watching for concrete steps towards easing trade barriers. Such positive movements in the traditional economic sphere, while not guaranteeing specific outcomes for digital assets, can contribute to an environment where risk appetite is higher and overall market sentiment is more positive – factors that historically have been supportive of the broader financial landscape, including the dynamic Crypto market impact .

US President Donald Trump has announced a last-ditch effort to prevent an all-out war between Israel and Iran, which could impact global markets, including crypto. According to reports, Trump is pushing for an emergency meeting with Iranian officials this week. He believes the decision to use powerful “bunker buster” bombs on Iran’s nuclear sites would be a turning point. Trump also cut his trip to the G7 Summit short to head back to Washington and focus on the crisis. In a bold statement, he even called for “everyone” to evacuate Tehran, Iran’s capital, though it’s unclear whether he meant US citizens or the city’s 14 million residents. The crypto market, which saw a brief rally a few hours ago, has already started reacting. XRP led the jump with a 7% gain, while Bitcoin soared to $108,950 before pulling back. Bitcoin is now hovering slightly above the $107,000 mark. With the latest developments, it’s uncertain which way the market will move next. Experts are closely watching the news, as any escalation could trigger another major sell-off. Adding to the pressure, liquidations have begun across the market. In the past 24 hours alone, total liquidations reached a staggering $394.16 million, wiping out leveraged positions.

Artprice’s comprehensive database coverage demonstrates its position as the world leader in art market information. See the Perplexity Labs illustration: https://www.perplexity.ai/search/hello-perplexity-can-you-prepa-ecPX.gL.RFiE9Xsl571xdg Thierry Ehrmann: The Visionary Founder Thierry Marie Nicolas Pierre Joseph Ehrmann, born March 13, 1962, in Avignon, embodies a unique combination of entrepreneurial genius and artistic vision that has shaped Artprice’s distinctive identity. According to his certified biography in Who’s Who in France, Ehrmann has been recognized as a visual artist since 1980, alongside his role as company president and sculptor-artist. His educational background encompasses theological studies at the Faculty of Theology of Lyon and classical education at prestigious institutions including Lycées Fénelon, des Maristes, and Pascal. See thierry Erhmann’s biography here: https://www.perplexity.ai/search/hello-perplexity-can-you-prepa-ecPX.gL.RFiE9Xsl571xdg Ehrmann’s entrepreneurial journey began in 1983 with the creation of an audiphone device, followed by the development of an electronic freight exchange in 1985. His founding of Groupe Serveur in 1987 established the technological foundation that would later support Artprice’s revolutionary approach to art market data management. The creation of the Judicial Server in 1993 demonstrated his early understanding of digital database applications, preparing him for the art market revolution that would follow. His artistic identity is deeply intertwined with his business vision, as evidenced by his creation of La Demeure du Chaos in 1999, a contemporary art museum that serves simultaneously as Artprice’s global headquarters. This dual identity as both artist and entrepreneur has enabled Ehrmann to understand the art world from multiple perspectives, contributing to Artprice’s unique positioning in the market. Artprice’s Strategic Advantages and Global Leadership See the timeline of Artprice’s key milestones from its founding to becoming a leader in AI-driven art market analysis: https://www.perplexity.ai/search/hello-perplexity-can-you-prepa-ecPX.gL.RFiE9Xsl571xdg Artprice’s strategic dominance in the art market stems from several key competitive advantages that have been developed over 28 years of continuous innovation. The company maintains the world’s largest art market database, encompassing 181 million images and historical data spanning from 1700 to the present day. This comprehensive coverage includes partnerships with 7,200 auction houses globally, creating an unmatched network for real-time market intelligence. The company’s proprietary approach to data collection and analysis represents a fundamental strategic advantage over competitors. Unlike other art market platforms that rely on limited datasets or external sources, Artprice has systematically acquired legendary editorial funds and databases across Europe, the United States, and Asia, representing assets worth over €30 million. These acquisitions include the prestigious Enrique Mayer Guide (1962-1987), the Dictionary of Art Sales 1700-1900 by Doctor H. Mireur, Sound View Press with nearly 50 databases in the USA, and Franck Van Wilder editions. Artprice’s technological infrastructure, built upon the foundation of Groupe Serveur’s expertise in judicial and scientific databases, provides unparalleled processing capabilities. The company processes 35MB of data per second per employee, outperforming European averages by over 20 times. This technological superiority enables real-time analysis of complex art market trends and provides users with instantaneous access to comprehensive market intelligence. The company’s global reach extends to 119 countries with support for 11 languages, positioning it as the definitive international authority on art market information. Its press agency distributes content to 6,300 newspapers worldwide, while annual reports reach 122 countries, establishing Artprice as the primary source for art market analysis globally. Unique Documentary Background and World’s Largest Art Archive Artprice’s documentary collection represents one of the most significant and unique archives in the art world, comprising hundreds of thousands of manuscripts and sales catalogs spanning from 1700 to the present day. This extraordinary collection has been methodically assembled through strategic acquisitions of legendary art publishing houses and editorial funds worldwide. The scope and depth of this documentary heritage make it unparalleled in the global art market, providing researchers and professionals with access to historical documentation that exists nowhere else. The collection includes original manuscripts, annotated auction catalogs, and historical documents that have been carefully preserved and digitized by Artprice’s team of art historians. Each document in the collection has been reviewed and annotated by specialists, creating a scholarly resource that combines historical accuracy with contemporary accessibility. The archive serves not only as a commercial database but as a vital repository for art historical research, supporting academic institutions and museums worldwide. The uniqueness of Artprice’s documentary background lies in its comprehensive coverage of auction results and market transactions across multiple centuries. While other databases focus on contemporary markets or specific periods, Artprice’s collection provides an unbroken chain of market documentation that allows for unprecedented historical analysis and trend identification. This temporal depth enables the company to identify long-term patterns and provide insights that would be impossible with more limited datasets. The physical archive is housed at La Demeure du Chaos, where it forms part of the museum’s extensive collections. This integration of commercial database management with artistic and cultural preservation reflects Ehrmann’s vision of art market transparency as both a business imperative and a cultural responsibility. The collection continues to grow through ongoing acquisitions and partnerships with auction houses worldwide, ensuring that future generations will have access to comprehensive art market documentation. Artificial Intelligence Innovation: Intuitive Artmarket® and Blind Spot AI® Artprice’s technological leadership reached a new pinnacle with the official launch of its Intuitive Artmarket® AI on January 9, 2025, marking the company’s emergence as the global leader in AI-driven art market intelligence. This revolutionary artificial intelligence system represents the culmination of nearly two decades of algorithmic learning and data accumulation, processing hundreds of millions of anonymized proprietary logs and tens of millions of artworks to identify previously hidden patterns and connections. The cornerstone of Artprice’s AI innovation is its proprietary Blind Spot AI® technology, inspired by Marcel Duchamp’s concept of “infrathin” and Henri Poincaré’s work on mathematical models. This unique approach avoids traditional fuzzy logic systems, instead using degrees of truth to explore connections between structured data elements that conventional Boolean logic cannot detect. The methodology seeks to capture subtle relationships and patterns that exist in the liminal spaces between clearly defined data points, revealing insights that escape traditional analysis methods. The Intuitive Artmarket® AI encompasses several specialized tools designed for different aspects of art market analysis. The AIDB Search Artist® function enables image recognition for artwork identification, allowing users to identify pieces through visual analysis similar to Google Lens technology. The AIDB Signatures & Monograms® database provides expertise in recognizing and validating artist signatures and monograms from the 4th century to the present day, trained using three of the world’s largest databases in this field. Perhaps most significantly, the AI system can anticipate future value fluctuations for artworks, including totally unique pieces, by analyzing traceability and historical auction results over time. This predictive capability extends beyond simple price estimation to identify complex transversal artistic trends that largely escape academic, institutional, and commercial analysis. The system’s ability to calculate reliable price information while exploring artwork provenance represents a breakthrough in art market valuation methodology. The AI’s proprietary nature provides Artprice with significant competitive advantages, as it draws exclusively from the company’s vast collection of intellectual property-protected content. This approach eliminates dependencies on external data sources and potential legal complications while ensuring the system’s responses remain within Artprice’s ethical and quality standards. The gradual integration of AI-enhanced data into Artprice’s existing databases has already demonstrated significant impact, with premium subscriptions showing substantial growth as users recognize the enhanced value of AI-enriched content.

On March 20, 2025, French Minister of Culture Rachida Dati granted official recognition to this extraordinary complex as a “total work of art,” placing it alongside legendary installations such as Jean Tinguely & Niki De Saint Phalle’s Cyclop and the Palais Idéal of Facteur Cheval. The museum complex spans 7,555 square meters and features a unique museum trail set in the heart of nature, conceived as a total work of art that ensures accessibility and inclusion for all audiences. Since its creation in 1999 by Thierry Ehrmann as “a mirror of our world,” the site has evolved into a comprehensive artistic statement comprising nearly 7,200 distinct works of art. The collection includes 4,500 laser-sculpted steel artworks, some weighing several hundred tons, alongside 1,800 portraits representing geopolitical, philosophical, and scientific themes. The recognition by the Minister of Culture represents a significant milestone for both Artprice and the contemporary art world, validating the complex’s artistic and cultural importance on a national level. This official designation provides Artprice with a prestigious global headquarters that reflects the company’s innovative approach to business and culture. The museum operates as an ERP (Établissement Recevant du Public) open-air museum, classified by the Prefecture and open to the public free of charge. Since its opening in 2006, the Contemporary Art Museum has received 2.5 million visitors free of charge, with 25% coming from outside France. The international impact of La Demeure du Chaos is evidenced by nearly 3,600 written and audiovisual press reports from 72 countries over 25 years. The complex maintains a global following of more than 10.9 million subscribers on its social media accounts and has garnered 720,000 signatories to a petition for its preservation and recognition by France’s public authorities. The integration of Artprice’s documentary archives within this artistic environment creates a unique synthesis of commercial database management and cultural preservation. This physical manifestation of Ehrmann’s vision demonstrates how business innovation and artistic expression can coexist and mutually reinforce each other, providing Artprice with a headquarters that embodies its mission of art market transparency and accessibility. Reputation and Recognition in the Art World Artprice’s reputation in the international art world has been solidified through nearly three decades of consistent innovation and reliable service to art market professionals. A comprehensive study conducted during the CIHA Lyon 2024 congress, the 36th world congress devoted to research in Art History with participants from more than 70 countries, revealed Artprice’s dominant position in academic and professional circles. When 378 congress attendees were asked “Which databases on the Art Market do you know?”, 325 cited Artprice first, representing 86% recognition and clearly establishing Artprice as the “top-of-mind” art market databank. The company’s reputation extends across multiple sectors of the art world, serving auction houses, experts, insurers, private bankers, galleries, dealers, art professionals, and collectors. Artprice’s twice-awarded “Innovative Company” label from the French Public Investment Bank (BPI) recognizes its technological leadership and strategic importance to the French economy. The company’s annual art market reports, now in their 30th edition, are distributed in 122 countries and 11 languages, serving as authoritative references for art market analysis worldwide. Professional recognition of Artprice’s expertise is demonstrated through its collaboration with major institutions and its role as a primary source for art market intelligence. The company continuously publishes art market trends for major agencies and press titles worldwide, establishing itself as the definitive voice on market developments. Its partnership with the Chinese State group Artron for the past 15 consecutive years has enabled comprehensive global coverage of art auctions and structural analysis of market evolution. The integration of advanced artificial intelligence capabilities has further enhanced Artprice’s reputation as a technological innovator in the art world. The successful launch of Intuitive Artmarket® AI has positioned the company as the global leader in AI-driven art market intelligence, attracting increased attention from both traditional art market participants and technology-focused investors. The company’s ability to maintain accuracy and reliability while incorporating cutting-edge technology has strengthened its position as the trusted authority in art market information. Scientific Innovation and Future Vision Artprice’s commitment to scientific methodology and technological innovation represents a fundamental aspect of its global leadership position. The company’s approach to artificial intelligence development reflects a deep understanding of both technological capabilities and art historical methodology, resulting in tools that enhance rather than replace human expertise. The Blind Spot AI® concept, inspired by Marcel Duchamp’s aesthetic theories and Henri Poincaré’s mathematical work, demonstrates the sophisticated theoretical foundation underlying Artprice’s technological development. The company’s 2025-2029 strategic roadmap, unveiled at the Global AI Action Summit in Paris, positions Artprice at the forefront of France’s ambition to become the world’s third-largest AI hub after the United States and China. This alignment with national AI development priorities reflects the recognition of Artprice’s technological capabilities and its potential contribution to France’s digital economy. The company’s processing capacity of 35MB of data per second per employee demonstrates the practical implementation of this technological vision. Ehrmann’s vision for Artprice extends beyond traditional database management to encompass a comprehensive transformation of how the art world accesses and utilizes market information. The integration of AI technology with the company’s extensive documentary archives creates unprecedented opportunities for art historical research and market analysis. This synthesis of historical documentation and cutting-edge technology reflects Ehrmann’s unique perspective as both entrepreneur and artist, enabling Artprice to serve both commercial and academic constituencies. Conclusion Artprice’s position as the world leader in art market information results from a unique combination of comprehensive data collection, technological innovation, and visionary leadership that has been sustained over nearly three decades. The company’s unparalleled documentary collection, spanning from 1700 to the present day, provides the historical foundation for its AI-driven analysis tools. The recent recognition of La Demeure du Chaos by France’s Minister of Culture validates the integration of artistic vision and commercial excellence that characterizes Thierry Ehrmann’s approach to business.

While cryptocurrency markets have their own unique drivers, the performance of traditional assets, particularly stocks, often provides valuable context about overall investor sentiment and macroeconomic conditions. And today? The sentiment leaned positive. What Happened in the US Stock Market Today? The latest stock market performance saw all three major US indexes finish the day in positive territory, reflecting a generally optimistic mood among investors. This broad-based gain signals a potential ‘risk-on’ environment, where investors feel more comfortable allocating capital to assets perceived as having higher growth potential. Here’s a quick look at the numbers: S&P 500: Closed up +0.9% Nasdaq: Closed up +1.5% Dow Jones Industrial Average: Closed up +0.77% These figures represent a solid day of gains across the board, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq leading the charge. Why Does Stock Market Performance Matter for Crypto Investors? It might seem counterintuitive to focus on the stock market on a crypto news site, but the reality is that global financial markets are increasingly interconnected. Here’s why observing the US stock market is relevant to your crypto portfolio: Sentiment Indicator: Positive movement in stocks often reflects broader investor confidence in the economy. This ‘risk-on’ sentiment can sometimes spill over into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Macro Factors: The same economic news (inflation data, interest rate decisions, jobs reports) that moves stocks also influences crypto. Both asset classes react to changes in liquidity and economic outlook. Institutional Flow: Large institutional investors often have allocations in both traditional markets and digital assets. Their shifts in strategy based on macro conditions can impact both spaces. Correlation, Not Causation: While not always perfectly aligned, there has been a notable crypto market correlation with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 , particularly since the increased institutional adoption of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. Understanding the pulse of the stock market helps provide a fuller picture of the financial environment in which crypto operates. A Closer Look: The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Lead The strong showing from the S&P 500 , which tracks the performance of 500 of the largest U.S. publicly traded companies, indicates broad market strength. Its positive close suggests that gains weren’t confined to just a few sectors but were relatively widespread. The even more significant jump in the Nasdaq , home to many technology and growth stocks, is particularly interesting for crypto enthusiasts. Tech stocks are often seen as more sensitive to interest rate changes and future growth expectations, similar to how many view cryptocurrency valuations. The strong performance here could suggest renewed optimism about growth prospects and a greater appetite for assets positioned for future innovation. While the Dow Jones also saw a healthy gain, the leadership shown by the S&P 500 and Nasdaq often provides a clearer signal about the market’s appetite for growth and risk. Translating Crypto Market Correlation : What Does This Mean for You? It’s crucial to remember that while a crypto market correlation with stocks exists, it’s not a perfect one-to-one relationship. Cryptocurrencies have their own unique catalysts, such as regulatory news, technological developments (like network upgrades), and specific adoption trends. However, a positive day in the US stock market , especially one led by the Nasdaq , can be interpreted as a tailwind. It suggests that the broader financial mood is conducive to risk-taking, which can be supportive of crypto prices. It doesn’t guarantee a pump, but it removes a potential headwind that a negative stock market day might represent. Actionable Insight: Don’t make investment decisions based solely on stock market movements. Use this information as one data point among many when evaluating the overall market environment. Pay attention to major economic announcements that could impact both markets. In Summary Today’s positive stock market performance , with strong closes for the S&P 500 , Nasdaq , and Dow Jones, reflects a positive shift in investor sentiment. While the US stock market and crypto market are distinct, their increasing crypto market correlation means that traditional market health can provide valuable insights for crypto investors. A ‘risk-on’ day in stocks suggests a potentially favorable environment for riskier assets, but always remember the unique factors driving the crypto space.

The second largest crypto by market cap has been trending sideways displaying an increasing selling pressure on higher timeframes, but today ETH holders seem hopeful of further gains. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: Bitcoin Price Primed For Deep Correction Below $90,000 At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $2,600 with a 3.5% gain on the past 24 hours.

Ethereum price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview Ethereum Price On Brink Of Massive Recovery According to Daan Crypto, the current price action for Ethereum shows classical signs of compression. This action is usually recorded when an asset is about to experience a massive spike in volatility, either to the upside or the downside. The analyst pointed out that Ethereum has been trading in a tight range, trapped between two critical levels. If buyers manage to push the price above the first of these levels, sitting at $2,851, then the second crypto by market cap is likely to trend to the upside. ETH price trading on a tight range on the 2 day chart. Source: Daan Crypto via X On the contrary, if sellers regain control over the ETH market, and price dips below its current levels, then the price is more likely to return to the bottom of its current range, sitting at $2,168. Daan Crypto stated the following, warning his followers on taking positions as the Ethereum price consolidates: ETH Price action is compressing right below this big $2.8K level. If we’d see a convincing break above $2.8K and hold there, that would be a good setup for a move to the cycle highs around ~$4K. If we do lose this current range then $2.1K is the big high timeframe level to watch. No reason to get over excited in either direction until this current consolidation/compression resolves. ETH Price Rally to Ignite Massive Alt Season On a separate note, analyst Cantonese Cat showed the Ethereum price dominance chart, used to gauge the percentage of the total crypto market cap represented by ETH. As seen in the chart below, this chart is tightly compressed according to the Bollinger Band indicator. Related Reading: $8 Dogecoin?

ADA is now consolidating and might struggle to stay above the $0.620 support. ADA price started a fresh decline below $0.70 and $0.680. The price is trading below $0.680 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.630 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it dips below the $0.620 support zone. Cardano Price Dips Further In the past few days, Cardano saw a fresh decline below the $0.720, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA even declined below the $0.70 level to enter a bearish zone. The bears even pushed the price below the $0.680 level. A low was formed at $0.6134 and the price recently corrected some losses. There was a move above the $0.620 and $0.6350 levels. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.7311 swing high to the $0.6134 low. However, the bears remained active near $0.6560.

On June 16, 2025, the SEC submitted a new status report to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, requesting that the court continue to hold both parties’ appeals in abeyance. The Commission confirmed it will file a follow-up report by August 15, 2025, pending Judge Analisa Torres’s decision on the parties’ revised joint settlement motion in the district court. The filing comes amid growing anticipation within the XRP community. Attorney James K. Filan shared the update publicly, highlighting that the current pause in appeals hinges on the court’s response to the pending motion for an indicative ruling. This procedural step allows a district court to signal its intention to reconsider or modify a judgment, even when an appeal is already underway. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP In light of the pending motion for an indicative ruling, the parties have requested that the Second Circuit continue to hold the appeals in abeyance, with the @SECGov to file a status report by August 15, 2025. https://t.co/7oQvL5Rx7U — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) June 17, 2025 Background of the Current Situation Ripple and the SEC previously submitted a joint motion in May to resolve key issues relating to institutional XRP sales. That proposal was rejected shortly thereafter by Judge Torres, who stated that the request lacked sufficient justification. In response, the parties submitted a more detailed second motion on June 12, which included additional arguments intended to meet the court’s standards for reconsideration. The filing currently under review is based on that revised motion. Appeals Held as Judge Reviews Revised Proposal The June 16 deadline for filing the status report has loomed over the lawsuit for weeks now, and the SEC’s latest status report references this ongoing district court development, stating that “in light of the developments described below,” it would be appropriate for the appeals court to continue holding the case. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Both the Commission and Ripple maintain that awaiting Judge Torres’s response could avoid unnecessary appellate litigation, streamline proceedings, and potentially result in a full resolution of the case. Awaiting a Key Decision Should Judge Torres indicate she is inclined to grant the revised motion, the appeals court may then formally remand the case to the lower court, allowing for final approval. If the motion is denied, litigation will likely resume in the Second Circuit, as many expected this outcome on June 16 until both parties refiled their joint motion addressing the judge’s concerns. John Deaton, another well-respected attorney, has predicted a 70% chance that the judge will approve the motion. Until then, the SEC’s request to maintain the pause until August 15 ensures that no new appellate steps will occur while the district court weighs its next move.

The proposal, presented by Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson on June 13, involves converting $100 million worth of ADA coins in the Cardano treasury into Bitcoin and stablecoins. However, Yakovenko said the idea was “very stupid,” indicating mismanagement of the treasury and sending the wrong message to the Cardano community. According to Yakovenko, projects only need to hold enough funds in short-term US Treasury bonds to cover their operational expenses for 18 to 36 months. Yakovenko said that turning to different assets such as Bitcoin is unnecessary and wrong, and said, “If users want to buy Bitcoin, they can already buy it themselves. There is no need for the project to hold Bitcoin on behalf of users.” Related News: XRP Experiences a First-Time Event in Its History - Unusual Data Coming In Hoskinson argued that the proposal was made to strengthen Cardano’s decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure and solve some problems in the stablecoin ecosystem. However, some critics believe that the move shows a lack of trust in the ADA coin. Crypto investor Aaron Dishner said that this plan implicitly implies that Cardano admits that Bitcoin is more valuable than ADA. Opinions on the proposal have been mixed in the Cardano community, with some users concerned that the $100 million ADA sale could negatively impact the token’s price. However, Hoskinson dismissed these concerns, stating that the ADA market is deep enough to absorb the transfer without any crashes. As discussions continue within the Cardano community, it is eagerly awaited whether the proposal will be implemented and how the project's governance process will be followed. *This is not investment advice.

However, its slow growth has left many investors seeking opportunities with higher potential for returns. Enter Ruvi AI (RUVI) , an audited blockchain project primed to become the next big $1 breakout. With its focus on real-world utility, structured growth, and impressive return potential, Ruvi AI might just be the smarter investment choice for today’s forward-thinking investors. Why Ruvi AI Could Outperform Dogecoin Dogecoin’s primary appeal lies in its meme-driven popularity and speculative value, but it lacks the utility and practical applications needed for long-term demand. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, is built on a foundation of blockchain-integrated artificial intelligence (AI) , delivering solutions for marketing , entertainment , and finance . This integration ensures Ruvi AI isn’t just another crypto token but a project with meaningful, scalable applications. At its current Phase 2 presale price of $0.015 per token , Ruvi AI offers investors a chance to secure early-stage gains. Upon the presale’s conclusion, the token price will rise to $0.07 , delivering an automatic 50% return to presale participants. Analysts are also forecasting a $1 valuation post-listing , translating to a 66x return from its initial price entry. Compared to Dogecoin’s relatively stable but slow-moving price history, Ruvi AI’s trajectory sets it apart as a high-growth contender in the crypto world. Milestone Achievement During the Presale One of the clearest indicators of Ruvi AI’s strength is its recent presale success. The project has already raised $1.8 million and sold more than 150 million tokens , making it a standout in the competitive cryptocurrency landscape. Ruvi AI’s structured price roadmap ensures steady value growth, avoiding the wild volatility that speculative projects like Dogecoin often experience. By guaranteeing a price increase to $0.07 after the presale , Ruvi AI assures early backers of consistent returns while setting the stage for future growth. VIP Investment Tiers Offer Incredible Returns Ruvi AI’s VIP investment tiers make the presale even more enticing by rewarding participants with bonus token allocations. Here’s a detailed look at these lucrative tiers: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These VIP tiers highlight Ruvi AI’s commitment to rewarding early investors with exceptional opportunities to maximize their returns. Transparency and Security Set Ruvi AI Apart Dogecoin, despite its popularity, lacks the robust infrastructure and transparency that serious investors often prioritize. This is where Ruvi AI excels. The platform is undergoing a third-party audit by CyberScope , a leading name in blockchain security, ensuring the project’s technical reliability. Ruvi AI has also partnered with WEEX Exchange , a globally recognized trading platform, to guarantee liquidity after the token launches. Such measures demonstrate Ruvi AI’s commitment to trust and long-term viability, providing investors with peace of mind as they commit to the project. Real-World Applications Drive Sustained Growth Unlike speculative meme coins, Ruvi AI’s utility-driven approach ensures enduring relevance. Here’s how it’s changing the game across major industries: Marketing Ruvi AI enhances advertising efficiency through AI-powered targeting tools, enabling businesses to optimize ad spend and improve engagement metrics. Entertainment By offering personalized content recommendations and secure blockchain-backed payments, Ruvi AI creates a better experience for both creators and consumers. Finance The platform boosts efficiency and transparency in financial operations while strengthening fraud detection capabilities, making it a game-changer for financial institutions. These practical applications ensure ongoing demand for Ruvi AI’s token, making it more than just an investment opportunity but a valuable solution in the blockchain space. Why Ruvi AI Could Be the Next $1 Breakout While Dogecoin’s slow growth suggests limited short-term upside, Ruvi AI presents a promising alternative for investors eager to multiply their portfolios. Its $0.015 presale price , guaranteed rise to $0.07 post-presale , and $1 valuation potential offer an achievable path to significant six-figure returns. Supported by a CyberScope audit , WEEX Exchange partnership , and its innovative integration of AI and blockchain, Ruvi AI stands out as a transparent and lucrative investment option.

SEC Stalls Again as Appeal Put on Hold — Here’s What’s Holding It Up,https://cryptonews.com/news/ripple-v-sec-stalls-again-as-appeal-put-on-hold/,"The long-running courtroom saga between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission has hit another pause, as both parties asked the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to keep the case on hold. In a joint status report filed on June 16, the SEC confirmed that a settlement has been signed but still hinges on the district court’s approval to move forward. This is the latest twist in a case that has shaped the way digital assets are viewed under US law. Since 2020, when the SEC sued Ripple for allegedly raising $1.3b through unregistered sales of XRP, the dispute has pulled in investors, crypto platforms and policy watchers from around the world. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP In light of the pending motion for an indicative ruling, the parties have requested that the Second Circuit continue to hold the appeals in abeyance, with the @SECGov to file a status report by August 15, 2025. https://t.co/7oQvL5Rx7U — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) June 17, 2025 What Began As A Billion-Dollar Dispute Edged Toward Resolution With A Scaled-Down Penalty A partial ruling in 2023 gave Ripple a win on XRP’s classification in retail sales , but the company was found liable for securities violations in its institutional sales. Both sides appealed. Then in May, a breakthrough seemed close. The SEC and Ripple reached an agreement in principle to resolve the litigation entirely. According to the June filing, they signed a formal settlement on May 8. Under the deal, Ripple would pay $50m to the SEC , while the remaining $75m from a previously imposed civil penalty would be returned to the company. The agreement also called for dissolving the injunction placed on Ripple. Legal Gridlock Deepens As District Court Holds Back Settlement Approval Still, the path to closure has been far from smooth. The settlement depends on the district court agreeing to revise its earlier judgment. To move forward, both sides filed a motion seeking what is known as an indicative ruling. In essence, they asked the court to signal whether it would consider approving the proposed changes. However, the court rejected that request on May 15. It ruled that the motion failed to show the “exceptional circumstances” needed for such a modification. On June 12, Ripple and the SEC returned to court with a renewed motion. This time, they aimed to meet the “exceptional circumstances” standard set by the judge. So far, the court has not ruled on the new request. As a result, both the settlement and the appeals remain in limbo. In the meantime, the SEC has asked for more time. It requested that the appeals court continue to pause the case and committed to providing another update by Aug. 15. The delay adds to growing uncertainty, as crypto firms and regulators watch closely for guidance on how securities laws will apply to digital assets. With billions in crypto still operating in a regulatory grey zone, the Ripple case has become a bellwether. What happens next could set the tone for how token sales, crypto company operations and regulatory oversight unfold in the US. For now, the waiting game continues. The post Ripple v.

Most indicators and moving averages are showing weakness, signaling a bearish trend for now. On the daily chart, SUI is well below all the short and mid-term EMAs (10, 20, 30, 50, and 100), which are between $3.12 and $3.51. The only short-term support comes from the 100-day Simple moving average at $2.95, which makes it a key level to watch. SUI Shows Weak Momentum Momentum indicators like the MACD and momentum are also currently in sell territory. RSI is at 41, which shows that there is still room for further downside before it becomes oversold. Overall, the trend remains weak unless bulls step in with strong volume to reclaim the lost EMAs. A trader warns that SUI is showing weakness after failing to hold its support range. The recent bounce was shallow, and with the price breaking below key levels, they expect a drop toward $2.10 if altcoins continue to show weakness. Additionally, the SUI network will unlock over 58 million tokens on July 1, which could impact the price action in the short term. Long-term Outlook is Bullish One analyst has tracked two possible scenarios for SUI. On the larger time frame, the outlook remains bullish as long as SUI holds above the $2.90 support zone (the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement from the April rally). This area has held up multiple times, and if the correction is complete, a strong third wave up could follow, with a possible target around $10.90. However, there is no confirmation yet that the next major rally has started. Can SUI Hold $2.95? In the short term, the price is still in a correction phase. It may move higher to $3.50–$3.60, but first, it needs to break above $3.14–$3.15 to confirm that upside. For now, there is a small uptrend from June 14, and it is still holding. But if SUI drops below $2.95, it may confirm a bearish trend.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|TRADING|SUI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-17 05:29:04

The move positions the exchange to serve users across the EU with a single license, reflecting broader institutional interest in the region’s clearer regulatory environment. However, at the same time, Coinbase is facing criticism from parts of the crypto community for sponsoring a US Army anniversary parade, with some users arguing the move contradicts the company’s stated commitment to political neutrality and the core values of the crypto space. Gemini and Coinbase Set to Expand in Europe as MiCA Reshapes the Crypto Landscape Gemini and Coinbase, two of the most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, are reportedly on the brink of securing regulatory licenses to operate across the European Union under the newly implemented Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. The move signals a significant escalation in the global expansion efforts of these digital asset firms and shows Europe’s emerging leadership in crypto regulation. According to a report published by Reuters on Monday, Gemini is poised to obtain regulatory approval from Malta, while Coinbase is expected to receive its license through Luxembourg, a jurisdiction often favored by fintech and digital asset companies for its strong regulatory reputation. A Coinbase spokesperson, while declining to confirm details of the licensing process, acknowledged Luxembourg as a “well-respected global financial center.” If approved, Gemini and Coinbase would join a growing cohort of global exchanges pushing into the EU under the MiCA framework. Other major platforms, such as Bybit, have already gained a regulatory foothold—Bybit recently secured approval to operate in Austria. Binance, meanwhile, has adjusted its operations in Poland to align with the new requirements, signaling the widespread impact of the regulation. The Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation officially came into effect in June 2024, with full implementation expected by the end of the year following guidance from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). MiCA was introduced to harmonize crypto regulations across all 27 EU member states, offering a single licensing regime for crypto firms and eliminating the need for country-by-country compliance. The framework is designed to ensure regulatory clarity, enhance investor protection, and foster financial stability in the crypto markets. It introduces comprehensive oversight for crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), encompassing areas like custody, trading, and issuance of digital tokens, including stablecoins. While MiCA is widely seen as a pioneering step toward crypto regulation on a global scale, industry reactions have been mixed—particularly around the treatment of stablecoins. Stablecoin Regulation Sparks Controversy One of MiCA’s most debated provisions concerns stablecoins. The law requires stablecoin issuers to hold a “significant” portion of their reserves in European banks. This requirement has been sharply criticized by some players in the industry for limiting the global scope of stablecoin operations. Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin USDt, has notably opted out of the MiCA regime, citing the stringent reserve requirements as a key concern. On the other hand, at least ten other stablecoins have received approval under MiCA, including those issued by Circle (USD Coin), Crypto.com, Fiat Republic, and even French banking giant Société Générale. Patrick Hansen, EU policy expert and Circle’s EU strategy lead, revealed in February that ten entities were already approved to operate stablecoins under the new regime. However, early indications suggest that uptake has been relatively cautious. Despite the promise of a unified regulatory framework, stablecoin adoption in the region remains tepid. Fabio Panetta, former executive board member of the European Central Bank and current Governor of the Bank of Italy, noted that MiCA has not spurred significant stablecoin growth in Italy, one of Europe’s largest economies. Instead, market demand appears to be gravitating more toward custodial and trading services—areas that exchanges like Gemini and Coinbase are well-positioned to serve. Their entry into the European market could capitalize on this shifting demand, offering secure infrastructure and institutional-grade trading capabilities amid a more regulated environment. A Global Chessboard for Crypto The expansion of Gemini and Coinbase into Europe comes at a time when the regulatory climate in the United States remains uncertain. US crypto firms continue to face enforcement actions and legal ambiguity from regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has been criticized for regulating by enforcement rather than through clear legislation. In contrast, the EU’s MiCA regime is being praised as a model of proactive regulation. By providing a passporting mechanism for firms licensed in one EU country to operate across all member states, MiCA has created an attractive and streamlined path for crypto firms aiming to serve European customers. As the crypto industry matures, regulatory clarity is increasingly seen as a competitive advantage. With Gemini and Coinbase soon to be licensed under MiCA, the European Union may become a pivotal arena for digital asset innovation, regulation, and adoption. Coinbase Faces Backlash for Sponsoring US Army Parade Amid Political Tensions Meanwhile, Coinbase is under fire from the crypto community following its sponsorship of the US Army’s 250th anniversary parade in Washington, D.C. The June 15 event, billed as a semiquincentennial celebration, drew support from President Donald Trump and sparked a wave of criticism among crypto advocates who see the move as politically charged and out of step with the ethos of decentralization. The backlash erupted shortly after Adam Cochran, a partner at venture capital firm Cinneamhain Ventures, took to social media platform X on June 16 to announce that he would be exiting all of his positions in Coinbase — including stocks, bonds, and crypto holdings — in protest of the sponsorship. Cochran said the decision wasn’t just personal, but also a reflection of broader concerns about Coinbase’s evolving alignment with government and military interests. The military parade, which coincided with Donald Trump’s 79th birthday, unfolded against a backdrop of intensifying political division in the US and a growing debate over the role of tech companies in partisan affairs. Critics point out that while the event was marketed as a patriotic celebration, it bore distinctly political overtones given the president’s involvement and the timing of the event. Adding to the national unrest, a tragic and possibly politically motivated attack occurred the same day, claiming the lives of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband. The attacker reportedly attempted to target a state senator and his wife as well. Meanwhile, protests erupted across major US cities, with nearly five million people demonstrating against the Trump administration’s policies — including the militarization of urban areas and deportations without due process. In this volatile climate, Coinbase’s decision to sponsor a military event has been perceived by many as a tacit endorsement of political and institutional power, at odds with the crypto community’s founding ideals. Crypto's Cultural Identity at a Crossroads Online reaction has been swift and impassioned. X user Captain Nemo encapsulated the sentiment of many disillusioned users by arguing that the sponsorship betrayed the very principles that birthed the crypto movement. The discontent taps into a longstanding tension within the crypto industry — between those who view blockchain as a tool for individual empowerment and resistance to centralized authority, and those seeking mainstream legitimacy and institutional partnerships. Coinbase, which has long maintained a policy of staying out of “political causes,” now finds itself increasingly entangled in the very issues it once claimed to sidestep. This isn’t the first time Coinbase has courted controversy over its political affiliations. The company contributed $1 million to Trump’s 2017 inauguration fund and has been actively lobbying for regulatory clarity in Washington, D.C. CEO Brian Armstrong attended a March 2025 crypto summit hosted by the president and pushed for the passage of a stablecoin regulation bill in May. Coinbase’s chief policy officer, Faryar Shirzad, also announced during the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas that the company would sponsor the 2026 semiquincentennial celebration. A source familiar with the matter said that the company’s recent parade sponsorship was a one-time financial contribution to America250 — a nonprofit, nonpartisan initiative tasked with organizing events to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the United States. However, critics argue that even indirect participation in politically loaded events carries consequences, particularly for a company representing an industry built on the promise of neutrality and financial freedom. A Battle for Crypto’s Narrative As Coinbase continues to grow its political and regulatory footprint, the crypto industry is being forced to confront uncomfortable questions: Can companies truly remain nonpartisan while engaging in government-led celebrations? Does participation in national events necessarily imply endorsement of a political regime? For some, Coinbase’s latest sponsorship represents a natural progression of crypto’s maturation — a sign that digital assets are becoming part of the mainstream financial and political fabric. For others, it marks a betrayal of crypto’s roots and a warning that the original vision of a decentralized, apolitical internet economy is at risk of being co-opted. With another controversial sponsorship lined up for 2026, Coinbase may need to do more than just explain its intentions — it may need to redefine what it stands for in the eyes of the community it helped bring into the mainstream.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-17 05:30:00

The long term price action of KSM token will heavily depend on the mainstream adoption of its Parachains, the Polkadot ecosystem. The Kusama (KSM) network remains a vital component of the Polkadot (DOT) chain, a layer-0 blockchain. The relatively low circulating supply of KSM tokens has helped it attract investors in the past, but has been criticized for its 10 percent annual inflation. The future growth prospects of KSM tokens will remain dependent on the mainstream adoption of Parachains and the ability of the project to navigate the changing regulatory landscape. Most importantly, the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystem must offer competitive services to developers in order to remain relevant amid rival chains such as Cosmos . .shortcode_title h6 { font-size: 14px; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left: 5px; } .top-gainer { background: transparent; border-radius: 10px; padding: 0; margin-bottom: 15px; } .top-markets { background: #fff; padding: 10px 10px 3px; border: 1px solid #eee; text-align: center; border-radius: 8px; position: absolute; z-index: 99; } .top-gainers-loosers ul { padding-left: 0 !important; margin-left: 0; overflow: auto; white-space: nowrap; } .top-gainer h2 { font-size: 16px; } .top-gainers-loosers ul li .top-gainer-desc { background: #fff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; } .top-gainer-desc h4 { font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 22px;}.top-gainer-desc .color-green { color: #0DA71D; font-size: 12px; font-weight: 300; line-height: 20px; float: right;}.color-green img, .color-red img { width: 12px; display: initial;} .top-gainers-loosers ul li { padding: 5px; width: 200px; margin: 0 !important; vertical-align: top;}.top-gainer h3 { font-size: 13px; margin-top: 0px; font-weight: 500; max-width: 150px; white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; }.top-gainer-desc h3 span{ color: #171717B2; font-weight: 400;}.top-gainer-desc .color-red { color: #ff3e55; font-size: 12px; font-weight: 500; line-height: 20px; float: right;}.top-gainers-loosers .curve-image{border-radius: 50%;}/* .top-gainers-loosers ul::-webkit-scrollbar { height: 5px; border-radius: 50px;} *//* .top-gainers-loosers ul::-webkit-scrollbar-track { background-color: #f1f1f1; } */.top-gainers-loosers ul::-webkit-scrollbar { display: none; /* Hides the scrollbar in WebKit browsers */}/* For Firefox */.top-gainers-loosers ul { scrollbar-width: none; user-select: none;}.circle-image{ border-radius:50px;} Market Top Gainer Turbo Trump/ TURBO $ 0.000258 126.260% Wall Street Pepe/ WEPE $ 0.000079 67.794% OpenZK Network/ OZK $ 0.000447 45.494% Treasure/ MAGIC $ 0.169523 42.799% Altlayer/ ALT $ 0.034460 33.815% document.addEventListener(""DOMContentLoaded"", function () { const gainersContainer = document.querySelectorAll('.top-gainers-loosers'); gainersContainer.forEach(container => { const list = container.querySelector('ul'); // Select the first ul within this container // Attach event listeners for drag scrolling list.addEventListener('mousedown', handleMouseDown); list.addEventListener('mouseleave', handleMouseLeave); list.addEventListener('mouseup', handleMouseUp); list.addEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove); });});// Named functions for handling eventslet isDown = false;let startX;let scrollLeft;function handleMouseDown(e) { isDown = true; this.classList.add('active'); // Optional: for styling active state startX = e.pageX - this.offsetLeft; scrollLeft = this.scrollLeft;}function handleMouseLeave() { isDown = false; this.classList.remove('active'); // Optional: remove active state}function handleMouseUp() { isDown = false; this.classList.remove('active'); // Optional: remove active state}function handleMouseMove(e) { if (!isDown) return; // Stop the function from running if mouse is not down e.preventDefault(); // Prevent text selection const x = e.pageX - this.offsetLeft; const walk = (x - startX) * 2; // Scroll-fast this.scrollLeft = scrollLeft - walk;} Overview Cryptocurrency Kusama Token KSM Price $ 14.76290276 -2.13% Market cap $ 245,717,854.2635 Circulating Supply 16,644,277.7728 Trading Volume $ 13,885,653.9173 All-time high $ N/A All-time low $ N/A 24 High Coming soon 24 Low Coming Soon Kusama Price Prediction for 2025 Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $496 $621 $745 Kusama (KSM) price in the weekly price has been forming a macro reversal pattern after being trapped in a macro bearish consolidation since 2022.

His message was clear to the crypto investors that the UK has a chance to move ahead of other countries, especially as the US continues to struggle with unclear crypto regulations . A Call for Clarity and Competitiveness The visit signals Coinbase’s strong interest in the UK. Armstrong’s call for regulatory clarity aligns with the company’s broader push to expand internationally. He believes that if the UK can create a solid legal framework, it could attract more institutional investment and crypto talent. This would also send a clear message to the wider European market that the UK is open to crypto innovation. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Companies Buying Bitcoin in 2025 – MicroStrategy No Longer Alone , Backing Innovation, One Product at a Time Armstrong’s visit follows recent product developments from Coinbase, including the launch of its Bitcoin Card with improved cashback features.

The court found that these companies misled users, broke important rules, and hid the real control of the business. This comes after WazirX faced a $235 million hack last year, making things even harder for its users. Fake Votes and Withheld Truths The case took a major turn when the court declared a recent user vote conducted by WazirX as invalid. Judge Tan stated that users were misled, as key information was intentionally kept from them. The vote, which appeared democratic on the surface, turned out to be a carefully planned act that denied users the opportunity to make a truly informed decision. Judge Tan noted that, without the court’s intervention, thousands of users would have been misled, with WazirX escaping accountability. 2/ 1. The Lie at the Heart of the Vote Singapore Court found that #WazirX orchestrated a misleading user vote. Judge Kristy Tan ruled users were not given full disclosure & couldn’t make an informed choice. The vote = invalid. A crushing blow to WazirX’s credibility. pic.twitter.com/w9ikXjZ4Pl — TOOFAAN (@TOOFAANARMY) June 16, 2025 Zettai Operating Illegally in Singapore The court went further, declaring Zettai’s operations illegal in Singapore, as the company lacked a Digital Token Service Provider (DTSP) license and had no plans to apply for one. Shockingly, Zettai’s legal team admitted in court that they never intended to apply for the required DTSP license. This isn’t a case of ignorance—it’s an intended violation of local laws. Hidden Control by Zensui Panama Adding to the controversy, it was revealed that the real control behind the scenes wasn’t Zettai, but Zensui, a Panama-based entity . This fact was deliberately hidden from users and regulators alike. The court criticized the year-long delay and legal drama as a waste of public resources, all to maintain a false narrative. India Compliance Also Ignored The court also highlighted WazirX’s refusal to register with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), further exposing a pattern of avoiding regulations in multiple countries. With the restructuring plan rejected, WazirX’s future is uncertain. The company has announced plans to appeal but has also begun shifting operations to Panama under the Zensui brand. For millions of users, the hope of recovering lost funds is now even more distant.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-17 05:42:22

According to a June 16 report shared on X, Polyhedra ( ZKJ ) says the crash began when several wallets pulled large amounts of liquidity from the ZKJ/KOGE pool on PancakeSwap ( CAKE ) and quickly sold off millions of tokens. One address withdrew over $4.3 million in liquidity and dumped around 1.57 million ZKJ. At least five other wallets followed similar patterns, all within minutes. These actions severely weakened market depth and triggered sharp price drops in an already fragile liquidity structure. Because the KOGE/USDT pool had little liquidity, the selling pressure spilled into the more liquid ZKJ/USDT pool, deepening the crash. During the same period, crypto trading firm Wintermute sent over 3.39 million ZKJ to centralized exchanges like Bybit. Between 12:45 and 14:14 UTC, the price dropped from $1.92 to $0.29.

Over $94 million in long positions were closed in just two hours, with multiple trades over $1 million liquidated around 12:57 UTC. These forced sales made the price fall faster. Adding to the pressure, recent changes to Binance’s Alpha Points program increased the fragility of the liquidity pool. Before the crash , traders were using the ZKJ/KOGE pair to farm Binance Alpha points. However, Binance decreased rewards for these trades earlier in June, which caused the pool to become less stable. Polyhedra said it added $30 million in liquidity during the crash to help support the price. But most of this was converted into ZKJ as the price fell. The crash also came just days before 15.53 million ZKJ tokens are set to unlock on June 19. This added to fears about more selling. The top 10 wallets hold nearly 69% of the supply, raising speculation about more coordinated exits. ZKJ has recovered slightly and is trading at $0.42, up 23% in the past 24 hours. Polyhedra’s team is conducting further investigations and has pledged token buybacks. Still, analysts warn that the bounce may be short-lived, with risks of further volatility as the token unlock approaches.

Alta, an innovative AI Fashion Tech startup, has successfully closed an $11 million seed funding round, signaling strong investor confidence in its vision. This development is particularly interesting for those following advancements in artificial intelligence and its practical applications, even extending into areas like personal digital assets and future consumer experiences. What is Alta AI and How Does it Work? At its core, Alta AI is designed to be your personal styling agent and shopper, bringing a concept previously seen in films like ‘Clueless’ into reality. Founded by Jenny Wang, the platform leverages advanced artificial intelligence to help users curate outfits and make purchasing decisions based on a variety of factors including their existing wardrobe, budget, lifestyle needs, current weather, and even their calendar appointments. Key features of the Alta platform include: Virtual Wardrobe Digitization: Users can upload their existing clothes by taking photos, forwarding digital receipts, or searching the Alta database. AI-Powered Outfit Recommendations: Based on user input and wardrobe data, Alta suggests suitable outfits for specific occasions or conditions. Personalized Virtual Avatar: Users can visualize how recommended outfits look on a personalized digital avatar. Mix-and-Match Functionality: The platform allows users to combine items they already own with potential purchases to see how they work together. This innovative approach to AI Styling aims to make getting dressed easier, more efficient, and more personalized than ever before. Significant Venture Capital Funding Fuels Growth The announcement of an $11 million seed round marks a significant milestone for the Fashion Tech Startup . The funding was led by prominent venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, known for backing impactful technology companies. This substantial investment at the seed stage highlights the perceived potential of Alta’s technology and business model in capturing a significant share of the burgeoning personal styling market. Jenny Wang described the fundraising process as ‘aligned,’ emphasizing the strategic nature of the investors brought on board. The capital infusion will be primarily directed towards expanding the team and accelerating research and development efforts. Wang noted, “Our team is continuously updating our in-house models and improving the experience based on community feedback,” indicating a commitment to ongoing technological advancement and user-centric development. An All-Star Investor Lineup Beyond Menlo Ventures, Alta’s seed round attracted a remarkable group of investors, blending traditional venture capital with strategic figures from the fashion, technology, and media worlds. This diverse backing underscores the broad appeal and potential market reach of the Alta AI platform. Notable investors include: Benchstrength Algaé Ventures (the investment firm linked to fashion’s prestigious Arnault family of LVMH) Phenomenal Ventures (founded by Meena Harris) Anthroptic’s VC arm, Anthrology fund The angel investor list is equally impressive, featuring: Meredith Koop (Michelle Obama’s stylist, who helped train Alta’s AI) Tony Xu (DoorDash CEO and co-founder) Supermodels Jasmine Tookes and Karlie Kloss Jenny Fleiss (Rent the Runway co-founder) Manish Chandra (Poshmark CEO and co-founder) Tech influencer Zita d’Hautville This combination of venture capital and strategic industry experts provides Alta not only with necessary capital but also invaluable expertise and network connections crucial for scaling a Fashion Tech Startup . Jenny Wang’s Vision for AI Styling For Jenny Wang, the launch of Alta is the culmination of years of contemplating the potential for a personal styling agent. A Harvard engineer by training with a background in various tech roles, including investment and technical advising, Wang recognized that while the idea existed, the artificial intelligence technology was not mature enough to build the sophisticated, intuitive product she envisioned. Now, she believes the technology has caught up, making platforms like Alta AI feasible and impactful. Wang remains deeply involved in the technical side, stating, “I am still actively coding every day and learning from our team and technical advisors.” This hands-on approach from the founder, combined with a team described as both highly technical and fashion-obsessed, positions Alta to innovate rapidly in the competitive AI Fashion Tech space. Expanding Reach and Partnerships With the fresh Venture Capital Funding , Alta is already moving quickly on strategic partnerships and geographic expansion. The company has partnered with the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) to offer its services to their membership base, providing direct access to fashion professionals and brands. Geographically, Alta is expanding its presence. Wang relocated from San Francisco to New York City, recognizing NYC as a growing hub for consumer AI companies and its proximity to European fashion centers like Paris. Collaborations with LVMH-connected investors and influencers like Zita d’Hautville are aiding expansion into Europe. Furthermore, a partnership with Marie Kondo is facilitating expansion throughout parts of Oceania and the Pacific, adding a unique angle focused on wardrobe organization and mindfulness alongside styling. The long-term plan includes partnering with retailers worldwide, creating a seamless ecosystem where users can get styling advice and directly discover or purchase items. The Future of AI Styling Alta is part of a new wave of consumer technology companies leveraging advanced AI to solve everyday problems and enhance user experiences. While other players like Whering and Cladwell, and even tech giants like Google and Pinterest, are exploring similar areas, Alta believes its approach, built on new technical architectures and user interfaces, will create a more compelling and effective styling and shopping experience. This successful Venture Capital Funding round provides Alta with the resources to pursue this vision aggressively. The blend of cutting-edge AI, strategic fashion industry connections, and strong technical leadership positions Alta as a significant player to watch in the future of fashion and technology. As AI Fashion Tech continues to evolve, platforms like Alta could fundamentally change how we interact with our wardrobes and the brands we love.

While Eric Trump dismissed claims of participation, he and Sun have a documented business history. This includes Sun’s $30 million investment in World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto platform linked to the Trump family. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s 2025 financial disclosure revealed $57.4 million in income from WLFI, where he holds over 15 billion governance tokens. Additionally, Trump’s Truth Social filed with the SEC to launch a Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, with Crypto.com as the proposed custodian. This move was made despite the intense scrutiny over the Trump family’s deepening ties to crypto. Eric Trump Dismisses Tron Deal Rumors Eric Trump, son of US President Donald Trump, denied claims that he will be involved in the Tron blockchain’s upcoming public offering in the United States, despite expressing admiration for Tron founder Justin Sun. “I’m the biggest fan of Tron,” Trump shared on social media, and praised Sun as a “great friend and icon in the crypto space,” but dismissed a report by the Financial Times that suggested he would participate in the venture. Tron’s plans to go public involve a reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed SRM Entertainment, which will be renamed Tron Inc. as part of the transition. The deal also includes a $100 million private equity investment to establish a large TRX treasury. Tron currently ranks as the ninth-largest blockchain network globally, with a market cap of $26.16 billion. Tron’s all-time market cap (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Trump and Sun’s business ties date back to November when Sun became the largest investor in World Liberty Financial by acquiring $30 million worth of WLFI tokens. Eric Trump played a pivotal role in shaping World Liberty Financial, which is a crypto platform closely associated with his family. The Trump family’s involvement in the crypto sector deepened earlier this year with the launch of American Bitcoin, a mining company preparing for a public debut via merger with Dryphon Digital Mining. Since April , the company accumulated 215 BTC, worth approximately $23.3 million. Eric Trump believes Bitcoin is a critical global asset, and called its accumulation an international “arms race” due to interest from sovereign wealth funds, ultra-wealthy families, and major corporations. Despite the financial success, the Trump family’s growing involvement in cryptocurrency attracted a lot of scrutiny from members of Congress, who raised questions about the overlap between political influence and business interests. Trump Discloses Major WLFI Income US President Donald Trump himself recently disclosed earning $57.4 million from his involvement with World Liberty Financial. The income was revealed in his 2025 financial disclosure , which was filed with the US Office of Government Ethics on June 13. According to the filing, Trump holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in World Liberty Financial, which also grant him voting rights. While the document does not provide a specific valuation or structure for the tokens, the substantial income figure implies that Trump either sold part of his holdings or that the tokens were valued highly for disclosure purposes. The reported gain is listed as “$57,437,927” and attributed to token sales. Trump’s WLFI earings World Liberty Financial launched in September of 2024 with a focus on decentralized finance and stablecoins, and it raised approximately $550 million through two token sales. The first round brought in $200 million, and a second round in early 2025 raised an additional $250 million. The project positions itself as a challenger to traditional finance and attracted a lot of backing from the crypto industry. In addition to Justin Sun, Web3Port contributed $10 million in January, while Oddiyana Ventures joined as a strategic investor, although the size of its investment was not disclosed. Trump’s digital asset involvement extends beyond World Liberty Financial. While his latest filing does not show new revenue from previous ventures like Trump Digital Trading Cards, it does reflect the still ongoing connections to entities like CIC Digital and CIC Ventures. These companies are tied to his past Web3 and NFT efforts, though they appear to be inactive or generating minimal income at present. The President’s certification on the ethics filing confirms that the information provided is accurate to the best of his knowledge and is now subject to review by the Office of Government Ethics. Truth Social Files for Bitcoin and Ether ETF The Trump-crypto ties deepened after US President Donald Trump’s social media platform, Truth Social, recently filed an S-1 registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a dual exchange-traded fund (ETF) focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum. The proposed fund is named the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, and will be sponsored by asset manager Yorkville America Digital. A crypto ETF is a fund that allows investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum without directly owning them. It tracks crypto prices and is traded on traditional stock exchanges, which simplifies access and reduces custody risks. Party of Truth Social’s S-1 filing The main goal of Truth Social’s fund is to simplify crypto investment by offering shares backed by BTC and ETH. According to the filing, the digital assets will be held by Crypto.com’s trust arm, Foris DAX Trust Company, serving as the crypto custodian for the ETF. The ETF is intended to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange Arca, though the fund’s ticker and cash custodian details haven not been disclosed yet. Truth Social explained that further details, including its prime execution agreement with Crypto.com, will be included in a later amendment to the filing. This ETF filing was made shortly after the SEC approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury registration, which followed the company’s $2.5 billion capital raise in May to acquire Bitcoin, despite initially denying such plans. The firm stated that it has no immediate plans to issue securities under the approved deal. Coinciding with Truth Social’s ETF filing, CoinShares also submitted a separate S-1 application on the same day, proposing a Solana spot ETF for US investors. CoinShares already operates a similar Solana ETP in Europe and is now looking to expand its footprint to the US market. With this addition, there are now at least eight Solana spot ETF applications under SEC review, including proposals from Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, and Canary Capital. Despite this growing interest, analysts suggest that an approval for a Solana ETF is unlikely in the immediate future.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-17 05:54:42

In an X post, Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink , says this regulatory clarity will unlock a wave of new stablecoins, not just in the US but around the world. However, with that growth comes rising expectations for transparency, security, and compliance.

Chainlink is… — Sergey Nazarov (@SergeyNazarov) June 17, 2025 Stablecoins Will Need More Than Just Backing Nazarov points out that future stablecoins won’t survive on branding alone. To become widely adopted across the digital economy and tokenized funds market, they’ll need real-time proof that they’re fully backed. They’ll also need to work across multiple blockchains, as users and institutions demand seamless movement of assets between different networks. This is where Chainlink steps in. Nazarov says it’s currently the only platform offering both proof of reserves and cross-chain connectivity in one system, a key advantage as new stablecoins enter a more competitive and regulated environment. Compliance and Identity Are the Next Frontiers Looking ahead, regulators are expected to push for more identity and compliance requirements on-chain. Nazarov highlights that Chainlink is already preparing for this next phase. In addition to tracking reserves and enabling cross-chain payments, the platform is also building tools for identity verification and low-friction compliance. With these layers in place, Chainlink aims to become the first system that can deliver reserves, connectivity, identity, and compliance under one roof. Managing Complexity with Simplicity As blockchain transactions grow in complexity, Nazarov argues that most platforms will struggle to keep up. Chainlink’s vision is to offer a unified framework where all necessary services can be configured and controlled through one workflow using its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). This approach is meant to give stablecoin issuers, institutions, and developers a simple way to manage complex systems, offering all the required infrastructure through a single piece of code. With stablecoins poised to play a central role in the future of finance, Chainlink is betting big on becoming the backbone that keeps them secure, connected, and compliant from day one. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

One area drawing significant attention is stablecoins – cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar. A crucial piece of legislation aiming to bring clarity and structure to this market is now on the cusp of a major step forward. Get ready, because the US Senate is poised for a pivotal vote. What is the GENIUS Act and Why Does it Matter for Stablecoin Regulation ? The bill in question, officially known as the GENIUS Act (Guaranteeing an Exceptional National Investment Unified System Act), represents a significant legislative effort to establish a comprehensive framework for stablecoin regulation in the United States. It’s not just another proposal; it’s a bill that has navigated the complex waters of Washington D.C. and is now heading towards a decisive moment in the Senate. At its core, the GENIUS Act seeks to address key concerns surrounding stablecoins, aiming to ensure their stability, protect consumers, and prevent illicit use. Here are some of the main pillars of the proposed legislation: Dollar-Backed Reserves: A primary requirement is that stablecoin issuers must hold reserves equivalent to the value of the stablecoins they issue. These reserves are mandated to be held in safe, liquid assets, primarily U.S. dollars or highly liquid dollar-denominated assets. This aims to ensure that stablecoins are truly backed 1:1, providing confidence in their value peg. Audits for Large Issuers: The bill proposes stricter oversight for larger stablecoin issuers, likely defined by market capitalization or transaction volume. These entities would be subject to regular, independent audits to verify their reserve holdings and operational compliance. Transparency through audits is seen as essential for market integrity. Consumer Protections: The legislation includes provisions designed to protect individuals and businesses using stablecoins. This could involve requirements for clear disclosure of risks, mechanisms for complaint resolution, and rules around the handling of customer funds. The goal is to prevent scenarios like the collapse of algorithmic stablecoins that led to significant user losses. Licensing and Supervision: While details are still being debated, the bill likely establishes a framework for stablecoin issuers to be licensed and supervised by relevant financial regulators, potentially the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) or state banking regulators, working in coordination with federal bodies like the Federal Reserve and Treasury. Passing a robust stablecoin bill is seen by many as a critical step for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in the global financial system as digital assets become more integrated. It could provide the necessary regulatory certainty for businesses to build on stablecoin technology and for consumers to use them safely. How Has the GENIUS Act Gained Traction in the US Senate ? Achieving bipartisan support in the current political climate is no small feat, yet the GENIUS Act has managed to build a degree of consensus. Initial versions of stablecoin legislation faced hurdles, particularly regarding how to handle foreign stablecoin issuers operating within the U.S. market and the extent to which non-financial corporations could be involved in stablecoin issuance. According to reports, including insights from The Block, revisions were made to the GENIUS Act to address these concerns. These changes appear to have broadened its appeal, bringing together lawmakers from both sides of the aisle who recognize the need for clear rules in the rapidly expanding digital asset space. The ability to find common ground on key aspects like reserve requirements and consumer protection has been instrumental in propelling the bill to the Senate floor for a vote. The bipartisan nature of the support is significant because it increases the likelihood of the bill passing the Senate and potentially becoming law. It signals a growing understanding among policymakers that ignoring or outright banning stablecoins is not a viable long-term strategy, and that a balanced regulatory approach is needed. What Challenges and Controversies Surround This Stablecoin Bill ? Despite gaining bipartisan support, the path to enactment for the GENIUS Act is not entirely smooth. Like many pieces of legislation touching upon the complex world of crypto, it faces scrutiny and raises specific controversies. One notable point of contention highlighted in initial reports is the connection between U.S. President Trump and World Liberty Financial, a stablecoin issuer reportedly co-founded by his sons. While the GENIUS Act is said to include provisions restricting current government officials from having direct involvement in stablecoin issuance or related businesses, the language reportedly does not explicitly extend these restrictions to immediate family members. This has raised ethical questions and concerns about potential conflicts of interest, adding a layer of political complexity to the bill’s consideration. Other challenges inherent in regulating stablecoins include: Defining ‘Stablecoin’: Ensuring the legal definition is broad enough to cover various types of stablecoins (fiat-backed, commodity-backed, etc.) but specific enough to provide clarity. Balancing Innovation and Regulation: Finding the right balance that protects consumers and financial stability without stifling technological innovation in the crypto space. Enforcement: Determining which agencies will have primary oversight and how enforcement actions will be coordinated, especially for globally operating issuers. Interoperability: Considering how U.S. stablecoin regulation will interact with regulatory efforts in other countries. These challenges underscore the difficulty of crafting effective crypto regulation in a fast-moving sector. How Does the GENIUS Act Compare to Other Efforts in Crypto Regulation ? The GENIUS Act isn’t the only game in town when it comes to digital asset legislation in the U.S. The House of Representatives has also been working on its own versions of stablecoin bills, often with different approaches or priorities. According to The Block, there is speculation that the House might consider adopting the Senate’s GENIUS Act version rather than pushing its own through. This potential move is attributed to the broader bipartisan support the GENIUS Act has garnered in the Senate, which could make it easier to pass through both chambers of Congress. Harmonization between the House and Senate is crucial for any bill to reach the President’s desk. This situation highlights a broader trend in U.S. crypto regulation – a fragmented approach across different committees and chambers of Congress, as well as various regulatory agencies (SEC, CFTC, Treasury, Fed, etc.). The push for a dedicated stablecoin law like the GENIUS Act represents an attempt to create specific, tailored rules for this asset class, rather than trying to fit stablecoins awkwardly into existing securities or banking frameworks. The success of the GENIUS Act could set a precedent for how future crypto-specific legislation is developed and passed, potentially paving the way for more comprehensive digital asset laws down the line. What Actionable Insights Can We Gain from the GENIUS Act’s Progress? The impending vote on the GENIUS Act offers several key takeaways for anyone involved in or observing the cryptocurrency market: Regulatory Clarity is Approaching (for Stablecoins): While not a full crypto bill, the GENIUS Act signals that concrete, asset-specific regulation is becoming a reality in the U.S. Stablecoin issuers, users, and developers should pay close attention to the final requirements. Bipartisan Support is Possible: The fact that a significant stablecoin bill has achieved bipartisan backing demonstrates that common ground on certain aspects of crypto regulation can be found in Washington. This offers a glimmer of hope for future legislative efforts. Political Connections Remain a Factor: The controversy surrounding the Trump family’s ties to a stablecoin issuer underscores the political dimensions of crypto regulation and the potential for conflicts of interest to influence policy debates. House and Senate Coordination is Key: The potential for the House to adopt the Senate’s bill highlights the legislative process’s need for compromise and alignment between the two chambers. Impact on the Stablecoin Market: If passed, the GENIUS Act will fundamentally change how stablecoins operate in the U.S., potentially increasing confidence for institutional adoption while imposing stricter compliance burdens on issuers. For users and investors, a regulated stablecoin market could offer increased safety and predictability. For businesses, it could provide the certainty needed to integrate stablecoins into their operations. However, it will also mean navigating new compliance landscapes. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Stablecoins The upcoming US Senate vote on the GENIUS Act is undoubtedly a defining moment for stablecoins and broader crypto regulation in the United States. This stablecoin bill , with its focus on reserve requirements, audits, and consumer protection, represents the most significant legislative push yet to bring clear rules to this vital segment of the digital asset market. While challenges and controversies, including political connections, persist, the bill’s bipartisan support suggests a genuine momentum towards establishing a foundational framework. The outcome of this vote will not only shape the future of stablecoins in the U.S. but could also influence global regulatory approaches. It underscores the transition of cryptocurrencies from a niche technology to a subject of serious national policy debate. Whether the GENIUS Act passes as is, is amended, or faces further delays, its journey through the Senate highlights the growing urgency among lawmakers to address the complexities and opportunities presented by digital assets.

However, some analysts believe that the cryptocurrency will continue its sideways move for the coming weeks before its next big move. Related Reading: Will The Bitcoin Price Move Above $110,000 Again? Global M2 Money Supply Shows What’s Next Ethereum Eyes Range High Resistance Last week, Ethereum attempted to reclaim the $2,800 barrier, hitting a three-month high of $2,879. However, the market shakeout, fueled by the Iran-Israel conflict, sent the cryptocurrency’s price to retest its local range’s lows before recovering over the weekend. Notably, ETH has been hovering between the $2,400-$2,680 range since the early May market recovery, which saw the King of Altcoins surge from the $1,800 mark toward its current price range for the first time in three months. Nonetheless, it has been rejected from the local range’s resistance four times in the past month. Market watcher Daan Crypto Trades noted that Ethereum’s price action has been consolidating between these two key levels, compressing just below the $2,800 area. This level has been a crucial area throughout the cycle, serving as a key support and resistance level since 2024. The trader considers this area to be “the most important level on this entire chart by far,” detailing that every major retest of this zone has led to either “a nice bounce” or “big dump.” Meanwhile, ETH “went on to really even further” after every reclaim of this level as support. Daan explained that its current price range is “becoming quite a tight range for how long it’s been trading here. You can see how important this is and that there’s likely a big move coming from this point somewhere in the next few weeks.” Based on this, he forecasted that “If we’d see a convincing break above $2.8K and hold there, that would be a good setup for a move to the cycle highs around ~$4K.” However, if it loses this current range, then the $2,100 area “is the big high timeframe level to watch.” Is A 2017 Repeat In The Making? Merlijn The Trader highlighted that Ethereum is now consolidating within its current range after breaking out of a multi-month falling wedge, which suggests that the cryptocurrency could soon experience a massive move. He pointed out that, historically, “this pause often precedes a surge,” adding that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also retesting the recent breakout zone. Additionally, the trader noted that ETH appears to be following its 2016-2017 playbook, with a similar structure to eight years ago. At the time, the cryptocurrency had an “explosive setup” that led ETH to a massive lift-off starting in 2017. After the market shakeout, the cryptocurrency moved sideways within a tight range while reclaiming the 50-day Moving Average (MA).

According to Merlijn, “Same breakout zone. Same 50 MA reclaim. Sideways chop… then liftoff. But this time? Bigger market. Institutional fuel is backing ETH. No ceiling in sight. We’re not repeating history… We’re amplifying it.” As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,640, a 3.7% increase in the daily timeframe.

The OpenAI Microsoft partnership has been a cornerstone in the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, but recent reports suggest significant strain. For those tracking the fast evolution of technology, including in the crypto space where AI tools are increasingly relevant for analysis and trading, understanding these foundational shifts is key. A Wall Street Journal report, citing anonymous sources, indicates the relationship is facing serious challenges. What’s Causing the Strain in the OpenAI Microsoft AI Partnership? The core of the reported tension in the OpenAI Microsoft AI Partnership appears to revolve around control and strategic direction. OpenAI is reportedly seeking greater autonomy, particularly concerning its valuable Intellectual Property and the computing resources it relies on. The recent $3 billion acquisition of the AI coding startup, Windsurf, has reportedly become a major flashpoint in this dynamic. OpenAI reportedly wants to ensure that Windsurf’s intellectual property remains under its sole control and is not automatically accessible to Microsoft, fearing it could directly benefit or enhance Microsoft’s competing offerings, such as GitHub Copilot. This disagreement highlights a fundamental struggle over who ultimately controls and benefits from valuable AI assets developed or acquired within the framework of their collaboration. Is OpenAI Seeking Independence from Microsoft’s Cloud Computing Power? A significant area of reported contention is OpenAI’s desire to reduce its dependence on Microsoft’s extensive Cloud Computing infrastructure, Azure. While Microsoft’s cloud resources were undeniably crucial for OpenAI’s rapid scaling and early development, sources suggest OpenAI is now actively exploring ways to diversify its infrastructure providers. This reported move towards greater independence in Cloud Computing presents a complex challenge for OpenAI. Despite seeking more autonomy, the startup still requires Microsoft’s approval for critical business transformations, including its planned conversion to a for-profit entity. The need for massive, scalable computing power is fundamental to developing and deploying cutting-edge AI Technology , making cloud reliance a strategic vulnerability OpenAI reportedly aims to mitigate. The Fight for Control Over AI Technology and Future Direction The tension reportedly extends to the broader direction and control of cutting-edge AI Technology itself. The report mentions that OpenAI executives considered taking drastic steps, including the possibility of publicly accusing Microsoft of anticompetitive behavior related to the terms and execution of their partnership agreement. They also reportedly mulled seeking a formal federal regulatory review of their contract with Microsoft. These reported considerations point to deep-seated concerns within OpenAI about the power dynamics at play and potential limitations imposed by the partnership on its ability to innovate and deploy AI Technology freely. The struggle over access to and control of Intellectual Property is central to this reported fight for technological autonomy and future strategic direction. Challenges and Implications for the AI Ecosystem If the relationship between OpenAI Microsoft continues to deteriorate significantly, it poses considerable challenges for both companies and carries broader implications for the wider AI Partnership ecosystem. For OpenAI, a strained relationship could impact crucial funding streams and access to necessary computational resources required for continued innovation in AI Technology . For Microsoft, tensions could affect its strategic position in the competitive AI market, potentially limiting its access to OpenAI’s latest models and advancements. The uncertainty surrounding this critical AI Partnership could potentially slow down collaborative innovation and influence how AI Technology is developed, governed, and commercialized globally. Understanding these high-level corporate dynamics is important for anyone tracking major shifts in the tech landscape that often ripple out into adjacent sectors like cryptocurrency and decentralized technology. Summary The reported widening cracks in the OpenAI Microsoft AI Partnership reportedly stem from fundamental disagreements over the control of valuable Intellectual Property , strategic reliance on Cloud Computing resources, and the overall direction of AI Technology development. The standoff concerning the Windsurf acquisition is highlighted as a key example of this growing tension. While the partnership initially fueled significant growth for OpenAI, the startup is reportedly seeking greater independence, even considering potentially drastic actions like regulatory review or public accusations. The future trajectory of this crucial AI Partnership remains uncertain, with potential consequences for both involved parties and the broader landscape of AI Technology development and deployment.

The application , submitted on June 15, seeks protection for the name “JPMD” and outlines a wide scope of blockchain and digital currency functions, suggesting a broader strategy to expand the bank’s role in crypto payments and asset settlement. The US Patent and Trademark Office filing lists dozens of services tied to digital currency. These include payment processing, token issuance, currency trading, digital custody, and electronic fund transfers, all powered by blockchain and distributed ledger technology. While the word “stablecoin” is not explicitly mentioned, the filing’s language hints at a platform that could support one. The world’s largest bank, JPMorgan, has filed a trademark for what appears to be a stablecoin called ‘JPMD’ pic.twitter.com/LQg09Ga2LG — db (@tier10k) June 16, 2025 Filing Echoes Key Features Needed for a Scalable Stablecoin The timing of the move has drawn attention. Just weeks earlier, Wall Street Journal reported that JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo were exploring the launch of a joint stablecoin venture . Sources told the outlet that the goal was to compete with crypto-native stablecoins and streamline both domestic and cross-border payments. This latest trademark filing adds weight to those reports. In particular, JPMorgan’s description of providing real-time digital token trading, electronic transfers, and clearing via distributed ledger technology mirrors many of the technical functions required to operate a stablecoin at scale. Analysts believe the bank could be laying the legal and operational groundwork for such a product. JPMorgan Moves Ahead As Congress Debates Stablecoin Rules JPMorgan is no stranger to blockchain. Its Kinexys platform, previously known as Onyx, has already processed more than $1.5 trillion in interbank payments using JPM Coin, a private stablecoin backed 1:1 by fiat currency. JPM Coin is currently limited to institutional clients, but the new filing suggests the bank may be preparing for a broader, possibly retail-facing, rollout. The move also comes just as lawmakers in Washington begin debating new rules around stablecoins. The US Senate recently voted to advance the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan bill that could establish a regulatory framework for dollar-backed digital tokens. If passed by both chambers of Congress, the legislation would head to President Trump’s desk later this year. Whether “JPMD” will emerge as a publicly available token or simply expand JPMorgan’s institutional capabilities remains unclear. But with the financial sector rapidly converging on blockchain infrastructure, the trademark marks yet another step by a Wall Street heavyweight toward a more digital future.

Ferguson stated that in the current economic conditions, the central bank is operating in a “wait-and-see” mode and must be patient. Ferguson said, “The Fed will not cut interest rates at this meeting or even the next one. They hope inflation will decline further, but they will continue to be cautious.” He said the Fed will send “vigilant and patient” messages to the market in its statements this week, and that this situation may disappoint some segments. Ferguson said that what is described as a “good rate cut”, that is, a rate cut made only when inflation falls without a slowdown in the economy or a disruption in the labor market, does not seem likely this year. “The Fed came very close to a soft landing this year, but there are still many risks. Perhaps a more clear picture emerges next year and if inflation continues to decline, a limited rate cut may be on the agenda,” he said. Related News: BREAKING: Donald Trump's Son Eric Trump Denies Connection to Surprise Altcoin - Price Reacted The program also brought up geopolitical risks in the Gulf and the possible effects of oil prices. Ferguson argued that the increases in oil prices have not been reflected in core inflation so far, but that this could change and that the FED should be careful. When the presenters reminded him of President Trump’s approach of “cutting interest rates now while inflation is low, and raising them later if necessary,” Ferguson approached this suggestion cautiously. “In the past, inflation has been short-lived in the downward trend. There is also the risk that inflation expectations will deteriorate. The FED was late to address inflation in the previous cycle. They don’t want to make the same mistake again,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

Is it buzzing with excitement, or is everyone hiding under their digital beds? That’s where the Crypto Fear & Greed Index comes in. It’s a fascinating tool designed to capture the prevailing crypto market sentiment , giving us a snapshot of whether investors are feeling bullish or bearish. As of June 17, this widely watched index, provided by Alternative, registered a significant jump, climbing seven points to hit 68. This places it firmly within the ‘Greed’ territory, a notable shift that suggests optimism is currently running high in the market. But what exactly does this number tell us, and how should we interpret it in the context of broader crypto market trends ? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: More Than Just a Number The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t pulled out of thin air. It’s a composite index ranging from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). Its goal is to help traders and investors understand if the market is overly fearful (potentially a buying opportunity) or overly greedy (potentially due for a correction). The philosophy is rooted in investor psychology – extreme fear can lead to panic selling, while extreme greed can fuel FOMO-driven buying, neither of which is sustainable long-term. The index aggregates data from six key factors, each weighted differently: Volatility (25%): Measures how much the Bitcoin price and other major cryptocurrencies are fluctuating. Higher volatility in a positive direction often indicates a greedy market, while high volatility downwards points to fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares current volume and market momentum with average values. High buying volume in a rising market suggests greed. Social Media (15%): Analyzes posts and hashtags related to crypto on platforms like Twitter. High levels of positive, hype-driven posts can signal greed. Surveys (15%): Gathers sentiment from weekly polls. (Note: As of the original data, surveys were paused, meaning this component’s weight might be temporarily redistributed or the overall calculation adjusted). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear as investors move away from altcoins into the perceived safety of BTC, or greed if Bitcoin is leading a strong rally. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Rising search interest can reflect increasing public curiosity and potential FOMO (greed). By combining these factors, the index aims to provide a holistic view of the market’s emotional state, offering insights into prevailing crypto market trends . What Does a Reading of 68 (Greed) Imply for the Crypto Market? A reading of 68 places the index squarely in the ‘Greed’ zone (typically defined as 55-74). This suggests that investors are feeling confident and optimistic about the market’s direction. Historically, readings in the upper ‘Greed’ or ‘Extreme Greed’ zones have sometimes preceded market pullbacks, as high optimism can lead to overextension and increased risk-taking. Conversely, periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ (0-24) have often coincided with market bottoms, presenting potential buying opportunities for those brave enough to enter against the prevailing mood. While a high ‘Greed’ reading isn’t a guaranteed sell signal, it serves as a yellow flag, reminding investors to exercise caution. It highlights that the market is running on high octane optimism, which can make it more susceptible to sharp reversals if sentiment shifts. Connecting Investor Psychology to Bitcoin Price Movements There’s a strong correlation between investor psychology , as reflected by the Fear & Greed Index, and Bitcoin price movements. When the index is low (fear), it often means people are selling due to panic or uncertainty, pushing prices down. When the index is high (greed), it indicates strong buying pressure, often driven by excitement and the fear of missing out (FOMO), which helps propel prices upward. Observing how the index interacts with the Bitcoin price can be a valuable exercise. Does a sustained period of high greed align with a parabolic price increase? Does a sudden drop into fear coincide with a sharp price correction? While correlation doesn’t equal causation, the index provides a useful lens through which to view price action, understanding the emotional backdrop driving it. Using the Index to Navigate Crypto Market Trends So, how can you actually use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index in your own strategy? Here are a few actionable insights: As a Contrarian Indicator: Some investors use the index as a contrarian tool. The saying goes, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” A high greed reading might prompt a contrarian investor to consider taking profits or reducing exposure, while a low fear reading might encourage them to look for buying opportunities. Gauge Market Fatigue: A prolonged period in the ‘Greed’ or ‘Extreme Greed’ zone, especially when combined with other technical indicators showing potential overbought conditions, can suggest market fatigue and the potential for a correction. Confirming Trends: If you believe the market is in an uptrend, seeing the index rise into ‘Greed’ can confirm that positive sentiment is supporting the move. Conversely, a drop into ‘Fear’ during a downturn confirms negative sentiment is dominant. Not a Standalone Tool: It’s crucial to remember the index is just *one* indicator. Never rely solely on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for investment decisions. Always combine its insights with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and a thorough understanding of overall crypto market trends . Understanding the interplay between the index and investor psychology is key to using it effectively. Challenges and Limitations While insightful, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t without its limitations: Data Sources: The index relies on specific data sources. Changes in these sources or temporary pauses (like the surveys) can affect its accuracy. Interpretation: What constitutes ‘Extreme Greed’ or ‘Extreme Fear’ can be subjective and might evolve with market maturity. Lagging vs. Leading: The index is often seen as a reflection of *current* sentiment rather than a predictor of *future* price movements. While extreme readings *can* precede reversals, they don’t guarantee them. Focus on Bitcoin: Although it considers the broader market through momentum/volume, factors like Bitcoin dominance and Google Trends specifically focus on BTC, potentially making it less sensitive to sentiment shifts in the altcoin market specifically. Using the index requires nuance and an awareness that it’s a sentiment gauge, not a predictive model. Conclusion: Navigating Greed in the Crypto Market The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 68, keeping it in the ‘Greed’ zone, signals a period of heightened optimism and confidence among crypto investors. This level of ‘Greed’ is a direct reflection of prevailing crypto market sentiment , influenced by factors ranging from Bitcoin price action and market momentum to social media buzz and search interest. While positive sentiment can fuel further gains, a high ‘Greed’ reading also serves as a timely reminder that markets driven by excessive optimism can be prone to sharp corrections. Understanding the index, its components, and its limitations allows investors to better gauge the emotional climate of the market and integrate this insight into a more comprehensive strategy for navigating the ever-evolving crypto market trends . It’s a valuable tool for understanding collective investor psychology , but it should always be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis.

Although DOGE hasn’t seen its $4 milestone in sight, its entrenched meme-energy and retail momentum make it a staple in 2025.

Priced at just $0.03, MUTM is rapidly gaining momentum across social media and crypto circles, with growing whispers of reaching $4 before summer ends.

Although it is yet to regain the retail-driven peaks of the previous bull run, DOGE is still traded actively with high liquidity and a firmly established community base. According to analysts, the future performance of Dogecoin will be reliant on the overall sentiment changes and possible triggers related to the social momentum or platform integrations like X (formerly Twitter). In the meantime, new projects, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) begin to gather some interests also priced under $0.40. Certik Audited and Ready to Soar Security is a top priority for Mutuum Finance.

This transaction occurred as Circle’s stock reached new heights, prompting questions and discussions among investors about ARK’s strategy. What’s Behind the Strategic ARK Invest Sale of Circle Stock? On June 16, ARK Invest divested a substantial portion of its position in Circle (CRCL), selling a total of 342,658 shares. This sale was particularly noteworthy because it took place on a day when Circle’s stock experienced a significant surge, hitting a new intraday high of $165.60. The shares ultimately closed the day at $151.06, marking a 13.1% increase for the day and an impressive nearly five-fold return compared to its initial public offering (IPO) price of $31. The total value of the shares sold amounted to approximately $57.1 million based on the closing price. This strategic move was spread across three of ARK Invest’s flagship exchange-traded funds (ETFs): the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), and the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF). These ETFs are known for their focus on disruptive innovation and technology companies, including those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. Details of the Circle Share Sale: Date: June 16 Shares Sold: 342,658 Approximate Value: $57.1 million ETFs Involved: ARKK, ARKW, ARKF Context: Occurred on a day Circle stock hit a new intraday high ($165.60) and closed significantly above its IPO price ($31). Who is ARK Invest and Why Does Circle Stock Matter for Crypto Investment? ARK Invest, founded by Cathie Wood, has become a prominent name in the investment world, particularly for its high-conviction approach to investing in disruptive technologies. The firm’s research-driven strategy often leads it to take significant positions in companies poised to reshape industries through innovation, including areas like artificial intelligence, genomics, robotics, and fintech, which encompasses significant crypto investment exposure. Circle, on the other hand, is a key player in the digital asset ecosystem. While perhaps best known as the co-creator and principal operator of the USDC stablecoin, one of the largest dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, Circle also offers various fintech services for businesses building on digital currencies and blockchain technology. Its potential or realized public listing has been closely watched as a bellwether for the broader adoption and financial market integration of crypto-native businesses. For ARK Invest, an investment in Circle represents a direct play on the growth of regulated stablecoins and the infrastructure supporting the digital economy. Circle’s performance is tied to the expansion of the stablecoin market, regulatory clarity, and the overall health of the crypto landscape, making its stock a relevant holding for funds focused on the future of finance. Analyzing the Implications for ARKK ETF Holders and the Market The decision by ARK Invest to sell Circle stock, especially at a time of price strength, raises several potential interpretations. For holders of ARKK ETF, ARKW, and ARKF, understanding the rationale behind such a move is crucial. Potential Reasons for the Sale: Profit Taking: Given Circle’s significant appreciation from its IPO price and the recent surge, selling shares could be a simple case of taking profits off the table after a successful run. This is a standard portfolio management practice to lock in gains. Portfolio Rebalancing: As a stock’s value increases significantly within a portfolio, its weighting can become larger than desired. ARK may have sold shares to bring Circle’s position back in line with their target allocation across the ARKK ETF and others. Risk Management: Selling into strength can also be a form of risk management, reducing exposure to a single position, especially in a volatile market or ahead of potential future market shifts. Capital Allocation: ARK may see more compelling opportunities elsewhere in the market and is reallocating capital from a position that has performed well to fund new or existing positions with potentially higher future growth prospects. While some might interpret a sale as a lack of conviction, ARK’s strategy often involves actively managing positions based on their evolving research and market conditions. Selling a portion of a holding does not necessarily mean they are exiting the position entirely or have lost faith in the company’s long-term potential. It’s a dynamic process of capital allocation. Cathie Wood’s Vision: Navigating the Future of Fintech and Stablecoins Cathie Wood has consistently expressed a bullish long-term outlook on disruptive technologies, including the role of digital currencies and blockchain in the future of finance. ARK Invest’s holdings often reflect this vision, including companies involved in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader crypto ecosystem. Circle’s position as a leader in the stablecoin market aligns with this vision, as stablecoins are seen by many as a critical bridge between traditional finance and the decentralized digital economy. The regulatory environment for stablecoins is still evolving globally, presenting both opportunities and challenges for companies like Circle. ARK’s trading activity in Circle stock likely considers these complex factors, aiming to balance conviction in the long-term trend with tactical adjustments based on market dynamics and regulatory developments. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors following ARK Invest or holding positions in their ETFs, this sale highlights the active management style employed by the firm. It’s a reminder that portfolio composition is fluid and subject to change based on market performance, valuation, and evolving research. Instead of solely reacting to individual trades, investors might consider: Understanding ARK’s Rationale: While specific reasons for every trade aren’t always disclosed immediately, ARK often communicates its broader themes and research. Following their research updates can provide context. Looking at the Bigger Picture: Evaluate Circle’s fundamentals, the growth of the stablecoin market, and the regulatory landscape independently, rather than just focusing on ARK’s buy/sell decisions. Considering Diversification: Relying solely on one fund or manager’s decisions carries risks. Diversifying across different investment strategies and asset classes remains a core principle of sound investing. The $57 million sale of Circle shares by ARK Invest is a significant event, reflecting active portfolio management in response to market conditions and the performance of a key holding. It underscores the dynamic nature of investing in rapidly evolving sectors like fintech and crypto investment, where strategic decisions are constantly being made to navigate growth opportunities and manage risks.

Key Takeaways: Daily active XRP addresses have surged 7x to 295,000, signaling renewed network engagement. Whale wallets holding over 1 million XRP have hit a record high, suggesting rising institutional interest. Derivatives volume has spiked nearly 300%, pointing to heightened short-term speculation rather than long-term accumulation. The spike in interaction marks a 7x increase, pointing to renewed interest in the network, according to data from Santiment . Alongside growing usage, the number of whale wallets holding over 1 million XRP has reached an all-time high of 2,700 — a milestone not seen in the 12-year history of the protocol. Whale Surge Signals Rising Confidence in XRP Ledger The rise in large holders may reflect growing institutional or high-net-worth conviction in XRP’s long-term value. XRP is trading at $2.2373 at press time, up 2.7% on the day, with prices ranging between $2.10 and $2.32 over the past week. Trading volumes have surged, jumping 248% in the past 24 hours, indicating heightened market attention. The XRP ledger is showing serious signs of growth, from both a usage and key stakeholder perspective. The amount of interacting $XRP addresses has averaged over 295K per day over the past week. Its normal daily average over the past 3 months was approximately 35-40K. … pic.twitter.com/RvxE8BSFAg — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 16, 2025 According to Coinglass, open interest has risen 3% to $4.02 billion, while derivatives volume has soared by nearly 300% to $9.57 billion. The data points to a burst of short-term speculative trading rather than steady accumulation — a pattern that may precede sharp price movements in either direction. The XRP shift may also reflect broader developments. On June 11, VivoPower, a publicly listed firm, announced a partnership with the Flare blockchain to generate yield from its XRP holdings. The move could indicate that institutional players are looking for ways to leverage their crypto assets without liquidating them. In May, VivoPower also invested $121 million in XRP as a strategic reserve, making it the first company in the world with an XRP-focused treasury. XRP Continues to Consolidate XRP is currently trading near $2.236, following a period of volatile price action across different timeframes. On the daily chart, the RSI is holding around 53, suggesting neutral momentum with no clear overbought or oversold conditions. Meanwhile, the MACD line has just crossed above the signal line, a potential early signal of short-term bullish momentum. The 4-hour chart reflects a recent pullback after touching a local high of $2.35. RSI has cooled to 42, and MACD shows bearish crossover with widening divergence, indicating that bulls are losing control in the short term. This aligns with a dip back into the lower Bollinger Band region, hinting at possible support around $2.21. On the 1-minute chart, price action is consolidating tightly between $2.23 and $2.24. RSI and MACD are both flattening, confirming indecision among traders. With volume remaining modest, no breakout appears imminent at the moment. If XRP holds above the 20-period SMA on the 4H, a rebound toward $2.30 remains in play. However, failure to defend $2.21 support could open the way for further downside toward $2.10.

If this week does not close in green, then it is likely that sellers will break this support and take the asset to $0.55, where the next key support is found. Chart by TradingView 2. Low Momentum Interest in Cardano appears to be at a low point following a disappointing May and a poor start to June. Without any buyers at current levels, the only option left for ADA is to trend lower until interest returns. For this reason, a drop to $0.55 appears likely. Chart by TradingView 3. Falling Volume The daily volume continues to make lower lows. As long as this trend continues, it is unlikely for this cryptocurrency to reverse course.

According to data from Yahoo Finance, SRM Entertainment’s stock, selling under the ticker SRM, recently reached new heights after Sun announced his blockchain company Tron ( TRX ) is set to go public in a reverse merger involving the Florida-based company. The SRM stock hit its highest peak by late June 16, reaching a high of 10.84, making the 10-fold leap from its initial 1.48 price just a day prior. Upon market close, SRM was still riding the high that followed after the Tron announcement made headlines, closing at 9.19. Compared to its previous close, at 1.45 on June 13, the theme park supplier saw a 533% increase. Not only that, but the trading volume multiplied from an initial 2.05 million in shares to 250 million in trading volume. In turn, Tron’s price also jumped to nearly $0.30 following the announcement. At press time, the token has gone up by nearly 2.5%, trading at a price of $0.28. Its current price stands 35% below its previous all-time high of $0.43 from December last year. This meteoric rise in the Nasdaq -listed SRM stock was mostly fueled by its recent $210 million-reverse merger with Justin Sun’s Tron. However, the merger also resulted in the company considering a complete name change and a new treasury strategy.

Additionally, the company elected Tron founder Justin Sun as an advisor for the Florida firm. It also declared that it has received a $100 million equity investment from a “private investor.” As previously reported by crypto.news, the merger was arranged by boutique investment bank Dominari Securities.

The 2025 HYPE price suggests it could enter the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap with continued growth. Forecasts suggest that HYPE could reach a potential average price by 2030 of around $125, with highs up to $185. The crypto market is buzzing with excitement over Hyperliquid and its native token, HYPE. As a decentralized, paperless alternative to platforms like Binance and Coinbase, Hyperliquid is quickly gaining traction, prompting investors to look closely at the HYPE price prediction for 2025 and beyond . With its unique “HyperBFT” consensus mechanism, lightning-fast transactions, and zero KYC hurdles, Hyperliquid is rewriting the rules of perpetual trading. But does its innovative model signal long-term growth for HYPE Token Price? In this article, we dive deep into market sentiment and Hyperliquid price projections from 2025 to 2030.

As per DUNE charts, it is seen that in trading volume, it sat just behind DyDx in trading volume, but in July and August 2024, the tide started to turn in HYPE’s favor. The derivatives volume crossed $197 billion in January 2025, and like dYdX and others, lost its spot, and even by April, the volume hovered near the same benchmark it set in January. However, the performance in May exceeded that of January as derivatives volume shot up by over $248 billion derivative volume. This shows that people are using the Hyperliquid a lot, and its adoption is increasing strongly. Moreover, compared to Binance, Hyperliquid highlights’s steady growth. The chart clearly shows that in 2025, in comparison to Binance losing spot trading volume, the Hyperliquid’s perpetual trading volume is continuously rising, as if people are exiting Binance and taking a ride on Hyperliquid’s platform. Apart from on-chain, the HYPE price on the daily chart is super optimistic. As it recently pumped a symmetrical triangle breakout, which cleared its $39 hurdle in May. Now, the successful breach has raised its price potential for a higher move ahead. Presently, its price is sustaining near the newly developed all-time high, but it appears that it will soon be testing the $50 psychological mark in June. Meanwhile, for the year-end 2025, the target is much higher and goes beyond $80. If the momentum continues, the price of HYPE will give maximum return, unlike any other altcoin. If it clears $50 in Q2 2025 with a significant move, then its price clearing $80 in upcoming Q3 and Q4 wouldn’t be much of a surprise, and it could become the top 10 crypto by market cap.

While sellers managed to hold back a breakout, this appears imminent if buyers continue the pressure. Once $2.3 turns into a support, then XRP has a good shot to revisit $2.6. Chart by TradingView 2. Momentum Turning Bullish Another sign that bulls are having the upper hand right now can be seen on the momentum indicators. The daily MACD and RSI are curving up with clear higher lows. If XRP moves beyond $2.3, then higher highs are likely. While this is promising, buyers need to break $2.3 to confirm this bias. Chart by TradingView 3. MACD Bullish Cross The daily MACD did a bullish cross today. This is a clear indication that this cryptocurrency wants to go higher.

Lehmann added that deployment of the zkEVM has never been upgraded to use blobs, and the chain is currently running at a loss of more than $1 million per year. The organization has revealed its plans to phase out Polygon zkEVM by 2026, marking the end of its zero-knowledge scaling efforts. The Ethereum side-chain also plans to pivot, focusing on the PoS and AggLayer with leadership from CEO Nailwal. Nailwal becomes CEO of Polygon Foundation Agglayer will usher in the next phase of the Internet : The Trustless Internet https://t.co/zFjR3LGzAF — Sandeep | CEO, Polygon Foundation (※,※) (@sandeepnailwal) June 16, 2025 Sandeep Nailwal, CEO and co-founder of Polygon Foundation, believe that with a healthy treasury and several hundred million in cash, Polygon is in a great position to keep building for the long term. Nailwal disclosed that Polygon PoS will focus on stablecoin payments and real-world assets (RWA) while AggLayer will continue in its efforts to build a trustless Internet of Blockchains. The foundation’s co-founder said the first milestone of the Polygon PoS’s Gigagas roadmap is live in testnet and will push network capacity beyond 1,000 transactions per second in early July, which is only the start. Nailwal disclosed that blockchain already plans to move to zero reorgs and 1-second finality with >5000 TPS achieved in a devnet environment. “I’ve always stayed away from moving into the CEO role because I’ve been focused on building PF as an institutionally governed foundation. But right now, Polygon needs clear direction and focused execution and that means stepping up.” – Sandeep Nailwal , CEO and Co-founder of Polygon Foundation. The firm believes the new upgrade will put Polygon PoS amongst the most performant blockchains by September to October. The company also said it has a clear path to scale to 100k+ TPS over the next few years. According to Nailwal, the upgrades increase the economic viability of the protocol and, thereby, the value of POL stakes. As part of the company’s plans for AggLayer, the CEO said that AggLayer v0.3, which has been in the pipeline for some time, will launch on June 30 with improved features. Nailwal added that the AggLayer v0.3 is complete except for its fast interop, which the company anticipates will be completed by the end of Q3. According to the organization, the AggLayer Breakout program will continue to spin off projects, resulting in an increased focus on Polygon PoS and Agglayer and massive airdrops to POL stakers. Nailwal also highlighted that the firm was in the business of building blockchain networks, and ZK is an important tool for bringing internet-level scalability to blockchains. Polygon hopes to spin out more zero-knowledge research efforts Polygon noted that it has contributed a lot to ZK and will continue to do so in a more neutral way by spinning out more of ZK’s research efforts. Nailwal unveiled the firm’s next project, Polygon Zisk, which will be led by Jordi Baylina. Polygon said it was excited to see several large market makers returning to the table recently to make markets in POL after the SEC dropped its investigations and lawsuits related to MATIC as a security. Nailwal added that the Foundation will also engage in educational campaigns to ensure everyone is aware of the upgrade of MATIC to POL. Nailwal noted that during 2021-22, the company tried to institutionalize the project by laying the foundation for scaling the blockchain through stages. Ethereum later got into an existential crisis that pulled Polygon and the entire Ethereum ecosystem right back to the initial stages. He revealed that POL has been dragging lower as Ethereum layer-2 solutions like Base and Arbitrum increase in TVL.

Constructing a Parallel Dollar Network: Reframing Payment Architecture While the U.S. dollar has long dominated cross-border payments, the existing system suffers from structural inefficiencies: high transaction costs, slow settlement times, strict regulatory oversight, and widespread financial exclusion. Against this backdrop, stablecoins offer a permissionless, highly liquid, near-instant payment alternative underpinned by blockchain technology and pegged to the dollar. Key advantages include: Instant settlement and real-time clearance enabled by blockchain’s unified transaction structure; Borderless circulation that only requires wallet access and internet connectivity; Integration with multi-chain ecosystems and payment APIs , with tokens like USDT and USDC now deployed across Ethereum, Tron, and Solana; Functioning simultaneously as settlement assets and stores of value , particularly useful in high-inflation economies where they increasingly substitute for local fiat. In effect, stablecoins are forming a more efficient, inclusive, and censorship-resistant on-chain dollar network. Use cases are rapidly expanding — from individual remittances in Latin America, where residents rely on USDT amid currency devaluation, to SME trade settlements in FX-restricted countries. These networks dramatically enhance the efficiency of cross-border payments, digital commerce, and Web3 transactions, while also offering dollar-based financial access to the world’s 1.3 billion unbanked. More Than Payment Tools: Stablecoins’ Role as “On-Chain Shadow Banks” Despite their technical and economic advantages, stablecoins face regulatory, liquidity, and privacy challenges. Their disintermediating nature also raises strategic concerns among central banks and legacy payment networks. Meanwhile, stablecoins are increasingly performing the role of “shadow banks”— effectively acting as on-chain money market funds by transforming fiat deposits into short-term Treasuries while minting on-chain tokens. This architecture enables stablecoins to scale U.S. dollar liquidity across decentralized ecosystems, but it also challenges the traditional monopoly central banks hold over credit creation and monetary issuance. The lack of globally harmonized regulation raises risks related to transparency, systemic liquidity, and user trust. Regulatory Convergence Driving Institutionalization of Stablecoins The growing role of stablecoins in cross-border payments has prompted heightened regulatory attention worldwide. While mature markets such as the U.S. and EU are developing frameworks emphasizing compliance, capital adequacy, and reserve transparency, Asian jurisdictions are exploring hybrid approaches that balance innovation with oversight. HTX Ventures emphasizes that the regulatory certainty and technological neutrality of stablecoins will be decisive in determining whether they can serve as the “dollar infrastructure of the digital age.” Clear policy coordination and cross-border regulatory harmonization will be essential to unlocking their full potential in global finance. HTX Expands Stablecoin Ecosystem, Accelerates Global Payment Strategy As an exchange advocate for stablecoin adoption, HTX is actively expanding its stablecoin offering to fortify its position within the global crypto ecosystem. Since May, HTX has listed six new stablecoins: USD1, EURR, USDR, EURQ, USDQ, and AETHUSDT . Among them, USD1 , issued by World Liberty Financial — an initiative linked to the Trump family — has garnered particular attention amid the evolving U.S. regulatory landscape. HTX was the first platform globally to list USD1 and has expanded its support for BTC/USD1 and ETH/USD1 trading pairs to further enrich its ecosystem. These new listings enhance users’ flexibility in managing assets across multiple chains and currencies, while unlocking new use cases in high-frequency trading, on-chain hedging, and programmable payments. The initiative reflects HTX’s strategic vision to support a robust, multi-rail global stablecoin infrastructure.

The announcement was made in a June 17 press release by the Paris-listed firm (Euronext: ALTBG.PA), which is pursuing a long-term strategy of increasing the amount of Bitcoin ( BTC ) per share it holds. The funding was secured through an “At-The-Market type” capital raise with asset manager TOBAM, where 1.6 million new shares were issued at an average price of €4.49. That price reflected a 20.76% discount from the stock’s June 13 close, due to market volatility during the raise. The capital raise allows The Blockchain Group to continue adding BTC to its balance sheet, as part of a broader treasury strategy that started in late 2024. https://twitter.com/_altbg/status/1934854391451775360?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw You might also like: Michael Saylor’s Strategy strengthens Bitcoin bet with 10,100 BTC purchase This strategy mirrors capital market moves made by firms like Strategy and Japan’s Metaplanet, both of which hold significant amounts of Bitcoin. The Blockchain Group is one of the first in Europe to follow this path, aiming to accumulate up to 260,000 BTC, currently about $24 billion, by 2033. The recent capital raise saw TOBAM, through three of its funds, subscribe to all 1.6 million shares. The largest tranche went to the TOBAM Bitcoin CO2 Offset Fund, which acquired over 834,000 shares. The other two funds, the Bitcoin Treasury Opportunities Fund and the Blockchain Equity Fund, took the remaining portion. As a result, TOBAM now holds 3.3% of The Blockchain Group’s capital on a fully diluted basis. The capital raise follows a shareholder vote on June 11 that increased the company’s fundraising capacity to €500 million in nominal value. That resolution passed with over 95% approval, underlining strong investor support for the Bitcoin pivot. On a fully diluted basis, the company’s share count now exceeds 313 million, factoring in all potential conversions from bonds, free share grants, and warrants. The Blockchain Group’s model draws on the idea that Bitcoin is a long-term hedge against inflation and fiat currency risks. The company, which also develops decentralized tech, AI, and data tools, believes BTC can protect shareholder value and offer stronger returns than traditional treasury reserves.

With no major policy shifts expected, traders are watching closely for signals on rate cuts, inflation trends, and macro risks. The crypto market, already tense from recent volatility, is showing mixed performance with XRP leading gains among major tokens. Bitcoin Wobbles Amid Geopolitical Tensions Bitcoin briefly topped $108,000 in early U.S. hours on Monday before sliding to $106,500 on profit-taking. It later bounced back above $107,000 during Asian trading on Tuesday. The movement follows Friday’s $1.2 billion in futures liquidations, which forced out overleveraged traders and weighed heavily on altcoins through the weekend. Despite the choppy action, Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $1.4 billion in net inflows last week, reinforcing their growing role as stabilizers during volatile periods. Analysts suggest Bitcoin’s slow response to macroeconomic stress could change if investors seek alternative safe-haven assets. “Bitcoin typically lags behind gold and oil during geopolitical events, but if risk sentiment turns, BTC could quickly regain momentum,” said Eugene Cheung of OSL . XRP Takes the Lead as Altcoins Recover While most major altcoins are still recovering from the weekend drawdown, XRP stood out with a strong rebound. XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, is trading at $2.17 with a 0.77% daily gain, backed by a $128.23 billion market cap and $1.74 billion in volume. It continues to hold a strong position, supported by growing interest in institutional banking integration. Ethereum ticked up 1.5% to $2,609 but continued to trail Bitcoin’s ETF-fueled performance. Solana and Tron also posted modest gains, but sentiment across altcoins remains cautious. Meanwhile, Gold and oil surged early Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump unexpectedly urged the evacuation of Tehran during the G7 summit. The geopolitical jolt sent investors rushing into defensive assets, while Bitcoin’s response remained subdued. XRP Outperformed Bitcoin This Cycle, Says Analyst Crypto analyst Nick pointed out that XRP has gained more than 678% since its 2022 low, beating Bitcoin’s 565% rise. He added that XRP’s total gains this cycle have already topped 1,000%, and the rally isn’t over yet. According to him, XRP has outpaced both Bitcoin and Ethereum in this bull run so far. Fed Holds the Spotlight All eyes are now on the Fed. Market watchers expect interest rates to remain unchanged, but the tone of Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks could set the course for crypto and equities alike. With inflation easing and jobs data holding firm, officials may opt for patience, though some, like SignalPlus’ Augustine Fan, believe a dovish tilt could be signaled subtly. The near-term outlook remains tied to the Fed’s message and the unfolding tensions in the Middle East. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Recently, a substantial SOL transfer has put the spotlight back on the remnants of the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange, FTX. Specifically, approximately 252,847 SOL tokens, valued at a staggering $39.72 million based on recent prices, were moved from Coinbase Prime to an FTX cold wallet . This significant transaction, first highlighted by blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain on X, raises questions and provides insights into the ongoing process surrounding the FTX bankruptcy . Unpacking the Specifics of the SOL Transfer Let’s break down the details of this particular SOL transfer that occurred roughly 11 hours before the initial report. Understanding the specifics helps us grasp the potential implications: Asset: Solana (SOL) Amount: 252,847 SOL Approximate Value: $39.72 million (at the time of the transfer) Source: Coinbase Prime Destination: FTX Cold Wallet Timing: Approximately 11 hours prior to the Lookonchain report Source of Information: Lookonchain (via X) This movement isn’t just a simple transfer; it involves significant entities in the crypto space. Coinbase Prime is known for serving institutional clients, suggesting the assets were likely held there on behalf of the FTX estate or related parties. The destination, an FTX cold wallet , points towards a deliberate move for secure storage, likely as part of the asset consolidation efforts managed by those overseeing the bankruptcy. Why an FTX Cold Wallet? Understanding Asset Management in Bankruptcy The fact that the destination was an FTX cold wallet is highly significant, especially in the context of the exchange’s insolvency. But what exactly is a cold wallet, and why is FTX using them now? A cold wallet is a type of cryptocurrency wallet that is not connected to the internet. This offline nature makes them far less susceptible to online hacking attempts, offering a high level of security for storing digital assets. For an entity like FTX, which collapsed spectacularly amidst allegations of mismanagement and fraud, securing remaining assets is paramount. In the midst of the FTX bankruptcy proceedings, the priority is to identify, recover, and secure all available assets to eventually distribute them to creditors. Large holdings of cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) represent a substantial portion of the estate’s value. Moving these assets into secure, offline cold storage is a standard, prudent measure taken by bankruptcy administrators and liquidators to prevent further loss or theft while the complex process of asset valuation and distribution unfolds. Think of it like a company going bankrupt and consolidating all its valuable physical inventory into a highly secure warehouse. The digital equivalent for crypto assets is moving them into cold wallets. Solana (SOL) and its Complex Relationship with FTX The choice of asset in this large transfer – Solana (SOL) – is particularly noteworthy given the historical ties between the Solana ecosystem and FTX/Alameda Research. Sam Bankman-Fried’s entities were significant early investors and proponents of Solana. As a result, FTX and Alameda held substantial amounts of SOL tokens. This close relationship meant that when FTX collapsed, the fate of its large SOL holdings became a major point of discussion and concern within the crypto market. The Solana (SOL) price has shown resilience and significant recovery since the FTX collapse, but the potential for large sales from the FTX estate has always loomed as a supply-side risk. Movements like this SOL transfer are often interpreted by the market as steps taken by the bankruptcy estate to prepare assets for potential future liquidation or distribution. Key points regarding FTX’s SOL holdings: FTX/Alameda were early and large holders of SOL. These holdings are a significant asset for the bankruptcy estate. The release or sale of these tokens is part of the creditor repayment plan. Movements to cold wallets are often precursors to more active management or potential sales. While a transfer to a cold wallet doesn’t automatically mean an immediate sale, it signifies that the assets are being actively managed and secured as part of the ongoing resolution process for the FTX bankruptcy . Navigating the FTX Bankruptcy Process The FTX bankruptcy is one of the most complex in cryptocurrency history. It involves multiple entities, millions of creditors, and a vast, sometimes difficult-to-trace, pool of digital assets spread across various platforms and wallets. The process is overseen by court-appointed administrators (like the new management team led by John J. Ray III) and involves legal proceedings in multiple jurisdictions. The primary goal of the bankruptcy process is to maximize the value of the remaining assets and distribute them equitably among validated creditors. This involves: Asset Identification and Recovery: Finding and taking control of all assets belonging to FTX and Alameda. Asset Consolidation and Security: Moving recovered assets to secure locations, like the FTX cold wallet in this instance. Asset Valuation: Determining the current market value of the recovered assets. Claim Adjudication: Reviewing and validating creditor claims. Asset Liquidation/Distribution: Selling assets (like SOL) or distributing them in kind to creditors according to a court-approved plan. This recent SOL transfer fits squarely into steps 1 and 2 – the recovery and consolidation of assets. It indicates that the administrators are continuing to gather and secure the estate’s holdings, preparing them for later stages of the bankruptcy process. It’s a necessary, albeit often market-moving, step towards resolving the claims against the defunct exchange. Why This is Crucial Cryptocurrency News Movements of this magnitude by the FTX estate are always significant cryptocurrency news . Here’s why: Market Impact: Large transfers from known bankruptcy estates can signal potential future selling pressure, which can influence market sentiment and price predictions for the affected asset (in this case, Solana (SOL) ). Transparency: Blockchain explorers provide transparency into these movements, allowing the public and market participants to track the actions of the FTX estate. This contrasts with the opacity that characterized FTX’s operations before its collapse. Bankruptcy Progress Indicator: These transfers serve as milestones, indicating that the FTX bankruptcy process is actively moving forward, albeit slowly. It shows assets are being managed and secured. Creditor Confidence: For creditors awaiting repayment, seeing assets being consolidated and secured in an FTX cold wallet can offer a degree of reassurance that the recovery process is progressing. Staying informed about such developments is vital for anyone involved in the crypto market, whether as an investor, trader, or simply an observer of the industry’s evolution and challenges. This cryptocurrency news highlights the ongoing efforts to clean up the aftermath of one of the largest failures in crypto history. Potential Implications and What to Watch For While the immediate impact of moving SOL to a cold wallet is increased security, the market often interprets such moves as preparation for potential sales. The FTX estate has received court approval to sell assets over time to repay creditors, with limits and procedures in place to manage market impact. What should you watch for next? Further Transfers: Will more SOL or other assets be consolidated? Transfers to Exchanges: Movements from cold wallets to exchanges would be a stronger signal of impending sales. Official Announcements: The FTX estate may provide updates on its asset management and distribution plans. Market Reaction: Observe how the Solana (SOL) price reacts to future confirmed movements or sales by the estate. The process of liquidating or distributing assets from a bankruptcy estate is complex and often involves strategic timing to minimize negative market impact. However, the sheer volume of assets held by FTX means any significant action will likely be closely scrutinized and discussed as major cryptocurrency news . Conclusion: A Step in the Long Road to Resolution The transfer of $39.72 million worth of Solana (SOL) to an FTX cold wallet from Coinbase Prime is more than just a large transaction; it’s a visible step in the painstaking and prolonged FTX bankruptcy process. It underscores the ongoing efforts by administrators to secure assets and prepare them for eventual distribution to those harmed by the exchange’s collapse. For followers of cryptocurrency news , this movement serves as a reminder that the aftermath of FTX continues to unfold, with significant implications for assets like Solana (SOL) and the broader market landscape. While not necessarily signaling immediate sales, it confirms that the estate is actively managing its substantial holdings as it works towards a resolution for creditors.

Presale crypto tokens are evolving fast, and 2025 is packed with new opportunities. But not all token presales offer real value. Many come with hype, but few deliver utility. That’s where Angry Pepe Fork stands out. It doesn’t just ride meme coin momentum. It adds layers of utility that early investors demand. In a market flooded with crypto coins on presale, Angry Pepe Fork brings staking, CommunityFi, and GambleFi to the table. It’s already raised $240k in just a few days. That kind of traction signals it may be the best crypto presale to buy right now for long-term rewards and real engagement. Angry Pepe Fork Builds a Utility Meme Ecosystem Angry Pepe Fork ($APORK) is not just about memes. It’s designed as a utility-focused token with a viral edge. The project launched its presale with strong fundamentals and a clear plan. Already, it has raised over $240k with each $APORK token priced at just $0.0269. That early momentum positions it well among the top crypto presales of 2025. The ecosystem combines several income streams for users. One of the biggest attractions is staking during the presale. Ethereum buyers can earn over 10,000% APY just for getting in early. The longer you wait, the lower your returns. $APORK also introduces GambleFi—a suite of play-to-earn mini-games powered by smart contracts. Players use their tokens to enter, and winners receive $APORK payouts. To maintain token value, a portion of each prize pool is burned after payout, supporting long-term price appreciation. With support for Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Solana, Angry Pepe Fork is accessible and ready to scale. Add exclusive contribution-based rewards, and you’ve got a serious player in the pre-sale cryptocurrency market. If you’re looking to buy presale crypto with real mechanics, this project stands out in every crypto presale list. Angry Pepe Fork CommunityFi Turns Action Into Rewards Angry Pepe Fork introduces CommunityFi—an innovation few crypto presale projects offer. This system rewards every action that brings attention to the project. You don’t need deep pockets to earn. Instead, you contribute to the community and get paid in $APORK tokens. It works like this. Spread the word on social media, post memes, or just engage in discussions. Each activity earns you rewards based on your level of involvement. This makes Angry Pepe Fork more inclusive than most new crypto token presales. It’s not just about early investment. CommunityFi ensures that anyone can support the project and grow with it. That feedback loop brings more exposure and strengthens the value of the entire ecosystem. Even if you’re not buying huge amounts of tokens, you can still benefit and earn.

Avail , backed by Founders Fund, Dragonfly, and other top VCs, is powering some of Web3’s most forward-looking projects, including Lens, Sophon, Space & Time, Lumia, Skate, and leading institutional tokenization platforms. The rollout of the full Avail Stack enables seamless connections between chains to build a scalable and interoperable blockchain in the future. Avail is focused on building an interconnected Web3 that allows networks to move assets and communicate while abstracting away user complexities to create a unified in-app experience. The Avail Stack, a full-scale blockchain infrastructure solution, comprises Avail Nexus, Avail Fusion and Avail DA as well as a suite of products and functionality upgrades, including Turbo DA, Enigma DA upgrade, Light Clients, catering to a range of audiences; both Web3 native startups and traditional Web2 giants. Blockchain Infrastructure: A $300B Market According to Grand View Research , the global blockchain market is projected to grow from $31.3 billion in 2024 to $1.43 trillion by 2030, with infrastructure alone expected to reach $306 billion , driven by modularity, institutional demand, scalable tech, and tokenization. When Avail launched its purpose-built data availability (DA) layer on mainnet in July 2024, it set out to revamp the concept of blockchain scalability. The founding team was clear in its vision of broadening the scope of functionality so that blockchain could reach mass adoption. As Ethereum doubled down on its rollup-centric roadmap, the limitations of the current blockchain models became clear; bridges were brittle, liquidity fragmented, and developers faced friction rewriting logic across chains. Innovation slowed, and VC investment declined, as noted in S&P Global’s 2024 report . Despite market headwinds, Avail raised $75 million in 2024 from top investors under the leadership of Anurag Arjun (former Polygon co-founder) and Prabal Banerjee (former Polygon research lead), to build their vision of how blockchain experiences should be. The Avail Stack The Avail Stack comprises Avail DA for scalable, verifiable data availability, including Turbo DA , Enigma Upgrade , Avail Light Clients , and Avail’s 10 GB Infinity Blocks . Avail supports any execution environment with native ZK verification on the base layer. However, the most powerful upgrade is Avail Nexus. The Avail Nexus upgrade is a permissionless crosschain layer enabling connectivity between different chains. Avail Nexus unlocks liquidity and user access with a seamless in-app experience across multiple ecosystems, enabling a true crosschain economy. No network switches, no bridges, no leaving the app. Nexus fully abstracts convoluted flows and back-end processes, delivering a simplified, intuitive experience. With Nexus, the typical 12+ click, crosschain process is reduced to just a couple of simple approvals, all behind the scenes, allowing users to stay in the app. If one chain in the Avail Stack has access to key infrastructure, for example, Uniswap or Aave, every other connected chain can use it too, without needing to redeploy it. This borrowed infrastructure model allows new chains to bootstrap with shared liquidity and shared apps, accelerating ecosystem growth. For developers, Nexus unlocks a powerful new era of multichain applications that coordinate state and logic across environments without replicating contracts. Connectors for EVM, ZK, Optimistic, and sovereign chains make integration seamless for any environment. To complement this is the Avail Fusion upgrade that creates a diverse security model. Apps gain access to pooled crypto-economic security while maintaining decentralization. “With Avail, we were clear that developers no longer rebuild core infrastructure per chain. We wanted to give one integration that connects logic, assets, and users across all ecosystems. This is the foundation of Avail’s horizontal scalability vision: modular infrastructure, interoperable chains, and unified UX.” – Prabal Banerjee, co?founder, Avail. Confidence in Avail’s capability is reflected in the top-tier integrations. Lens Protocol, with over 650K user profiles and 28M+ social connections, launched Lens Chain using Avail DA. Sophon, a zk-validium, raised $60M in a node sale supported via Avail Light Clients. Space & Time, which has partnered with Microsoft and Google Cloud BigQuery, will use Avail to anchor ZK query proofs. Leading players in tokenization and RWAs like Lumia and rootVX are on the Avail testnet. Other projects powered by Avail include Rooch, Odysphere, and Eternal, with 50 more partnerships in the pipeline. “We built Avail for a world where new chains can launch fast, can communicate and scale instantly. That’s the promise of horizontal scalability, and it’s how blockchain technology can reach population scale.” – Anurag Arjun, co-founder, Avail. Avail is building the foundation for a crosschain economy, shared liquidity, and composability, all while staying true to the core principles of decentralization and permissionlessness. About Avail Avail is designed to connect and scale blockchains with the Avail Stack. Avail Nexus connects and powers crosschain messaging. Avail DA foundation powers horizontal scalability with its 10GB infinity blocks roadmap and functionality upgrades, while Avail Fusion will enable crypto-economic security for the Avail economy.

The report shows a historic volatility divergence between Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) during May 2025. Key Highlights: In May 2025 , ETH options exhibited historically high volatility premiums over BTC, driven by ETH’s elevated realized volatility during a major price rally. The ETH-to-BTC implied volatility ratio for short-dated options surged past 2x — reaching a nearly five-year high. BTC’s realized volatility fell below a long-standing 35% floor, breaking a 19-month trend. ETH’s volatility term structure showed persistent inversion, with shorter-dated options pricing higher volatility than longer-dated ones. The implied volatility divergence coincided with ETH’s outperformance, which included a 23% intraday rally amid key market events. ETH-to-BTC Implied Volatility Expands to Five-Year High In May 2025 , a notable dislocation in implied volatility emerged between ETH and BTC options. Implied volatility reflects market expectations for future price movement over an option’s lifespan. At the start of the month, the ETH-to-BTC implied volatility ratio for 7-day options hovered around 1.5 — indicating that ETH options were priced with 50% higher expected volatility than BTC options. By May 16 , the ratio climbed above 2x, reaching a peak not seen since 2020, as BTC’s implied volatility declined to its lowest levels since October 2023 . This drop in BTC volatility broke below the 35% floor that had held for over 19 months, while ETH’s short-tenor implied volatility remained elevated, though slightly below its May 10 high. The volatility spread was particularly pronounced in the 30-day tenor, reaching its widest point since mid-2022. Realized Volatility Trends Underscore the Divergence The sharp divergence in implied volatility was reinforced by trends in realized volatility — a measure of actual historical price movement. In May, ETH’s realized volatility significantly outpaced BTC’s across various tenors, fueling expectations for continued dispersion between the two assets. On May 15 , the 7-day realized volatility ratio between ETH and BTC peaked, closely followed by the implied volatility ratio — suggesting market participants expected ETH’s higher volatility to persist. This trend is not new: the ETH-BTC volatility ratio has been climbing steadily since July 2024 , amid both bull runs and periods of market stress. ETH’s standout performance in May was catalyzed by several factors, including positive US-UK trade news. ETH surged more than 23% on May 8 alone and continued to outperform BTC, which gained approximately 10% during the same period. Despite this momentum, ETH remained over 50% below its January 2025 peak and its all-time high. #Bybit / #TheCryptoArk / #BybitReport About Bybit Bybit is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 70 million users.

Despite market headwinds, Avail raised $75 million in 2024 from top investors under the leadership of Anurag Arjun (former Polygon co-founder) and Prabal Banerjee (former Polygon research lead), to build their vision of how blockchain experiences should be. The Avail Stack The Avail Stack comprises Avail DA for scalable, verifiable data availability, including Turbo DA , Enigma Upgrade , Avail Light Clients , and Avail’s 10 GB Infinity Blocks . Avail supports any execution environment with native ZK verification on the base layer. However, the most powerful upgrade is Avail Nexus. The Avail Nexus upgrade is a permissionless crosschain layer enabling connectivity between different chains. Avail Nexus unlocks liquidity and user access with a seamless in-app experience across multiple ecosystems, enabling a true crosschain economy. No network switches, no bridges, no leaving the app. Nexus fully abstracts convoluted flows and back-end processes, delivering a simplified, intuitive experience. With Nexus, the typical 12+ click, crosschain process is reduced to just a couple of simple approvals, all behind the scenes, allowing users to stay in the app. If one chain in the Avail Stack has access to key infrastructure, for example, Uniswap or Aave, every other connected chain can use it too, without needing to redeploy it. This borrowed infrastructure model allows new chains to bootstrap with shared liquidity and shared apps, accelerating ecosystem growth. For developers, Nexus unlocks a powerful new era of multichain applications that coordinate state and logic across environments without replicating contracts. Connectors for EVM, ZK, Optimistic, and sovereign chains make integration seamless for any environment. To complement this is the Avail Fusion upgrade that creates a diverse security model. Apps gain access to pooled crypto-economic security while maintaining decentralization. “With Avail, we were clear that developers no longer rebuild core infrastructure per chain. We wanted to give one integration that connects logic, assets, and users across all ecosystems. This is the foundation of Avail’s horizontal scalability vision: modular infrastructure, interoperable chains, and unified UX.” - Prabal Banerjee, co‑founder, Avail. Confidence in Avail’s capability is reflected in the top-tier integrations. Lens Protocol, with over 650K user profiles and 28M+ social connections, launched Lens Chain using Avail DA. Sophon, a zk-validium, raised $60M in a node sale supported via Avail Light Clients. Space & Time, which has partnered with Microsoft and Google Cloud BigQuery, will use Avail to anchor ZK query proofs. Leading players in tokenization and RWAs like Lumia and rootVX are on the Avail testnet. Other projects powered by Avail include Rooch, Odysphere, and Eternal, with 50 more partnerships in the pipeline. “We built Avail for a world where new chains can launch fast, can communicate and scale instantly. That’s the promise of horizontal scalability, and it’s how blockchain technology can reach population scale.” - Anurag Arjun, co-founder, Avail. Avail is building the foundation for a crosschain economy, shared liquidity, and composability, all while staying true to the core principles of decentralization and permissionlessness. About Avail Avail is designed to connect and scale blockchains with the Avail Stack. Avail Nexus connects and powers crosschain messaging. Avail DA foundation powers horizontal scalability with its 10GB infinity blocks roadmap and functionality upgrades, while Avail Fusion will enable crypto-economic security for the Avail economy. With Avail Stack, developers get a future-proof foundation where apps and assets move freely across chains.

Brent crude futures climbed 34 cents, or 0.5%, to $73.57 a barrel by 3:40 UTC. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude added 29 cents, or 0.4%, to $72.06. Earlier in the session, both benchmarks had gained more than 2%, according to Reuters . On Monday, oil prices fell by more than 1% after reports said Iran wanted to end the fighting. However, worries returned when U.S. President Donald Trump urged all residents to leave Tehran, accusing Iran’s government of rejecting a deal to curb its nuclear work. “Everyone should evacuate Tehran,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social , tying his warning to what he called Iran’s refusal to agree to nuclear limits. At the Group of Seven summit in Canada, leaders urged both sides to calm down. They branded Iran a source of regional instability, said it must never gain a nuclear weapon, and affirmed Israel’s right to defend itself. French President Emmanuel Macron had suggested the U.S. put forward a ceasefire plan, but Trump denied that in another Truth Social post . “Wrong! … it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that.” As the war entered its fifth day on Tuesday, Iranian outlets reported blasts and intense air-defense activity in Tehran. In Israel, air raid sirens wailed in Tel Aviv in response to Iranian missile launches. Traders stay focused on Iran-Israel tensions Priyanka Sachdeva, a senior market analyst at Phillip Nova, emailed Reuters to say that the conflict is weighing on investor sentiment, with traders mindful of war risks. She also said that “added volatility and caution ahead of the Fed policy decision are further ensuring higher-paced price reactions in oil.” The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which guides interest-rate choices, starts Tuesday. It will wrap up on Wednesday with a rate decision watched by markets. Iran is OPEC’s third-largest oil producer. Traders worry the fighting could cut its output and drive prices up. OPEC has warned that a supply shock could have global effects. Late Monday, U.S. outlets reported that Trump was proposing new talks with Iran over a nuclear pact. At the same time, other reports of a shipping incident in the Gulf of Oman underlined the risks for companies moving oil and fuel through the region.

This scheme was designed to legitimize stolen funds through a seemingly legitimate real-world asset tokenization platform. The investigation reveals direct on-chain connections between WhiteRock’s marketing wallets, ZKasino’s stolen presale funds, and a personal email address that ties key team members from both projects together. 1/ Community Alert: At least one team member from the $30M Zkasino exit scam appears to be involved with the project @WhiteRock_Fi $WHITE due to onchain transactions linking both projects and a personal email address. pic.twitter.com/rZSvLM98fR — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) June 16, 2025 What is ZKasino? The ZKasino scandal originally erupted in April 2024 when the blockchain gambling project abruptly diverted $33 million worth of investor funds to Lido’s staking protocol instead of returning them as promised to presale participants. The scheme led to the arrest of team member Elham Nourzai by Dutch financial crime authorities, while alleged co-conspirators Ildar Ilham and Lior Ben Zakan reportedly fled to the Middle East. Following Nourzai’s release in late 2024, the stolen funds began moving through a sophisticated laundering network that employed chain-hopping across ZkSync, Starknet, EVM, and Solana networks. Proceeds were converted to Monero through instant exchanges, cashed out via OTC brokers, and traded on perpetual platforms like Hyperliquid. ZachXBT’s investigation reveals that WhiteRock emerged in late 2024 with immediate red flags, including an anonymous team without verifiable history, fabricated partnership claims, and funding sources linked to instant exchanges commonly used for money laundering. 4/ WhiteRock (WHITE) appeared late last year and a number of large red flags were immediately observed. -anon team w/o history -team called out for faking partnerships -team has many side wallets all funded via instant exchanges -team exaggerates number of users -USDX backing… https://t.co/e9DhRNzT1T pic.twitter.com/CC8olsxFvi — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) June 16, 2025 The investigator traced funds from ZKasino’s stolen treasury directly to WhiteRock’s marketing wallet, which was subsequently used to pay influencers for promotional content. Most damning, ZachXBT discovered that a personal email address associated with WhiteRock’s deployer wallet belongs to an account named “IldarTheGrandMaster” on Chess.com. This directly links the project to Ildar Ilham, one of ZKasino’s alleged masterminds, who operates under the alias “Prometheus.” From Presale Scam to RWA Revolution: The ZKasino Money Laundering Scheme The ZKasino exit scam represents one of the most brazen betrayals of investor trust in recent crypto history. It began as a promising blockchain gambling platform that raised over $30 million through presales before revealing its true nature. The project initially promised participants that their bridged Ethereum would be returnable, but when launch day arrived on April 20, 2024, ZKasino dramatically altered the terms. Instead of honoring withdrawal requests, the team converted all 10,515 ETH to ZKAS tokens at a heavily discounted rate of $0.055, subject to a punitive 15-month vesting schedule that effectively trapped investor funds. The deception deepened when investigators discovered that ZKasino’s supposed revolutionary blockchain was merely an Arbitrum Nitro chain lacking the zero-knowledge technology that formed the core of its marketing promises. Following the collapse and subsequent arrests, the stolen funds underwent sophisticated laundering through multiple blockchain networks and financial instruments. This multi-vector laundering strategy, explained by ZachXBT, mirrors tactics seen in other major crypto crimes. Australian authorities have charged four individuals over a scheme that allegedly laundered $123 million through businesses and crypto. #Australia #aml https://t.co/uV1errA8TV — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 9, 2025 Recent cases include Australian authorities uncovering a $190 million laundering network that mixed illicit crypto with legitimate business income and European investigations into OKX’s alleged role in laundering $100 million from the Bybit hack. How Stolen Millions Funded WhiteRock’s Success Story WhiteRock, launched on December 24, 2024 , positioned itself as a revolutionary platform that would bring traditional markets onto the blockchain. The platform quickly gained traction by promising to democratize access to traditionally exclusive wealth-building opportunities through its native WHITE token and USDX stablecoin.

In a move that has surprised many in the crypto community, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs have jointly requested that the court pause the ongoing appeal process. This isn’t a full stop, but a significant pause, and it’s happening because of a mutual agreement tied to a pending motion for an indicative ruling. The update was shared by defense attorney and former federal prosecutor James K. Filan on X (formerly Twitter), a reliable source for information regarding the XRP lawsuit . He noted that the SEC is expected to file a status report by August 15, 2025, giving us a potential timeline for when we might hear more concrete developments following this pause. Understanding the SEC Ripple Lawsuit Background Before diving into the significance of this pause, let’s quickly recap the history of the SEC Ripple case. Filed in December 2020, the lawsuit alleged that Ripple, its CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP tokens. Ripple has consistently argued that XRP is not a security. The case has been closely watched because its outcome has major implications not just for Ripple and XRP, but for the broader landscape of US crypto regulation . A key moment came in July 2023, when Judge Analisa Torres delivered a summary judgment that provided partial clarity: Programmatic sales of XRP on exchanges were not deemed investment contracts (securities). Institutional sales of XRP to sophisticated buyers were deemed investment contracts (securities). Sales of XRP by Garlinghouse and Larsen were also deemed investment contracts. This split decision was seen as a partial victory for Ripple and led to a significant positive reaction in the crypto market, particularly for XRP’s price. However, it didn’t end the case. The SEC subsequently pursued an appeal regarding the programmatic sales aspect, while the case proceeded in the district court on other matters, including remedies for the institutional sales deemed securities offerings. Why the Pause? The Indicative Ruling in the XRP Lawsuit Explained So, why would both parties suddenly agree to pause the Ripple appeal that the SEC initiated? The filing explicitly mentions a “pending motion for an indicative ruling.” This is a crucial legal term that provides the key to understanding the current situation. An indicative ruling is something a party asks the district court (in this case, Judge Torres’s court) to consider while the case is already on appeal at a higher court (the Second Circuit Court of Appeals). It essentially asks the district court judge to indicate whether they would be inclined to grant a specific motion if the appellate court were to send the case back down (remand it) for that purpose. In this context, Ripple has likely filed a significant motion in the district court related to the ongoing remedies phase. This phase deals with the penalties, disgorgement, or injunctions the SEC is seeking against Ripple for the institutional sales that Judge Torres ruled were unregistered securities offerings. Ripple’s pending motion could be anything from a motion to dismiss certain claims related to remedies, a motion challenging the SEC’s proposed penalty amount, or something else entirely that, if granted by Judge Torres, could significantly alter the landscape of the case. By requesting an indicative ruling , Ripple is essentially asking Judge Torres to weigh in on this new motion *now*, even though the appeal on the programmatic sales is ongoing. If Judge Torres indicates she would grant the motion, it could potentially resolve or narrow key issues currently being debated in the remedies phase, and perhaps even impact the basis or necessity of the pending appeal. Implications of the Pause for the Ripple Appeal The decision by both the SEC and Ripple to jointly request this pause is quite telling. It suggests that whatever Ripple’s pending motion entails, both parties agree that getting Judge Torres’s perspective on it is a necessary or beneficial step before the Ripple appeal proceeds further. Here are some potential implications: Potential for Efficiency: If Judge Torres indicates she would grant Ripple’s motion, it could streamline the entire process. It might lead to a settlement, narrow the scope of the remedies trial, or even influence the SEC’s stance on the appeal. Ripple’s Confidence: Filing a motion for an indicative ruling suggests Ripple believes they have strong grounds for it and that Judge Torres might rule in their favor. SEC’s Calculation: The SEC agreeing to the pause indicates they also see value in Judge Torres’s input on the pending motion. It could be a strategic move to avoid unnecessary litigation on appeal if the district court’s ruling on the motion resolves key issues. Delayed Appeal Resolution: While potentially leading to a more efficient overall resolution, the immediate effect is a pause in the Ripple appeal itself. The ultimate outcome of the appeal on programmatic sales remains pending until the pause is lifted and the process resumes. It’s important to note that an indicative ruling is just that – an indication. Judge Torres isn’t *actually* ruling on the motion yet. She’s indicating what she *would* do if the case were remanded to her. The appellate court would still need to formally remand the case for her to issue a binding ruling. What This Development Means for US Crypto Regulation The SEC Ripple case has been a cornerstone in the ongoing debate about US crypto regulation . The initial ruling provided some of the first judicial clarity on how existing securities laws might apply to digital assets. This latest development, while procedural, underscores the complexity and evolving nature of this regulatory landscape. The outcome of the remedies phase, which is the focus of Ripple’s pending motion, will determine the final financial penalties and restrictions imposed on Ripple for the institutional sales. This will set a precedent for how the SEC might seek to penalize other crypto companies found to have conducted unregistered securities offerings. Furthermore, the eventual resolution of the appeal regarding programmatic sales will either solidify or challenge the current legal stance on exchange-based crypto trading under securities law. This case is bigger than just Ripple and XRP; it’s shaping the future of digital asset operations within the United States. Businesses, investors, and developers in the crypto space are all watching closely, as the final judgment will significantly influence how they operate, raise funds, and interact with digital assets under US crypto regulation . Looking Ahead: Potential Outcomes for the SEC Ripple Case With the appeal paused pending a decision on the indicative ruling , what are the possible paths forward for the SEC Ripple case? Judge Torres Indicates Granting the Motion: If Judge Torres signals she would grant Ripple’s pending motion (either fully or partially), it could significantly weaken the SEC’s position in the remedies phase and potentially impact the appeal. This could pave the way for a settlement or a more favorable final judgment for Ripple. Judge Torres Indicates Denying the Motion: If she indicates she would deny the motion, the remedies phase would likely continue as planned, and the appeal on programmatic sales would resume with the current summary judgment ruling intact. Settlement Talks Intensify: The joint request for a pause could be a sign that both parties are actively engaged in settlement discussions. Getting clarity from Judge Torres via the indicative ruling process might be a step towards finding common ground. Appeal Resumes: Regardless of the indicative ruling’s outcome, if no settlement is reached, the appeal process at the Second Circuit will eventually resume after the pause, potentially leading to a final ruling on the programmatic sales aspect sometime in the future (keeping in mind the August 15, 2025, status report deadline). The legal maneuvering highlights the high stakes involved. Both sides are using available legal tools to position themselves advantageously. The request for an indicative ruling is a sophisticated tactic that could significantly alter the trajectory of this landmark case. Conclusion: Awaiting the Next Move in the SEC Ripple Saga The joint request by the SEC and Ripple Labs to pause the Ripple appeal marks another fascinating turn in a case that has already seen numerous twists and turns. The focus now shifts to Ripple’s pending motion and the subsequent request for an indicative ruling from Judge Torres. While the pause introduces further delay in the appellate process, it also opens the door to potential efficiencies and perhaps even increases the likelihood of a settlement, depending on Judge Torres’s inclination regarding the pending motion. For anyone following the XRP lawsuit or interested in the future of US crypto regulation , this development is a clear reminder that the legal battles shaping the industry are far from over. The coming months, leading up to the August 2025 status report, will be critical in determining the next steps in this pivotal case.

U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has raised alarms, warning that billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos could abuse the system if critical loopholes aren’t fixed. Her warning has ignited a heated debate in the crypto community and among lawmakers. So, what exactly is the GENIUS Act , and why is it drawing so much attention? What Is the GENIUS Act? The GENIUS Act is a proposed U.S. Senate bill aiming to establish a federal framework for payment stablecoins. It sets out: Rules for issuance and transparency Reserve requirements for stablecoin providers Clear oversight roles for regulators The bill recently cleared a cloture vote and is now headed for a full Senate floor vote, where several amendments are expected to be considered. Warren’s Warning: “Billionaires Could Track Your Spending” Senator Elizabeth Warren took to X (formerly Twitter) to issue a sharp warning: “If Congress doesn’t fix the GENIUS Act, billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos could launch stablecoins that track your purchases, exploit your data, and squeeze out competitors.” Warren’s statement highlights a key concern: if tech giants gain control over both stablecoin issuance and the platforms on which they operate, it could create a dangerous data monopoly. Musk and Bezos Eyeing Stablecoins? Elon Musk Reports suggest Musk’s company X is exploring stablecoin integration through its X Money initiative, with the goal of enabling peer-to-peer payments and reducing transaction fees. Jeff Bezos Speculation is swirling that Amazon is also developing a USD-backed stablecoin , aiming to cut costs and streamline online payments. These potential moves by tech titans are exactly what Warren fears—corporate dominance over digital money and consumer data. The Consumer Risk: Privacy at Stake? Stablecoin transactions are recorded on public blockchains. But if a corporation controls both the stablecoin and the user platform, it could: Connect your wallet to your profile Monitor spending behavior in real-time Use the data for hyper-targeted ads, dynamic pricing, or even sell it to third parties This raises major privacy and surveillance concerns. Trump, Stablecoins, and the Politics of Regulation Senator Warren also warned of another risk: bailouts. If corporate stablecoins crash, taxpayers might be on the hook. Adding fuel to the fire, President Donald Trump is now tied to a controversial stablecoin project. Trump’s Crypto Empire: World Liberty Financial World Liberty Financial (WLF) was launched in 2024 Trump serves as “Chief Crypto Advocate” His sons are listed as “Web3 Ambassadors.” A Trump-affiliated entity owns 60% of WLF and receives 75% of revenue WLF has raised over $550 million and issued a USD1 stablecoin , backed by U.S. Treasuries and cash equivalents. While Trump’s support for crypto aligns with his campaign promises, critics question whether there’s a conflict of interest. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Today: Bitcoin Dips, XRP Pulls Back, Ethereum Lags Ahead of FOMC , Supporters vs Critics: The Stablecoin Divide Not everyone agrees with Warren. Fred Rispoli, a pro-crypto lawyer, argues the GENIUS Act could break big banks’ monopoly on consumer data. Others believe corporate stablecoins could boost innovation and financial inclusion. Critics also accuse Warren of hypocrisy for backing a government-run digital currency with similar data risks. Previous concerns around money laundering, foreign coins, and corporate involvement have been partially addressed in the bill, but the privacy debate remains unresolved. Final Vote Ahead: Will GENIUS Be Rewritten? The GENIUS Act is still evolving. As it heads to a full Senate vote, amendments may reshape its final form.But one thing is clear: the outcome will significantly impact the future of stablecoins in the U.S.—and the power tech giants may (or may not) have over them. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a tweet describing the update, CryptoSensei stated, “Massive news! A brand-new Ripple ad just dropped in NYC. Something big is unfolding, #XRP is making moves!” The tweet was accompanied by images showing Ripple’s visual presence at a major transit location, suggesting a renewed effort by the company to gain visibility in one of the world’s most prominent financial cities. Massive news! A brand-new Ripple ad just dropped in NYC. Something big is unfolding, #XRP is making moves! pic.twitter.com/XYcvaYQlfc — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) June 14, 2025 The advertisement was reportedly spotted at the Fulton Center in Manhattan, a major transportation hub. A user identified as cryptofanatic corroborated CryptoSensei’s post, commenting that the ad appears regularly at the location. Specifically, cryptofanatic stated, “I see this ad every day at Fulton center NYC on the way to work.” The visibility of the Ripple campaign in such a high-traffic area appears to underscore the company’s intention to broaden its awareness efforts to the general public. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Feedback Highlights Divided Opinions While the advertisement drew attention from XRP supporters , it also prompted a range of reactions from other users. A comment from a user identified as Bubbles strongly criticized the interpretation that advertising signaled a significant development. The user wrote , “Coca cola advertises, does that mean something big is coming for coca cola……idiot scammers. Get a life. Loser. Find a better job.” The comment reflected skepticism from some quarters of the community, questioning the strategic value or interpretation of commercial advertising as a signal of market movement or technological progress. CryptoSensei did not respond to the critical comment, but engagement with the tweet remained active, indicating that XRP community members continue to closely monitor Ripple’s media strategy. Ripple’s Advertisement Strategy Emphasizes Global Reach In a related report published on June 7 by Times Tabloid, Ripple’s advertising campaign was characterized as a declaration of its international ambitions. Titled “Powering Global Payments for All,” the advertisement highlighted Ripple’s ongoing partnerships with financial institutions such as Santander, TransferGo, and MoneyGram. These companies were featured as examples of Ripple’s current integrations within the cross-border payment ecosystem. Furthermore, the ad directed viewers to Ripple’s official website, where the company details its on-demand liquidity solutions and its intention to modernize traditional financial rails with blockchain-based infrastructure. Ripple’s Focus on Institutional Partnerships and Technology Integration The advertisement’s appearance in a key New York City location appears to be part of a deliberate marketing effort that aligns with Ripple’s ongoing institutional strategy. This development follows a year of intensified visibility for Ripple and XRP amid broader market growth. With new advertisements targeting urban financial centers and recent emphasis on Ripple’s payment infrastructure, the company continues to position itself as a leading entity in the blockchain-driven payments space.

PEPE/USD chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.0000102, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00000774. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe down today? Pepe’s price gained minor selling pressure after sellers gained control and plunged the price toward $0.00001. This was triggered by the recent low buying activity and increasing profit-taking sentiment. Will Pepe Recover? If buyers hold the price above the $0.00001 level strongly, we might see further upward rally in the Pepe price chart. What is Pepe price prediction for 2025? The Pepe price prediction for 2025 expects the meme coin to record a maximum level of $0.000035. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040. Recent news A whale moved 500 billion $PEPE worth $3.85M to Binance after facing a huge $450,000 loss for holding $PEPE for 40 days. PEPE Price Prediction June 2025 If BTC price records robust surges this month, we might see PEPE price skyrocketing. We expect the PEPE price to record minimum and maximum prices of $0.000008 and $0.000017, respectively. The average price might be around $0.000011. Month Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) June 2025 0.000008 0.000011 0.000017 Pepe price prediction 2025 The Pepe roadmap is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. Despite its robust community, this lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2025 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. In 2025, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000005. It may peak at a maximum value of $0.000035, with an average trading price of $0.000027 throughout the year.

The official X accounts for Pump.fun and its founder, Alon Cohen, were abruptly suspended, alongside several other accounts linked to memecoin activities. This unexpected move has ignited widespread speculation across the community, with many wondering about the potential involvement of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Keeping up with such rapid changes is crucial in the fast-paced realm of Crypto News . What Happened with Pump.fun ‘s Social Presence? The core event that triggered this wave of speculation was the simultaneous suspension of multiple X accounts. The primary accounts affected were: The official @pumpdotfun account. The account belonging to Pump.fun founder, Alon Cohen (@alon). Reports also indicate other accounts associated with memecoin projects or figures saw similar suspensions around the same time. While the platform itself, Pump.fun , reportedly remains fully operational, the loss of its main communication channels on a widely used platform like X is significant. For a project heavily reliant on community engagement and viral marketing, losing access to such a vital platform can disrupt information flow and create uncertainty among users and potential investors. Why the SEC Speculation? The immediate leap to speculating about SEC involvement isn’t unfounded, especially given the current regulatory climate surrounding cryptocurrencies, particularly those perceived as volatile or potentially unregistered securities. Several factors contribute to this speculation: Timing and Scope: The simultaneous suspension of multiple related accounts raises questions about coordinated action, which could potentially originate from a regulatory body investigating a broader issue. Nature of the Platform: Pump.fun facilitates the rapid creation and launch of new tokens, predominantly memecoins. Memecoins, by their nature, are often highly speculative, lack fundamental value, and are prone to extreme volatility. Regulators like the SEC have expressed concerns about platforms that could potentially facilitate the issuance and trading of tokens deemed unregistered securities, or enable manipulative practices like pump-and-dump schemes. Prior Legal Challenges: As highlighted in the initial report, Pump.fun has already faced legal scrutiny. A proposed class-action lawsuit filed in January accused the platform of facilitating the sale of unregistered securities and profiting significantly from fees generated by these activities. Generating nearly $500 million in fees, as alleged, certainly puts the platform on the radar, especially if a significant portion comes from assets later deemed problematic. While X’s terms of service allow for account suspensions for various reasons, including violations related to spam, manipulation, or illegal activities, the timing and the context of the legal challenges make regulatory action a plausible, though unconfirmed, explanation. The Memecoin Market and Associated Risks The rise of platforms like Pump.fun is intrinsically linked to the explosion of the Memecoin market. Memecoins are cryptocurrencies inspired by internet memes, jokes, or cultural trends. They typically gain value through social media hype, community enthusiasm, and speculative trading rather than underlying technology or utility. While some memecoins have seen astronomical gains, attracting significant attention and capital, they are also associated with substantial risks: Extreme Volatility: Prices can surge and plummet dramatically within hours or days, often driven purely by sentiment and social media trends. Lack of Fundamentals: Unlike projects building decentralized applications or solving specific problems, memecoins often have no intrinsic value or clear use case beyond speculation. Pump-and-Dump Schemes: The low liquidity and hype-driven nature of many memecoins make them susceptible to manipulation, where early holders promote the coin heavily to inflate the price before selling off their holdings, leaving later investors with losses. Scams and Rug Pulls: Platforms that lower the barrier to entry for creating tokens can inadvertently become avenues for malicious actors to launch scam tokens, often disappearing with investor funds (a “rug pull”). Platforms that facilitate the easy creation of these tokens face the challenge of balancing accessibility with the need to prevent abuse and protect users from potential fraud and manipulative practices. Regulatory bodies worldwide are increasingly scrutinizing the crypto market, and the memecoin sector, due to its inherent volatility and association with potential scams, is often under a magnifying glass. Solana ‘s Role in the Memecoin Boom Pump.fun operates on the Solana blockchain, which has become a popular hub for memecoin activity. Solana’s architecture, known for its high transaction throughput and low fees, makes it an attractive network for launching and trading tokens quickly and cheaply. This has fostered a vibrant, albeit sometimes chaotic, ecosystem of new projects and tokens, many of which are memecoins. The popularity of Solana for memecoins has been a double-edged sword. On one hand, it has brought significant activity and attention to the network. On the other hand, it has also attracted criticism and regulatory focus due to the proliferation of speculative assets and the associated risks. Developments affecting major platforms on Solana, like Pump.fun, can have ripple effects on the perception and activity within the broader Solana ecosystem. Staying Informed with Crypto News Events like the Pump.fun X account suspension underscore the importance of staying informed in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. Regulatory actions, platform developments, and market sentiment can change rapidly. For anyone involved in the crypto space, whether as an investor, developer, or enthusiast, reliable Crypto News sources are essential for understanding the landscape, assessing risks, and making informed decisions. While the exact reasons behind the X suspensions remain officially unconfirmed, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the potential regulatory risks faced by platforms operating in less-defined areas of the crypto market, particularly those associated with highly speculative assets like memecoins. It highlights the ongoing tension between innovation in decentralized finance and the need for consumer protection and market integrity that regulators aim to uphold. The situation surrounding Pump.fun will likely continue to develop. Whether regulatory action is indeed underway, or if the suspensions relate to other issues, the event has already fueled significant discussion and highlighted the challenges within the memecoin sector and the platforms that support it.

Despite the bullish sentiment around Circle and the stablecoin sector, Hayes predicts a bubble driven more by hype and poor fundamentals than sustainable value. Meanwhile, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire compared stablecoins to the iPhone in their early days, and pointed to growing institutional interest and surging transaction volumes as signs of mainstream adoption. Major retailers and platforms like Amazon, Walmart, and Shopify are exploring or integrating stablecoin payments. At the same time, JPMorgan’s new trademark filing for “JPMD” fueled speculation that the bank could soon launch its own stablecoin. Circle Copycats Face Harsh Reality BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes issued a stark warning about the next phase of the crypto market, and described it as the beginning of a new “stablecoin mania” after Circle’s highly successful IPO. In a post on Monday , Hayes said that while Circle’s public listing was a huge milestone for the industry, it is also the start of a bubble that will ultimately burst. He predicted that many companies will try to replicate Circle’s success, but most will be overvalued and ultimately fail due to structural challenges and market saturation. Hayes didn’t mince words in his criticism of these upcoming ventures, and labeled them “Circle copycats.” He also suggested that their business models rely more on showmanship and leverage than sustainable financial practices. He warned investors to be extremely cautious, and described the coming wave of stablecoin stocks as something to be traded like a “hot potato.” Despite his grim outlook, Hayes stopped short of recommending short positions due to the strong pro-crypto sentiment in the US and a narrative-driven surge in demand that could initially drive prices sharply upward. “These new stocks will rip the faces off of shorts,” he cautioned. The US Senate is set to vote on critical stablecoin legislation on June 17, which could lend even more momentum to the sector if passed. Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov agreed with Hayes’ outlook by saying the approval of US regulation would trigger a global explosion in stablecoin projects. However, Hayes pointed out that distribution is still the Achilles’ heel for most new entrants. According to him, without access to major crypto exchanges, social media platforms, or legacy banking systems, new stablecoin companies have little to no chance of survival. Additionally, he argued that the few existing distribution channels are already locked up by incumbents, forcing newcomers to either pay high fees or offer unsustainable yields to attract users. At the same time, he believes Web2 giants and banks are more likely to issue their own stablecoins than partner with new providers. As a result, most new stablecoin IPOs will be speculative hype rather than solid investments. Hayes was particularly scathing toward the upcoming wave of founders, and described them as “suited-up clowns” set to deceive the public into buying into weak companies. Circle share price since launch (Source: Google Finance ) Even Circle (CRCL), he claims, is currently “insanely overvalued,” as half of its interest income is handed over to Coinbase. Yet, he acknowledged that the stock’s price will likely stay elevated due to market enthusiasm. Circle’s share price has surged over 80% since its listing on June 5, and reached an all-time high on June 16. Stablecoins Near iPhone Moment Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire believes that stablecoins are nearing a pivotal moment in mainstream adoption, and compared their current stage to the early days of the iPhone before developers recognized its full potential. In a post on Saturday , Allaire said that while stablecoins haven’t yet attracted developers at the same scale as Apple’s revolutionary product, that breakthrough is coming soon. He described stablecoins as “the highest utility form of money ever created.” Allaire’s comments were made in response to a post by a16z Crypto partner Sam Broner , who argued that stablecoins promote competition by lowering the costs of launching fintech applications. According to Broner, this new openness encourages better pricing, experiences, and accessibility in financial services. The discussion coincides with reports that major retailers like Walmart and Amazon are considering launching their own dollar-backed stablecoins for consumer use. Meanwhile, e-commerce platform Shopify confirmed plans to integrate Circle’s USDC for payments by the end of 2025. A16z Crypto data scientist Daren Matsuoka added to the bullish outlook by stating that stablecoins might be the crypto industry’s best chance to onboard a billion users. He explained that stablecoins have processed $33 trillion in transactions over the past year — which is almost 20 times PayPal’s volume, almost triple that of Visa, and rapidly approaching ACH transaction levels. This surge in adoption momentum follows Circle’s recent listing on the New York Stock Exchange. However, Tether opted not to follow suit. On June 8, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed that the company has no plans to go public. New JPMorgan Trademark Sparks Stablecoin Speculation Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase took a major step toward expanding its presence in the blockchain and digital asset space with a new trademark filing for “JPMD” in the United States. The trademark application was submitted to the US Patent and Trademark Office on Sunday, and outlines a comprehensive suite of crypto-related services, including digital asset trading, exchanges, transfers, clearing, and payment processing. While the application does not specifically mention stablecoins, the breadth of services it covers intensified speculation that JPMorgan may be preparing to launch its own stablecoin. These developments happened on the heels of a report from The Wall Street Journal on May 22, which indicated that JPMorgan, alongside other major financial institutions like Bank of America and Wells Fargo, is actively exploring the launch of a joint stablecoin. The timing of this report and the recent trademark filing led industry observers to draw connections between the two, with some suggesting that JPMorgan’s actions point to an accelerated push into blockchain-native financial infrastructure aimed at competing with established crypto players. Despite CEO Jamie Dimon’s longstanding skepticism toward Bitcoin, JPMorgan maintained a positive stance on blockchain technology as a tool for modernizing traditional finance. The firm already made inroads through its Kinexy platform (previously known as Onyx), which facilitates interbank payments using JPM Coin, a blockchain-based digital token backed 1:1 by fiat currencies including the US dollar, British pound, and euro. To date, Kinexy has handled over $1.5 trillion in tokenized transactions. The news of JPMorgan’s trademark application also arrives at a time of increasing regulatory momentum in the US regarding stablecoins. Last week, the Senate voted 68-30 to advance the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, clearing the way for debate and a full floor vote. If approved by both chambers of Congress, the bill will head to President Donald Trump for final authorization.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-17 09:30:00

EURI is one of the first Euro stablecoins fully compliant with the EU’s MiCA regulation. MiCA enforcement is reshaping the European stablecoin landscape, with major exchanges racing for licenses. Eurite (EURI), a euro-pegged stablecoin regulated under the European Union’s pioneering Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, is possibly on the verge of a potential sell-off and incoming volatility. According to on-chain analytics platform Santiment, nearly 10% of EURI’s total supply was recently transferred to Binance. As per CoinMarketCap , EURI currently trades at $1.15, marking a minor 0.10% drop in the last 24 hours. However, this price is slightly above its intended €1.00 peg, a deviation that could be attributed to liquidity dynamics or exchange premiums. Also, the large-scale transfer to Binance could signal downward pressure if the tokens are sold in bulk, as Santiment suggested.

The rise of CRWV coincides with a positive month for miner stocks that pivoted to high-density computing for AI. CoreWeave (CRWV) is back to expansion mode, leading to expectations of another rally. The AI computation company, which pivoted early from Ethereum mining, was one of the biggest winners during the LLM expansion stage. CRWV showed strong bullish momentum in the past month, with periods of trading based on a short squeeze. | Source: Yahoo Finance CRWV climbed to $158.50, on track to repeat previous records above $161. In the last two weeks, the CRWV rally raised suspicions that the stock was boosted by meme traders . However, the company has tapped demand for high-density computation for AI, and got a boost from Nvidia (NVDA). The stock moves on a mix of two major factors—trading based on a potential short squeeze, and general bullish momentum for all AI stocks. CoreWeave goes through another record borrowing period While CRWV is watched for its fundamental potential, in the short term, the price rally coincides with record costs to borrow shares, signaling a short squeeze. During the recent price climb to near-peak prices, CRWV borrowing rates also reached new records. As of June 12, the rate increased to 343.1%, then turned down to around 197%, with 200K CRWV shares available to borrow. CRWV borrowing rates increased to a record, suggesting a short squeeze is a partial factor for the stock’s rally. | Source: CompaniesMarketcap The short interest on CRWV moved within a wide range in the past few days, from 32% to as much as 45%. On social media, messages of short interest of up to 65% of the free float also appeared, boosting the FOMO for trading CRWV. Short interest is not a guaranteed trend, and can shift on a daily basis. However, CRWV can still trade under conditions similar to a short squeeze, at least in the short term. The shares are closely watched for their month-long bullish trend, which may lead to sharp increases in borrowing costs for covering short positions. In June, shares available to borrow increased, potentially easing the borrowing situation, though at a high price. On June 8, only 25K shares were available to borrow, increasing to over 250K at the new record borrowing rates. CoreWeave brings attention to mining companies The success of CoreWeave and demand for computation is boosting the shares of other mining companies. Core Scientific (CORZ) rose by over 12% in the past month. The company may have an ongoing boost from its 12-year deal with CoreWeave, with $4.7B earmarked for data center investments. Core Scientific is also building some of the CoreWeave data centers in Texas, with a goal of tapping 200MW in energy for data centers. The shares are up by 100% since the lows in April and May. The company mixes ongoing BTC mining with a treasury of 977 BTC, while also making forays into computation services. Other companies like CleanSpark and Riot Platforms are still trying to push off their recent lows, with more gradual gains. TeraWulf (WULF) had a more dramatic rally, rising from around $3.50 in early June to over $4.33. The company has previously benefitted from its pivot to AI data centers. It also extends the trend of seeking out renewable electricity resources to create sustainable data centers.

While trading hasn’t officially begun for all, the underlying funds are starting to see movement. Recent data reveals a notable development: US Spot ETH ETFs collectively recorded a net inflow of $21.4 million on June 16. This marks an important early indicator of investor interest in these newly approved investment vehicles. What Exactly Are US Spot ETH ETFs and Why Do These Inflows Matter? Before diving deeper into the numbers, let’s quickly recap what a US Spot ETH ETF is. It’s an exchange-traded fund that holds actual Ethereum (ETH) as its underlying asset. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which track the price of ETH futures contracts, a spot ETF aims to track the direct market price of Ethereum by holding the asset itself. This structure is generally preferred by investors seeking direct exposure to the asset’s price movements without the complexities of holding the cryptocurrency directly. The approval of US Spot ETH ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year was a landmark moment for the crypto industry. It followed the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, which saw billions in inflows and significantly boosted Bitcoin’s price and mainstream acceptance. The approval of Ethereum ETFs signals growing regulatory comfort and institutional acceptance of major cryptocurrencies as legitimate asset classes for traditional investment products. Therefore, any recorded inflows into these funds, even before they are fully trading on exchanges (pending S-1 form approvals), are highly significant. They represent the first tangible signs of capital entering these specific investment products, indicating that investors and institutions are beginning to allocate funds towards Ethereum through this regulated and accessible pathway. Breaking Down the Initial ETH ETF Inflows: Who is Leading? According to data compiled by Farside Investors, the $21.4 million net inflow on June 16 was concentrated in just two of the approved funds. Here’s the breakdown: BlackRock’s ETHA: This fund, managed by the world’s largest asset manager, led the pack with a substantial $16.1 million in net inflows. Fidelity’s FETH: Another major financial player, Fidelity, saw its Ethereum ETF attract $5.3 million in net inflows. Other Funds: The remaining US Spot ETH ETFs tracked by Farside Investors reported no change in their holdings for that specific day. This initial data highlights the immediate impact and reach of major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity. Their existing client bases, brand recognition, and distribution networks likely play a significant role in attracting early capital into their respective Ethereum ETF offerings. While $21.4 million is a modest start compared to the massive inflows seen during the initial days of the US spot Bitcoin ETFs, it’s important contextually. The S-1 registration statements, which allow these ETFs to officially begin trading, are still pending final approval for most issuers. These early inflows could represent seed funding or initial strategic allocations ahead of the official launch. How Do These Early ETH ETF Inflows Compare to the Bitcoin Experience? It’s natural to compare the initial performance of US Spot ETH ETF inflows to that of their Bitcoin counterparts. The US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw billions of dollars in inflows within their first few days of trading in January 2024. While the $21.4 million figure for Ethereum ETFs on June 16 is significantly smaller, it’s crucial to remember that this data point represents activity *before* full trading commencement for all funds. The Bitcoin ETFs had their S-1s approved concurrently with the 19b-4 rule change, allowing them to trade almost immediately after the SEC’s decision. The Ethereum ETF process has been slightly different, with 19b-4 approval granted first, followed by the ongoing S-1 approval process for individual issuers. Therefore, a direct day-one comparison isn’t entirely fair. The true test for ETH ETF inflows will come once all major funds receive their S-1 approvals and begin trading on exchanges. However, these early numbers, particularly the interest shown in the BlackRock ETH ETF and Fidelity ETH ETF , suggest that there is indeed appetite among investors for this new product. What Could These Initial Flows Signal for the Future of Ethereum? While it’s too early to make definitive predictions based on a single day’s data, these initial ETH ETF inflows are generally viewed as a positive sign for Ethereum. Here’s why: Growing Institutional Interest: The participation of major firms like BlackRock and Fidelity, and the capital they are attracting, underscores increasing institutional comfort and interest in gaining exposure to Ethereum. Increased Accessibility: Once fully operational, these ETFs will make investing in Ethereum significantly easier for traditional investors who are uncomfortable with or unable to navigate cryptocurrency exchanges and private key management. This expanded access could bring new capital into the ETH market. Potential Price Support: As ETFs accumulate ETH to back their shares, this creates buying pressure on the underlying asset. While the initial $21.4 million is small relative to Ethereum’s market cap, sustained inflows over time could provide significant price support. Market Legitimacy: The existence of regulated ETF products for Ethereum further solidifies its position as a recognized and legitimate asset class within the traditional financial system. Navigating the Path Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities While the launch of Ethereum ETF products presents significant opportunities, there are also potential challenges to consider: Opportunities: Massive Capital Influx: If ETH ETFs mirror the success of Bitcoin ETFs, they could unlock significant capital from retail and institutional investors who were previously unable or unwilling to invest directly in crypto. Enhanced Liquidity: Increased trading activity around the ETFs could indirectly improve liquidity in the underlying ETH market. Innovation in Financial Products: The success of spot crypto ETFs could pave the way for other regulated products based on digital assets. Challenges: Market Volatility: While ETFs offer a regulated wrapper, they still track a highly volatile asset. Investors must be prepared for significant price swings. Regulatory Uncertainty: Although the ETFs are approved, the broader regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the US remains complex and subject to change. Competition: The market is competitive, with multiple issuers vying for investor assets. Performance and fees will be key differentiators. Staking Exclusion: Importantly, the current US spot ETH ETFs are approved without a staking component, meaning investors in these funds will not earn staking rewards, which is a significant feature of holding native ETH. Actionable Insights for Those Watching US Spot ETH ETFs For investors and market observers, here are a few key takeaways: Monitor S-1 Approvals: Keep a close eye on the SEC’s approval timeline for the remaining S-1 registration statements. This will be the green light for full trading commencement. Track Inflow Data Post-Launch: Once trading begins, daily inflow/outflow data will provide a clearer picture of investor demand compared to these early seed figures. Observe Market Reaction: See how the price of Ethereum reacts as these ETFs go live and accumulate assets. Compare Performance: If considering investment (not financial advice), compare the fees, structure, and performance of different ETF offerings. Remember, investing in cryptocurrencies and related products carries significant risk. This information is for educational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice. Always conduct your own thorough research and consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions. The Broader Significance Beyond Just the ETF It’s also worth remembering that the Ethereum ETF is just one part of the larger Ethereum ecosystem. Ethereum is a foundational layer for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and numerous other decentralized applications. Its ongoing technical upgrades, such as the transition to Proof-of-Stake and future scaling solutions, are critical drivers of its long-term value proposition, independent of the ETF wrapper. The ETF provides a new gateway for traditional capital, but the underlying technology and network development remain paramount. Concluding Thoughts: A Promising Start for a New Era The reported $21.4 million in net inflows on June 16 for US Spot ETH ETFs represents a modest but symbolically significant step forward. It confirms early interest from major players like BlackRock and Fidelity and signals the impending arrival of these highly anticipated investment products to the broader market. While the true impact will unfold once full trading commences, this initial activity sets a positive tone for the potential integration of Ethereum into traditional investment portfolios.

BladeDeFi, in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), warned followers that a significant downturn could be on the horizon, predicting a challenging summer ahead for the crypto space. Crypto Pump Or Trap? In his post, BladeDeFi emphasized that “crypto has already PEAKED” and forecasted a potential slump where alternative cryptocurrencies could see declines of up to 95%. He indicated that most indicators are flashing red, suggesting that the market is on the brink of a significant downturn. According to him, Bitcoin has already hit its all-time high early in the current cycle and is now trapped in a “slow-motion downtrend,” with each subsequent bounce becoming weaker than the last. Related Reading: Bitcoin Gold Rush 2.0? Treasuries Swell With 60 New Players The analyst pointed out a concerning trend: retail investors are becoming exhausted, while larger institutional players have begun to exit the market. Major firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and MicroStrategy are reportedly rotating their investments and hedging their positions, often without making their actions overtly public. The analyst suggests that this shift leaves retail investors vulnerable, potentially left holding depreciating assets as liquidity in the market continues to dwindle. BladeDeFi also criticized the current market dynamics, warning that sudden price increases or “green candles” are often deceptive, serving only to entice late buyers into traps that lead to further losses. He noted that without new capital inflows—such as fresh stimulus or significant investment—the recent price pumps lack sustainability. The absence of liquidity means that any upward movements are likely to be fleeting, and the overall trend remains downward. Bitcoin Poised For Year-End Peak? Adding to the bearish sentiment, another analyst, Peppeso, echoed similar concerns, suggesting that the top of the 2025 bull market has already been established. Peppeso observed historical patterns in previous market cycles, noting that while bull markets have become longer, bear markets have shortened and softened in their impact. Despite this, Bitcoin has consistently reached all-time highs in the final months of each cycle, reinforcing Peppeso’s expectation of a peak around November or December 2025.

With uncertainty clouding the outlook, many investors are adopting a risk-off approach, leading to a sustained downtrend in the crypto market. Even popular memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have experienced significant declines of 9% and 7% in the past week alone respectively, indicating that the hype surrounding these assets is fading.

Could Settle Within 1 Week to 2 Months,https://coinpedia.org/news/when-will-xrp-vs-sec-officially-end-could-settle-within-1-week-to-2-months/,"The post When Will XRP vs SEC Officially End? Could Settle Within 1 Week to 2 Months appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a latest twist in the Ripple vs SEC case, both parties have asked the Second Circuit Court to keep the appeals process on hold while they wait for a ruling from the district court. The SEC is expected to update the court with a status report by August 15. This comes after a joint request was filed by Ripple and the SEC on June 12 to lift the injunction and reduce the penalty. The final outcome now depends on how the district court rules on that request. If the court approves the proposed settlement, it could finally mark the end of this case. Otherwise, it could face new delays. All eyes are now on the next update, which is expected by mid-August. Update Likely Within a Week? One expert explains that the SEC refiled the motion with Judge Torres, and her response will guide the next steps. She also added that it might not take until August, as the last time Judge Torres responded within just 7 days, so a decision could come as early as Thursday or next week. Former SEC official Marc Fagel commented that writing legal opinions takes time and pointed out that this isn’t the only case in front of the judge. Will the Case Return to Judge Torres? Sherrie expressed that she would be surprised if Judge Torres were to reject the refiled motion. The community might need to be prepared for the possibility that, if the motion is not approved and either party restarts their appeals, the case could end back up in Judge Torres’ courtroom. This could trigger “conspiracy theories” within the XRP community. I don't think there's any way to predict whether she will modify her order. I could see it going either way. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) June 17, 2025 According to Fagel, it’s hard to predict whether the judge will modify her previous order. “I could see it going either way,” he said. So, both sides are now waiting on Judge Torres. If she accepts the motion, it could help wrap up the case. If not, the appeals process may restart and lead to more speculation across the community. If the case is resolved, it could boost XRP’s price and make way for spot XRP ETF approvals.

In a Monday blog post, Hayes expressed skepticism about a potential wave of copycat stablecoin companies aiming to replicate Circle’s (CRCL) IPO success . Hayes emphasized that Circle’s listing is likely just the beginning of a broader speculative frenzy. “The listing marks the beginning, not the end of this cycle’s stablecoin mania,” he wrote. He foresees a situation where companies attract massive investments by using financial tricks, excessive leverage, and flashy marketing—but ultimately lack a solid foundation. “The bubble will pop after a stablecoin issuer convinces investors to part with tens of billions, only to collapse,” he warned. New Entrants in Stablecoin World According to Hayes, most new stablecoin companies won’t survive. He outlined that the real challenge for these firms lies in distribution—specifically, how and where they get their stablecoins into users’ hands. Hayes identified three main distribution avenues: cryptocurrency exchanges, Web2 social media giants, and traditional banks. He argued that without access to at least one of these, a new stablecoin issuer has “no chance of success.” He added that existing players have already secured these routes, making it nearly impossible for newcomers to enter without paying significant fees or giving up yield. He noted that social media companies and banks are more likely to develop their own stablecoins rather than partner with third-party issuers. Despite his grim outlook, Hayes refrained from advising traders to short these companies’ stocks. “These new stocks will rip the faces off of shorts,” he wrote, citing the growing pro-crypto sentiment in the U.S. and momentum around stablecoin legislation. The U.S. Senate is expected to vote on a major stablecoin bill on June 17, which could further energize the market. Circle Soars Amid Caution Hayes was particularly critical of Circle’s current valuation, describing CRCL as significantly overvalued. He noted that Circle shares 50% of its interest earnings with Coinbase, which he sees as a structural weakness. Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the stock price is likely to remain high for now due to market hype. Circle’s share price has surged over 80% since its June 5 debut, hitting nearly $165 on June 16, according to Google Finance. Hayes sees this as a sign of things to come—but not in a good way.

In this cycle, a new class of meme coins is rising. All three tokens below currently trade with a market cap of under $10 billion, but each has a distinct path, narrative, and setup that could propel them to the $100 billion club in the next bull run. Let’s break down why Little Pepe (LILPEPE), SPX6900, and Pepe Coin may be the biggest meme winners of the next run. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) — Market Cap: Presale Stage While other meme coins fight for attention with clever branding or short-lived social spikes, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is doing something different — it's building the future of meme finance from the ground up. Not just a meme coin, LILPEPE’s explosive presale success shows that the market is already catching on. Since launching on June 10, Little Pepe’s presale has become one of the fastest-moving launches in the meme coin ecosystem. Stage 1 sold out in just 72 hours, and Stage 2 has already sold over 650 million tokens, raising more than $700,000. It's well on track to hit its $1,325,000 target soon. Here's why it's the one to watch: Meme-only Layer 2: It’s the first meme project to launch a dedicated Layer 2 blockchain tailored specifically for meme coins. This chain has sniper bot protection, ultra-low gas fees, and a launchpad. Pepe’s Pump Pad: that allows users to launch meme tokens with built-in liquidity locks and anti-rug mechanics. Zero Tax, Locked Liquidity: Ideal for whales, who have already begun accumulating early. CEX Listings Secured: Two centralized exchange listings are confirmed post-presale, with rumors of a Tier 1 exchange surfacing. Smart Contract Audit Complete: LILPEPE’s code passed its audit with zero critical or significant issues, providing early investors with confidence in its security. Importantly, Little Pepe is gaining traction across crypto Twitter and Telegram. Social buzz is surging, with multiple analysts now turning their eyes toward LILPEPE. Add to that its recently successful smart contract audit, and it’s clear the team is serious about security and execution, which is rare in the meme sector. Little Pepe is engineering long-term engagement through utility and scalability. With confirmed listings on two centralized exchanges following the presale, demand is expected to surge once trading starts. In the next bull run, it could be one of those that shoots to the moon, as its strong narrative remains a distinct factor. Intended to succeed PEPE, it could indeed outperform its successor and deliver massive returns. SPX6900 (SPX) — Market Cap: $1.37 Billion SPX/USD 1wk Price Chart|Source: TradingView SPX6900 led in 2024, rallying by about 20,000%. It crashed to $0.29 in March but has now rebounded massively. SPX is currently trading above $1.60, just shy of its January all-time high of $1.77. What makes SPX so promising? Whale Accumulation: Over 106 million tokens have been scooped up by large holders. This move shows long-term confidence. Community Resilience: Even after its official X (Twitter) account was suspended , engagement spiked. That’s a sign of a decentralized, organic movement—a vital trait of a meme coin. On-Chain Strength: Futures open interest has surged to over $163 million, and daily active addresses have hit a new high. This signals massive interest and liquidity. Technical Setup: The token is forming a textbook cup-and-handle breakout. RSI, ADX, and Chaikin Money Flow indicators are all flashing bullish continuation. If SPX6900 holds its trend and regains virality, a 10x move to a $15B–$20B valuation is plausible. A euphoric top around $100B isn’t off the table in peak mania. Pepe Coin (PEPE) — Market Cap: $4.69 Billion PEPE/USDT 1wk Price Chart|Source: TradingView Pepe Coin has already printed one explosive cycle. In early 2024, it surged from near-zero to multi-billion territory in just weeks. Now, with consolidation underway and smart money re-entering, many believe PEPE could outperform again. Here’s what gives PEPE its staying power: Cultural Dominance: It remains one of the most recognized meme brands in the cryptocurrency space. Technical Readiness: The current chart shows a descending flag, a classic bull continuation setup. Momentum indicators, such as RSI and MACD, are rebounding. Key Support Holding: The $0.000012 region has held critical support. It is aligning with the 100 and 200 EMA and 0.382 Fib level. Whale Confidence: Large holders are buying the dip, with minimal realized profits suggesting holders aren’t rushing to exit. With a clear breakout above $0.000014, PEPE could rocket toward its previous highs. And if the next bull cycle mirrors 2021, a $50B to $100B cap isn’t unrealistic given its retail gravity. Final Thoughts The next crypto bull run could see meme coins dominate, capturing attention and liquidity more quickly than any other asset class. SPX6900 brings technical strength and a defiant community. Meanwhile, Pepe Coin offers retail familiarity and proven explosive behavior. Little Pepe combines meme magic with real blockchain infrastructure, a feat no meme project has accomplished before. Still in its presale stage, it could offer explosive gains once it launches on top exchanges. For investors looking to place high-risk, high-reward bets, these three are your next 10x to 100x moonshots. LILPEPE’s presale is still open at littlepepe.com . With rising demand, the next stage price is imminent.

Both stocks and digital assets fell sharply on Friday following renewed Israeli strikes but began to stabilize on Monday. By early Tuesday, however, momentum had stalled . US index futures slipped, and cryptocurrency price action turned mixed over the previous 24 hours. Digital assets often mirror high-risk technology stocks—rising with investor optimism and reversing course when sentiment weakens. Geopolitical shocks typically trigger knee-jerk sell-offs, but markets tend to stabilize as traders reassess the broader implications. Amid this volatile backdrop, early-stage project Bitcoin Pepe has continued to see strong presale inflows. Since launching in February, the project has maintained steady investor interest, positioning itself as a notable outlier in an otherwise cooling meme coin segment. Firms continue to load up BTC The Blockchain Group has raised €7.2 million (approximately $7.7 million) to advance its ambition of becoming Europe’s leading Bitcoin Treasury company. In a press release dated June 17, the Paris-listed firm said the capital was secured via an “At-The-Market type” raise with asset manager TOBAM. The offering involved the issuance of 1.6 million new shares at an average price of €4.49, reflecting a 20.76% discount to the stock’s June 13 close amid market volatility.

The Blockchain Group aims to emulate firms such as US-based Strategy and Japan’s Metaplanet, which have adopted similar Bitcoin-forward capital allocation models. It plans to hold up to 260,000 BTC—currently valued at about $24 billion—by 2033, positioning itself as a pioneer of corporate Bitcoin adoption in Europe. Bitcoin Pepe: listing announcement scheduled for today Even amid a volatile market, the accelerating embrace of Bitcoin and digital assets by traditional finance has helped lift sentiment across the broader crypto ecosystem. In this risk-on climate, investors in search of outsized returns are rotating back into speculative plays—meme coins among the first to benefit. Among them, Bitcoin Pepe has emerged as one of 2025’s most closely tracked presales. The project distinguishes itself with the ambition to “build Solana on Bitcoin,” aiming to merge the Bitcoin network’s security with Solana-style scalability. The project’s PEP-20 token standard allows permissionless minting and trading on the Bitcoin network. Unlike meme tokens that rely purely on hype, Bitcoin Pepe is anchored by a defined technical roadmap and infrastructure-led narrative. The project has raised over $14.6 million in presale funding ahead of a planned listing announcement today, underscoring continued investor interest. As speculative capital flows back into early-stage assets, Bitcoin Pepe is well-positioned to harness the momentum in the final stretch of its token sale.

The cryptocurrency briefly touched a 24-hour high of $108,952 before pulling back to $106,000. Market sentiment improved following comments from French President Emmanuel Macron , who said that US President Donald Trump had received an offer—delivered through intermediaries—intended to secure a ceasefire and resume broader negotiations between the warring parties. “There is indeed an offer to meet and exchange. An offer was made especially to get a ceasefire and to kickstart broader discussions,” Macron told reporters that the development was a potentially positive step in resolving the Iran-Israel conflict. The broader market rebound is also benefiting early-stage tokens such as Bitcoin Pepe , which has continued to draw steady investor interest since its presale launch in February. Over the weekend, the project recorded more than $250,000 in new inflows, underscoring sustained momentum as traders seek high-upside opportunities amid improving sentiment. Trump’s Truth Social files for Bitcoin-Ether ETF Truth Social, the social media platform operated by Trump Media & Technology Group, has filed to launch an exchange-traded fund tracking the prices of both bitcoin and ether. According to a Form S-1 filed Monday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the proposed “Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, B.T.” will allocate approximately 75% of its assets to bitcoin, with the remaining portion invested in ether. The ratio may be adjusted at the discretion of the sponsor, Yorkville America Digital LLC, with any changes to be disclosed via prospectus supplements, SEC filings, or updates on the fund’s website. Foris DAX Trust Co. LLC is listed as the custodian, as in the platform’s earlier filing for a single-asset bitcoin ETF submitted on June 5. Truth Social is the third issuer to seek approval for a dual-spot crypto ETF, following similar filings by Bitwise and Hashdex. Other firms, including Volatility Shares and ProShares, have filed for bitcoin-ether ETFs as well, but tied to futures markets rather than spot prices. Bitcoin Pepe continues its forward march Bitcoin’s resilience amid macroeconomic uncertainty is lifting broader crypto market sentiment, rekindling speculative appetite across digital assets. Historically, such periods have often preceded market-wide rallies, especially in high-volatility segments like meme coins. Investors are once again rotating into riskier bets, with meme tokens among the early beneficiaries. One project gaining momentum is Bitcoin Pepe, which merges viral internet culture with a Layer 2 infrastructure play. Bitcoin Pepe is attempting to “build Solana on Bitcoin.” The project seeks to pair Bitcoin’s base-layer security with Solana-style scalability, distinguishing it from meme tokens that rely purely on hype. Unlike most of its peers, Bitcoin Pepe is underpinned by a technical roadmap and infrastructure-first narrative. That positioning appears to be resonating: the project has raised more than $14.6 million in its ongoing presale, with a listing announcement due today. As capital continues to rotate into early-stage, high-upside opportunities, Bitcoin Pepe is positioning itself to capitalise on renewed risk-taking in the final days of its token sale.

In fact, each has the potential to deliver 5x more returns than ETH or XRP this year. Here’s why they deserve a spot on your watchlist. Rexas Finance (RXS): An RWA Crypto on the Verge of a Massive Breakout Rexas Finance (RXS) is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about tokens of 2025, and for good reason. With just weeks to go before its official launch, this project has already proven it has what it takes to deliver significant gains, potentially 5 times more than many mainstream altcoins this year. Since the presale began, Rexas Finance has garnered the attention of investors, resulting in its impressive success. So far, the project has raised over 49 million, representing 93% of the presale tokens. Investors’ confidence is at an all-time high, with large investors buying and positioning themselves ahead of the token launch. Rexas Finance’s mission is to make real-world asset (RWA) tokenization accessible to everyone. That means giving people the tools to turn physical assets like real estate, luxury items, and more into blockchain-based tokens that can be traded, staked, or used in DeFi. Rexas Finance goes beyond its vision, having already designed an ecosystem that will make tokenization and DeFi investment accessible to even those with limited capital. It’s no-code Rexas Token Builder lets anyone create asset-backed tokens in just minutes. The QuickMint Bot takes it even further, allowing users to tokenize assets through Telegram and Discord even without technical knowledge. That kind of ease of use is what makes Rexas Finance different, and it’s what’s drawing in thousands of new holders. Rexas Finance crossed the 50,000 holder milestone in February during its presale, an impressive sign of demand before it even hits major exchanges. RXS has already jumped 566% in presale value, moving from $0.03 to $0.20, with an official listing price set at $0.25. Analysts say that once trading begins and the exchange listings go live, RXS could look at 100x returns within the current cycle. Beyond the hype, there’s real momentum. Over $49 million has been raised in presale funds, and the team has completed a full CertiK audit with zero critical issues. This has given investors more confidence in the project’s security and long-term roadmap. The token launch is scheduled for June 19, and the countdown is on. Rexas Finance is building a full ecosystem. With AI tools for NFT creation, fractional real estate ownership with passive stablecoin income, and cross-chain staking opportunities, RXS offers something for everyone—from retail traders to institutions. As the crypto market heats up and the narrative around RWA tokenization grows stronger, Rexas Finance is one of the few tokens positioned to lead this next phase. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Quietly Dominating, Ready to Explode Hyperliquid’s HYPE is already outperforming most big names. Despite the broader correction, it’s holding steady above $33 and recently hit an all-time high of $39. HYPE powers the Hyperliquid trading platform, which is gaining serious traction for its smooth user experience and high-speed performance. With limited token supply, real trading demand, and bullish technical patterns, this isn’t just another short-lived pump. Even when analysts flash caution signs, HYPE keeps bouncing back. It’s holding a critical support zone at $29.20 with solid volume behind it. That means buyers are serious. If the crypto market recovers, this token could easily surge past $40. It’s already outranking coins like Sui and sneaking toward the top 10 on CoinMarketCap with zero major marketing. Dogecoin (DOGE): Poised for a Powerful Comeback After a stretch of sideways movement, analysts have spotted a classic bullish signal forming on DOGE’s charts—an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. This setup often hints at the end of a downtrend and the beginning of a fresh rally. Crypto analyst Klejdi Cuni highlighted this pattern on the 1-hour chart, suggesting a short-term breakout could push DOGE toward $0.239 and then $0.25. While these may seem like modest gains, they mark key resistance zones that, once broken, could open the door to much larger price jumps. Adding fuel to the fire, another respected analyst, Ali Martinez, pointed to a TD Sequential buy signal known for predicting short-term rallies. Combined with Dogecoin’s recent higher lows and consolidation near $0.25, this suggests bulls are ready to take charge. As altcoins start gaining steam and meme coin hype returns, Dogecoin could be the dark horse of 2025. With strong technical support and growing momentum, it might deliver 5x returns this cycle. Conclusion Ethereum and Ripple have been in the spotlight, but 2025 belongs to the movers. Rexas Finance is redefining real-world asset tokenization with tools that bring DeFi to the masses. Hyperliquid is already dominating the trading space, and Dogecoin is gearing up for a technical breakout that could shock the market once again. Miss these three tokens now; you might be chasing them later at much higher prices.

For those following cryptocurrency, understanding broader macro trends, including shifts in Asia FX and other Currency Markets , is crucial. Recently, a confluence of factors – primarily escalating Geopolitical Risk in the Middle East and strategic moves by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) – has put significant pressure on Asian currencies while boosting the Japanese Yen . This complex interplay of international tension and central bank action is shaping the immediate outlook for forex traders and investors worldwide. Why is Asia FX Feeling the Pressure? Asian currencies have recently experienced a downturn, dipping against the US dollar and other safe-haven assets. Several factors contribute to this vulnerability: Increased Risk Aversion: Heightened Geopolitical Risk , particularly the tensions between Israel and Iran, prompts investors to move away from assets perceived as riskier, which often includes emerging market and Asian currencies. Capital tends to flow towards safer havens like the US dollar, the Swiss Franc, and the Japanese Yen . Sensitivity to Global Shocks: Asian economies are deeply integrated into global supply chains and trade. Any threat to global stability or trade routes can negatively impact their economic outlook and currency strength. Differential Central Bank Policies: While some global central banks are contemplating rate cuts, others like the BOJ have only recently started moving away from ultra-loose policy. This divergence in BOJ Monetary Policy and that of other regional central banks can create pressure points for Asia FX . Commodity Price Volatility: Rising tensions can impact oil prices and other commodities, affecting the trade balances and inflation outlooks for importing and exporting nations in Asia, further influencing their currencies. This collective pressure leads to depreciation in various Asian currencies, making imports more expensive and potentially impacting inflation targets and economic stability in the region. The Rise of the Japanese Yen: A Safe Haven Amidst Tension? While much of Asia FX has been under pressure, the Japanese Yen has shown relative strength, or at least resilience, and has even firmed up recently. This might seem counterintuitive given Japan’s economic challenges, but it highlights the Yen’s enduring status as a safe-haven currency during times of global uncertainty. When Geopolitical Risk rises, investors often flock to assets perceived as stable and liquid, and the Yen fits this description. Furthermore, recent developments regarding BOJ Monetary Policy have played a significant role. The Bank of Japan’s decision to finally exit negative interest rates and end its yield curve control policy marked a pivotal shift. This move, while modest, signals a potential path towards tighter monetary conditions in Japan, increasing the attractiveness of Yen-denominated assets relative to a period of near-zero or negative rates. This policy pivot, combined with safe-haven demand driven by Geopolitical Risk , has provided a floor, and at times, a boost to the Japanese Yen against many other currencies, including some within Currency Markets in Asia. Decoding BOJ Monetary Policy’s Impact on Currency Markets The Bank of Japan’s recent policy adjustments are perhaps the most significant change in BOJ Monetary Policy in years. After maintaining ultra-low interest rates for an extended period to combat deflation, the BOJ raised its short-term policy rate target to a range of 0% to 0.1%. Key aspects of this shift include: Ending Negative Rates: This move formally concludes an eight-year experiment with negative interest rates. Scrapping Yield Curve Control (YCC): The BOJ will no longer directly control the yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds, allowing market forces more influence. Halting ETF/J-REIT Purchases: The central bank will stop buying exchange-traded funds and Japanese real estate investment trusts, unwinding unconventional stimulus measures. Continued JGB Purchases: The BOJ stated it would continue buying Japanese government bonds, though the amount might decrease over time. This shift in BOJ Monetary Policy reduces the yield differential between Japanese bonds and those in other countries, making the Yen potentially more attractive for carry trades (borrowing in a low-interest currency to invest in a high-interest one). While the initial rate hike was small, the *direction* of policy change is significant for Currency Markets and provides fundamental support for the Japanese Yen , counteracting some of the depreciation pressures it faced when rates elsewhere were much higher. How Does Geopolitical Risk Influence Currency Flows? The current elevated level of Geopolitical Risk stemming from the Middle East conflict has a direct and immediate impact on Currency Markets . Here’s how: Flight to Safety: Investors panic or become cautious, selling assets they perceive as risky (stocks, emerging market bonds, some Asia FX ) and buying traditional safe havens (US Dollar, Gold, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen ). This capital movement directly affects currency valuations. Impact on Oil Prices: The Middle East is a major oil-producing region. Tensions there often lead to spikes in oil prices. For oil-importing nations in Asia, this means higher import costs, potentially widening trade deficits and weakening their currencies. Oil-exporting nations might see their currencies strengthen, but overall risk aversion often outweighs this. Supply Chain Disruptions: While not immediately apparent, prolonged conflict could threaten shipping lanes or supply chains, impacting economies reliant on trade and potentially weakening their currencies. Uncertainty: Markets dislike uncertainty. The unpredictable nature of geopolitical events makes investors hesitant to commit capital to riskier assets, favoring the stability offered by major reserve currencies and safe havens like the Japanese Yen . This heightened Geopolitical Risk environment is a primary driver behind the recent divergence observed between the struggling Asia FX complex and the relatively stronger performance of the Japanese Yen . What’s Next for Asia FX and the Japanese Yen? The outlook for Asia FX and the Japanese Yen remains closely tied to these dominant themes: Geopolitical Risk and central bank policy, particularly BOJ Monetary Policy and the actions of other major central banks like the US Federal Reserve. Key factors to watch include: De-escalation or Escalation: Any significant change in the Middle East situation will immediately impact risk sentiment and currency flows. De-escalation could see some recovery in Asia FX , while escalation would likely boost the Japanese Yen and other safe havens further. Future BOJ Moves: While the BOJ exited negative rates, the pace of future rate hikes is uncertain. Any hints from the BOJ about further tightening or dovish signals could significantly move the Japanese Yen . US Dollar Strength: The US dollar remains a primary safe haven. Its trajectory, influenced by Fed policy and US economic data, will heavily impact all Currency Markets , including Asia FX and the Yen. Economic Data from Asia: Inflation, growth, and trade data from key Asian economies will also play a role in determining the resilience of their currencies against external pressures. For investors, navigating these Currency Markets requires careful attention to both macro-geopolitical developments and specific central bank communications. The current environment underscores the importance of understanding how global risk translates into currency movements. Concluding Thoughts The recent dips in Asia FX and the relative strength of the Japanese Yen are clear indicators of how global Geopolitical Risk and central bank decisions, notably the recent shift in BOJ Monetary Policy , are shaping the landscape of Currency Markets . The tension in the Middle East has amplified demand for safe havens, benefiting the Yen, while simultaneously increasing risk aversion towards other Asian currencies. As these complex dynamics continue to unfold, staying informed about both geopolitical developments and monetary policy shifts will be essential for anyone involved in the forex space or interested in the broader macroeconomic factors influencing global finance.

While both altcoins have their supporters, investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald said he prefers Solana over Ethereum. According to The Block, Cantor Fitzgerald said he supports Solana more as a treasury asset than Ethereum. Solana is a more logical treasury asset than Ethereum, Cantor analysts said, despite Ethereum having wider adoption and higher total locked value. Stating that he focused on three companies that adopted Solana as a treasury asset at this point, Cantor listed them as DeFi Development Corp., Upexi and SOL Strategies. Cantor analysts said the basis for this view is Solana’s potential to strengthen stronger developer growth and future on-chain finance. Analysts have stated that although they prefer Solana to Ethereum, they do not see SOL as a reserve asset similar to Bitcoin. “Developer growth on Solana has far exceeded growth in ETH recently and we expect this to continue. At this point, it makes sense to use SOL as a treasury asset instead of ETH, as SOL is thought to be capable of overtaking ETH, which currently has a market cap that is approximately 259% higher. Just as Bitcoin has established itself as the primary reserve currency or asset for the digital economy, we believe Solana aims to be the technology that powers transactions and marketplaces in the digital economy. We believe that SOL treasury companies are betting that the future of finance will be on-chain and that Solana will be the chain of choice.” Cantor recently set a target of $45 for DeFi Development Corp., $16 for Upexi, and $4 CAD for SOL Strategies. *This is not investment advice.

According to the post , the two most misunderstood components in forecasting XRP’s value are its transactions per second (TPS) and the token’s annual velocity. Future XRP begins by addressing the current capabilities of the XRP Ledger. Under real-world conditions, the ledger handles 1,500 TPS. However, in stress testing environments, it has achieved throughput exceeding 3,400 TPS. He argues that, with enhancements such as validator optimization or horizontal scaling through sidechains, XRP’s infrastructure could realistically scale to 10,000 TPS, or more. This is important, he explains, because TPS directly affects XRP’s annual velocity—the number of times each token is used within a year. For XRP to serve as the backbone for global settlements, velocity must become a key metric in understanding how much transactional volume the network can support, relative to its circulating supply. XRP Circulating Supply vs Total Supply While the total supply of XRP is capped at 100 billion tokens, Future XRP argues that the effective circulating supply could be far lower. He points out that a significant share of XRP is expected to remain in cold storage, be reserved in ETFs , locked in institutional agreements, or allocated for long-term staking . Depending on the scenario, the truly liquid supply could be between 10 and 60 billion XRP. He then uses these ranges to explore how velocity would shift under different TPS levels. At 10,000 TPS, XRP could handle approximately 315.36 billion transactions per year. With 20 billion XRP in circulation, that implies a velocity of 15.8. If supply is at 60 billion, the velocity is 5.26. However, if TPS remains at just 1,500, annual transaction volume drops to 47.3 billion, dramatically reducing velocity. Under this low-performance scenario with 60 billion XRP in circulation, velocity falls to only 0.79 turns. Quantifying XRP’s Role in Global Settlement The analysis then shifts to the potential value XRP might be required to settle in future financial ecosystems. According to Future XRP, the realistic annual settlement volume for XRP ranges between $500 trillion and $1 quadrillion. He clarifies that these figures are not speculative projections but rather reflect portions of established financial systems, such as cross-border payments, foreign exchange (FX) markets, tokenized securities, and derivatives. As a benchmark, he cites the SWIFT network, which processes over $5 trillion daily. Ripple, the company behind the XRP Ledger, has previously stated its goal to capture a 10–14% share of that market . When extended to include other forms of institutional and governmental settlement, Future XRP asserts that $1 quadrillion per year is a conservative long-term estimate, especially by 2030. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Applying the MV = PQ Formula Using the standard equation from monetary theory, MV = PQ (where M is the circulating supply, V is velocity, and Q is the total value transacted), Future XRP illustrates the relationship between XRP’s technical utility and price. Under a high-performance setup—10,000 TPS and a 20 billion circulating supply—XRP achieves 15.8 annual velocity. To settle $1 quadrillion in volume, the price per XRP would be calculated as: Price = 1,000,000,000,000,000 ÷ (20,000,000,000 × 15.8) = $3,165 per XRP. Even with a 60 billion supply, the price still aligns closely at $3,145 due to the inverse relationship between velocity and supply. However, under lower performance conditions, with TPS limited to 1,500 and a 60 billion supply, the token’s velocity falls drastically, and the model demands a far higher price of over $21,000 per XRP to settle the same volume. Conclusion Based on Mathematical Models Future XRP concludes by emphasizing that XRP’s potential valuation is a function of its practical use in global financial infrastructure. According to his analysis, hype and market sentiment are not central to understanding XRP’s trajectory. Instead, pricing models derived from real transaction throughput and supply dynamics make a strong case for a four- or five-digit valuation if XRP is to fulfill a global settlement role. His argument rests on calculations rather than conjecture, highlighting the role of TPS and velocity in determining the token’s necessity-driven price.

Since January, it has surged over 30%, shooting past $3,403 after briefly topping $3,500 in April. That’s a rejection of Treasurys, the yen, and the Swiss franc. Investors and central banks are piling into gold, not because it’s shiny, but because the old safety nets are unraveling in real time. According to CNBC, every corner of the financial world is now watching bullion claim the throne as the new crisis asset of choice. At the annual Asia Pacific Precious Metals Conference, Metals Focus managing director Nikos Kavalis explained why this is happening: “Gold’s key advantage is that it is no one else’s liability.” Holding bonds or fiat currencies means trusting the governments behind them. That trust is evaporating fast, especially in 2025, as fiscal policies from Washington to Tokyo turn unhinged. Treasurys fall, dollar weakens, central banks dump risk The US dollar index is down nearly 10% this year. The Japanese yen and Swiss franc gained 8% and 10% respectively, but that hasn’t saved their reputation. The yield on 10-year Treasurys dropped 19 basis points, signaling investor nervousness, not confidence. But none of that compares to gold, which keeps pushing record highs as chaos spreads. Shaokai Fan, global head of central banks at the World Gold Council, said the fear runs deep: “There’s a growing sense of just not being sure what the future of the US dollar and US Treasury market is going to be.” In April, President Donald Trump rolled out his “reciprocal” tariff policy. Treasurys got hammered. Then in May, Moody’s downgraded the US credit rating. Trump’s new tax bill followed, triggering another exit from long-term debt. The 30-year Treasury yield busted through 5%, and the damage stuck. The recovery in demand for US bonds hasn’t restored faith. Japan didn’t escape the selloff either. Yields on 10-year Japanese bonds are up 39 basis points since January. That means investors are walking away. The Bank of Japan hasn’t done much to fix that—keeping interest rates at 0.5% during both its May and June meetings. That interest rate differential makes the yen less attractive: people just don’t want to park their money in a place where they’ll earn nothing. Swiss franc gets less sexy, gold pulls in record central bank buyers The Swiss franc is up, but it’s not enough. The Swiss National Bank cut its policy rate to 0.25% in March. Consumer prices dropped in May for the first time in over four years, and that’s raised expectations of negative interest rates returning. That alone kills the franc’s appeal. Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities, said: “If the Swiss now have negative rates, and if I buy a franc, I’m not getting a lot of returns.” That’s why central banks are going heavy on gold. In 2024, they added 1,044.6 tons of it to their reserves—the third straight year they crossed the 1,000-ton line. By the end of that year, the European Central Bank confirmed that gold overtook the euro to become the second-largest reserve asset globally. It now makes up 20% of all official reserves. This year, it’s not slowing down. A fresh survey by the World Gold Council shows 95% of central banks expect to increase gold holdings in the next 12 months—the highest reading since the survey started in 2018. Meanwhile, three-quarters of them think their US dollar holdings will shrink over the next five years. Geopolitical tension is also changing storage behavior. Central banks no longer feel safe keeping all their bullion in New York or London. In February, Trump publicly questioned whether gold had gone missing from Fort Knox, making foreign officials even more nervous. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York holds bullion on behalf of foreign central banks—but trust is wearing thin. India repatriated over 100 tons from the Bank of England in 2024. Nigeria followed suit. In the same WGC survey, 7% of respondents said they were planning to store more gold locally—the most since the pandemic. The goal? Make sure the asset is actually reachable during a crisis or in case of sanctions. The reasons they’re buying are clear. In the survey, central banks said gold’s reliability during crises, its zero default risk, and its ability to hedge against inflation were the main factors behind the buying spree. Ever since the US went after Russia’s access to the global financial system after the Ukraine invasion, more countries started looking for financial insurance.

Rate Cuts Look Unlikely… For Now https://t.co/lgG5fx58Hd — The All-In Podcast (@theallinpod) June 17, 2025 According to prediction market Polymarket, there’s a 98% chance the Fed rate cuts will hold steady in June, and nearly 87% expect no changes in July either. While inflation is easing and GDP growth remains steady, Chamath argues the Fed’s reluctance to cut rates stems from political caution, not a lack of economic justification. Chamath’s $600B Scenario On the All-In Podcast, Chamath proposed a scenario in which the Fed slashes rates by a full percentage point. He explained such a move would have immediate and powerful effects in the long run, as the government could save around $300 billion in interest payments, and cheaper borrowing costs would stimulate short-term lending and business activity. Combined with Trump’s projected $300 billion in added tariff revenues, that’s $600 billion in potential fiscal gains. Hence, “If you make that cheaper, people borrow more money. That fuels more growth, and that will end up in GDP,” Chamath said, noting that the resulting economic boost could even outweigh a slight rise in inflation. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : FOMC Meeting Today: What to Expect from Jerome Powell Speech and FED Interest Rate , So Why Not Cut Rates Now? If such a move could generate strong growth and fiscal savings, Chamath questioned why the Fed wouldn’t act. In his view, the Fed may be holding back to avoid stirring up political issues before the next elections. So even though the numbers suggest a rate cut makes sense, Chamath thinks the Fed is being careful because of how it might look politically. If inflation drops closer to 2%, Palihapitiya expects the Fed will face pressure to justify keeping rates high. Should rate cuts happen, he says it’ll fuel confidence in U.S. markets, with global capital flowing into American assets. Echoing a similar sentiment, Crypto analyst Weaver, in his X post , explained that the Federal Reserve tends to follow the direction of the 2-year Treasury yield. If strong buying pressure pushes the 2-year yield lower, it gives the Fed room to cut interest rates. In short, you have to watch the 2-year yield; when it drops, rate cuts are likely to follow. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Both Ripple and the SEC have asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to delay the appeals process until August 15, 2025. This means the case will not move forward for at least two more months. But why the delay? Why the Delay Till August 15? The main reason for this delay is that Ripple and the SEC are trying to finalize a settlement agreement. Earlier this year, in April, the two sides said they were trying to reach a final settlement and asked the court for an “indicative ruling” to help move the process forward. The idea was to modify an earlier judgment—specifically, to lift the permanent injunction against Ripple and cut down the penalty from $125 million to $50 million. But in mid-May, that first attempt hit a roadblock. Judge Analisa Torres denied their joint motion, saying it didn’t meet the rare, “exceptional circumstances” needed to change a final ruling. Second Try—Still Waiting Not giving up, Ripple and the SEC filed a new motion on June 12, asking the district court to dissolve the injunction against Ripple and to adjust the penalty distribution. Meanwhile, that new motion is still pending, and Judge Torres has not yet given her decision. On the other hand, the SEC filed a new status report with the Second Circuit Court, asking to keep the case on hold while waiting for the judge’s response by August 15. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP In light of the pending motion for an indicative ruling, the parties have requested that the Second Circuit continue to hold the appeals in abeyance, with the @SECGov to file a status report by August 15, 2025. https://t.co/7oQvL5Rx7U — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) June 17, 2025 What’s Next For XRP? If the settlement is approved, it could lift the restrictions on Ripple and potentially boost XRP’s price.

At the forefront of this transformation is the news that Deutsche Bank tokenization efforts are moving forward significantly. Germany’s largest commercial bank is making waves with its plan to launch a minimum viable product (MVP) of its ambitious blockchain-based asset tokenization platform. Deutsche Bank Tokenization Platform: What’s the Plan? According to reports from WatersTechnology, Deutsche Bank is targeting November 2025 for the launch of its asset tokenization platform MVP. This development stems from the bank’s ‘Dama 2’ initiative, a strategic project focused on exploring and implementing distributed ledger technology (DLT) solutions. The primary goal of this platform is to provide financial institutions – including asset managers and wealth advisors – with the tools they need to create and manage tokenized assets . This move signals a strong commitment from a major global bank to leverage the potential of DLT for core financial activities. Understanding Asset Tokenization and Its Potential At its core, asset tokenization involves representing ownership rights or value of an asset (like real estate, art, stocks, or even funds) as a digital token on a blockchain or other DLT. This process can potentially: Increase liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets. Reduce intermediaries and associated costs. Enable fractional ownership. Improve transparency and auditability. Speed up transaction and settlement times. Deutsche Bank’s platform aims to make this process more accessible and cost-effective for financial firms looking to dip their toes into or expand their use of asset tokenization platform capabilities. The Significance of Institutional Tokenization When a major player like Deutsche Bank enters the fray, it lends significant credibility and momentum to the adoption of DLT in traditional finance. This focus on institutional tokenization is crucial because it addresses the needs and compliance requirements of large-scale financial operations. The platform’s design, specifically tailored for asset managers and wealth advisors, suggests a focus on streamlining complex processes involved in managing diverse portfolios. One of the key selling points highlighted is the reduction of upfront infrastructure and hardware costs. This is a significant barrier for many firms considering tokenization, and Deutsche Bank’s solution aims to lower this entry hurdle, potentially accelerating wider adoption within the financial sector. Why is Blockchain in Finance Gaining Traction? The integration of blockchain in finance is not a new concept, but it’s moving beyond experimental stages into practical applications. Banks and financial institutions are exploring DLT for various use cases, including payments, trade finance, and increasingly, asset tokenization. The benefits of immutability, transparency (when designed appropriately), and efficiency offered by blockchain technology align well with the requirements of modern financial systems. Deutsche Bank’s Dama 2 initiative is a prime example of how large institutions are strategically exploring these technologies to stay competitive and create new business models. What Does This Mean for Tokenized Assets? The launch of platforms like Deutsche Bank’s could significantly boost the market for tokenized assets . By providing a reliable and cost-effective infrastructure, the bank is enabling more types of assets to be tokenized and traded. This could lead to a proliferation of tokenized securities, funds, and other financial instruments, potentially creating more efficient and accessible markets. While the MVP in November 2025 is just the first step, it lays the groundwork for potentially much larger-scale tokenization efforts within the traditional financial system. Looking Ahead: The Path Post-MVP The MVP launch in November 2025 will likely focus on specific use cases or a limited set of clients. The success of this initial phase will be critical for the platform’s future development and broader rollout. Key factors to watch will include: Client adoption rates and feedback. Regulatory responses to the platform’s operation. The types of assets successfully tokenized. How the platform integrates with existing financial infrastructure. This move by Deutsche Bank is a clear indicator that major financial institutions see a tangible future in tokenization and DLT, moving from exploration to implementation. Conclusion Deutsche Bank’s plan to launch its asset tokenization platform MVP by November 2025 is a significant development in the ongoing convergence of traditional finance and blockchain technology.

In a recent post , DWF Labs CEO and Head of FalconStable, Andrei Grachev announced that the USD-backed stablecoin has been fully integrated into the Kaia ( KAIA ) Chain. The partnership enables the synthetic stablecoin to be embedded into the LINE messenger ecosystem through Kaia. “Together, we bring sustainable and innovative stablecoin yield solutions for more than 250 Millions of Line users BUIDL!” said Grachev in his recent post. By integrating USDf into Kaia Chain, LINE users will be able to access the stablecoin and earn passive yield from its staked product, sUSDf. Falcon Stable is a stablecoin venture established by DWF Labs’ Falcon Financial. Falcon Stable is the DWF Labs’ synthetic stablecoin protocol that enables users to mint a yield-bearing U.S. dollar‑pegged token called USDf. Unlike most stablecoins, Falcon’s USDf allows users to deposit various digital assets, such as other stablecoins like USD Coin ( USDC ) and Tether ( USDT ), major tokens like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and ETH ( ETH ) and even tokenized real-world assets into the protocol. These different assets are then used as collateral to mint USDf.

Minted USDf can be staked to receive sUSDf, an interest-bearing version that accrues yield with an APY that has surpassed 22%. At press time, the stablecoin has accumulated a market cap of nearly $560 million and a 24 hour trading volume of more than $1.7 million. Kaia Chain serves as the main web3 infrastructure for the messaging platform, LINE. Kaia powers the Mini Dapp and Dapp Portal within LINE’s messaging app, allowing users to seamlessly access and interact with decentralized applications without the need for web3 onboarding. LINE is a messaging platform popular among East Asians, with a user base of more than 250 million people registered. Back in August last year, LINE began diving into web3 with the integration of mini dApps powered by Kaia blockchain. The Kaia DLT Foundation is an independent body born from the merger of two prominent blockchain projects, from LINE and South Korean tech giant Kakao. The blockchain combines Line’s Finschia blockchain and Kakao’s Klaytn blockchain.

Even though he holds an advisory role at the firm managing the deal, Trump says he has no public involvement . Still, his post on X calling Tron founder Justin Sun a “great friend” and a “crypto icon” has raised eyebrows. So, what’s really going on between Tron, the Trumps, and their growing role in the crypto space? Tron’s Big Nasdaq Move Instead of going the traditional IPO route, Tron is set to go public through a reverse merger with SRM Entertainment, a little-known company based in Florida. SRM recently secured a $100 million investment from an undisclosed backer and plans to rebrand as “Tron.” The company will also start building a crypto treasury by accumulating TRX tokens. Leading the deal is Dominari Securities, a Trump-affiliated firm based in Trump Tower. It’s handling a $210 million stock offering tied to the merger. Both Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. joined Dominari’s advisory board earlier this year. Justin Sun and the Trump Connection Tron founder Justin Sun has been showing up more and more in Trump’s world. He attended the private launch party for Donald Trump’s meme coin, bought a $75 million stake in World Liberty Financial (WLFI), and is now the biggest holder of the $TRUMP token. At a Trump-hosted dinner for the top 220 $TRUMP holders, Sun was gifted a luxury Trump Golden Tourbillon watch. It’s another sign of his growing closeness to the Trump circle. Soon after Sun’s WLFI investment, the U.S. SEC quietly paused its long-running investigation into him and his companies. The probe was focused on possible market manipulation and unregistered securities. Whether that timing is coincidental or not is still up for debate. Donald Trump’s Crypto Cash Flow Donald Trump’s involvement in crypto is growing fast. In 2024, he made $58 million from crypto-related deals – mostly through WLFI token sales. That figure was second only to his hospitality income. And there’s more coming. In 2025, he’s expected to make another $390 million from token sales and gains from his meme coin, which launched earlier this year. Trump is also involved in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs. The SEC recently approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury plan, which includes 85 million shares – 29 million of them tied to convertible notes. Eric Trump Says “No Public Role” But Questions Remain Eric Trump’s statement distancing himself from the Tron deal hasn’t stopped the speculation. His role at Dominari, paired with the family’s expanding crypto activity, makes many wonder what’s really happening behind the scenes. With Tron’s public listing on the way and the Trumps playing a bigger role in the space, there’s no doubt this story is far from over.

On Monday, June 16, 2025, the official platform handles for the Solana-based memecoin launchpad Pump.fun and its co-founder founder Alon Cohen were taken offline from the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). When accessed, each now displays the message “Account suspended,” accompanied by X’s standard notice for violations of its platform rules. Screenshot of Pump.fun’s suspended X profile | Source: X The move appears to be part of a wider enforcement action targeting accounts tied to the memecoin sector. Over 20 accounts have been affected, including those linked to trading platforms BullX, Bloom Trading, GMGN, among others. Many of the suspended accounts are associated with bot infrastructure or automated trading tools, commonly used for launching tokens, sniping early trades, and managing memecoin positions. You might also like: Over 60% pump.fun traders saw losses, less than 0.01% made over $1m While X has yet to issue an official statement, speculation is mounting that the move is largely tied to Pump.fun’s controversial services.

However, this ease of access has also fueled a surge in malicious launches, including meme tokens that end in rug pulls or pump-and-dump schemes. This aspect of the platform has often drawn scrutiny, even resulting in two lawsuits earlier in January. Others across the community suggest that the suspensions may be due to the use of third-party APIs by the impacted accounts, a practice X officially banned in January 2023. Neither Pump.fun nor its founder has addressed the X account suspensions, and it remains to be seen whether the removals are temporary or permanent. One of the other affected platforms, GMGN, announced via Telegram that it is aware of the suspension and is in contact with the platform in hopes of restoring access.

In its June 13 filing made public on Monday, Paradigm requested that the court instruct the jury that for Storm to be convicted under federal money transmission laws, there must be clear evidence that he knowingly operated a business that controlled user funds, charged fees for transactions, and knowingly processed funds tied to criminal activity. Paradigm argued that the prosecution’s theory ignores longstanding FinCEN guidance, including 2019 statements issued under the Treasury Department clarifying that developers without control over funds are not money transmitters. “Subjecting a software developer to criminal liability under § 1960 for others’ independent actions, when the software developers had no control over any funds and their only ‘operation’ was creating immutable open-source code, would be as absurd as prosecuting a television manufacturer for state secrets being divulged on-air,” the brief stated. According to the brief, Storm’s role was limited to publishing open-source, self-custodial software. In an accompanying blog post , Paradigm’s chief legal officer Katie Biber and general counsel Gina Moon warned that allowing the charge to proceed could “let unelected prosecutors change the plain meaning of criminal statutes” and threaten people with imprisonment “even if they are following widely-disseminated and accepted regulatory guidance.” You might also like: Paradigm-backed AI startup Succinct launches token to transform contract analysis Industry executives have echoed Paradigm’s concerns in recent months. Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang previously signed a public letter calling for the case to be dismissed.

The DeFi Education Fund, which authored the April 28 petition, has argued that the Department of Justice’s approach threatens to criminalize “code-writing itself.” The prosecution has become a flashpoint in ongoing debates over how U.S. law treats open-source development. During Congressional hearings earlier this month, lawmakers raised similar concerns while reviewing the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act. Storm’s legal battle began in August 2023, when U.S. authorities charged him with conspiracy to facilitate money laundering, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitter, and violating U.S. sanctions. He faces up to 45 years in prison if convicted. Storm’s trial is scheduled to begin on July 14 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

According to data from crypto.news, WhiteBIT Coin ( WBT ) surged 32% intraday, forming a sharp breakout candle often referred to as a “god candle,” and reached a new all-time high of $52.27. The rally pushed its year-to-date gains above 110%. With a market cap of $7.43 billion, WBT has overtaken Toncoin ( TON ) and Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) to become the 21st-largest cryptocurrency in the market. The primary catalyst behind the surge was WhiteBIT’s announcement of an exclusive partnership with Juventus, one of Europe’s most iconic football clubs. The deal includes WhiteBIT’s logo being featured on Juventus’ official matchday jerseys, significantly increasing the exchange’s brand visibility across global sports audiences.

Here’s why. In his recent essay “Assume the Position”, Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, explained that the “stablecoin mania” is just getting started, but many retail investors are likely to get burned. Inspired by Circle’s stellar IPO , stablecoins will flood the market, Hayes says, with giants like Meta, X, and Airbnb jumping in, embedding their stablecoins directly into messaging, commerce, and payout systems. That’s great for tech stockholders, but bad for upstart stablecoin issuers who will be crushed by Big Tech’s scale. More importantly, stablecoin issuers are in a weak position because their success depends entirely on its distribution channels. If a company can’t get its coin listed on crypto exchanges, integrated into social media platforms, or adopted by legacy banks, it won’t survive. “… the only question you must ask yourself when evaluating an investment in a stablecoin issuer is this: how will they distribute their product? If they have no distribution, they have no chance of success. And if you can’t easily verify that said issuer has the access to push product through one or more of these channels, run away!” You might also like: “No need to go public:” Tether brushes off IPO talk post Circle debut Hayes believes that the stablecoin bubble will burst after a stablecoin issuer goes public and pulls in billions from unsuspecting investors by “using a combination of financial engineering, leverage, and amazing showmanship.” “A very bankable charismatic individual will get on stage and spew all sorts of nonsense, wave his (most likely a male) hands to and fro, and convince you why the leveraged piece of dogshit he is selling is about to corner the multi-trillion dollar stablecoin total addressable market (TAM),” Hayer writes. However, Hayes warns investors not to short stablecoin stocks just yet, saying, “These new stocks will rip the faces off of shorts.” Circle’s shares will also “continue levitating” in the near term, although Hayes considers it “insanely overvalued.” “Trade this shit like a hot potato,” he cautions, referring to both Circle and stablecoin stocks, in general.

Ethereum ( ETH ) is betting big on a future filled with rollups. But in typical Solana ( SOL ) fashion, the network is taking a different route—one that doesn’t just scale more blockspace, but bespoke execution environments with first-class developer control. You might also like: Warning to builders: L2s are leaking value, L1 appchains are the smarter bet | Opinion Enter network extensions, Solana’s most important—and misunderstood—infrastructure innovation to date. While they’re often compared to sidechains or dismissed as Solana’s version of appchains, that framing undersells what’s really happening here. Network extensions allow for custom execution environments that don’t fragment liquidity or composability, unlocking a new frontier for application-specific blockspace without breaking the core network apart. This isn’t just a scaling strategy. It’s a statement about how the future of crypto infrastructure will work. Solana’s modular, L1-integrated extensions preserve validator security, support differentiated consensus and transaction logic, and offer developers more design surface without forcing them to launch new chains or settle for constrained rollups. That’s a big deal for anyone building high-performance applications—from games to decentralized physical infrastructure networks to real-world finance. While Ethereum L2s offload computation and struggle with fragmented liquidity, Solana is building something quieter but more elegant: a unified, highly customizable L1 that treats specialization as a first-class primitive. And in doing so, it might just leapfrog the rollup wars entirely. Customization without fragmentation Ethereum’s L2s were built to scale. Solana’s network extensions were built to specialize. While Ethereum rollups increase throughput, they all run essentially the same playbook: general-purpose blockspace, minimal variation, and fragmented liquidity across siloed chains. The architecture improves efficiency, but not flexibility. Solana takes a different view. Network extensions let developers define their own execution environments from the ground up. They can customize consensus mechanisms, transaction logic, dedicated storage, and isolated environments that don’t compete with mainnet traffic. More importantly, they do it without breaking composability or spinning up entirely new chains. Data availability, Solana style Unlike Ethereum’s standardized rollups, Solana has not mandated a single approach to network extensions. That’s by design. It invites experimentation, so long as extensions validate state transitions and anchor them to layer 1, preserving Solana’s unified state and liquidity. To achieve this, Solana has introduced specialized data lanes, akin to Ethereum’s blobspace for rollups. One of the most promising developments is ZK compression, a joint effort by Helius and Light Protocol. By compressing account state and using zk-proofs to validate state transitions, ZK compression offers a glimpse into how Solana can scale without sacrificing verifiability or speed. Comparing Ethereum’s approach: Throughput over customization While Solana is enhancing execution environments with network extensions, Ethereum is focusing on two major scalability improvements: Layer-2 rollups and preconfirmations. Rollups bundle transactions off-chain, then submit them to Ethereum L1. The tradeoff? Fragmented liquidity and an independent state. Preconfirmations aim to reduce perceived latency by issuing soft guarantees before block inclusion. Useful? Sure. Transformative? Not really. Solana’s approach skips the workaround entirely. With sub-second finality, it doesn’t need preconfirmations. And with network extensions, it avoids the L2 complexity tax by keeping specialized execution environments anchored to a unified chain. Why this matters for builders For developers, network extensions lower the barriers to launching custom environments, without the overhead of managing an entirely new chain or compromising user experience. This unlocks a long tail of blockchain applications that don’t want to live inside generalized blockspace. Customization has already proven its value as a driver of innovation.. Network extensions encourage experimentation by providing secure, flexible execution environments for applications. Specifically, consumer-focused applications—where abstraction and UX optimization are paramount—stand to benefit the most. Applications that stand to benefit include: DeFi: Custom execution environments enable high-frequency trading, low-latency transactions, and built-in regulatory compliance features like KYC enforcement. Supply chain management: Isolated environments facilitate complex logistics workflows, ensuring data integrity and real-time tracking without burdening the mainnet. DePIN and IoT: Extensions can efficiently process data from IoT devices and integrate with blockchain-based DePIN networks. Gaming: Dedicated resources allow for near-instant settlements and optimized in-game economies. What comes next? Network extensions mark a shift in how blockchains can scale—not just by handling more transactions, but by supporting more types of applications. As more developers experiment with specialized execution environments, Solana’s infrastructure could evolve into a network of purpose-built layers that remain unified at the base. This model stands in contrast to the fragmentation creeping into other ecosystems. Rather than offloading scale to separate rollups or appchains, Solana keeps customization close to the core. That reduces friction, preserves composability, and gives developers more room to build without starting from scratch. This approach could yield custom-tailored DeFi platforms, next-gen consumer applications, and institutional blockchain environments compliant with real-world regulations. The success of network extensions will depend on developer adoption, tooling, and real-world deployment. But the early signs are promising. If executed well, this strategy could redefine blockchain infrastructure—shifting the focus from mere scalability to flexibility, adaptability, and application-specific performance.

Its massive online community fuels sudden price movements and surges in trading volume. Yet, for investors looking beyond the social buzz, it’s becoming increasingly clear that hype alone doesn’t sustain long-term gains. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently in Phase 5 of its presale, is steadily gaining real traction—not through trending hashtags, but through growing demand for its decentralized lending protocol and proven development progress. From Meme Power to Protocol Strength Shiba Inu (SHIB)’s journey highlights how internet culture can inflate token value quickly. However, tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB) are not typically backed by functional utility. While community support remains strong, the fundamental purpose of the token has remained limited compared to true DeFi solutions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, is attracting investor attention for a different reason. It is building a permissionless lending ecosystem where real users are preparing to earn revenue from lending out their crypto, all while maintaining full control over their assets via non-custodial smart contracts. The ecosystem will include both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models—offering tangible ways for users to generate income beyond speculation. At the heart of the protocol lies the P2C lending system. Lenders will be able to deposit tokens such as ETH, SOL, USDC, BTC, and others into liquidity pools. These pools will then be accessed by borrowers who must provide sufficient collateral to take out loans. As pool utilization increases, so will interest rates, creating a self-adjusting economic model driven entirely by market supply and demand. This system is designed to let users earn real yield, rather than depending on unsustainable token emissions. To make the experience more accessible, lenders will receive mtTokens in return for deposits. These mtTokens represent the initial deposit plus interest, and can be used within the ecosystem or even traded. For example, a DAI deposit generates mtDAI on a 1:1 basis, with the token accumulating value over time through yield generated in the lending pools. Unlike meme coins that rely solely on buying pressure and community sentiment, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a system where every interest payment has a source—borrower demand. And for users interested in more tailored strategies, the P2P lending model will allow lenders to set individual rates for unique tokens, including popular meme assets like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and DOGE. This flexibility offers a powerful advantage that centralized platforms rarely offer. The ecosystem is already showing signs of strong early momentum. With over $10.7 million raised and more than 12,100 holders on record, the presale is gaining the kind of traction typically seen in more mature protocols. The ongoing $100K giveaway is further encouraging user engagement and expanding the reach of the community. Security with a Stamp of Approval In a DeFi environment where trust is everything, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out with its third-party security verification. The protocol has completed a CertiK audit, a respected industry standard in smart contract evaluation. With a token scan score of 80.00 and a timeline spanning both manual and static analysis, this audit adds a crucial layer of trust for incoming users. As the protocol prepares for public launch, many users are calculating the long-term gains available at the current price of $0.03. For instance, a $2,000 investment at this stage can become $60,000 if the token reaches a 30x valuation after launch. With a total supply of 4 billion tokens and a future listing price of $0.06, early access provides a strategic entry point for those seeking value rooted in actual use cases—not just speculative hype. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not building a token for traders to flip—it is building an economy where participants generate income by supplying liquidity, negotiating direct loans, and contributing to a decentralized treasury. Layer-2 Infrastructure Brings Speed and Efficiency Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also preparing for scalability. By building the protocol with Layer-2 integration in mind, the team aims to address the limitations of traditional DeFi platforms—high gas fees and network congestion. Faster transactions and lower costs will significantly improve usability, especially for users who actively manage positions across the P2P and P2C models. As the lending ecosystem evolves, this Layer-2 foundation will give Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a competitive edge. It will make it easier to support more assets, onboard new users, and process thousands of loan agreements simultaneously—all while preserving decentralization and transparency. MUTM is the core token of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) protocol. Its role extends beyond transactional utility—it serves as a performance-linked indicator of protocol health. The development team has confirmed plans to use a portion of platform profits to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market. Those purchased tokens will then be sent to safety-module participants who stake mtTokens in designated contracts. This mechanism is designed to increase staking participation while reinforcing token value through sustained buy-side pressure. Future Milestones: A Platform Built for Long-Term Adoption While still in presale, the development roadmap indicates that a functional beta version of the Mutuum platform is being prepared besides the token’s launch. The decentralized stablecoin currently under development will further diversify protocol usage. Backed entirely by on-chain collateral and algorithmically controlled, this stable asset is expected to offer a reliable borrowing alternative while simultaneously contributing to protocol growth through interest redirection. Shiba Inu (SHIB)’s viral presence continues to attract retail attention, and such moments of social enthusiasm are part of what keeps the crypto market dynamic. But long-term success depends on more than just engagement metrics. Investors are increasingly shifting focus toward platforms like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), where real utility, sustainable earnings, and advanced technology combine into a single, working system.

Smart Investors Say Ruvi AI’s (RUVI) Low Price and Huge Upside Beats Binance Coin (BNB),https://timestabloid.com/summers-best-pick-smart-investors-say-ruvi-ais-ruvi-low-price/,"Ruvi AI (RUVI) is emerging as the go-to investment pick for this summer. With a low entry price, advanced technology integration, and huge upside potential, Ruvi AI is being favorably compared to industry veteran Binance Coin (BNB). Smart investors see Ruvi AI as the crypto to watch, with its rapid adoption and ambitious roadmap adding to its appeal.

BNB is also a significant player in the non-fungible token (NFT) sector, enabling transactions on Binance’s NFT marketplace. Coupled with its deflationary mechanism of periodic coin burns, BNB has consistently retained its value. Despite its solid standing, the high buy-in price of BNB may deter smaller investors, prompting them to explore promising alternatives like Ruvi AI. Ruvi AI (RUVI): Shaping the Future of Blockchain Automation Ruvi AI is making waves in the industry with its innovative fusion of blockchain and artificial intelligence. Designed as a decentralized superapp, Ruvi AI offers users the ability to create AI-generated content across various mediums like text, images, videos, and audio.

The ecosystem is powered by the $RUVI token, which facilitates transactions, governance, staking rewards, and premium feature access. Unlike many speculative tokens, $RUVI prioritizes tangible utility, making it a groundbreaking contender with real-world applications. Ruvi AI’s Presale Success Story The rapid success of Ruvi AI’s presale illustrates its increasing popularity. During Phase 1, tokens launched at $0.010, and the supply sold out within just two weeks. Early adopters saw sharp returns as the Phase 2 price jumped to $0.015, reflecting a 50% value increase. Ruvi AI has raised $1.8 million to date, amassed over 1,600 holders, and sold more than 150 million tokens. The project has already secured its first exchange listing and partnered with a reputable trading platform, ensuring liquidity and accessibility. With additional announcements scheduled, momentum continues to build, suggesting Ruvi AI’s best days are still ahead. Trust Built Through Cyberscope Auditing Ruvi AI has strengthened its market credibility by undergoing a security audit performed by Cyberscope, a leading blockchain security firm. This detailed evaluation covers Ruvi AI’s smart contracts, platform integrity, and compliance, providing investors with peace of mind in a volatile market.

A significant development is unfolding in Asia, specifically concerning South Korea crypto regulation . Lawmakers in South Korea are pushing forward with plans to introduce a comprehensive bill aimed at shaping the future of digital assets, with a particular focus on stablecoins. What’s Driving South Korea Crypto Regulation Efforts? South Korea has long been a hub for cryptocurrency activity, boasting a vibrant trading scene and innovative blockchain projects. However, like many nations, it grapples with the challenge of fostering innovation while protecting investors and maintaining financial stability. The proposed bill, spearheaded by lawmakers from the ruling party, seeks to strike this balance. The primary goal, as reported, is to promote healthy growth and innovation within the digital asset sector, suggesting a move towards clearer rules rather than outright prohibition. This initiative builds upon previous legislative efforts, indicating a sustained commitment from the government to establish a robust framework for digital assets. The focus on clear guidelines is expected to provide certainty for businesses and consumers alike, potentially boosting confidence in the market. Deep Dive: The South Korea Stablecoin Bill Details While the bill covers broader aspects of digital assets, a major highlight is its detailed approach to stablecoin regulation . Stablecoins, designed to maintain a stable value relative to a traditional currency or other asset, have become a critical part of the crypto ecosystem. However, their stability depends heavily on their underlying reserves and operational transparency, issues that have led to significant concerns globally. The proposed South Korean bill addresses these concerns directly by imposing stringent requirements on stablecoin issuers. According to reports, issuers will need to meet a set of 12 specific conditions to operate legally within the country. These conditions are designed to ensure the financial soundness, governance, and transparency of stablecoin operations. Let’s break down some of the key requirements: Capital Requirement: Issuers must hold a minimum capital of at least one billion won, which is approximately $734,000 USD at current exchange rates. This significant financial threshold aims to ensure that issuers have sufficient resources to manage their operations and potentially absorb losses. Executive Eligibility: Executives of stablecoin issuing companies must meet specific eligibility criteria outlined under existing financial company governance laws. This ensures that leadership has the necessary expertise and adheres to high standards of conduct, similar to traditional financial institutions. Clear User Redemption Policies: The bill mandates that issuers establish and clearly communicate policies for users to redeem their stablecoins for the underlying reserve assets or fiat currency. This is crucial for maintaining the ‘stable’ peg and ensuring users can access their funds when needed. Reserve Asset Standards: Strict standards will be set for managing the assets that back stablecoins. This includes rules on what types of assets can be held (e.g., cash, government bonds), how they should be stored, and how frequently reserves must be audited and reported. These requirements signal a clear intent from South Korean regulators to treat stablecoins with the same level of scrutiny as other financial instruments, emphasizing stability and investor protection. Why This Matters for Global Stablecoin Regulation? South Korea’s move is not happening in isolation. Countries worldwide are grappling with how to regulate stablecoins. The collapse of Terra/Luna in 2022 highlighted the potential risks associated with poorly regulated or structured stablecoins, accelerating the push for clearer rules. This South Korea stablecoin bill adds to the growing global trend of bringing stablecoins under tighter regulatory control. We’ve seen similar discussions and proposals in the United States, the European Union (with MiCA regulation), and other jurisdictions. South Korea’s specific approach, particularly the detailed conditions and capital requirements, could serve as a reference point or influence regulatory discussions in other countries. It underscores the international consensus that stablecoins, due to their potential role in payments and the broader financial system, require a robust regulatory framework to mitigate risks related to liquidity, solvency, and transparency. What Does This Crypto Law South Korea Mean for Issuers and Users? For stablecoin issuers looking to operate or continue operating in South Korea, this new crypto law South Korea represents a significant compliance challenge. Meeting the 12 conditions, including the substantial capital requirement and stringent reserve management rules, will require considerable investment in infrastructure, personnel, and legal expertise. On the flip side, for users of stablecoins in South Korea, the bill aims to provide greater confidence and security. Knowing that issuers are subject to strict capital, governance, and reserve standards should reduce the risk of stablecoin de-pegging or issuer insolvency. Clear redemption policies mean users should have reliable access to their funds. This could potentially make stablecoins a more trusted and widely used tool for payments and transfers within the South Korean digital asset market, fostering healthier growth built on a foundation of regulatory clarity and safety. Navigating Digital Asset Regulation in South Korea The proposed bill is a crucial step in the broader landscape of digital asset regulation in South Korea. It signals a shift from a relatively less structured environment to one with specific rules for key components like stablecoins. This move is part of a larger global trend where regulators are defining how cryptocurrencies fit into existing financial systems. While the bill’s full impact will become clearer upon its finalization and implementation, it’s evident that South Korea is positioning itself to create a regulated, yet innovative, digital asset market. Companies operating in or planning to enter the South Korean market must pay close attention to these developments and prepare for increased compliance requirements, particularly concerning stablecoins. This regulatory clarity, while demanding, is often seen as a necessary step for attracting institutional investment and fostering mainstream adoption of digital assets, as it provides a framework of trust and accountability. In conclusion, South Korea’s planned crypto bill, with its detailed requirements for stablecoins including a significant capital threshold, marks a pivotal moment in the country’s approach to digital asset regulation. It reflects a global trend towards stricter oversight of stablecoins and aims to build a more secure and reliable environment for participants in the South Korean crypto market. As the bill progresses through the legislative process, its specific provisions will be closely watched by the international crypto community.

The world of early-stage crypto projects just got a bit more interesting. Binance Alpha, a dedicated showcase platform nestled within the powerful Binance Wallet ecosystem, is set to feature the Matchain (MAT) token starting June 19. This move, announced via Binance’s official communication channels, highlights Matchain MAT as a project gaining traction and community interest. What Exactly is Binance Alpha and Why Does it Matter for Crypto Projects? Think of Binance Alpha as a curated spotlight for promising, early-stage crypto projects . It’s not the main Binance exchange listing platform, but rather a feature within the broader Binance Wallet environment. Its primary goal is to give visibility to tokens that have demonstrated strong community engagement, innovative technology, or alignment with current market trends among emerging projects. For nascent crypto projects like Matchain MAT, being selected for Binance Alpha offers significant benefits: Increased Visibility: Gaining exposure within the massive Binance ecosystem immediately puts the project in front of a large, active user base interested in crypto. Community Growth: The spotlight can attract new community members, developers, and potential investors. Validation (Partial): While not a full endorsement or guaranteed crypto listing , inclusion suggests the project has met certain initial criteria assessed by Binance’s team. Potential for Future Growth: Strong performance and continued development while featured on Alpha could potentially pave the way for deeper integration or even a full crypto listing on the main Binance exchange down the line (though this is explicitly NOT guaranteed). This platform serves as a bridge, allowing users within the Binance Wallet to discover and potentially interact with tokens before they might hit the mainstream trading markets. Meet Matchain MAT: What Do We Know? Based on the announcement, Matchain (MAT) is the project stepping into the Binance Alpha spotlight. While specific details about Matchain’s technology, use case, and roadmap would require a deep dive into the project’s own documentation (website, whitepaper, etc.), its selection by Binance Alpha suggests it fits the criteria of an engaging and potentially trend-aligned emerging project. Users interested in Matchain MAT should conduct their own thorough research into its fundamentals, team, tokenomics, and community before considering any involvement. Key aspects to research about Matchain MAT would typically include: The core problem the project aims to solve. The technology stack or blockchain it utilizes. Its target market or user base. The utility and distribution of the MAT token. The strength and activity of its community. Understanding these elements is crucial for anyone looking at crypto projects featured on platforms like Binance Alpha . Understanding the Crucial Caveat: Binance Alpha vs. Full Crypto Listing This is perhaps the most critical point for users and potential investors to grasp. The announcement clearly states that inclusion on Binance Alpha does NOT guarantee a future crypto listing on the main Binance exchange. This distinction is vital for managing expectations and assessing risk. Think of it this way: Feature Binance Alpha Inclusion Full Binance Crypto Listing Platform Featured within Binance Wallet Tradable on Binance Exchange (Spot, Futures, etc.) Availability Showcased to Binance Wallet users Available for trading to all eligible Binance users globally Selection Criteria Community engagement, market trends among emerging projects More rigorous review: technology, team, market demand, compliance, etc. Trading Typically no direct trading pairs on Binance Exchange (users might need to acquire elsewhere) Official trading pairs (e.g., MAT/USDT, MAT/BTC) Guarantee of Future Listing NO GUARANTEE Is the listing itself While being on Binance Alpha is a positive signal and provides exposure, it’s a separate process from the stringent evaluation required for a full crypto listing . The journey from Alpha to a main exchange listing, if it happens at all, is often long and depends on the project’s continued performance, adoption, and meeting Binance’s evolving listing standards. Actionable Insights for Those Watching Matchain MAT and Binance Alpha For individuals interested in Matchain MAT or keeping an eye on projects featured on Binance Alpha , here are some key takeaways and actions: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): This cannot be stressed enough. Don’t treat the Binance Alpha inclusion as an implicit endorsement for investment. Investigate Matchain’s fundamentals independently. Understand Binance Alpha’s Role: Recognize that it’s a discovery platform within the Binance Wallet , not a trading launchpad on the main exchange. Assess Risk: Early-stage crypto projects are inherently high-risk. They may face significant volatility, development challenges, or fail to gain traction. Only consider exposure if you are comfortable with potential total loss. Monitor Community and Development: Since Binance Alpha considers community engagement and trends, observe how the Matchain MAT community reacts and how the project progresses after the June 19th feature date. Manage Expectations: Do not assume a quick crypto listing on the main Binance exchange is imminent or guaranteed. Plan based on the project’s own merits, not solely on its Alpha status. Utilizing Binance Wallet to potentially interact with featured projects requires understanding the wallet’s functionalities and associated risks. Challenges Early Crypto Projects Face (and How Alpha Might Help) Early crypto projects navigate a challenging landscape. They need to build technology, find product-market fit, attract users, and build a strong community, often with limited resources and intense competition. Gaining visibility is one of the biggest hurdles. This is where Binance Alpha provides a potential advantage. By featuring projects like Matchain MAT , it helps them overcome the initial visibility barrier. However, the fundamental challenges remain: Adoption: Can the project attract real users and achieve widespread adoption? Sustainability: Is the business model and tokenomics sustainable long-term? Competition: How does it stack up against similar projects? Regulation: How will evolving regulations impact the project? Execution: Can the team deliver on their roadmap? Being on Alpha doesn’t solve these core challenges, but the increased attention might provide the necessary boost in community and resources to better address them. Summary: A New Chapter for Matchain MAT on Binance Alpha The addition of Matchain MAT to Binance Alpha on June 19 marks an exciting step for the project, granting it valuable exposure within the extensive Binance Wallet user base. As a platform designed to showcase promising, community-driven crypto projects , Binance Alpha serves as an important discovery tool. However, it is crucial for everyone in the crypto space to remember that this feature is distinct from a full crypto listing on the main Binance exchange and comes with no guarantee of one. Users interested in Matchain MAT should approach with informed caution, conducting thorough research and understanding the inherent risks associated with early-stage ventures. This development offers an opportunity for the Matchain project to gain momentum and for users to explore a potentially interesting new project within the familiar environment of the Binance ecosystem.

Recently, both parties jointly filed a motion requesting the court to revise its earlier judgment. The motion aims to reduce Ripple’s financial penalty from $125 million to $50 million, return $75 million in escrowed funds, and lift the injunction on institutional XRP sales, which is a major source of regulatory contention. Here’s the Impact on XRP Price Meanwhile, the investor’s sentiment around XRP has turned notably bullish in recent days. Following the news of the proposed settlement, the price experienced a minor uptick, trading around $ 2.2. If the legal clarity materializes, the XRP price projections range from $1.5 to $3, as the current price action indicates towards the beginning of a broader rally. Some more optimistic technical forecasts even target up to $4.5, based on breakout patterns and historical resistance levels. As seen in the above chart, the XRP price has reached the edge of the consolidation and hence is speculated to undergo a bullish breakout. Although the price has been experiencing a notable upward pressure over the past few weeks, the token has managed to hold firmly above the ascending support of the bullish pennant. Therefore, a breakout is expected to elevate the levels to a new ATH. What Technicals Say! Despite the bearish pressure, the weekly RSI has remained strong above the ascending trend line, hinting towards a rising bullish potential. On the other hand, the weekly MACD shows a drop in the selling pressure, while the levels are going parallel to each other, displaying the possibility of a bullish crossover. Hence, the XRP price is expected to break above the crucial resistance and clear $2.5 initially and later make it above $3. If the price sustains above these levels, then the token is expected to form new highs around $3.6 to $3.7 in the short term before facing a rejection. However, in the long term, the XRP price target remains beyond $5 to $8, which may be extended to $10.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-17 11:45:04

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Gromen tells his 340,800 followers that he thinks gold and Bitcoin are poised to surge if energy prices spike. “1. Whenever physical [gold] is revalued to a big multiple of oil, energy prices in fiat will skyrocket, sending gold far higher on fiat. 2. When energy prices in fiat skyrocket, the price of BTC will also skyrocket in fiat. And the stock-to-flow ratio of BTC is way higher than gold.” When asked about the connection between oil and BTC, the macro expert explains that surging energy prices fuel inflation, which in turn puts pressure on the bond market. “Because the bond market will need to be capped with printed money to prevent the inflation driven by a rise in energy prices from collapsing it… Rising energy prices beyond a point will break bonds. Once that happens, either money will have to be printed to cap yields to maintain government solvency, or sovereign debt will nominally get restructured. Assets with no counterparties should outperform (gold, BTC).” When inflation is on the up and up, bond investors demand higher yields (returns) to make up for the loss in purchasing power. Bonds locked into lower yields typically witness a drop in value as investors rush out of assets that offer little to no real returns, triggering a bond market collapse. Gromen thinks that the Fed will be forced to buy bonds with printed money to prevent a collapse, creating favorable conditions for Bitcoin and gold. Gromen also notes that at the most fundamental level, Bitcoin is a product of the energy market as miners rely on massive amounts of electricity to mine BTC. “Electricity used to support BTC and its price is very real, enough to power much of the US continent.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $106,401.

A motion filed on Monday by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York revealed that Celsius debtors and Mashinsky have reached a legal agreement to prevent any payouts to the former executive and his related parties. The filing allows Celsius to distribute funds that were previously locked due to outstanding claims by Mashinsky and the three entities. The court retained jurisdiction to oversee any disputes related to the agreement but made clear it will not interfere with Mashinsky’s ongoing criminal case. “The Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve any and all disputes related to this Stipulation and Order,” the motion stated, underscoring that the criminal proceedings remain separate and unaffected by this bankruptcy arrangement. Mashinsky Sentenced to 12 Years in Prison for Fraud The agreement follows Mashinsky’s sentencing in May, where he received 12 years in prison after being found guilty of fraud connected to the collapse of Celsius Network. His legal team had appealed for leniency by highlighting his past military service and his December guilty plea. Despite these efforts, the court handed down a significant sentence, though it stopped short of the 20 years requested by the U.S. Department of Justice. Mashinsky’s lawyers argued that such a sentence would amount to a “death-in-prison” outcome given his age . Mashinsky’s downfall has been a focal point in the broader scrutiny of failed crypto lenders, many of which collapsed during the 2022 market downturn. Celsius Creditors Begin Recovering Funds While Mashinsky is barred from recovery, creditors have begun seeing some relief. Since the start of 2024, creditors have claimed more than $1 billion in assets. In August 2024, the Celsius disbursed over $2.5 billion to more than 251,000 creditors. However, around 121,000 potential claimants opted not to stake their claims—largely because the amounts were below $1,000, with many losing under $100. In a follow-up announcement from November, Celsius confirmed a $127 million payout from its “Litigation Recovery Account,” aimed at retail users and Earn program participants. Celsius initially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2022, and two key settlements reached in 2023 have since helped the company advance toward completing its restructuring.

On June 15, ZKJ plunged from roughly $2 to just 32 cents in under an hour, losing nearly $500 million in market cap. An initial post‑mortem released in Asian morning hours laid out various factors resulting in the collapse, including a supposed coordinated liquidity attack on PancakeSwap’s ZKJ/KOGE pool, substantial ZKJ deposits by market-making company Wintermute into centralized exchanges, and a cascade of liquidations on CEXs like Bybit. On-chain data reveals that several addresses had drained millions from the ZKJ/KOGE pool. One removed about $4.3 million in liquidity provider (LP) tokens and dumped 1.57 million ZKJ; others followed, unloading close to 1 million ZKJ each. When the shallow KOGE/USDT pool couldn’t absorb the sell pressure, activity spilled over into the deeper ZKJ/USDT pool, triggering a liquidity spiral, the team claimed. Further pressure came from a Wintermute-associated address that deposited over 3.39 million ZKJ into centralized exchanges in the crash window, the team said. However, in an X post, Wintermute co-founder Evgeny Gaevoy said the team was selling spot and going long via ZKJ-tracked futures. As spot prices collapsed, roughly $94 million in leveraged long positions were liquidated between 12:00 and 14:00 UTC, including multiple six-figure margin calls that compounded the crash. To stem the hemorrhage, Polyhedra’s team injected approximately $30 million in USDT, USDC, and BNB as DEX liquidity. It added that no ZKJ holdings belonging to the team were sold. Polyhedra affirms it’s conducting a full technical investigation, and its upcoming buyback initiative aims to both offset the attack’s impact and deter similar future exploits. Token prices rose by more than 50% following the release of the crash report, but all gains were reversed throughout the day, and prices are now up just 1.3% over the past 24 hours.",Tech|Hack|DeFi|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-17 11:50:01

Over the past week, XRPL has averaged 295,000 daily interacting addresses. This is more than seven times higher than its previous three-month average of 35,000 to 40,000. Data from blockchain analytics firm Santiment shows the rise has been steady throughout the week, indicating growing interest in the ledger’s ecosystem. The consistent increase suggests a wider range of users, including both individuals and large entities, are now interacting with the XRPL infrastructure. The XRP ledger is showing serious signs of growth, from both a usage and key stakeholder perspective. The amount of interacting $XRP addresses has averaged over 295K per day over the past week. Its normal daily average over the past 3 months was approximately 35-40K. … pic.twitter.com/RvxE8BSFAg — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 16, 2025 Whale Wallets Take Center Stage One clear sign of increased activity on the XRP Ledger is the surge in high-value accounts. For the first time in its 12-year history, 2,708 wallets now hold over 1 million XRP each. These “whale” and “shark” addresses often belong to institutional players or large-scale holders with long-term plans. Notably, this rise in large holdings points to stronger institutional positioning on the network. The growing concentration of XRP in major wallets signals rising institutional confidence. This trend could strengthen liquidity dynamics and streamline value transfers across the network. The trend is further supported by growing enterprise interest in XRPL. For example, asset manager Guggenheim recently introduced digital commercial paper on the network, highlighting its expanding role in traditional finance. Likewise, Circle’s USDC stablecoin launched on XRPL, enhancing its liquidity and transactional utility. These moves align with Ripple’s broader strategy to expand cross-border payment corridors and secure regulatory clarity. As the network matures, institutions may be positioning themselves early to leverage XRPL’s evolving infrastructure. Markets React to On-Chain Momentum On the price front, XRP is starting to reflect the buzz. The token moved between $2.10 and $2.32 over the past week and currently trades at $2.22, up 1.9% in the last 24 hours. Market activity around XRP has also intensified. Daily trading volume jumped by 245%, likely as market participants reacted to the on-chain momentum.

A significant development is on the horizon as one of the nation’s leading platforms, Bithumb, has just announced a major new addition. This Bithumb Listing is set to bring fresh opportunities for traders looking to diversify their portfolios. What Does the Bithumb Listing Mean for SPK Token? The official word is out! Korean Crypto Exchange giant, Bithumb, confirmed on its official website that it will be listing the SPK KRW Pair for spot trading. This highly anticipated event is scheduled to go live at 10:00 UTC on June 17th . For traders in South Korea, this translates to 19:00 KST on the same day. A spot trading pair means you’ll be able to directly buy or sell the SPK token using South Korean Won (KRW). This move by Bithumb is more than just adding another coin; it opens the door for a significant number of traders to access the SPK Token directly through a familiar and trusted platform. Bithumb holds a substantial share of the South Korean crypto market, making any listing on the exchange a notable event for the listed asset. Understanding the Spark Token (SPK) So, what exactly is the Spark Token , or SPK, that’s getting listed? SPK is the native utility token powering the Spark network. While specific details about the Spark project can vary, native tokens like SPK typically serve multiple functions within their ecosystem, such as: Governance: Allowing token holders to vote on project proposals. Staking: Earning rewards by locking up tokens to support network operations. Utility: Paying for services, accessing features, or participating in activities within the Spark ecosystem. Incentives: Rewarding users or participants for contributing to the network. Projects launching tokens like SPK aim to build decentralized applications, services, or protocols. The success and adoption of the Spark network are intrinsically linked to the value and utility of its SPK Token . Why is the SPK KRW Pair on a Korean Crypto Exchange Important? The choice of the SPK KRW Pair is particularly significant. The South Korean market is known for its active retail investor base and high trading volumes. Listing a token directly against the Korean Won on a major platform like Bithumb provides a direct fiat on-ramp for South Korean residents. This eliminates the need to first trade KRW for a stablecoin or another major cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ethereum before acquiring SPK, simplifying the process and potentially reducing fees for local traders. For the Spark project, getting listed with a direct KRW pair on a prominent Korean Crypto Exchange like Bithumb offers unparalleled access to this crucial market, potentially boosting liquidity and increasing the token’s visibility among a dedicated group of crypto enthusiasts. What Potential Benefits Could This Bithumb Listing Bring? A listing on a major platform like Bithumb can have several positive implications: Increased Liquidity: More trading pairs and easier access typically lead to higher trading volumes and better liquidity for the SPK Token . Enhanced Exposure: Listing on a top-tier exchange brings the Spark Token to the attention of a vast number of potential investors and traders who actively use the platform. Market Accessibility: The SPK KRW Pair makes it significantly easier for South Korean investors to buy and sell SPK. Potential Price Impact: While not guaranteed, increased demand and accessibility following a major exchange listing can sometimes positively impact the token’s price. Are There Challenges or Considerations for Traders? While the news is positive, traders should always approach new listings with caution and a clear strategy. Here are a few things to consider: Volatility: New listings can experience significant price swings shortly after trading begins due to initial market reactions. Research is Key: Before trading, thoroughly research the Spark project, its fundamentals, use cases, and tokenomics. Don’t trade based solely on the listing news. Market Conditions: The broader crypto market sentiment can also influence the performance of a newly listed token. Actionable Insights Before Trading SPK on Bithumb If you’re considering trading the SPK KRW Pair on Bithumb, here are some steps you might take: Research Spark: Understand the project’s whitepaper, team, technology, and roadmap. Study Bithumb’s Platform: Familiarize yourself with Bithumb’s trading interface, fee structure, and deposit/withdrawal procedures for SPK. Develop a Trading Plan: Decide on your entry and exit points, risk tolerance, and how much capital you are willing to allocate. Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from Bithumb and the Spark project. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Spark Token on Bithumb The upcoming Bithumb Listing of the SPK KRW Pair marks a significant milestone for the Spark Token and the Spark ecosystem. By providing direct access to the token for users on a major Korean Crypto Exchange , this move has the potential to greatly enhance liquidity, expand the project’s reach, and foster greater adoption. As the June 17th listing date approaches, market participants will be watching closely to see how this new trading pair performs and what it means for the future of SPK.

Kraken’s latest move is one of them and it could have a lasting impact on how crypto gets integrated into mainstream finance. The exchange has launched a Crypto-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform in partnership with equities broker Alpaca. It’s not flashy, but it’s powerful: more than 200 enterprise clients connected to Alpaca can now offer crypto trading, yield, and custody without infrastructure or licenses needed. It’s a major step toward making crypto services as easy to plug in as payment gateways and that’s where things start to get interesting. Plug-and-Play Crypto? Kraken’s CaaS model acts as a modular crypto backend for brokers, FinTech apps, and digital wallets. It’s designed to slot right into existing platforms, letting companies offer crypto services without starting from scratch. “They basically get access to Kraken’s entire suite of assets,” said Brett McLain, Kraken’s Head of Payments and Blockchain. “We today support over 400 different assets, over 10 different blockchains.” That includes full compliance, deep liquidity, and a ready-to-go infrastructure, which is exactly what traditional finance firms have been waiting for before jumping into crypto. Banks Want Stablecoins – Kraken Is Ready One trend Kraken is clearly watching: stablecoins. McLain says interest from big banks is picking up fast. Some are planning to issue their own, others want to use existing ones, but nearly all of them need the backend support to do it safely and at scale. Kraken wants to be that support layer. Tokenized Stocks Are Just the Start Kraken is also pushing deeper into tokenized real-world assets, starting with tokenized stocks through its xStocks platform. The bigger vision includes tokenizing real estate and other tangible assets to unlock new liquidity and access. “The tokenization of real-world assets [has] long been a holy grail for crypto,” McLain noted – and Kraken’s aiming to build the infrastructure to make it happen. Kraken’s Shortcut Through EU Regulation While crypto regulation in Europe gets stricter under MiCA, Kraken has found a smart workaround: its partnership with Alpaca. By plugging into Kraken’s licensed infrastructure, Alpaca’s clients in Europe can offer crypto services without waiting years for their own approvals. That makes Kraken an easy on-ramp for brokers and apps looking to expand into crypto across multiple markets, including Canada, the UK, and Europe. Compliance That’s Built In One of Kraken’s smartest moves? Making KYC/KYB compliance part of the foundation. Instead of tacking it on later, it’s baked into the CaaS system – making it faster and smoother for clients to onboard and launch. This aligns with a broader shift in financial tech: embedded services. Just like payments and lending are getting built directly into apps, crypto is heading the same way. As banks and brokers look to enter crypto without the risk or red tape, Kraken’s CaaS could become the infrastructure powering it all.

Bitcoin cash BCH, the best performing top 100 cryptocurrency of the past 24 hours, looks set to chalk out a bull run against bitcoin BTC. That's because the BCH/BTC trading pair listed on Bitstamp has jumped out of a triangle pattern identified by series of descending intraday price highs and ascending price lows, both representing a narrowing price range. Breakouts from these patterns typically lead to significant moves, which means BCH could chalk out an impressive bull run against bitcoin in the days ahead. Adding to the bull case is the fact that the ratio has already topped the 200-day simple moving average, a barometer of long-term trends tracked by both retail and institutions. The ratio's expected ascent could face resistance at 0.00467, the swing low registered in February 2024, followed by the December high of 0.00636. The bullish outlook stands invalidation in case of a potential move below the monthly low of 0.00373.

HYPE's daily price chart shows that while the token has recently hit higher intraday highs, the 14-day relative strength, a momentum osicalltor, has diverged lower, confirming a so-called negative divergence.

This move involves a staggering $980 million, injecting a massive amount of capital infusion into the protocol’s liquidity pools. The news was first shared by Marc Zeller, founder of the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI), via a post on platform X (formerly Twitter). According to reports from Odaily, Plasma had recently completed a public placement, successfully raising $1 billion in capital, making this large deposit possible. What is the Significance of this Massive Crypto Deposit? A nearly billion-dollar deposit is not an everyday occurrence in the DeFi lending space, even for a protocol as established as Aave . This particular crypto deposit is significant for several reasons: Scale: The sheer size of the $980 million deposit immediately boosts Aave’s Total Value Locked (TVL), signaling strong confidence from large-scale participants. Source: Coming from a stablecoin project like Plasma , it suggests a strategic allocation of raised capital, likely seeking yield or integration opportunities within a reputable DeFi protocol. Market Signal: Such a large capital infusion can be interpreted as a positive signal for the health and attractiveness of the Aave protocol and potentially the broader DeFi market, indicating that significant funds are comfortable interacting with decentralized platforms. This event highlights the increasing maturity of the DeFi ecosystem, where large entities are comfortable deploying substantial funds into protocols like Aave for various financial activities. Who is Plasma and Why Choose Aave DeFi Lending? While specific details about the Plasma project itself and its stablecoin mechanics might require deeper investigation, the core information is that it’s a project that recently secured substantial funding ($1 billion). Deploying a significant portion ($980 million) of this newly raised capital infusion into a DeFi lending protocol like Aave suggests a strategic decision. But why Aave ? Aave is one of the largest and most well-regarded decentralized lending and borrowing protocols. It allows users to deposit crypto assets to earn yield or borrow assets by providing collateral. Its key features include: Established reputation and track record. Robust security measures (though DeFi always carries inherent risks). Diverse range of supported assets. Governance structure (partially overseen by entities like the Aave Chan Initiative). Deep liquidity pools (further enhanced by this deposit). For a project like Plasma holding a large amount of stablecoin (or assets easily convertible to stablecoin), depositing into Aave could serve multiple purposes: Yield Generation: Earning passive income on their large capital reserves by lending it out via the protocol. Liquidity Management: Utilizing Aave’s pools for future operational needs or integrations. Establishing Presence: Signaling their involvement and confidence in the broader DeFi ecosystem by participating in a leading protocol. The choice of Aave underscores its position as a go-to destination for large-scale DeFi lending activities. How Does This Capital Infusion Benefit Aave? The arrival of $980 million from Plasma represents a significant capital infusion for the Aave protocol. The primary and most direct benefit is the substantial increase in available liquidity. More liquidity in lending pools generally means: Increased Capacity: More room for users to borrow assets without significantly impacting interest rates. Improved Stability: Deeper pools are often more resilient to large withdrawals or market volatility. Potential for Growth: Higher liquidity can attract more users, both lenders and borrowers, fostering a virtuous cycle of growth for the protocol. While the exact impact on interest rates can be complex and depend on borrowing demand, a large deposit like this typically increases the supply of assets available for lending, which could potentially lead to adjustments in variable borrowing rates for certain assets within Aave . What Does the Plasma Deposit Mean for the Future of DeFi? The Plasma crypto deposit into Aave is more than just a transaction; it’s a noteworthy event for the entire decentralized finance landscape. It serves as a powerful example of large-scale capital infusion entering DeFi protocols from entities that have successfully raised significant funds in the traditional or crypto markets. This trend suggests: Growing Institutional/Large Player Confidence: It indicates that sophisticated players and large capital holders are increasingly comfortable utilizing established DeFi protocols for yield, liquidity, and capital management. Validation of DeFi Lending: The use of a leading protocol like Aave for such a large sum validates the operational reliability and potential returns offered by decentralized lending platforms. Potential for Further Integration: As more large projects interact with DeFi protocols, it could pave the way for deeper integrations between different layers of the crypto and traditional financial systems. Events like this reinforce the narrative that DeFi is evolving beyond retail participation and attracting substantial institutional-grade capital, which is crucial for its long-term growth and adoption. Are There Risks Associated with Large Aave Deposits? While the capital infusion from Plasma is largely seen as positive for Aave , it’s important to consider potential risks, as is the case with any significant movement of funds in DeFi: Concentration Risk: A single large deposit from one entity could potentially introduce some level of concentration risk, depending on how the deposit is managed and the overall size of the pool relative to the deposit. Smart Contract Risk: As with all DeFi protocols, Aave is built on smart contracts, which are susceptible to bugs or exploits, although Aave has a strong track record and undergoes extensive audits. Governance Considerations: Large depositors or integrated projects might seek to influence protocol governance (via mechanisms like the Aave Chan Initiative), which is a dynamic aspect of decentralized systems. However, the open and transparent nature of DeFi means these movements and potential risks are often visible on-chain, allowing the community and entities like ACI to monitor and discuss them. Actionable Insights: For participants in the Aave ecosystem, this deposit likely means increased liquidity and potentially more stable interest rates. For those observing the market, it’s a signal of significant capital continuing to flow into established DeFi lending protocols, highlighting potential areas for growth and activity. Summary: The deposit of $980 million by Plasma into the Aave protocol marks a significant event in the DeFi lending space. This substantial capital infusion , following Plasma’s successful $1 billion raise, underscores the growing confidence of large entities in decentralized finance platforms like Aave for managing and growing capital. While bringing benefits like increased liquidity and market validation, it also highlights the dynamic nature and inherent considerations of large fund movements in the DeFi ecosystem. It’s a clear indicator that DeFi continues to mature and attract substantial participation.

In a post on X, he shared a chart showing a classic bull flag pattern and declared, “XRP is about to explode. I’m eyeing at least $8, and the market still hasn’t caught up to the fact that the SEC doesn’t consider it a security. XRP holders are about to PRINT.” As of report time, XRP is trading at $2.22 and moving in tandem with rising optimism across the broader cryptocurrency market. Bull Flag Formation Signals Breakout Potential The chart posted by Crypto Beast illustrates a textbook bull flag—a powerful upward movement known as the “flagpole,” followed by a downward-sloping consolidation channel. This structure often indicates a continuation of the prior uptrend once the price breaks through the upper boundary of the flag. XRP is about to explode. I’m eyeing at least $8, and the market still hasn’t caught up to the fact that the SEC doesn’t consider it a security. $XRP holders are about to PRINT. I’ll drop the signal to exit right here when the moment is right. You’ll regret not following. pic.twitter.com/oiE8INoy7F — Crypto Beast (@cryptobeastreal) June 16, 2025 In XRP’s case, the strength of the initial rally, combined with a narrowing consolidation range, suggests a breakout could be imminent. Crypto Beast’s $8 price target aligns with projections derived from the height of the flagpole, especially if momentum builds above key resistance levels around $2.60 to $2.90. Regulatory Clarity Strengthens the Fundamentals Beyond the chart, Crypto Beast’s bullish stance rests heavily on XRP’s improved regulatory outlook. While Ripple and the SEC await Judge Torres’ decision on the revised settlement agreement before the court, legal expert John Deaton has predicted a 70% chance of the court granting the motion. The upcoming settlement is expected to resolve long-standing regulatory uncertainty surrounding XRP, boosting investor confidence and paving the way for broader adoption. According to Crypto Beast, the broader market has yet to fully price in the significance of this legal milestone, an oversight he believes could offer a rare opportunity for early-positioned holders. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 ETF Speculation Adds Fuel to the Fire Adding to the momentum is growing speculation around a spot XRP ETF. Asset manager Franklin Templeton has a proposal currently under review by the SEC, with a decision expected today . The potential approval of an ETF, inspired by the success of Bitcoin ETFs, could be a significant driver of new demand from both institutional and retail investors. XRP’s recent move above $2.30 already reflects some of this anticipation. If an ETF is approved, analysts believe XRP could surge past the $3 mark in short order, with extended targets near $5 and beyond. Watching for the Signal Crypto Beast has promised to share his exit signal when the time is right, suggesting he views this breakout as both explosive and time-sensitive. His message has energized the XRP community, with many seeing this as the moment they’ve been waiting for. At $2.22, XRP sits at a critical juncture. With a compelling technical setup, favorable legal status, and potential ETF tailwinds, the conditions for a powerful move appear to be in place. Whether it reaches Crypto Beast’s ambitious $8 target remains to be seen, but according to his forecast, XRP holders are about to print.

Yet as fast as they rise, most vanish just as quickly. In this chaotic churn, only a handful of projects truly stand out, not because of hype, but because of real architecture, real purpose, and a real path to user-driven wealth. Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is that rare gem. With over 11,500 early adopters already on board, it’s not just another coin; it’s a movement. And for many, it could be the last move they need before retirement. The Future of Wealth Isn’t Just Bitcoin Anymore Bitcoin changed the world. But it was never built to meet the demands of the modern blockchain space. Bitcoin Solaris picks up where Bitcoin left off, combining the core values of decentralization and scarcity with a bold new approach to scale, speed, and participation. BTC-S operates with a dual-consensus mechanism that fuses Proof-of-Work and Delegated Proof-of-Stake. The Base Layer, modeled after Bitcoin’s SHA-256 mining, brings strong security and decentralization. Above it, the Solaris Layer accelerates everything, processing up to 100,000 transactions per second with two-second finality. Validators rotate daily for fairness and efficiency. The result? A blockchain that is lightning-fast, ultra-secure, and built to support everything from DeFi and gaming to enterprise-level smart contracts. But the brilliance of BTC-S isn’t just in its code. It’s in its mission to bring wealth-building tools to everyday users through frictionless mining, accessible apps, and real ownership. Mobile Mining That Works for Everyone With most new projects, mining is either impossible for newcomers or so energy-hungry that it defeats its own purpose. Bitcoin Solaris flips the script with the upcoming Solaris Nova App, allowing users to mine directly from phones, laptops, or light GPUs. One-click setup. Real-time tracking. Smart performance tuning. This isn’t theoretical. Use the calculator and see for yourself how much passive income your device could be generating. And as part of its broader infrastructure push, Bitcoin Solaris consumes 99.95% less energy than traditional mining, making it one of the most sustainable blockchain networks ever designed. Finally, a Crypto You Can Mine from Your Pocket. Welcome to BTC-S A Presale So Fast It’s Making History We’re in phase 8. The current price is $8. In just weeks, that jumps to $9, then $20 at launch. That’s a 150% projected return. But the real number you should care about? 11,500 and rising. That’s how many early investors have already secured their BTC-S holdings. The presale is raising over $4.5M, and with less than 7 weeks left, the clock is ticking. This isn’t just a presale. It’s a phenomenon. A movement driven by real users, not bots or bots-and-influencer games. And speaking of real buzz, 2Bit Crypto recently released a detailed breakdown of Bitcoin Solaris, calling out its unique dual-layer setup and app-powered mining model as serious innovations. Crypto enthusiasts across X and Telegram have echoed similar sentiments, spotlighting BTC-S as a serious contender in a saturated market. Tokenomics That Are Built to Last The value of BTC-S isn’t built on empty speculation. It’s built on a powerful economic design that mirrors Bitcoin’s scarcity while modernizing its usability. Check out the full tokenomics breakdown: 66.66% allocated for mining over 90 years 20% for the presale 5% for liquidity pools 2% for ecosystem development 2% for community rewards 2% for staking rewards 2% for marketing 0.33% for the team and advisors This distribution keeps control in the hands of contributors and miners, not venture capital whales. It’s fair, balanced, and built for long-term decentralization. Referral-Driven Growth Without the Hype Bitcoin Solaris integrates a clean, direct referral system that rewards organic growth. No pyramid schemes. No overload of tiered incentives. Just a simple value for helping expand the network and bring in more real users. It’s part of what has fueled this breakout presale, without relying on empty gimmicks. Accessible. Secure. Verified. With energy-efficient mining, a user-first mobile app, and high-speed smart contract capabilities, BTC-S is tailor-made for both seasoned investors and first-time crypto users. Security? It’s already audited. Both Cyberscope and Freshcoins have verified the system’s safety. You’re not taking a leap of faith. You’re stepping into a verified, scalable platform with real traction. And if you’re looking to catch updates and strategy drops, the official Telegram and X page are buzzing with the latest developments. Final Verdict Most new coins offer hype and dreams. Bitcoin Solaris offers something different. A real foundation. Real apps. Real scalability. And most importantly, a real opportunity. While others chase the next pump-and-dump token, BTC-S is building something sustainable. If you’re looking for one final shot at early retirement, this may be your best one yet. With thousands already in and time running out, the window to become an early investor is closing fast.

The firm calls both countries “key growth markets” in Europe. Per an official announcement , the launch offers deep liquidity, low fees, and trade over 270 cryptocurrencies, including 60 crypto-euro pairs. OKX received a MiFID II license in March to launch derivative products for European institutional clients. Additionally, it became the first virtual financial assets exchange to receive the pre-approval status under the new MiCA framework. From its headquarters in Seychelles, OKX recently relaunched in the US , following the company’s settlement with the Department of Justice. Cryptocurrency exchange OKX is expanding to the United States on the heels of its recent settlement with the DOJ. #OKX #DOJ https://t.co/3cnY22jcJf — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 16, 2025 Here’s What OKX Will Offer in Germany, Poland Erald Ghoos, CEO for OKX Europe, said that the European expansion “represents a major advancement” in the exchange’s strategy. With the launch, OKX users in Germany and Poland can access spot trading, staking, automated trading bots, and a wide range of localized services. Further, OKX supports Euro deposits and withdrawals, making it easier to access crypto markets. Additionally, the regulatory compliance and clear legal framework is expected to boost new institutional partnerships. “That means building regulated, localized platforms that not only meet compliance standards, but actually deliver on what our users care about: performance, simplicity, and trust,” the announcement read. MiCA Offers a ‘Level-Playing Field’ The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, has been one of the major crypto regulatory shifts in Europe.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP’s recent moves have bulls eyeing a 10x rally, but a cheeky new challenger, Angry Pepe Fork, could steal the spotlight with meme-powered momentum and real token utility. Table of Contents XRP court moves opens institutional doors Angry Pepe Fork Conclusion The latest SEC moves, asking for a 2-month delay in the current SEC-XRP case, are a sigh of relief for crypto traders and for XRP. Now, optimistic bulls are even calling for 10-fold gains as banks and big funds scramble to tap speedy, low-cost cross-border payments powered by the XRP network . Yet while that is to materialize, a fresh arrival – Angry Pepe Fork (APORK) is quietly building a story that some holders think could outshine XRP’s resurgence. Let us check out more about this new altcoin. But first, let’s get straight to XRP’s comeback story: XRP court moves opens institutional doors The green light from the US SEC should unleash trapped demand from family offices, hedge funds, and payment outfits already piloting Ripples On-Demand Liquidity corridors. Even if a fraction of the multiple trillion-dollar global remittance pie moves through XRP , a 10-fold jump from today’s price isn’t pure fantasy. Credits: CoinMarketCap With top exchanges drafting relisting schedules, institutional squads are staring at staggering upside. XRP currently sits at $2.32 and has had an exceptional past year. It has broken all records by growing over 370% in the past twelve months. If regulatory clarity comes in, it could expect something similar even in the coming days. Angry Pepe Fork Still, investors hunting for outsized returns shouldn’t overlook the memecoin sector entirely, especially when the entry cost is so low. Angry Pepe Fork is doing just that. Launched via a hot presale at $0.0269 per token, APORK marries Pepe’s viral energy with mechanisms that reward holders and developers alike: Presale details: Start Date: June 9, 2025 Price: $0.0269 per APORK Supply: 1.9 billion total tokens, with 380 million allocated to presale Funding Caps: $4 million soft cap to launch; $10 million hard cap to avoid oversaturation Deflationary mechanics: Every win on the forthcoming GambleFi mini-game burns some APORK, slowly trimming supply and backing long-term value. This makes sure that as the demand for the coin grows organically, investors will make huge profits. CommunityFi rewards: Through the CommunityFi system, active supporters earn bonus tokens for tweeting updates, memeing or referring friends, converting organic hype into real profit. Multi‑chain launch: Once the presale wraps, APORK will debut on Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, and Solana, giving everyone a seat at the table and spreading liquidity so fees stay low. With a hard cap, regular burns, community rewards, cross-chain presence, and eye-popping presale returns, Angry Pepe Fork fuses classic meme fun with real earning power, a fresh alternative to both legacy coins and casual meme tokens. Conclusion Sure, XRP’s new legal breathing room might ignite a ten-fold jump, and its corporate use-cases look bulletproof. Still, wise portfolios will have a mix of both XRP’s reliability and APORK’s ability to generate heavy returns. For traders who can tolerate a little risk in exchange for big, double-digit moves, Angry Pepe Fork’s presale stands out. By eyeing both XRP and APORK, investors can enjoy institutional acceptance in the crypto world while also tapping next-level meme creativity and utility.

Falcon Finance, known for its work on next-generation synthetic dollar protocols, is joining forces with Kaia, an EVM compatible layer-1 blockchain. This partnership aims to introduce innovative stablecoin yield solutions directly to Line users, opening up new avenues for earning potential within the blockchain ecosystem. What is Driving This Key Crypto Integration? The news was shared by Andrei Grachev, a managing partner at Falcon Finance, via a post on X (formerly Twitter). The core of this collaboration is to leverage the strengths of both platforms. Falcon Finance brings its expertise in creating and managing synthetic dollar protocols, which are crucial for generating sustainable and potentially high stablecoin yield . Kaia provides the underlying infrastructure – a robust, EVM compatible layer-1 blockchain that ensures scalability, security, and interoperability with the broader Ethereum ecosystem. This integration is particularly noteworthy because it targets Line users. Line, a popular messaging and services platform, has been increasingly exploring blockchain and web3 technologies. By integrating with Kaia, which is closely associated with Line’s blockchain initiatives, Falcon Finance gains direct access to a large and engaged user base, potentially onboarding many new individuals into the world of DeFi and stablecoin yield farming. How Does Falcon Finance Deliver Stablecoin Yield? Falcon Finance specializes in synthetic dollar protocols. In simple terms, a synthetic dollar is a digital asset designed to maintain a stable value relative to the US dollar, similar to a traditional stablecoin like USDT or USDC. However, synthetic protocols often employ different mechanisms, sometimes involving collateralization or algorithmic strategies, to achieve this stability. The yield generated by such protocols typically comes from various DeFi activities supported by the protocol’s design. This could include: Lending the synthetic dollars on money markets. Providing liquidity in decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Staking the protocol’s native tokens or synthetic assets. Utilizing sophisticated yield-farming strategies across different protocols. By bringing these capabilities to the Kaia blockchain , Falcon Finance is essentially porting its yield-generating engine to a new, potentially high-growth environment. This expands the reach of Falcon Finance’s offerings and provides Kaia users, including those coming from the Line ecosystem, with direct access to structured stablecoin yield opportunities. Why is Kaia Blockchain a Suitable Partner? Kaia’s choice as the integration partner is strategic. As an EVM compatible layer-1 blockchain, it offers several advantages: Interoperability: Being EVM compatible means that smart contracts and tools developed for Ethereum can be easily deployed or adapted on Kaia. This lowers the barrier for protocols like Falcon Finance to integrate. Developer Familiarity: A large pool of blockchain developers are familiar with the EVM and Solidity, making it easier to build and maintain applications on Kaia. Ecosystem Potential: Kaia aims to build a vibrant DeFi and Web3 ecosystem. Integrating a protocol focused on stablecoin yield is a fundamental step in attracting liquidity and users. Line Connection: Kaia’s strong ties to the Line platform provide a direct pipeline to a massive user base eager to explore blockchain applications. This synergy between Falcon Finance’s yield expertise and Kaia’s EVM compatible infrastructure forms the bedrock of this promising crypto integration . What Benefits Can Line Users Expect? For Line users, this integration could be a gateway to previously inaccessible DeFi opportunities. The primary benefit is access to potentially attractive stablecoin yield on assets that are designed to be stable. This contrasts with the high volatility often associated with holding other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Key benefits for Line users facilitated by this crypto integration include: New Earning Opportunities: A simple way to potentially earn returns on stable digital assets within the Kaia ecosystem. Diversification: Adding DeFi yield strategies to their potential crypto portfolio. Accessibility: Accessing these opportunities through platforms or interfaces built on the Kaia blockchain , potentially integrated within the Line ecosystem itself. Reduced Volatility Risk (Relative): Earning yield on stablecoins typically exposes users less to price fluctuations compared to earning yield on volatile assets, although risks inherent to DeFi protocols still exist. The collaboration aims to make participating in DeFi yield generation more straightforward and accessible for a broader audience, leveraging the user-friendly nature often associated with platforms targeting mainstream adoption. Are There Any Challenges or Risks? While the prospect of earning stablecoin yield is attractive, it’s crucial to acknowledge that DeFi and blockchain integrations come with inherent risks. Potential challenges and risks associated with this integration on the Kaia blockchain could include: Risk Category Description Smart Contract Risk Vulnerabilities in the code of Falcon Finance’s protocols or Kaia’s infrastructure could lead to loss of funds. Yield Strategy Risk The specific strategies used by Falcon Finance to generate yield might underperform or fail, resulting in lower-than-expected or zero yield, or even principal loss in extreme cases. Peg Risk While designed to be stable, synthetic dollars or stablecoins can potentially lose their peg to the underlying asset (USD) under certain market conditions or protocol failures. Platform Risk Risks associated with the Kaia blockchain itself, such as network congestion, security breaches, or downtime. Regulatory Risk The evolving regulatory landscape for stablecoins and DeFi could impact the operation or accessibility of these services. Users should always conduct their own research (DYOR) and understand the mechanisms and risks involved before participating in any DeFi yield-generating activity. What’s Next for This Crypto Integration? The announcement marks the beginning of this collaboration. The next steps will likely involve the technical deployment of Falcon Finance’s protocols onto the Kaia blockchain , followed by the rollout of specific stablecoin yield products or services accessible to users. Details regarding the specific yield strategies, the types of synthetic dollars available, and how Line users can access these opportunities are expected to be released as the integration progresses. This partnership represents a tangible step towards bringing sophisticated DeFi tools to a wider audience through established platforms like Line and emerging networks like Kaia. The success of this crypto integration will likely depend on the ease of access for users, the competitiveness and sustainability of the yield offered, and the overall security and reliability of the integrated systems. Summary: Unlocking Potential on the Kaia Blockchain The integration between Falcon Finance and the Kaia blockchain is a significant development poised to deliver innovative stablecoin yield solutions to Line users. By combining Falcon Finance’s expertise in synthetic dollar protocols with Kaia’s robust, EVM compatible layer-1 infrastructure, this crypto integration aims to make DeFi yield generation more accessible and attractive. While potential benefits like new earning opportunities are clear, users should remain aware of the inherent risks in the DeFi space. This collaboration highlights the ongoing trend of bringing advanced crypto functionalities to mainstream platforms, potentially onboarding a new wave of users into the decentralized finance world.

ETF Inflows and Bitcoin Technical Support Catch the Fall Despite the sell-off, Bitcoin found support near $105,000 and bounced to $106,136 by June 17. The bounce was partly driven by institutional inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw over $1.3 billion last week, according to BitMEX. Technical indicators are mixed: BTC failed to hold above $107,790 Price is trapped in a broadening wedge MACD is negative RSI is neutral at 50 The 50-EMA at $106,671 is now acting as resistance, and bears are eyeing a deeper pullback to $104,633 and $102,861 if the price breaks below $105,000 on strong volume. Outlook: Will Bitcoin go to $95K or bounce above $112K? Looking ahead, Bitcoin’s next move depends on how the geopolitical narrative plays out. A sharp escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict could further damage risk sentiment and take BTC below $100K. The next major support is around $95,000, a key psychological and technical level. In response to Israel launching an airstrike against Iran, gold is up another $24 in early Asian trading, back above $3,410. Bitcoin, on the other hand, just tanked below $104.5K. Priced in gold, Bitcoin is now more than 15% below its Nov. 2021 peak. Bitcoin's failure to rise… — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) June 13, 2025 If diplomacy prevails and ETF demand remains strong, Bitcoin could retest the 50-day EMA and aim for $108,993. A close above $112,000 would confirm a bullish trend and potentially open up the $120,000 level.

BTC Bull Token Nears $8.2M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With BTC trading near $105K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,141,005.09 out of its $8,216,177 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00256 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: The token also features a 61% APY staking pool holding over 1.73 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income.

With the ongoing evolution of Ethereum 2.0, Layer-2 scaling solutions, and institutional adoption, many analysts now believe ETH may want to attain $10,000 by 2025. But even with that explosive potential, a new project— Ozak AI —is catching serious attention. Currently in its 4th presale stage and priced at just $0.005, Ozak AI is drawing in speculative capital with a bold target of $1, representing a staggering 200x upside. Ethereum to $10K Ethereum’s fundamentals are stronger than ever. The successful migration to proof-of-stake drastically reduced its energy consumption and improved scalability. In 2025, the Ethereum ecosystem is expected to see massive growth in DeFi TVL (Total Value Locked), NFT platforms, and real-world asset tokenization. Additionally, large institutions are looking to Ethereum for decentralized infrastructure. Key support levels for Ethereum lie at $2,500, $2,400, and $2,000, while its primary resistance levels to look at are $4,500, $6,800, and $9,500. Once ETH decisively breaks these barriers, especially publish-Bitcoin halving cycles, a 5-figure price is not out of the question. Yet, from ETH’s current range around $3,000–$3,500, a move to $10K would yield about a 3x return—attractive, but modest when compared to early-stage opportunities like Ozak AI. Youtube embed: Next 500X AI Altcoin Ozak AI (OZ): The 200x Crypto Project Ozak AI isn’t just a meme coin or speculative alt—it’s positioning itself at the intersection of two major trends: AI and blockchain. Designed to offer AI-powered analytics, automation tools, and decentralized machine learning support, Ozak AI is more than just a hype play. At $0.005, and with the project already listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko , Ozak AI has captured the interest of early investors hunting for the next big altcoin. If it hits its projected $1 valuation, investors at the current stage could see 200x gains, turning a $1,000 investment into $200,000. Furthermore, as Ozak AI builds out its space and expands partnerships inside the AI and DeFi sectors, its real-world use case capacity grows, giving it a sustainable cost proposition beyond speculation. Ethereum remains the safer, long-term investment for those seeking lower volatility and dependable growth. It’s the foundation upon which most decentralized applications are built. But its massive market cap also limits its upside. Ozak AI, with its low market cap and presale status, carries more risk—but also the kind of reward potential that could change portfolios. In 2025, both coins could win. Ethereum may secure its $10K milestone, rewarding long-term believers. But those who caught the Ozak AI wave early could see life-changing returns if it reaches even a fraction of its $1 goal. Ultimately, the choice depends on the user’s investment strategy—stability with ETH or high-stakes upside with Ozak AI. For many in the crypto space, holding both might just be the smartest move. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that provides a technology platform that specializes in predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets.

On-chain volume remains suppressed since early June, yet long/short ratios above 2.5 on Binance and OKX suggest traders are positioning for a bullish reversal. A breakout above $0.72 is needed to confirm a trend shift, while failure to hold $0.60 could expose ADA to a retest of the $0.48–$0.50 support range. Cardano On-Chain and Governance Update Cardano surpassed 1.3 million staking addresses this week, confirming its position as one of the most actively staked blockchains. Staking activity is expected to increase further with the upcoming launch of $NIGHT token rewards, which will be issued alongside regular ADA staking returns. Meanwhile, Charles Hoskinson’s $100M ADA treasury reallocation proposal continues to draw debate. The proposal aims to mint native stablecoins (USDM, USDA, iUSD), generate treasury yield, and bolster DeFi liquidity. This potentially transforming Cardano’s treasury into a decentralized sovereign wealth fund. Though ambitious, the plan has sparked division within the community. ADA/USD Technical View: Price Compression Beneath Resistance As of June 17, ADA is trading at $0.634 after rebounding from a local low of $0.62. Price action remains confined within a range, with key support found at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level ($0.60–$0.63), which has repeatedly acted as a defensive zone during previous corrections. Despite holding this support, ADA trades below a tightly stacked EMA cluster, including the 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day moving averages, currently between $0.68 and $0.72. This multi-timeframe confluence forms a strong resistance ceiling that bulls must clear to validate a breakout structure. The RSI (14) stands near 39.5, indicating mildly oversold conditions. MACD remains below the signal line, with a flattening histogram showing reduced downside pressure—but no bullish crossover yet. The Balance of Power indicator measures the strength of buyers versus sellers in the market, helping to identify momentum shifts. It is neutral-to-positive, reflecting accumulation attempts but subdued momentum. On-Chain Activity and Derivatives Sentiment On-chain volume has dropped over 45% since June 1, with ADA slipping from $0.69 to $0.63. This contraction reflects a possible consolidation phase, especially as traders wait for a macro or governance catalyst. Derivatives data shows ADA futures open interest holding around $752M, while the long/short ratio remains elevated at 2.65 on Binance and 2.43 on OKX. This suggests that speculative traders expect a bullish outcome. However, shrinking futures volume and stagnant spot flows signal that conviction remains weak. Coinbase saw minor inflows (~$367K), while OKX and Kraken registered outflows exceeding $700K each. Conclusion: Accumulation or Breakdown Ahead? Cardano’s fundamentals—staked address growth, treasury innovation, and DeFi integrations—continue to strengthen. But technicals remain pressured. A sustained breakout above the $0.68–$0.72 EMA cluster is needed to confirm trend reversal and attract fresh liquidity. Until then, ADA remains trapped between speculative long bias and structural fragility. Traders are watching $0.60 closely. If it holds, accumulation continues. If it breaks, downside targets shift to $0.50 and lower.",Price Analysis|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-17 12:17:01

The recent movements in the US Dollar offer a prime example of how macroeconomic factors, particularly central bank actions, can influence asset prices globally. As investors anticipate key decisions, the dollar is showing strength, a trend worth watching closely. Why is the US Dollar Gaining Traction? The US Dollar ‘s performance is often a barometer for global risk sentiment and expectations around US economic policy. Its recent uptick can be attributed primarily to anticipation surrounding the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting. Here’s a breakdown: Fed Meeting Anticipation: The market is keenly focused on signals from the Federal Reserve regarding future monetary policy. While a rate hike is not expected at this specific meeting, investors are looking for clues about the timing and pace of potential rate cuts later in the year, or conversely, any hints that rates might stay higher for longer. Stronger-than-expected US economic data released recently has led some market participants to push back their expectations for rate cuts, which provides support for the dollar. Safe-Haven Appeal: In times of global uncertainty or market volatility, the US Dollar often benefits from its status as a premier safe-haven currency. While current conditions aren’t necessarily crisis-driven, underlying geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties in other regions can subtly bolster demand for dollar-denominated assets. Yield Differentials: Compared to many other major economies, interest rates in the US remain relatively attractive. This difference in interest rates makes dollar-denominated investments, like US Treasury bonds, more appealing to international investors seeking higher yields, thereby increasing demand for the dollar. What Does the Upcoming Fed Meeting Signify? The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is a pivotal event on the global economic calendar. Their statements and projections have far-reaching implications. Here’s what market participants are watching for: Interest Rate Decision: While no change is expected now, the language around future policy is critical. Will the Fed maintain a cautious stance, emphasizing data dependence? Or will they signal a clearer path towards easing? Economic Projections (Summary of Economic Projections – SEP): The ‘dot plot,’ which shows individual FOMC members’ expectations for future interest rates, is heavily scrutinized. Any shift in the median expectation for rates in 2024, 2025, and beyond can significantly impact market sentiment and the dollar’s trajectory. Chair’s Press Conference: Jerome Powell’s post-meeting press conference provides further context and clarity on the committee’s thinking. His remarks on inflation, employment, and economic growth forecasts are vital for understanding the Fed’s policy outlook. The outcome of the Fed meeting will likely set the tone for the Forex market and broader financial markets for the coming weeks. Meanwhile, the BOJ Policy Stands Pat In contrast to the anticipation surrounding the Fed, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) recently concluded its monetary policy meeting, deciding to keep its ultra-loose policy settings unchanged. This decision, while largely expected, highlights the divergence in monetary policy paths between the US and Japan. Negative Interest Rates Maintained: The BOJ kept its short-term interest rates target at -0.1%. Yield Curve Control (YCC) Unchanged: The target for the 10-year Japanese government bond yield remains around 0%, with a reference range of +/- 1%. Assessment of Economy: The BOJ’s assessment of the Japanese economy and inflation outlook provides context for their decision, suggesting they believe conditions are not yet ripe for a significant shift towards tightening. The continuation of the BOJ’s accommodative stance maintains a significant interest rate differential between Japan and the US, which typically weighs on the Japanese Yen (JPY) relative to the US Dollar (USD). This divergence in BOJ policy versus the expected path of the Fed is a major driver in the USD/JPY currency pair. Impact on the Forex Market The differing stances and expectations for the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan are primary catalysts in the global Forex market . The USD/JPY pair is a direct beneficiary of this divergence, with the dollar strengthening against the yen as US yields remain higher than Japanese yields. Other currency pairs involving the dollar, such as EUR/USD and GBP/USD, are also influenced by the dollar’s overall strength, though local economic conditions and central bank expectations in the Eurozone and UK also play significant roles. Here’s a simplified view of the dynamics: Stronger USD: Often leads to weaker performance in other currencies against the dollar (e.g., EUR/USD falls, GBP/USD falls). Weak JPY: A consequence of the BOJ’s low-rate policy and the yield differential with other major economies. Increased Volatility: Major central bank meetings like the Fed meeting often increase volatility across the Forex market as traders react to policy statements and forecasts. Understanding Interest Rates and Their Broader Effects Interest rates set by central banks are powerful tools used to manage inflation and stimulate or cool down economic activity. Changes, or expected changes, in these rates have ripple effects: Borrowing Costs: Higher rates make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers, potentially slowing economic growth. Lower rates encourage spending and investment. Investment Flows: Money tends to flow towards regions offering higher interest rates, impacting currency values. Asset Valuation: Interest rates influence the valuation of various assets, including stocks, bonds, real estate, and even indirectly, cryptocurrencies. A higher interest rate environment can sometimes make riskier assets like tech stocks or cryptocurrencies less attractive compared to safer, yield-bearing investments. The current focus on potential shifts in interest rates by major central banks, particularly the Fed, is therefore crucial for understanding broader market sentiment and capital flows. Challenges and Opportunities in the Current Environment The current market environment presents both challenges and potential opportunities: Challenges: Uncertainty surrounding the exact timing and pace of future rate changes by the Fed creates volatility. The divergence in BOJ policy versus others also adds complexity. Predicting market reactions to central bank communication is always difficult. Opportunities: For traders, volatility can mean increased trading opportunities in the Forex market . For investors, understanding these macroeconomic drivers can help in making informed decisions about asset allocation, considering how different sectors or asset classes might perform in varying interest rate environments. Actionable Insights for Staying Informed Navigating markets influenced by central bank policy requires staying informed. Here are some actionable steps: Monitor Central Bank Announcements: Pay close attention to official statements, meeting minutes, and press conferences from the Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan, and other major central banks. Follow Economic Data: Key economic indicators (inflation, employment, GDP) influence central bank decisions. Understanding these reports is vital. Observe Currency Pair Movements: Watch how major currency pairs, especially those involving the USD and JPY, react to news and expectations. Consider the Broader Impact: Think about how changes in interest rates and currency values might indirectly affect other markets you are interested in, including the crypto space. Conclusion: A Market Focused on Policy The financial world is currently highly attuned to the actions and words of central bankers. The US Dollar ‘s upward movement ahead of the critical Fed meeting , set against the backdrop of an unchanged BOJ policy , underscores the significant influence of monetary policy divergence on the Forex market . Understanding the drivers behind interest rates and central bank decisions is not just for currency traders; it’s essential for anyone seeking to comprehend the broader macroeconomic forces shaping global liquidity and asset markets. As the Fed meeting approaches, market participants will be looking for clarity, hoping to gain a clearer picture of the path forward for the world’s most influential interest rates.

Ubyx Inc., a stablecoin infrastructure startup founded by Citigroup executive Tony McLaughlin, has raised $10 million in seed funding to build a global clearing system for digital money, Bloomberg reported . The round was led by Galaxy Ventures and included participation from Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, Coinbase Ventures, Paxos, VanEck, and others. Following the funding, the company plans to expand its partnerships and prepare for a full network launch by the end of the year. Ubyx’s mission is to solve the growing fragmentation of the stablecoin market, where multiple issuers and incompatible blockchains have created barriers to adoption. To this end, Ubyx aims to establish a unified acceptance network, similar to how Visa or Mastercard operate for card payments, allowing even small banks to issue and accept stablecoins without needing to build infrastructure. “This would enable people to take stablecoins to a bank and for the bank to give them credit for the equivalent in their account,” explained McLaughlin. Ubyx will support several blockchains including Solana, Base, Canton, and the XRP Ledger, and will also allow other digital money formats such as tokenized deposits and central bank digital currencies.

Accordingly, this legislation lays the groundwork for the first major federal regulation of stablecoins, with the U.S. Senate set to hold its final vote today. While the law is expected to pass the US Senate, Chainlink (LINK) CEO Sergey Nazarov made important statements regarding the GENIUS law. Accordingly, Sergey Nazarov argued that stablecoin regulation in the US will stimulate global growth and raise the bar in terms of transparency and cross-chain functionality. Stating that the impact of the stablecoin law in the US will be seen worldwide, the famous CEO said that stablecoins will need proof of reserves and interchain connectivity in order to be used as a payment source. Stating that Chianlink comes into play at this point, Nazarov explained that Chainlink is currently the only platform that offers both proof of reserve and inter-chain connectivity in a single system. The famous CEO says that at a time when stablecoins are preparing to play a central role in the future of finance, Chainlink is preparing to become the only platform that keeps stablecoins secure, connected and compatible from the early stages. Stablecoin regulation in the US will kick off a wave of new stablecoins in the US and all over the world.

The consolidation of prices in the $2,300 to $2,500 range has opened the door for significant upward movement as informed by key liquidity data. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently pointed out the accumulation of over 65 million Ethereum within a support zone priced between $2,368 and $2,445. This substantial holding indicates a strong foundation for upward price action. Further backing this sentiment, another market expert emphasized the appearance of multiple liquidity breakout signals, suggesting an imminent rally towards $3,000. The interplay of increased market liquidity and investor confidence might just be the catalyst Ethereum needs to surpass this new milestone.

According to the latest on-chain data , U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs now hold a combined 3.91 million ETH ( ETH ) in assets under management (AUM), valued at approximately $10.56 billion. The rise in AUM follows a steady streak of net inflows in recent weeks, signaling strong and growing investor interest. Over the past 19 days alone, the funds have pulled in more than $1.37 billion in net inflows, accounting for roughly 35% of their total since inception. Although the streak briefly paused on June 13 with a modest $2.1 million outflow, overall momentum remains strong. You might also like: ETH jumps 8% on staking milestone and ETF Inflow spike, reclaims $2,700 Dominating the total AUM is BlackRock’s ETHA with 41% share of the total AUM, holding around 1.58 million ETH valued at $4.1 billion. Grayscale’s ETHE follows suit with 29.5%, while Grayscale Mini’s ETH and Fidelity’s FETH hold 12.8% and 12% respectively. BlackRock’s position as the largest holder reflects its consistent positive performance, often leading daily net gains across the ETF group. This echoes the similar success of its Bitcoin ETF IBIT, which recently became the fastest exchange-traded fund in history to surpass $70 billion in assets under management. In addition to the inflows, the asset manager has also been actively acquiring ETH in the past weeks, including a recent $50 million ETH purchase highlighted by analytics firm Arkham Intelligence. Meanwhile, Ethereum has been on a downward trend. The token is down approximately 3% over the past 24 hours, trading just above $2,500 at press time. ETH has dropped 11% from its monthly high of $2,869 and is down roughly 8% over the past seven days.

The firm, led by well-known Bitcoin supporter Cathie Wood, sold 342,658 shares of Circle (CRCL) on Monday, according to a trade disclosure. The transaction was valued at roughly $51.7 million. ARK Invest Trims Circle Stake After 387% Post-IPO Rally The move marks ARK’s first reduction in its Circle position since acquiring shares during the June 5 IPO. On that day, ARK snapped up around 4.49 million shares, spending $373.4 million based on the closing price. Despite the recent sale, Circle remains one of the top holdings across ARK’s three major funds: the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), and the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF). Update: Cathie Wood's Ark Invest has sold off $51.7M in Circle shares as the stablecoin company's stock hits a new peak of $151.06. pic.twitter.com/8ZyKeXPAer — Crypto Jessica (@CryptoJessXBT) June 17, 2025 The majority of the trimmed shares came from ARKK, which reduced its holdings by nearly 196,000 shares. ARKW and ARKF followed, selling 92,310 and 53,981 shares, respectively. Combined, the sale accounts for about 7.6% of ARK’s original Circle position. Circle’s stock has surged since going public. It opened at $31 on June 5 and closed at $151.06 on June 16. That represents a 387% gain in less than two weeks. The stock hit an intraday high of $165.60 before easing by the close. At yesterday’s price, ARK’s remaining 4.15 million shares are now worth approximately $628 million, well above its initial investment. The timing of ARK’s partial exit coincides with Circle reaching record highs, suggesting a possible strategy to lock in early profits amid strong market enthusiasm. Still, the asset manager maintains substantial exposure to Circle. ARKK holds the largest slice, valued at $387.7 million and making up 6.6% of its portfolio. ARKW and ARKF follow closely, each holding over 6.7% of their portfolios in CRCL. Neither ARK nor Wood has commented publicly on the sale. However, the rapid rise in Circle’s valuation raises questions about whether ARK is simply securing gains or taking a cautious approach after a steep rally. Circle’s listing and the sharp increase in its stock price have brought renewed attention to tokenization and digital asset firms entering public markets. With this sale, ARK shows it’s willing to move quickly when the numbers align. Circle’s IPO Frenzy Draws Big Players as Shares Soar 160%—But Is the Momentum Sustainable? Circle Internet Financial, the issuer of USDC, made a blockbuster trading debut on the NYSE on June 5 , with shares opening at $69.50, more than doubling its IPO price of $31. The 124% surge marked one of the most dramatic post-IPO rallies of 2025, briefly pushing Circle’s valuation to over $8 billion fully diluted. The offering raised $1.05 billion, with 34 million shares sold , 14.8 million by Circle itself and the remaining 19.2 million from existing shareholders. It followed a last-minute upsizing of the deal from 24 million to 32 million shares, driven by overwhelming demand that saw books close more than 25 times oversubscribed. Major financial institutions were quick to back the listing. BlackRock is reportedly acquiring roughly 10% of the shares , strengthening its existing ties to USDC through its management of the stablecoin’s cash reserves. BlackRock is reportedly planning to purchase around 10% of the shares offered in @Circle upcoming IPO according to a Bloomberg report. #USDC #Circle https://t.co/yabSKAOV47 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 28, 2025 Ark Invest also made headlines by revealing plans to buy up to $150 million worth of shares at IPO . The excitement comes after Circle’s months-long preparation for a traditional listing, following the SEC filing of its Form S-1 earlier this year. Citi and JPMorgan served as lead underwriters for the deal . However, with Ark Invest selling $52 million worth of shares just 11 days post-IPO, questions are already emerging over whether the rally was driven more by hype than fundamentals. Investors are now watching closely to see if Circle can sustain this momentum, or if the sell-off signals early doubts about its long-term growth story.

According to the World Economic Forum, stablecoin usage has surged in recent years, with the average supply increasing by approximately 28% year-over-year. In 2024 alone, total transfer volumes reached $27.6 trillion, surpassing the combined transaction volume of Visa and Mastercard. While US-based issuers Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC) continue to dominate the sector with market capitalizations of over $155 billion and $61 billion respectively, Europe is approaching the stablecoin shift with measured intent. The continent’s push is underpinned by regulatory clarity, infrastructure maturity, and a strategic focus on global competitiveness. “MiCA has made the concept of stablecoins or even crypto no longer a forbidden topic in boardrooms and executive tables in corporates,” says Arnoud Star Busmann, CEO of Netherlands-based Quantoz Payments—the first issuer in the Netherlands and currently the only stablecoin issuer licensed under the EU’s MiCA framework in a AAA-rated country. In an in-depth conversation with Invezz , Busmann discusses the strategic advantages of being a non-US issuer in today’s geopolitical environment, the niche use cases for euro-denominated stablecoins despite their smaller market share, why the future of stablecoins will be shaped by local jurisdictions, and how these digital assets are unlocking real-world asset tokenization by effectively representing cash. Edited excerpts: How the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation is reshaping the stablecoin sector in Europe Invezz: Quantoz was the first EU-regulated issuer of e-money tokens. This regulatory-first approach has helped or hindered adoption, especially when you compare it to global competitors like Circle or Tether? We were the first issuer in the Netherlands- the first issuer in a AAA jurisdiction. There were a couple of parties before us, like Monerium for instance and Membrane, who got to market earlier, but we were the first ones in a AAA jurisdiction. MiCA has been an enabler, allowing us to expand our business models. So, originally the token that we issued was, we needed to figure out how to do it in a regulatory compliant way and we used the concept of e-money to issue that token, which is a closed loop. MiCA opened up the opportunity also to create tokens that trade in secondary markets, which is our EURQ and USDQ. What MiCA has done for anybody in this market, is it has made the concept of stablecoins or even crypto no longer a forbidden topic in boardrooms and executive tables in corporates. And in fact, it enables people in finance to actually take a serious look at this technology rather than the compliance concerns surrounding it. Being regulated by a central bank like the Netherlands gives that status of acceptability and credibility, certainty, that also helped us secure banks like ABN AMRO to work with us as our reserve banking partner. On Quantoz differentiating itself as a non-US issuer in the current geopolitical setting In terms of competing with global issuers, obviously Tether has taken a view on some of the requirements, and the MiCA did not align with their vision and business models, so it decided not to pursue a license in Europe. It sort of opens the door for Circle. Now, where we believe we can differentiate ourselves is as a, in a way, a non-US issuer in the current geopolitical setting. We find that trust in some of the US institutions, US technology is not where it was. And companies are looking for alternatives- European alternatives, but in the payment space, they’re also looking for ways to find settlements, paths that are an alternative to the standard SWIFT one. In the past, that alternative wasn’t possible really, in a regulated way, but now it is. And that creates the opportunity, and we’re getting a lot of inbound interest for that reason. Source : World Economic Forum On evolution of euro-dominated stablecoins in a market dominated by dollar-based stablecoins Invezz : How do you see the role of euro-dominated stablecoins evolving in a market that’s dominated by dollar-based stabecoins? Even if we look at your own tokens, USDQ, the market cap is higher than that of EURQ. So why does this difference exist, and what’s your take on that? It’s something that I’ve struggled with as well as we’ve built our roadmap. Because if you think about it, if you’re taking a Europe-only approach, a Europe-only view, then payments in Europe are pretty well organized. So why would people start making payments in Europe using stablecoins? You can just use Euros, right? So, there’s no real use case for that. There’s also no real use case for US dollars in Europe other than liquidity across European crypto exchanges just because US dollars is, let’s say, the default currency for that. So, it’s a bit of a weird one. We think US dollars are going to remain the dominant currency for cross-border trade flows, although the euro is picking up. We see more interest. But I’m not going to claim that the euro will take over from the US dollar and cross-border banks because I don’t think that will be the case anytime soon. So the euro will compete in Europe in very specific circumstances. And one of them is in cap pooling, for instance, in corporate use cases, particularly if you want to have protected environments where payments happen in euros, but where the cost of payment is still pretty expensive if you use regular payment technology. If you can bring in stablecoin technology where the cost of settlement is like a thousandth of a cent, that’s disruptive, and that’s an area where we see huge opportunity for euro stablecoins. We also see in the world of agentic commerce that is emerging, and it’s happening fast. We are actually involved in a couple of pilots in that space. Exploring global use cases from Europe to Asia Invezz: What are the milestones that you are eyeing in the next 12-month time frame in terms of business expansion, entering new jurisdictions? Asia and Latin America are seeing a rising stablecoin adoption, so any plans of entering those markets? Absolutely. So we identify a go-to market by the corporates there. We’re still early stages. We still have to learn. And also, exactly how can we place our products? We have a range of suspected use cases where we can differentiate ourselves and go to market. European corporates with a global footprint are one of those areas. We are engaging with a couple to start figuring out how we can play. Similarly with trade flows. So we are engaging with a series of partners, a couple of partners out of Hong Kong and one from Singapore to figure out how we can digitize the payments flow, the payment corridor for those exports to Europe. We’re also doing a project at the moment with a coffee exporter from Europe and figuring out how we can facilitate same day payments from a buyer here in Europe to coffee producers in Colombia and in Brazil. So those are really use cases that we’re working on, and we’re very bullish. Again, we’ve had the feedback from most of those trade corridors that there’s an interest in non-US issuers for these stablecoins. So we don’t have to educate them anymore on stablecoins. They get it. When they ask about the counterpart we risk, we come back to the banks, to the regulator and being a non-issuer? Also, you can imagine in the current trade wars, people might still want to have a US dollar-denominated stablecoin, but maybe not from a US issuer. GENIUS Act is different from MiCA but legitimises stablecoins in a big way Invezz : There are a lot of regulatory discussions happening around stablecoins, like with the Genius Act that’s under consideration in the US. What’s your take on that? The discussions also come with concerns about President Donald Trump’s involvement in the launch of a stablecoin through his family venture, World Liberty Financial. I think it’s a huge opportunity to further legitimize the technology and take it out of the crypto realm. And, I would see the Genius Act separately from President Trump’s personal business. There’s always going to be comments on that, probably rightly so. But I don’t think the two are that tied together. I think what it does is remove the implicit curse or career risk that the US has had for years if you dared to pursue something to do with stablecoins, opening up the opportunity. And the US has always been quite good at promoting innovation and opportunity, and ultimately ending up with regulation that is sufficiently protective of the consumers. So, I think it’s a massive unlock of the biggest economy in the world to use this technology. It’s slightly different structured than in the EU. I think the MiCA is even more focused on protecting consumers, has some other geopolitical agenda items, as well as protects monetary sovereignty in the EU. And the way the reserves are structured is slightly different. But the fact that the US is pursuing this is amazing. Invezz : In the long term, do you foresee yourself being an infrastructure layer, a B2B settlement provider or something else? How do you want to evolve in the coming years? Competition among stablecoin infrastructure providers is very high. Everybody is talking about converting euro or US dollar into Colombian peso. So, I think the real strength ultimately is going to be in becoming, let’s say, a trusted… I wouldn’t say a bank, but it’s more of a bank in the new world, which will bring us very close to the settlement layers when we do that. Providing optionality in settlements, technologies to customers to create ideal mixes of traditional payment rails, closed-loop payment technologies, but also stablecoins that trade in secondary markets. Not every technology is right for every circumstance. So, trying to do everything with a stablecoin doesn’t make sense. But as a company, we’re very focused on creating a capability that is sitting on top of the real-time settlement networks as provides optionality with regards to settling on specific blockchains. Speed and cost, and decentralization are really key aspects there. And then providing to corporates, let’s say, I wouldn’t say a bank, because we won’t be doing credit, but we will be providing an incredibly strong counterparty for corporate use cases and build out from there. No winner-takes-all: local rules will shape stablecoin dominance by sector and region I think that is our niche. I also strongly believe that in the future of stablecoins, there will not be a winner-takes-all. So currently we have Tether, the first mover advantage being huge, and they’re focusing really on a more retail proposition now in emerging markets, even though they’re massive, absolutely massive in crypto trading and that side. I think Circle is a strong contender. But as I mentioned earlier, these stablecoins, they’re starting to affect monetary sovereignty in a number of jurisdictions. So if you start realising that the dominant payment method, for instance in Bolivia is USDT and not the local currency, that’s a big risk for governments to have control over their own destiny. Now, as it gets more and more impactful, these stablecoins in these economies, I think there will be a counter-trend, right? That there will be a regulation either permitting it or basically creating certain rules that are more aligned with the monetary policy objectives of the country itself. You’ll also start finding that there will not be regulatory equivalence between jurisdictions, just because the objectives and the impacts are different. Which also means that stablecoins as a financial technology will be determined by local jurisdictions. So what you’ll see is you start swapping. You’ll have a USDQ swapping with a USDC if it goes to America. Or with a Hong Kong dollar if it goes to Hong Kong. And there will be the liquidity provision of swapping is going to be a key part of it. But I think every regulatory jurisdiction will have a couple of leading stablecoins. And they might even be in specific verticals. Either high-risk sector, crypto trading, corporate use cases. And that’s the future as I see it. And that’s what we’re positioning for. We will very much be an issuer. And very much be sitting close to settlement as we can. And offer optionality of superior payment solutions to conflicts. Stablecoins emerging as key unlock for real-world asset tokenization and treasury efficiency Invezz : Is there anything that you’d like to share with us? Something that I haven’t asked, but that’s pertinent to the whole debate? One of the most interesting areas right now is the tokenization of real-world assets — a long-promised concept that was hot two years ago but then fizzled out. In a way, stablecoins are already tokenizing real-world assets by representing cash. I believe stablecoins are the key to unlocking real-world asset adoption. We’re seeing this with partners who have surplus cash they need to keep liquid. They can’t earn interest on idle cash, and moving funds into money market products limits access and yields. Stablecoins solve this by offering intraday liquidity and efficient cash movement, which is a major unlock for funds managing cash drag and optimizing treasury operations. Another area to consider is the distinction between CBDCs and stablecoins. They’re fundamentally different. CBDCs are monetary policy tools that affect M1 and M2 and influence banks’ credit creation. Politically, it’s a nightmare, the way we’re seeing it done, and it doesn’t add anything to the payment mix. I’m curious to see whether CBDCs will be adopted or simply become tomorrow’s legacy systems. The key difference is that stablecoins don’t create new money — they represent existing money, just moving it more efficiently. That distinction is crucial to understand.

Key Takeaways: Barron Trump may have earned up to $40 million from World Liberty Financial. He was named a cofounder and “Web3 ambassador” alongside his brothers in the venture. Trump acknowledged his son’s crypto knowledge, calling him more informed than himself. Nine months after Donald Trump entered the crypto arena with the launch of World Liberty Financial, his 19-year-old son Barron is reportedly sitting on a fortune. According to financial disclosures and estimates by Forbes , Barron may have earned up to $40 million from the venture, placing him well ahead of his older siblings in terms of early wealth accumulation. After taxes, his net gain is believed to hover around $25 million. Trump Admits Barron Knows More About Crypto Than He Does Trump first teased Barron’s crypto curiosity in September 2024, calling him “a young guy, but he knows it” and admitting he himself barely understood the basics of digital wallets. That same month, World Liberty Financial launched with a “gold paper” — a Trump-branded version of a white paper, naming Barron, Don Jr., and Eric Trump as “Web3 ambassadors” and cofounders. Exactly how much the Trump children stood to gain remained unclear until last week, when the former president disclosed his stake: 52.5% personally, with an additional 22.5% split among unnamed family members. If divided equally among the three sons, that would mean a 7.5% share each, the same percentage they reportedly held in the now-defunct Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. World Liberty Financial has sold over $550 million worth of tokens to date, with roughly $520 million distributed to stakeholders. That suggests each Trump son may have received around $39 million, though a partial sale of the venture in early 2025 could have changed those figures. Pres. Trump raked in $57.7M from the crypto scheme he and his sons helped launch. WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF CRONY CAPITALISM. pic.twitter.com/refkdV1Xmw — Steve Hanke (@steve_hanke) June 15, 2025 The sale’s timing fell outside the disclosure window, and neither the Trump Organization nor the crypto venture has responded to requests for clarification. Barron’s rise as a crypto figurehead marks a notable shift from his previously private profile. He was just nine when Trump launched his first presidential campaign. Since then, Barron has remained largely out of the spotlight, attending elite private schools in Washington and Florida before enrolling at NYU’s Stern School of Business in fall 2024. Trump Continues to Capitalize on Crypto Market Momentum Meanwhile, Donald Trump continues to capitalize on crypto market momentum. According to financial disclosures released last Friday, the former president pulled in $58 million from crypto ventures in 2024, primarily through WLFI token sales. That total trailed only his hospitality income and is expected to climb further in 2025 with an anticipated $390 million token sale and gains from his meme coin, launched in January. His involvement in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs is raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Critics have pointed out that some of his businesses have seen tailwinds from favorable policy decisions during his time in office. As reported, the SEC has approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s (TMTG) registration statement tied to a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative.

And here’s a list of the people who think a $SOL ETF could send Solana – and Solaxy, a much-needed Solana Layer 2 – sky-high: also everyone. That’s right, Solana is gaining serious momentum. Cantor Fitzgerald’s analysts report that Solana-focused firms DeFi Development, Upexi, and SOL Strategies will raise each raise $250M this year for various crypto-related efforts, including $SOL treasuries. Both the pending $SOL ETFs and current treasury efforts underscore SOL’s strengths: a unified, low‑cost, and high‑throughput blockchain that enables native staking yields and positions it as an attractive treasury asset. And how does this impact side projects like Solaxy, Solana’s first-ever Layer-2 chain? Let’s discuss below. Solana’s TVL Climbs as ETFs Loom Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) now exceeds $8B, and it maintains a vibrant developer base. Today’s treasury strategies are shifting accordingly, favoring scalable, productive blockchains alongside traditional reserve assets like Bitcoin. Simultaneously, CoinShares joined other financial heavyweights in filing for a spot Solana ETF, featuring staking components and third-party custody via Coinbase and BitGo. The filing aims to address SEC concerns about redemption and staking. While there’s no timeline on the SEC’s response and potential approval, analysts anticipate potential approvals in late summer or early fall 2025. It’s worth noting that CoinShares’s filing was one of 8 on the same day for new $SOL ETFs. Why the rush? In part because Solana is enjoying steadily growing adoption, despite relatively lackluster $SOL price performance. Strategy’s Treasury Strategy Expands to Solana As the drumbeat of Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy goes on, companies beyond (Micro)Strategy are joining the bandwagon. After all, who doesn’t want their very own pile of crypto? And in this case, companies are applying it to $SOL as well. DeFi Development Corp notified the SEC back in April that it intended to sell $1B in securities to purchase $SOL. SOL Strategies, based in Canada, did the same in late May. What does this mean for investors? At least three possibilities: ⬆️ SOL could be moving into the mainstream, attracting attention as a yield-generating asset thanks to its staking model and institutional embrace. ✅ Approval of spot $SOL ETFs would dramatically lower barriers to $SOL exposure through traditional brokerage venues. 📊Continued technological adoption and treasury-level interest could propel SOL further, though regulatory black swans and market volatility remain risks. Solana stands at a pivotal junction, even as $SOL treasuries take off and Solana meme coins continue to get attention. And the core Solana technical advantages – low fees, fast transactions – will get supercharged as Solaxy wraps up a dynamite presale. Solaxy ($SOLX) – $54M Raised as Time Runs Out for Groundbreak Layer-2 Presale $53.9M raised in its official presale – but with interest still sky-high, Solaxy ($SOLX) has opened a six-day window for investors to join the action. Solana loyalists and meme coin enthusiasts, drawn by Solaxy’s potential as the first-ever Solana Layer 2, have added another $2M after the presale ended on Monday. That potential is taking shape with the Testnet Block Explorer and Bridge already live. The full launch schedule kicks in with the Token Claim on June 23, then builds out with a Mainnet Launch and bridge connecting Solana, Ethereum, and Solaxy. Multichain functionality is built into Solaxy from launch, with full Layer 2 deployment as the crowning achievement of a red-hot crypto presale. With Solana interest peaking at just the right time, how far could Solaxy go? Our own price prediction shows the token could reach $0.032, up 1,700% from its current $0.001766. What is Solaxy? It’s the future of an already dynamic blockchain, combining Solana’s speed and low costs with Ethereum’s rock-solid framework and incredible ability to scale. Learn how to buy Solaxy, but don’t delay – this truly is the last chance to buy. Visit the Solaxy Presale Page. Solana Climbs Adoption Ladder – Will Solaxy Price Follow? Curiously, Solana’s price seems to lag its adoption. Even as institutions flock to $SOL treasuries and ETFs, the token price lags far behind $BTC’s impressive performance.

All members backed the call. No changes were made to the ongoing bond taper schedule, which runs until March 2026, but the central bank released a new roadmap for what happens next. Starting April 2026, it’ll slow things down. Monthly bond purchases will be cut by 200 billion yen every quarter, eventually trimming them to 2 trillion yen per month by March 2027. The decision showed that the BOJ still prefers a cautious, drawn-out approach. While other global central banks are slamming brakes or even reversing course, Japan is easing off the gas like it’s driving in thick fog. Ueda’s warning pushes yen slightly higher After the meeting, Kazuo Ueda, the BOJ Governor , gave a press briefing in Tokyo and said there’s still “high uncertainty” in global trade. That line was enough to move the yen. It had been wobbling before Ueda spoke, but edged higher once he pointed out the risks. The dollar, by contrast, was flat. Traders had already priced in the decision, but Ueda’s trade comments added weight. Currency markets barely moved elsewhere. The euro was stuck at $1.1556, with no big reaction. The pound dropped slightly to $1.3562 after President Donald Trump signed a deal on Monday at the White House that cuts some tariffs on UK goods. But not everything got relief—steel imports are still stuck with tariffs. The Australian dollar, often seen as a bet on risk, went up 0.22% against the greenback. The US dollar index hovered at 98.18, barely moved by any of it. Ueda wasn’t signaling any new policy shifts. He was pointing out the same thing traders already knew: with tensions rising across global trade routes, it’s hard to commit to tighter monetary policy. The BOJ wants room to breathe, and Ueda just gave it a reason. Markets drop as Middle East crisis escalates Away from Japan, markets were shaken by new conflict headlines out of the Middle East. Fighting between Iran and Israel intensified this week. On Monday night, Trump used his Truth Social account to post that “Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran.” That post dropped just before he left the G7 summit in Canada early. Trump told reporters his early exit had “nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that.” This came after Emmanuel Macron, the French President, claimed that Trump proposed a truce between Israel and Iran. Trump denied that. The contradiction left diplomats scrambling. No clear outcome emerged from the G7, and analysts weren’t impressed. Jim Reid, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, summed it up in a note: “We’re all in a bit of a limbo in terms of whether anything substantive came out of the summit and whether Trump was alluding to new information with his post and his early G7 meeting departure.” US stock futures didn’t like any of it. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dropped 191 points, or 0.5%. Futures tied to the S&P 500 also fell 0.5%, as did Nasdaq 100 contracts. No one was buying into uncertainty. Energy traders responded even faster. With tensions rising in the Middle East and Trump stirring the pot, oil prices spiked. West Texas Intermediate futures rose 1.5%. Brent crude climbed 1.7%. Risk-off sentiment was all over the place, and safe havens were in demand. Through all of it, the BOJ stayed the course. They’ll keep buying bonds for now, but with smaller steps each quarter after 2026 starts. Until then, it’s status quo. Inflation in Japan hasn’t broken out like it has in the US or Europe. That gives them time. Whether that lasts is a whole different question. But for now, the BOJ is taking its time.

Meanwhile, this sudden rise, with 500,000 ETH staked in just two weeks, points to growing confidence in the network. At the same time, long-term holders are stacking ETH without selling a single coin. But what does this mean for Ethereum’s price? Over 35 Million ETH Now Staked According to the data from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, in the first half of June alone, more than 500,000 ETH were added to Ethereum’s staking contract. This pushed the total staked amount to an all-time high of over 35 million ETH. Ethereum Hits ATH in Staking: Over 35 Million ETH Locked “Alongside this, Accumulation Addresses (holders with no history of selling) have also reached an all-time high, now holding 22.8 million ETH.” – By @onchainschool Read more https://t.co/WYoX9qpODZ pic.twitter.com/6MAlK0sCfJ — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 17, 2025 This is a big deal because staking locks up coins, taking them out of circulation. With fewer ETH available for trading, the liquid supply drops, and that could create upward price pressure, especially if demand increases. Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling Another strong signal comes from accumulation addresses — these are wallets that have never sold any ETH. According to on-chain data , these addresses now hold a record 22.8 million ETH. This suggests that a large group of Ethereum holders are not just bullish — they’re in it for the long run. They’re not taking profits or reacting to short-term market moves. They’re quietly building their stack and waiting. Ethereum Price Holding Steady Ethereum price is holding steady above a rising support line near $2,556, which shows that buyers are still active. If the price manages to break past $2,660, it could quickly climb toward $2,720. A strong push above that level might even take ETH to $2,800 in the short term. But if Ethereum fails to move above $2,500, it might fall again. In that case, ETH support is around $2,460.",News,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-17 13:31:48

NEW YORK , June 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — CoinDesk Indices , a leading provider of digital-asset benchmarks, in collaboration with Sentora , a pioneer in institutional DeFi solutions, today announced the launch of CoinDesk Overnight Rates (CDOR) , the first benchmark interest rates that draw upon Aave’s lending pools to provide standardized overnight rates for major stablecoins. CDOR to Support Industry Growth CDOR rates are designed to support markets for hedging funding costs, securing yields, and developing cross-currency rate strategies. Calculated and published daily, these rates are accessible to exchanges, market makers, protocol treasuries, and structured-product desks. Stani Kulechov, Founder of Aave Labs says, “CDOR is a new benchmark interest rate built on Aave’s deep onchain liquidity. It provides a transparent, risk-free lending rate that unlocks new use cases for stablecoins, such as derivatives and fixed-income products, enabling more efficient, scalable, and automated financial markets.” The first CDOR rates utilize activity on Aave v3’s Core variable borrow pools for USDC and USDT. CoinDesk Indices has released a methodology that converts this on-chain activity into a historical daily (or “overnight”) rate that can be aggregated over longer periods. These pools, whose rates react instantly to changes to supply and demand, are important facilities in decentralized finance that reflect activity of a large population of borrowers and lenders. Andy Baehr , CFA, Head of Product and Research, CoinDesk Indices says “Stablecoins are expected to grow into the trillions, but there is no institutional-grade money market for trading and hedging term rates. CDOR rates provide a cornerstone element for the stablecoin rates markets, using the same conventions as TradFi benchmarks, which support the largest derivatives markets in the world.” Anthony DeMartino , CEO, Sentora says, “Sentora’s mission is to make on-chain finance as efficient as traditional finance. With CDOR rates you can switch from floating to fixed funding, or speculate on the curve, in a single, capital-efficient trade; a crucial building block that’s been missing for years. These rates will enable new DeFi use cases and Sentora is happy to support the evolution of capital markets on-chain.” Liquidity Providers Signal Support for CDOR Exchange-traded futures contracts, currently under development, will settle against CDOR rates and will provide market participants with new and powerful tools for risk management and strategy implementation. Galaxy, FalconX, Flowdesk and Tyr Capital will act as founding market makers. Ed Hindi, CIO, Tyr Capital says, “CDOR rates enable the creation of a broad range of financial derivatives that are currently missing in the crypto financial ecosystem. This addition alongside a clearer regulatory environment should exponentially increase the interaction of institutional players with DeFi. The ability to efficiently manage interest rate risk is a game changer for the CeDeFi markets. Tyr Capital is thrilled to be more widely involved in making the TradFi and crypto relationship more symbiotic.” Jason Urban , Global Head of Trading at Galaxy says, “With CDOR rates, the market gains a powerful rate signal that reflects real-time borrower demand and enables smart, scalable trading strategies. It’s a meaningful step in bridging DeFi and traditional finance, making stablecoin markets more accessible and actionable for sophisticated investors.” Joshua Lim , Global Co-Head of Markets, FalconX says, “We are pleased to partner with CoinDesk Indices and Sentora on their CDOR product suite. The next phase of growth in crypto will be driven by convergence of CeFi and DeFi capital markets.” Reed Werbitt , US CEO, Flowdesk says, “The introduction of CDOR will enable broader institutional adoption and participation in crypto credit markets, enhancing capital efficiency and risk management across our trading strategies. The ability to mitigate interest rate risk is a critical foundation of a functioning capital market, and we’re excited to be working with Sentora to bring this product to fruition.” By turning on-chain market activity into standardized interest rates, CDOR lays the groundwork for exchange-traded money-market futures and other rate-based derivatives.

Legal expert and XRP community figure Bill Morgan weighed in on the significance of the latest filing, clarifying what must happen next for the case to be resolved. Joint Filing Seeks Pause on Appeals In a motion filed jointly by Ripple and the SEC with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, both parties requested that the pending appeal and cross-appeal be held in abeyance until August 15, 2025. This pause would allow sufficient time for Judge Torres to rule on the revised joint settlement motion submitted to her last week.

They’re asking the Second Circuit to keep the appeal on hold until Aug 15th, with the SEC filing a status report! Is this the calm before the MOON?” Parrot wrote. Bill Morgan Debunks the Hype Bill Morgan, however, offered a more grounded perspective. In a post responding to the hype, Morgan stated, “In no way is it a bomb.” According to him, the request to hold the appeal in abeyance was expected and necessary, primarily to give Judge Torres adequate time to rule on the joint resolution and, if approved, allow both parties to carry out the final procedural steps. In no way is it a bomb. The Appeal and Cross-Appeal needed to be held in abeyance for a longer period so that there is time for Judge Torres to rule on the joint motion filed last week, and if she grants the joint motion, for the parties to take the final steps to bring this… https://t.co/sUbfn9oS81 — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 17, 2025 Morgan emphasized that the request is procedural and represents the logical progression of the case. “The Appeal and Cross-Appeal needed to be held in abeyance for a longer period so that there is time for Judge Torres to rule on the joint motion filed last week, and if she grants the joint motion, for the parties to take the final steps to bring this sorry tale to an end,” he explained. The Road to Resolution Judge Torres has played a central role in shaping the legal trajectory of the Ripple case. Her July 2023 summary judgment marked a partial victory for Ripple, ruling that XRP sold via exchanges and algorithms did not constitute securities . However, she found that institutional sales of XRP did violate securities laws. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Following that decision, the SEC filed an interlocutory appeal, while Ripple filed a cross-appeal challenging the parts of the judgment it opposed. Much later, both parties engaged in settlement discussions. A subsequent joint settlement agreement was denied by Judge Torres on procedural grounds, prompting a revised version now pending her decision. Why August 15 Matters If Judge Torres grants the revised joint motion within the 60-day window, the appeal and cross-appeal would become moot, clearing the way for a final resolution. Legal observers believe this timeline provides a real opportunity to conclude one of the most closely watched regulatory cases in crypto history. For Ripple, a final resolution would lift a years-long legal cloud over its business and the status of XRP. For the broader crypto industry, the outcome could influence how digital assets are classified and regulated in the United States going forward. Until then, all attention remains on Judge Torres as the countdown to August 15 begins. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Despite retracing from its peak, some industry participants remain optimistic, predicting that its market capitalization may explode to $1 billion. What a Pump The lesser-known meme coin aura (AURA) defied the negative trend in the sector in the past week, recording a staggering 13,000% increase within that timeframe. Just a few days ago, it reached a new all-time high of almost $0.24, whereas its current valuation stands at around $0.13 (according to CoinGecko’s data). At one point, AURA’s market cap surged past $220 million, but as of this writing, it is roughly $130 million. AURA Price, Source: CoinGecko Some of the factors that may have contributed to the token’s impressive resurgence include community excitement, high-volume social-driven speculation, and listings on popular exchanges. The Singapore-based Bitrue, which claims to have over 10 million users, listed AURA on June 11. On the same day, MEXC Global introduced the AURA/SOL trading pair to its clients. Gate.io followed suit on June 16, with its on-chain trading gateway Gate Alpha listing AURA/SOL. To celebrate the move, the entity unveiled a special promotion that will last until June 19 , during which users who trade the meme coin and whose cumulative trading volume is above 100 USDT can receive 52 AURA. “During the event, Gate Pilot users complete their first trade on Gate Alpha (any token) with a minimum amount of 20 USDT to receive 26 AURA. Only 1000 spots are available – first come, first served,” the promotion reads. AURA is a Solana-based meme coin that saw the light of day in June last year. Despite its latest rally, the token has been the subject of criticism, with some claiming it lacks a use case beyond the social media hype. Having that said, investors should remain vigilant about possible “pump and dump” schemes and sudden price declines. How About Further Gains? Despite the risks involved, some industry participants remain in the bullish corner, envisioning that AURA’s bull run is far from over. The X user Fuel assumed that the asset’s market cap might explode to $1 billion. Currently, there are only seven meme coins whose capitalization exceeds that level.

His comment comes as more people question the role of politics in crypto, especially since t he Trumps have begun dabbling in digital assets. President Donald Trump has reportedly made $57 million from NFTs and the launch of his token referred to as $TRUMP, which reportedly became popular earlier in the year. The family also connects with other blockchain startups through advisory roles and investment stakes. It’s not the first time that their involvement has raised eyebrows. Earlier, World Liberty Financial, a crypto company believed to be affiliated with the Trump camp, made headlines for a lack of transparency. With Tron’s IPO heating up, questions about ethical lines and financial disclosures are intensifying. Trump says he stays out of the deal but supports Tron’s founder Eric Trump posted on X saying he has no “public involvement” in Tron’s reverse merger with SRM Entertainment but still showed strong support for Tron’s founder, Justin Sun, by calling him “a great friend and an icon in the crypto space.” However, many people felt Eric’s message showed a strong personal interest in the project and its key players despite trying to distance himself from official involvement. The news that Tron would go public on the Nasdaq by merging with SRM Entertainment gained quick attention because Eric Trump and his brother, Donald Trump Jr., sit on the advisory board of the boutique investment bank leading the deal, Dominari Securities. This connection linked the Trump family to one of the largest crypto platforms seeking to enter the US stock market. Eric’s post left people wondering whether he could still be involved behind the scenes or indirectly benefit from the deal. SRM Entertainment also publicly announced on the same day that it had received a $100 million equity investment from an unnamed private investor and said it would change its name to “Tron Inc.” to accumulate TRX tokens as part of a new strategy for a cryptocurrency treasury. The new company will actively hold and invest in crypto, following the same model used by Bitcoin-heavy companies like Strategy. Sun works with Trump-linked bank to take Tron public The founder of the Tron blockchain network, Justin Sun, has joined forces with a Trump-affiliated investment bank to push Tron’s public debut on the Nasdaq through a backdoor listing strategy that is now drawing financial and political attention. The reverse merger with SRM Entertainment will allow Tron to bypass the traditional, more complex IPO process and instantly become a publicly traded company in the United States because SRM Entertainment is a Florida-based company already listed on the Nasdaq. SRM will officially change its name to “Tron Inc.” and accumulate large volumes of Tron’s native cryptocurrency, TRX, while Dominari Securities, a subsidiary of Dominari Holdings, handles this entire transaction. It’s difficult to ignore the Trump family’s indirect influence over the transaction and potential financial upside because Dominari is the exclusive placement agent for a $210 million stock offering tied to the merger, and its offices are located in Trump Tower. Many people now view Justin Sun’s relationships with the Trump family as a strategic move to strengthen his footing in US financial and political circles. He even attended a private crypto dinner hosted by Donald Trump and is the largest holder of the $TRUMP token. In addition to these moves, Sun created goodwill with American regulators after purchasing a $75 million stake in World Liberty Financial in 2024, convincing the US Securities and Exchange Commission to quietly pause an ongoing investigation into Sun and the Tron Foundation. Sun has not taken a formal leadership role in the new Tron Inc. but has a direct channel of influence over how the merged company will operate because he’s been named an advisor to SRM as part of the deal.

According to a press release shared with crypto.news on June 17, decentralized cloud provider io.net has partnered with Walrus, a Sui-based storage protocol, to provide a robust infrastructure for AI and machine learning applications. You might also like: OpenAI clashes with Microsoft over AI future, threatens lawsuit The partnership enables developers to securely store proprietary models on Walrus’ tamper-proof decentralized network while leveraging io.net’s globally distributed GPU clusters for training and inference. “Partnering with Walrus unlocks a game-changing opportunity for AI/ML teams. By integrating Walrus’s secure, decentralized storage with io.net’s distributed compute, we’re empowering users to deploy models affordably and privately, paving the way for a new era of decentralized AI innovation,” Tausif Ahmed, Chief Business Development Officer at io.net, stated. At the core of io.net’s integration with Walrus lies a trifecta of innovative features aimed at addressing the shortcomings of conventional, centralized cloud services. The Bring Your Own Model framework breaks the mold of restrictive AI ecosystems, giving developers the freedom to deploy custom models without being limited to pre-approved options. This feature is paired with Private Compute Execution, a function that enables encrypted models stored on Walrus to be seamlessly pulled into io.net’s GPU clusters while remaining cryptographed even during processing. And in perhaps the most practical departure from Big Tech’s playbook, the pay-as-you-go model eliminates the predatory pricing traps that have made AI development prohibitively expensive for all but the best-funded teams. The timing of io.net’s integration with Walrus couldn’t be more relevant. As demand for AI/ML infrastructure continues to grow, the industry’s dependence on centralized providers has become a major choke point — introducing risks not only around cost, but also data ownership and censorship resistance. By decentralizing both storage and compute, io.net’s partnership with Walrus offers a credible alternative that aligns with the ethos of Web3 while delivering practical, developer-first features.

OKX celebrated the launch with opening events held in Berlin and Warsaw, and also premiered the short film “Mild Mild West”, which reinterprets the “wild west” image of the crypto world. OKX describes this step not only as commercial, but also as an indicator of its vision for transparency, regulation and trust in the sector. In addition to being one of the first global crypto exchanges to hold a MiCA license in Europe, OKX continues to lead the industry in transparency with its Proof of Reserves reports published for 31 consecutive months. What's Next?

Alongside the Dow, the S&P 500 opened down 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.5%. These declines came as investors weighed the prospects of a quick truce versus a potential escalation of the Israel-Iran hostilities. U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent remarks and social media posts related to the conflict, as well as his early departure from the G7 summit, stoked fears that a swift ceasefire was unlikely. Trump said in a post on Truth Social : “Publicity seeking President Emmanuel Macron, of France, mistakenly said that I left the G7 Summit, in Canada, to go back to D.C. to work on a “cease fire” between Israel and Iran. Wrong! He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that. Whether purposely or not, Emmanuel always gets it wrong.” Market reactions were swift.

The RSI near 48 hints at the start of recovery but lacks strong momentum. It is worth mentioning that a breakout above $170 could trigger a rally toward the $185 to $190 resistance zone. However, a failure to hold above $150 may floor the price to $140. That being said, Solana crypto is likely to trade sideways with an inclination to the bulls until the next fortnight. Potential High: $190 Average Price Range: $165 Potential Low: $140 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the derivatives market with $6.74B in open interest, far surpassing other altcoins. The heatmap and high trader positioning signal elevated volatility ahead. Any major price move in SOL could trigger significant market reactions, making it a key token to watch in the coming sessions. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

However, the worsening situation in the Middle East prompted a sharp decline as markets turned bearish. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency dropped to $106,806. BTC is down almost 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $105,897. Despite overwhelming selling pressure, the price has stayed above $105,000. Strategy Announces Latest Bitcoin Purchase Michael Saylor’s Strategy has announced that it purchased 10,100 BTC for approximately $1.05 billion at an average acquisition price of around $104,080 per coin. Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor announced the news in a post on X, stating, “Strategy has acquired 10,100 BTC for ~$1.05 billion at ~$104,080 per bitcoin and has achieved a BTC Yield of 19.1% YTD 2025. As of 6/15/2025, we hodl 592,100 acquired for ~$41.84 billion at ~$70,666 per bitcoin.” The latest Bitcoin purchase takes Strategy’s total holdings to a staggering 592,100 BTC , further cementing its place as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Strategy has doubled down on its “buy and hold” strategy, using proceeds from equity and debt financing instead of its at-the-market programs. Notably, it did not sell any stock in the days leading up to its latest acquisition. Strategy’s management is convinced about BTC’s long-term value proposition. However, they acknowledge the risks associated with a highly concentrated treasury allocation. Strategy’s filing warns that the absence of diversification increases the firm’s exposure to BTC’s short-term fluctuations and volatility. “The concentration of our assets in Bitcoin limits our ability to mitigate risk that could otherwise be achieved by holding a more diversified portfolio.” Bank Of America Ranks Bitcoin Among The Most Disruptive Innovations Bank of America has called Bitcoin one of the most disruptive innovations, signaling its potential to shape the global financial ecosystem. The observations were made in a long-term chart outlining 1,000 years of technological and scientific disruptions. The chart highlighted Bitcoin as one of the most consequential innovations in history. The chart highlights key breakthroughs from the invention of the printing press to quantum computing and everything in between. Bank of America Global Research stated that Bitcoin stands out for its challenge to traditional financial systems by introducing a decentralized alternative to traditional fiat currencies. Its inception is also regarded as the catalyst for the rapid growth of the crypto industry. The chart put Bitcoin alongside innovations like the World Wide Web, microprocessors, and electric vehicles. Bitcoin ETFs Continue Inflow Streak US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded inflows of $412 million on Monday, extending their positive streak to six days despite escalating tensions in the Middle East. The latest inflows take the cumulative inflows to $46 billion. The latest streak of inflows began on June 9 and has attracted a total of $1.8 billion, according to data from SoSoValue. Inflows have persisted despite rising geopolitical tensions across the world, including a renewed conflict between Israel and Iran. As expected, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led inflows, recording over $266 million in net inflows on Monday, with its total accumulation crossing $50 billion. This was followed by Fidelity with inflows of $82 million, and Grayscale, which recorded just 12.84 million in inflows. Vincent Liu, Chief Investment Officer of Kronos Research, stated, “Despite rising tensions between Israel and Iran, institutions are looking past short-term volatility and focusing on long-term positioning. Steady Bitcoin ETF inflows reflect growing trust in BTC’s resilience, accessibility, and role as a hedge in a shifting macro environment.” Trump Media To Hold Bitcoin (BTC) And Ethereum (ETH) Trump Media & Technology Group’s ETF will hold BTC and ETH and combine them into a single tradable asset. The company, founded by the Trump family, said it intended to launch the ETF with a quarter of the assets in ETH, with the rest in BTC . It added that the launch is planned for “later this year.” Trump Media & Technology Group initially planned to offer a Bitcoin-only ETF, announcing in May that it was raising funds to acquire Bitcoin. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered a sharp drop on Monday as it fell from an intraday high of $108,944 Monday. However, sentiment soured after it emerged that President Trump requested the National Security Council convene in the White House Situation Room. Trump left the G7 early, posting a chilling warning on his Truth Social handle, urging people to evacuate Tehran. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed President Trump’s early departure from the summit in Canada, stating, “Much was accomplished, but because of what’s going on in the Middle East, President Trump will be leaving tonight after dinner with Heads of State.” However, a Bitfinex Alpha report predicts a quick rebound for BTC and the broader crypto market, provided global tensions don’t escalate further. BTC fell over 7% following the Israel-Iran conflict, with the net taker volume also registering a sharp drop to negative $197 million, suggesting widespread panic. Bitfinex analysts stated that such declines in net taker volumes often indicate capitulation, a pattern seen in previous market bottoms. The crypto fear and greed index also slid into “fear” territory. The Bitfinex Alpha report stated, “This selling, however, combined with a spike in liquidations, resembles past capitulation—style setups that often mark local bottoms. If Bitcoin can hold the $102,000–$103,000 zone, it may suggest that selling pressure is being absorbed and that the market could be primed for recovery—assuming geopolitical risks don’t intensify further.” BTC registered a sharp drop on Thursday (June 5) as bearish sentiment increased after it dipped below $105,000. As a result, it fell 3%, dropping to a low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. The price recovered on Friday, rising nearly 3% and settling at $104,378. Price action remained positive over the weekend as BTC rose 1.15% on Saturday and registered a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. BTC surged on Monday as it started the previous week on a bullish note, rising over 4% to cross $110,000 and settle at $110,251. The price fell to a low of $108,335 on Tuesday. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $110,253. Source: TradingView BTC lost momentum on Wednesday, falling 1.42% to $108,687. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price fell nearly 3% to $105,828. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $102,832 on Friday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $106,106. The price was back in the red on Saturday, dropping 0.59% to $105,482, but registered a marginal rise on Sunday to end the weekend at $105,562. BTC raced to an intraday high of $108,944 on Monday as it started the week on a bullish note. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $106,806, ultimately registering an increase of 1.18%. The current session sees BTC down over 1%, trading around $105,000. Buyers must keep the price above $105,000. A drop below this level could drive BTC toward $100,000. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The ongoing buying shows a clear accumulation trend where institutions are positioning for an ETH rally. The on-chain activity and holdings of Ethereum ETFs suggest the network and the token are nowhere near dead. ETH on-chain holdings for all major ETFs are close to an all-time high, after the last few weeks of accelerated accumulation. BlackRock was the most active buyer, driving the momentum of inflows to Ethereum ETFs. | Source: Dune Analytics Blackrock and Grayscale lead institutional demand for ETH ETF funds have bought over 3.77M ETH, or around 2.97% of the supply, currently above 120M ETH. Alternative data by CryptoQuant points to over 4M ETH acquired by all ETFs, with a market acceleration in June. The funds based on Ethereum have a much lower level of assets under management but stronger accumulation momentum. Inflows have surpassed BTC since the end of May. The ETFs are approaching $1B in accumulation per month. For now, BlackRock and Grayscale remain the biggest holders, with the most rapid new ETH inflows. Grayscale switched to accumulation in the past month, ending the era of divesting its ETH acquired for as low as $90. The accumulation happens at a time when ETH still trades sideways, at around $2,561.97, with a total market dominance of 9.03%. ETH stabilized at around 0.024 BTC, ending its long-term slide. The ETF accumulation is seen as just one of the positive signs for the Ethereum ecosystem, in addition to growing DeFi activity, stablecoin transfers, and general accumulation in both small and whale-sized wallets. ETFs are not the most significant destination for ETH, as many of the tokens are locked in protocols. Currently, Ethereum carries over $63.3B in total value locked, in addition to over 125B in stablecoins. Close to 30% of ETH is staked with validators, while leaving diminishing reserves on exchanges. In total, each week, 16,621 ETH is produced, smaller than one single day of ETF inflows. While Ethereum does not offer the same scarcity as BTC, ETFs still control a significant part of the supply. Ethereum ETFs show growing daily inflows Ethereum ETFs have seen much more lively inflows in the past few days, surpassing the accumulation of BTC. Spot Ethereum ETFs had an almost unbroken period of net daily inflows since the middle of May. This is the longest period of ETF accumulation since the bull rally in March 2024. However, this time, ETH trades at a lower range, after dipping as low as $1,200. Despite this, there is interest in the token, with the potential for a late but outsized rally to a higher price range. One of the possible effects of an ETH rally is the launch of a new altcoin market. Despite expectations for an altcoin rally in Q1, most old tokens failed to break out. ETH is considered the one factor to lift up other tokens and chains. ETF inflows also precede a new period of fund approvals. This time, the most probable new fund will accumulate SOL, as investors seek to tap the growth potential of other crypto platforms. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Shares of Enphase Energy crashed over 17% before the market opened. First Solar dropped 12%. Sunrun tanked by more than 27%, and SolarEdge Technologies fell 22%. The sudden selloff came after investors saw what was buried in the bill — a full phaseout of solar and wind tax credits by 2028. That’s the same support system that’s been keeping solar firms alive post-Inflation Reduction Act. The legislation preserves incentives for nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal energy, but axes the support for solar. These clean energy credits were a central part of Joe Biden’s climate plan. Now they’re on the chopping block. The cuts come straight from the Senate version of Trump’s spending plan, which Republicans want passed before July 4. The market didn’t wait. It dumped every major solar stock the minute this version hit the floor. Republicans rush the bill, Senate clashes with House over SALT Ed Mills, a policy analyst at Raymond James, said in a note that “the Senate proposal still represents a material negative for renewable energy investment,” even though it looks better than the earlier House version. He added, “Wind and solar eligibility continue to see pressure in the Senate-passed version.” The GOP’s plan is to pass this before Independence Day, but Mills flagged that “pending Byrd Rule decisions and potential amendments” could slow them down. If Republicans lose even a few votes out of their 53-47 majority, they’ll be forced to start making concessions. The bill lifts the debt ceiling from $4 trillion to $5 trillion. But buried beneath the fiscal talk are deep cuts to Medicaid. The House’s version already paused taxes on providers helping states fund Medicaid and raised payments for their services. The Senate version goes even harder by limiting provider taxes in any state that expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, said the Senate didn’t ease up on anything. “There were expectations that the Senate might moderate the Medicaid cuts passed by the House,” he said, “but if anything they’re doubling down.” That triggered pushback from inside the party. Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, said it could crush rural hospitals. “That’s not good,” Josh said. “It sounds to me like this needs some work.” On the SALT deduction, the Senate also rejected the House’s compromise. The Senate version keeps the federal cap at $10,000 per filer, which blue-state Republicans hate. The House version had bumped the limit to $40,000 for households making under $500,000. That was the deal they needed to get enough GOP votes. Now the Senate just erased it. Senator Kevin Cramer from North Dakota said the $10,000 cap is “just putting down a marker for negotiation,” and said he hopes for a $20,000 middle ground. But Representative Mike Lawler from New York wasn’t having it. He blasted the $10,000 cap on X, calling it “DEAD ON ARRIVAL.” Medicare changes hit seniors, EV credit gets scrapped More hidden changes in the bill hit Medicare. It now requires seniors to prove citizenship or permanent residency to keep their benefits. That’s on top of another provision also included in the House version. It would change cost-sharing rules for people who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid, known as “dual eligibles.” Kevin called the Medicare changes “low-hanging fruit.” Meanwhile, the clean energy rollback goes even further. The Senate bill removes clean energy funding that Democrats passed in 2022, including the electric vehicle tax credit. It opens the door back up for fossil fuels to dominate energy investments, reversing nearly two years of policy direction. Senator Mike Crapo, chair of the Finance Committee, said in a statement, “I look forward to continued coordination with our colleagues in the House and the Administration to deliver President Trump’s bold economic agenda for the American people as quickly as possible.” The goal is to have the whole package signed by Trump before August. Democrats are preparing to fight the bill on every level. Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon and the ranking member on the Finance Committee, said, “Senate Democrats are going to fight this with everything we’ve got. The House Republican version of this bill was already a class war, but Senate Republicans decided to inflict even more devastation on the lives of working Americans to give even larger handouts to the top.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

With the digital asset trading above $105,500, over $13 billion worth of leveraged short positions across major exchanges like Binance , Bybit, and OKX are hanging by a thread, according to fresh data from Coinglass, retrieved by Finbold on June 17. The liquidation heatmap doesn’t lie, if Bitcoin surges past $118,000, we could witness one of the largest mass short liquidations in crypto history. The chart breaks down where leveraged positions are most concentrated—and, more importantly, where they’re most vulnerable. On the right-hand side, the rising green curve represents short liquidation leverage. What makes this setup especially dangerous for shorts is the way the green line steepens past $110,000. That sharp upward curve means a growing pile of leverage is waiting just above the current market price. The moment BTC starts inching toward those levels, a chain reaction could be triggered, trapping late sellers and slingshotting Bitcoin upward. BTC exchange liquidation map. Source: Coinglass In simple terms, this shows how much money traders have bet against Bitcoin going up. If BTC climbs, these short positions start bleeding. And if it climbs fast? They’re forced to close, automatically, by exchanges. That process is called liquidation. Liquidations don’t happen quietly. When shorts get closed, the traders must buy Bitcoin to settle their losses. That sudden burst of buying adds fuel to the fire, pushing prices even higher and forcing more shorts to close. It’s a vicious cycle for the bears. This cascading effect is known as a short squeeze, and right now, the chart is flashing a textbook setup. It’s not just theoretical. We’ve seen it before in past cycles. The 2020 breakout past $20,000? Similar mechanics. The $30,000 rally in early 2021? Same story. Bitcoin short liquidation leverage summary For beginners, this chart might seem intimidating. But here’s the simple takeaway: it shows where leveraged traders are likely to get wiped out. And right now, those at risk are the ones betting against Bitcoin. The fact that $13 billion in short exposure exists just overhead is a strong bullish signal. Not because that money guarantees upward movement, but because it reveals just how unstable the current positioning is. If a catalyst appears, whether ETF inflows, macro easing, or more institutional headlines such as BlackRock, the move could be explosive, not gradual.

The firm said the launch is a commitment to building the future of crypto security, transparency, and tailoring to local needs. The dual launch in Germany and Poland followed events highlighting OKX’s compliance focus, though the company is entering markets where local regulators have been increasing their scrutiny of digital currency service providers. Berlin has seen regulators tighten licensing requirements, while Poland has been working to align its national standards with broader EU policies ahead of MiCA’s full implementation. MiCA introduces standardized rules for asset issuance, custody, trading, and disclosure requirements across member states, replacing the fragmented national regions that previously governed crypto activities. The license also provides greater legal certainty for firms navigating Europe’s complex financial regulations. OKX advances its crypto activities to European countries MICA ożywia rynek krypto.

Witamy @OKXPolska pic.twitter.com/qcotu7KD6I — Paweł Biedrzycki (@PawelBiedrzycki) June 16, 2025 The exchange said users in Germany and Poland can now access deep liquidity, low fees, and over 270 digital assets, including more than 60 crypto-euro pairs. The firm said customers from both countries can also deposit and withdraw euros for free through SEPA transfers and local bank transfers, and easily purchase digital assets using cards and other local payment methods. The crypto company also localized its platforms to support native languages and regional customer service teams. OKX welcomed Moritz Putzhammer as General Manager for Central Europe and the Nordics and Gabriel Manduca as General Manager for Eastern Europe. According to the firm, both individuals bring deep experience in both CeFi and DeFi, and they’re already building partnerships, engaging with regulators, and making sure their users’ voices are heard. “These two countries are key growth markets in Europe, and we wanted to make sure we got it right. That means building regulated, localized platforms that not only meet compliance standards but actually deliver on what our users care about: performance, simplicity, and trust.” – OKX . The crypto platform unveiled that users from both Germany and Poland can enjoy spot trading, staking, and automated trading bots. They can also access euro deposits and withdrawals with tools like buy/sell options. OKX also offers users from both nations a growing suite of earn products and localized features built for European users. OKX secures licenses to provide its services in Europe OKX said its MiCA license allows it to offer its regulated products and services to over 400 million people across Europe through its European Economic Area (EEA) hub in Malta. In February, the crypto exchange also began passporting its MiCA license from its Malta hub to all 30 EEA member states. According to OKX, the feature of the MiCA law allows businesses registered and licensed in one EU country to offer their services in another EU country under a unified regulatory framework. The company said that its goal isn’t just about Europe but part of a broader mission to bring crypto to the world. The exchange hopes that MiCA passporting can scale even further, ensuring European users can trade confidently on a regulated platform. OKX also announced on March 12 its acquisition of a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) license entity. The firm acknowledged that the entity is expected to become operational later this year, pending approval from the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). OKX Europe CEO Erald Ghoos said the MiFID II authorization strengthens the company’s position in Europe and reflects its commitment to regulatory compliance, security, and innovation. Ghoos argued that the license will help the firm deliver institutional-grade services, partner with tier-1 financial institutions, and offer regulated investment solutions that enhance market access and empower investors across the continent. OKX President Hong Fang acknowledged that the exchange is committed to advancing a sustainable and transparent ecosystem in the crypto space. Fang believes the MiFID II license aligns with OKX’s mission to make regulated crypto products accessible across Europe, reflecting its dedication to responsible expansion with regulatory compliance in mind.

46211552,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=772789,1750168850,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/46211552.jpeg,Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash As War Tensions Mount In Middle East,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-crash-as-war-tensions/,"Bitcoin’s recent price activity has been characterized by sharp swings as global uncertainties persist, particularly following the escalation of tensions between Israel and Iran. After plunging by nearly 5% amid the rising geopolitical strain, Bitcoin managed to recover, bouncing back above $105,000 and currently trading around $106,800. The past 24 hours have been highlighted by Bitcoin recovering toward $108,000 briefly again, but with escalating tensions in the Middle East, there’s a good chance it could crash soon. This aligns with an outlook from a crypto analyst, who noted that Bitcoin might crash toward $100,000. Resistance Band Faces Test For Bitcoin According to crypto analyst Pejman_Zwin on the TradingView platform, Bitcoin is hovering within a confluence of resistance and short liquidation zones, stretching from $105,330 to $107,120. This range, he notes, is not only a structural resistance zone but also corresponds with the cumulative short liquidation leverage area. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forms Descending Triangle Pattern Amid Israel-Iran Tensions Basically, this means there’s a high possibility of an intensified price volatility if this zone is challenged or broken. The charts also reveal the presence of a possible contracting triangle pattern, which is a bearish continuation setup in the context of a larger correction. According to the analyst, if Bitcoin fails to reclaim $106,600 convincingly, the structure could shift from a corrective triangle to a five-wave downward impulse. This would cause a deeper retracement, especially as the price is already forming lower highs within the triangle. As such, the longer Bitcoin lingers in this resistance range without a breakout, the higher the likelihood of a rapid downward move. Bearish And Bull Targets If Bitcoin were to confirm this breakdown, the analyst noted the first major target around the lower boundary of the support zone, which lies between $105,330 and $103,162. This zone is reinforced by the monthly pivot point and also overlaps with the cumulative long liquidation leverage region. The 1-hour candlestick timeframe chart further highlighted a potential short setup from the reversal zone near $107,100 and a projected target close to $104,300. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Back In Control After $110,000 Rejection, What Comes Next? Further downside could pull the price toward the next support band around $102,600 or even down to $101,000, should liquidation pressure persist. Pejman, on the other hand, pointed out that a sustained breakout above the $107,120 resistance line could initiate a bullish reversal and push Bitcoin back towards the heavy resistance cluster above $108,000. A strong daily close above $108,000 could cancel the bearish outlook. However, failure to break above here could lead to a rejection and another downside move. Although Bitcoin is starting to show some signs of bullishness, its price action is still vulnerable to a quick pullback, especially if the tensions in the Middle East continue to unfold. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $106,638, down 0.02% in the past 24 hours. This subdued price action shows its current consolidation nature.

Designed to support long-term engagement, the platform streamlines participation while incorporating embedded security measures and time-based reward models. Streamlined Staking and Liquidity Solutions The R0AR Platform enables users to interact with three primary mechanisms: Token Staking : Users can stake $1R0R tokens for defined durations and earn time-weighted rewards based on lock-up periods. Liquidity Provision : Participants contribute to ETH/$1R0R liquidity pools and receive rewards calculated through a dynamic, time-based APY system. NFT Staking : Executive R0AR Society (ERS) NFTs allow holders to access monthly returns that scale with the duration of the stake. The NFTs also interface with governance and future AI-based personalization tools. All services are accessible via a unified dashboard compatible with MetaMask, Trust Wallet, WalletConnect, and additional login methods. Time-Based APY and Smart Engagement Logic The SmartAPY system employed by R0AR replaces static returns and fixed lock-up models with a time-sensitive structure that increases rewards proportionally with the length of the stake. All liquidity and staking positions are subject to an 11-day minimum engagement window, enforced on-chain, with real-time visibility into countdowns for penalty-free withdrawal. (After 11 days their is no required lock periods letting you unstake at anytime while hitting APY tiers) Security Infrastructure and Direct Token Access The platform operates without reliance on third-party routing or aggregator services, reducing exposure to slippage and MEV-related risks. Smart contracts include embedded protections against unauthorized interactions and manipulation. Additionally, users can purchase $1R0R directly using ETH, Weth, USDC, or USDT via the platform, bypassing the need for centralized exchanges. Practical Applications for NFTs Beyond aesthetic or collectible use, ERS NFTs serve functional roles within the platform. When locked, they deliver increasing monthly payouts and can boost staking rewards when held alongside $1R0R in the same wallet. Bonus incentives are also available for verified users. The NFTs include metadata designed to integrate with R0AR’s upcoming AI tools, allowing the system to adjust experiences based on behavioral patterns without requiring active user input. Ecosystem Integration and Technical Foundation Each of the platform’s core functions—staking, liquidity, and NFT utilities—contributes to a cohesive ecosystem. Built on the Optimism OP Stack, the R0AR Platform benefits from reduced transaction costs and scalability for future integrations, including real-world asset support and AI-enhanced personalization features.

Solana (SOL) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are surging in the DeFi market. Solana’s price hovers near $165, fueled by ETF speculation and bullish chart patterns. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in phase 5 of its presale, raising $10,700,000 with over 550 million tokens sold to 12,100 holders. Priced at $0.03, MUTM offers a guaranteed 100% ROI at its $0.06 launch. Both coins signal massive potential for 2025. As the crypto market heats up, these projects stand out for their innovation and growth prospects. Solana’s Bullish Surge Solana (SOL) is climbing crypto charts with a price near $165. The SEC’s review of ETF filings sparks investor excitement. Fund managers are updating S-1 forms, hinting at potential approvals. This mirrors Ethereum’s 2021 rally, which soared from $300 to $4,000. Solana’s $100 billion market cap and $5.4 billion daily trading volume show strong liquidity. On-chain data reveals a 41.12% spike in derivatives volume to $18.18 billion. Moreover, open interest rose 8.62% to $7.44 billion. These metrics scream bullish momentum. However, Solana’s high price may limit short-term gains compared to newer tokens. Still, its stability attracts long-term investors. Moreover, a cup-and-handle pattern on Solana’s chart signals a breakout. Analyst Ali predicts a rally to $1,000-$2,000 if SOL breaks $200. This could mean 6-12x gains in 2025. Crypto investment in Solana looks promising, but its higher entry point demands careful consideration. For those seeking bigger returns, newer projects offer fresher opportunities. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Power Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing crowds in phase 5 of its presale. The token sells at $0.03, up 200% from its $0.01 starting price. Phase 6 will raise the price 16.7% to $0.035. At launch, MUTM hits $0.06, locking in a 100% ROI for early buyers. The project has raised $10,700,000, with 550 million tokens sold to 12,100 holders. This demand highlights MUTM’s appeal in the crypto market. Its low entry price makes it a top pick for investors eyeing crypto coins with high upside. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has completed a Certik audit, scoring 80.00 for security. No vulnerabilities were found in its smart contracts. The team also introduced a dashboard of the top 50 holders, who receive bonus tokens of keeping their place. This encourages a long term holding, and boosts community trust. For crypto investment, MUTM’s transparency and low price make it a standout. Mutuum’s Game-Changing Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining DeFi lending with a dual-model system. Its Peer-to-Contract model lets users deposit stablecoins into smart contract pools. These pools adjust interest rates automatically, maximizing lender profits while cutting borrower costs. The Peer-to-Peer model allows direct lending without intermediaries. Users negotiate custom loan terms, ensuring flexibility and transparency. Built on Ethereum, MUTM’s stablecoin pegged to the USD ensures secure transactions. Unlike Solana, MUTM’s focus on lending utility positions it for explosive growth in the DeFi sector. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is hosting a $100,000 giveaway . Ten winners will each receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens. To enter, submit a wallet address, complete all quests, and invest at least $50 in the presale. Analysts predict MUTM could hit $2 post-launch, a 6,566% jump from $0.03. This makes it a prime crypto investment for 2025. Bright Horizons for DeFi Gains Solana and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are shaping the DeFi future. Solana’s ETF buzz and technical strength make it a solid bet. Yet, its higher price limits short-term gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), at $0.03, offers a lower entry with a guaranteed 100% ROI at launch. Its lending model and tech promise scalability. The $2 price prediction signals massive potential. As the best crypto to buy now, MUTM blends affordability with innovation. Don’t miss out—join the presale or explore Solana’s growth. Act fast to secure your spot in the 2025 DeFi boom.

Open Interest surged to $171M before a sharp 25% decline, suggesting overleveraged longs were flushed. Spot outflows hit $6.4M on June 14, signaling strategic exits SPX6900USD Technical Analysis: A Classic Parabolic Advance The rally was triggered by a golden cross on May 6, when the 50-day EMA crossed above the 200-day EMA—a bullish signal in technical analysis. Following this crossover, SPX coin accelerated through successive resistance zones, kicking off a multi-leg parabolic advance. SPX Price followed a textbook parabolic rally between May 7 and June 11, rallying from $0.50 to almost break its previous all-time high of $1.77 in just over a month. The move unfolded in four accelerating legs, each followed by shallow pullbacks. This structure often signals a blow-off top or exhaustion phase, especially when volume and sentiment spike at the peak. A temporary top formed on June 11 as the SPX price began to fade under $1.70. The correction intensified on June 14, driven by heavy profit-taking, and is now consolidating above key support at $1.30. Indicators Point to Cool-Off, Not Collapse RSI has dropped from 75 to 40.19, cooling from overbought territory. MACD shows a bearish crossover, confirming waning momentum. Balance of Power is soft at 0.12, while BBTrend and BBP show weakening bullish energy. The indicators align with a standard post-rally reset. A base is likely forming between $1.30–$1.35. Derivatives Flash Warning: Open Interest Collapse, Sentiment Flip Open interest reached an ATH of $171.7M on June 13, but rapidly fell by 25% as the price retraced. At the same time, long/short ratios flipped bearish across major exchanges: Binance L/S (accounts): 0.773 24h Global L/S: 0.9604 This shift indicates that traders began aggressively closing long positions or opening shorts as the rally lost momentum. Bybit, which led trading volume with $177M, also saw over $13M in net outflows. Spot Flow Reversal Confirms Profit-Taking On-chain flows show over $6.4M in net outflows on June 14 alone, with additional daily exits continuing through June 17. Coinbase saw light inflows (~$367K), but Kraken and OKX recorded significant net exits, confirming that the move was not retail-driven accumulation but strategic unloading. SPX6900 Price Prediction: Bounce or Breakdown? SPX coin trades at $1.39. Holding $1.30 support could see price test $1.50 and potentially retarget the $1.71 ATH by late June. A breakout may push SPX toward $2.00. If $1.30 fails, downside targets include $1.18 and $1.05 (Fib retracement levels). For now, SPX shows signs of stabilizing. Traders should watch for volume return near $1.50 and RSI flattening to confirm bullish continuation. SPX6900’s rally followed technical structure, and its cooldown reflects healthy market rotation.

Designed to support long-term engagement, the platform streamlines participation while incorporating embedded security measures and time-based reward models. Streamlined Staking and Liquidity Solutions The R0AR Platform enables users to interact with three primary mechanisms: Token Staking : Users can stake $1R0R tokens for defined durations and earn time-weighted rewards based on lock-up periods. Liquidity Provision : Participants contribute to ETH/$1R0R liquidity pools and receive rewards calculated through a dynamic, time-based APY system. NFT Staking : Executive R0AR Society (ERS) NFTs allow holders to access monthly returns that scale with the duration of the stake. The NFTs also interface with governance and future AI-based personalization tools. All services are accessible via a unified dashboard compatible with MetaMask, Trust Wallet, WalletConnect, and additional login methods. Time-Based APY and Smart Engagement Logic The SmartAPY system employed by R0AR replaces static returns and fixed lock-up models with a time-sensitive structure that increases rewards proportionally with the length of the stake. All liquidity and staking positions are subject to an 11-day minimum engagement window, enforced on-chain, with real-time visibility into countdowns for penalty-free withdrawal. (After 11 days their is no required lock periods letting you unstake at anytime while hitting APY tiers) Security Infrastructure and Direct Token Access The platform operates without reliance on third-party routing or aggregator services, reducing exposure to slippage and MEV-related risks. Smart contracts include embedded protections against unauthorized interactions and manipulation. Additionally, users can purchase $1R0R directly using ETH, Weth, USDC, or USDT via the platform, bypassing the need for centralized exchanges. Practical Applications for NFTs Beyond aesthetic or collectible use, ERS NFTs serve functional roles within the platform. When locked, they deliver increasing monthly payouts and can boost staking rewards when held alongside $1R0R in the same wallet. Bonus incentives are also available for verified users. The NFTs include metadata designed to integrate with R0AR’s upcoming AI tools, allowing the system to adjust experiences based on behavioral patterns without requiring active user input. Ecosystem Integration and Technical Foundation Each of the platform’s core functions—staking, liquidity, and NFT utilities—contributes to a cohesive ecosystem. Built on the Optimism OP Stack, the R0AR Platform benefits from reduced transaction costs and scalability for future integrations, including real-world asset support and AI-enhanced personalization features. Public Launch and Availability The R0AR Platform is scheduled for public release on 6-16-2025 . Users will be able to access all staking, liquidity, and NFT functionalities (NFT staking to follow on the r0ar platform in the coming weeks after launch) at https://www.r0ar.io/platform . About R0AR R0AR is a decentralized finance platform offering token staking, liquidity solutions, and NFT-based engagement tools. Operating on the Ethereum Blockchain & R0AR’s custom OP Stack Layer 2 chain, the platform emphasizes time-based rewards, user protection, and simplified participation across DeFi protocols.

Many are curious about what exactly happened that led to such a blast. Then, this article will tell you exactly why this surge occurred and what this event has to do with Tron Crypto, Justin Sun, and Eric Trump. Why The Blast In SRM & Tron Price? Surprisingly, a nearly dead company with negative earnings suddenly made an iconic all-time high of $10.84 alongside a bounce seen in Tron price, hitting $0.29 from $0.27. Both surges are big deals, not just any move that came on a whim. This surge is a well-planned strategy of Justin Sun, as he announced his intention to go public in the US via a unique reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed SRM Entertainment Inc. This news became a catalyst and boosted these assets. This move left people intrigued about the future of Tron and its role in the crypto market. Some sources revealed that Eric Trump, who has ties with Dominari Securities, assisted in the reverse merger deal. For the curious, Dominari Securities facilitated the recent deal. Sources also highlighted that SRM Entertainment will change its name to Tron Inc. and the firm will utilize a $100 million equity investment to initiate a TRON treasury strategy. In this recent merger news, Justin Sun was named an advisor to the company. In comparison, Eric Trump is anticipated to be in the new firm. . @tier10k I’m the biggest fan of Tron and love @justinsuntron – he is a great friend and an icon in the crypto space. That said the below is inaccurate – I don’t have public involvement in this company. https://t.co/CDt0uudY1s — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) June 16, 2025 However, in recent events, Eric Trump shared an X post clearing all IPO doubts by saying that ” he had no involvement in this company.” In the same post, he had said positive things about Justin Sun and remarked on him as a great friend and icon in the crypto space. Why Instead Of Fresh Company, Justin Sun’s Combined With An Old One? First, this reverse merger deal would allow Tron to bypass the traditional IPO by merging with a publicly traded company on the Nasdaq. This move comes right after the SEC paused its investigation, now similar to what MicroStrategy does with Bitcoin, this new corporate structure Tron is planning for TRX is the same. Also, this would bring order to the company structure and build trust among investors. Also, immediate access to capital markets is another excellent advantage it received. Tron – $TRX is making moves: $210M reverse merger to go public on Nasdaq TRX up 10% $55.7M in 30-day revenue $694.5B USDT transfers in May Aligning with Eric Trump & adopting MicroStrategy-style reserves All-time high incoming? $TRX #Tron #TRX #Crypto #IPO #USDT pic.twitter.com/6D7WLRIjNJ — Wise Crypto (@WiseCrypto_) June 17, 2025 This move will go viral in the crypto sector as other companies might follow Tron’s reverse merger idea, as it could give other companies a boost with greater transparency and regulatory clarity. Eric Trump’s Influence In The Deal Is Zero: Now What? The Tron price has reduced to $0.278 while the SRM price has also dipped 15% to trade at $9.19. Indeed, the move was big, and Tron has strong fundamentals. The decline could be a minor sell-off from traders who booked the peak received from the news. Since Justin Sun is already a celebrity, Eric Trump’s involvement was just a rumor. Since the Rumour is cleared, the real momentum could be witnessed in the following days or sessions. While looking at the SRM price, it is at an ATH and in a price discovery mode; it’s unfair to predict where it will land now, as it’s too early. But if we look at Tron’s price, it has some good potential for a breakout now, similar to what was seen in December 2024. Tron Price has built a similar ascending wedge and is inching towards the upper border from the lower border. A break above $0.30 will give higher targets. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

At the time of reporting, PI is trading around $0.60, after briefly stabilizing following a nosedive from its April peak of $1.50. The Pi Network team had hoped to draw more investment numbers with last week’s update on its .pi domains auction. In its Pi Day 2025 announcement with accompanying FAQ documents, the auction was presented as a new feature within the Pi ecosystem. Users, called “Pioneers” in the community, could now acquire custom .pi domains added to a new domain statistics page hosted on the auction app. “ Pioneers can view domains with the most bids, highest price, and recent trending bids alongside other information. This feature gives participants a transparent snapshot of how the Auction is progressing and where the highest activity is happening ,” the announcement read. According to data from Coinmarketcap, the update has seemingly failed to deliver any form of market boost, and PI prices have fallen 12% in the last seven days on the community’s muted reaction. Support levels under pressure, trading volume up 60% In the last day, Pi coin’s trading volumes have shot up 60% over the last 24 hours. At the same time, there has been a rise in centralized exchange (CEX) inflows, both signals of a token dumping market. The coin is consolidating around a support zone between $0.57 and $0.60. This level has become a pivot point for traders after the token plunged from $1.50 to $0.40 in March. “ The holder base of $PI underwent a significant transformation. The project maintains a solid foundation because of its successful government technology contract history. The price could quickly recover if buying activity returns to normal, ” said one analyst on X, supporting Pi coin’s recovery sentiment. Market data shows that 11 million PI tokens are being unlocked daily, which could further strain price action. A rebound to $0.85 in the coming weeks is technically possible, but current conditions, with no catalyst in sight, suggest a continuation of sideways or downward movement. Still, a surprise listing or positive announcement during the upcoming Pi Day 2 event on June 28 could lead to a positive price correction. Centralized exchange activity spells downward price pressures for Pi Network Per data from blockchain explorer PiScan, in the past 24 hours, Gate.io recorded the largest net deposit at 1,336,196 PI. OKX followed with 904,384, while Bitget registered an inflow of 186,316 PI tokens. The total netflow amounted to 2,458,127 PI tokens, numbers that may push the token’s price downwards. Meanwhile, the Pi Foundation’s own wallet (#2) showed a net outflow of 14,820 tokens. Analysts suggest this behavior could be part of planned releases or liquidations, both of which could weaken the PI token’s position. Despite room for recovery, there are few signals suggesting an imminent bounce. The MACD indicator is approaching the neutral zero line from negative territory. A decrease in bullish histogram bars hints at a possible bearish crossover with the signal line, a classic sign of a potential downtrend. Technicals show some potential for a minor recovery toward the 200-period EMA at $0.67, bears have mounted a resistance at $0.66, the June 7 high. Without strong buying pressure or a material catalyst, PI appears trapped in a narrow range with a bearish tilt. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Despite the apparent wind-down of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's long-standing case against Ripple, Australian attorney Bill Morgan believes the matter still holds relevance for XRP investors, especially institutions. Are There Any More Legal Risks Around Trading XRP?His remarks came in response to a growing sentiment in the XRP community that the case is no longer significant. Notably, in the most recent update, Ripple and the SEC jointly asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to pause the appeals process until Aug. 15, 2025. The request is part of efforts to allow U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres time to rule on a motion submitted on June 12, 2025. The motion seeks to amend the final judgment issued in the case, with both parties aiming to bring the years-long legal battle to an official end.Crypto market commentator Dave Weisberger raised an important question. Weisberger asked if any traders still perceive legal risk for XRP in light of the developments. Specifically, he questioned why investors should care about the case if the market has already priced in the assumption that there's no lingering SEC threat.The SEC vs Ripple Case is Still Relevant to Institutional XRP InvestorsBill Morgan clarified that the legal risk has not entirely disappeared. According to him, the current uncertainty surrounding the permanent injunction still matters, particularly for institutional investors in the United States. https://twitter.com/Belisarius2020/status/1934964415725781073Recall that Judge Analisa Torres placed an injunction on Ripple in her final judgment last August regarding its future XRP sales to institutional investors. Notably, these investors may want to purchase XRP directly from Ripple, but they face a potential legal issue. Morgan explained that without the dissolution of the injunction, uncertainty remains. The company could also face the threat of breaching a standing court order. From Ripple's perspective, this legal overhang places it at a disadvantage compared to competitors not facing similar restrictions.Essentially, while individual traders may not perceive immediate legal threats, institutional buyers operate under stricter compliance standards. This legal issue could hinder Ripple's ability to engage in large-scale token sales, despite retail investors trading XRP freely.Ripple and the SEC's Push to Lift the InjunctionAs a result, Ripple and the SEC's move to lift this injunction is particularly important. For context, on June 12, both parties jointly filed a motion under Rule 60, requesting Judge Torres to modify the final judgment. They proposed dissolving the injunction and redistributing the $125 million civil penalty, with $50 million going to the SEC and Ripple recovering $75 million. They cited shifts in regulatory attitudes and a shared interest in avoiding more litigation as grounds for the modification. Judge Torres is expected to issue a ruling on this motion soon. This is not the first time Ripple and the SEC have tried to conclude the case this way. An earlier attempt was dismissed by Judge Torres due to procedural errors. The current motion is a revised version, and if granted, it could close the book on the legal battle that has stretched on for over four years. Until then, the appeals process will remain paused, with another update due by mid-August.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|Ripple v.

After dodging a high-stakes lawsuit under former President Joe Biden’s SEC, Coinbase is now pushing the envelope. In an interview with Reuters , Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal said the crypto exchange is seeking formal regulatory approval to offer tokenized equities. While Grewal stopped short of confirming whether Coinbase has submitted a formal request, he said the initiative is a “huge priority” and contingent on a no-action letter or similar exemptive relief from the SEC. If approved, the move would pit Coinbase directly against entrenched retail brokerages like Robinhood and Charles Schwab, marking its boldest incursion yet into mainstream finance. You might also like: a16z backs EigenLayer with $70m token buy amid EigenCloud launch The promise and pitfall of tokenized stocks At stake is more than just a new product line. Coinbase’s push into tokenized equities would mark the first serious attempt to bring Wall Street onto the blockchain under the Trump-era SEC, which has adopted a noticeably softer stance toward crypto firms. For years, crypto advocates have argued that blockchain could make traditional finance faster, cheaper, and more transparent. Tokenized equities put that theory to the test. Unlike conventional stock trading, where shares take days to settle, brokers take a cut, and markets shut down at 4 PM New York time, blockchain-based equities promise near-instant settlement, lower fees, and 24/7 trading. Coinbase’s pitch to the SEC hinges on that premise: bring the old financial world onto the rails of the new. But doing so requires regulatory blessing in the form of a no-action letter, essentially a hall pass from the SEC, assuring that the agency won’t pursue enforcement, even if existing laws remain murky. That hall pass is everything. Without it, Coinbase risks repeating history. The SEC has spent years treating crypto as a rogue asset class. And even under Trump’s friendlier regime, the agency may hesitate to greenlight a product that blurs the line between stocks and digital assets. Still, the landscape is shifting. The SEC under Trump has scrapped lawsuits against Binance, Kraken, and others, and now appears more open to rewriting the rulebook. That political shift has emboldened firms like Coinbase to revive long-shelved ambitions. And while rivals such as Kraken are already offering tokenized stocks outside U.S. borders, Coinbase wants to do it in America, transparently and above board.

Edgnex Data Centres by Damac announced the multi-billion-dollar investment, which will be the group’s second project of the nature in that region. The data center project is expected to support the region’s booming AI hyperscale market. The facility is expected to have a capacity of 144 megawatts According to the DataCentre Magazine , the new project will feature high-density AI racks, setting new benchmarks for next-generation AI infrastructure in the region. It is also forecasted to have a future capacity of 144 megawatts (MW), with a total investment worth $2.3 billion. The project is expected to be a pivotal asset to Indonesia’s digital journey as the country fast transitions to digitalisation. It will be a critical site in speeding up its transformation from an analogue base to a robust and AI-powered digital economy. “This is our second project in Indonesia, and this development reinforces our commitment to bridging the digital divide in fast-growing markets across Southeast Asia (SEA), such as Indonesia.” Hussain Sajwani, founder of DAMAC Group. “We are proud to build what will become one of Southeast Asia’s most advanced, sustainable data centres to power the next wave of innovation and digital growth,” added Sajwani. Damac first completed land purchase of the site earlier this year in March and has already started early construction phases. The company has targeted the first phase of the data center to be ready for service by December next year. According to Sajwani, this project is part of the group’s $3 billion investment earmarked for the region. “The scale of AI workloads demands a new class of infrastructure… This project is part of our broader push across SEA, where we have committed over US$3bn in digital infrastructure investments to date,” he said. The data center market is projected to reach $30.47 billion by 2030 in the SEA region, a significant jump from the $13.71 billion recorded for 2024. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global data center market was valued at $242.7 billion last year and is projected to grow to $269.7 billion this year and $584.8 billion by 2032. Damac spearheads data center developments in Indonesia and beyond The Jarkata data center project comes as Indonesia is seen as a high-potential market within the SEA region. Yet, it faces a digital infrastructure gap, rising latency challenges, and limited hyperscale readiness. This project is also seen as an answer to Indonesia’s growing demand for scalable and energy-efficient infrastructure. Now, by targeting a Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of 1.32, this project will enhance energy efficiency in line with Edgnex’s global sustainability standards . The Damac Group is making significant investments towards digital infrastructure not only within the SEA region but in some parts of the world. The company pledged $20 billion for data center projects in the US as it makes a strategic entry into the world’s largest economy. As for the Jarkata project, it builds on the firm’s growing presence in Malaysia, Thailand, and other SEA markets. “Leveraging our expertise in real estate and data centres, we aim to deliver best-in-class infrastructure that supports the next wave of cloud and AI growth, helping further to position the US in the technology and global data ecosystem,” Sajwani has previously explained.

The British analyst argues that the token is sculpting an inverse head-and-shoulders formation whose right shoulder “still needs to form around the high-$1.80s” before any sustained rally can commence. How Low Must XRP Go? In the broadcast, he emphasised that “dense liquidity is below us,” pointing to a confluence of resting bids and stop-loss clusters between roughly $1.92 and $1.80. “I still think it comes down to make the right shoulder which is around 1.88,” he said, adding that a swift wash-out into that pocket would “flush the lows, tap in there and send it.” At present, XRP is changing hands near $2.24, up about 3% over the past 24 hours, which implies a prospective drawdown of roughly 20% if the market fulfills his downside scenario. From the analyst’s vantage point, such a retreat is less a cause for alarm than a prerequisite for the next major leg higher: “If we come down first, we’ve done the downside part. Otherwise I’m still going to be worried about going down even if we come up to $2.42 or higher.” Related Reading: What Are The Implications For XRP If Ripple Captures 14% Of SWIFT’s Volume? He linked the bearish short-term bias to structural forces beyond the XRP Ledger’s ecosystem. Bitcoin dominance, he noted, has crept toward a historical inflection zone that previously triggered alt-seasons: “Anywhere in this box could be the start of alt-season… That would probably coincide with Bitcoin dropping to between $100,000 and $93,000.” A dominance spike fed by a late-cycle Bitcoin dip, he argued, would typically inflict outsized percentage losses on major altcoins—including XRP—before liquidity rotates back into them. Within XRP’s own order book, CryptoInsightUK highlighted a “liquidity vacuum” created by May’s capitulation candle. Although the token has since retraced most of that single-session collapse, he described the rebound as “choppy corrective price action,” lacking the conviction and volume that accompanied earlier impulse waves. The right-shoulder flush, in his view, would neutralise residual leverage, particularly among traders who re-loaded longs too aggressively during the $2.15–$2.40 bounce. How High Can XRP Explode? The inverse head-and-shoulders thesis also features prominently on his long-range chart, stretching back to mid-May. The analyst first published the pattern on X, showing a left shoulder near $2.42, a head at $1.47, and a neckline just above $2.50. Completing a symmetrical right shoulder near $1.88 would, by classical pattern-measuring rules, project an upside target above $3.50—a level not visited since late-2021’s cycle top.

Open interest in perpetual swaps for Ether, he observed, remains “as high as it’s ever been,” suggesting that any sudden drop in majors could spark a forced-liquidation cascade across altcoin pairs. “These people will be flushed out,” he warned, calling attention to negative-funding episodes that hint at an overcrowded short base waiting to be squeezed—once the final downside pocket has been filled. Despite the near-term jitters, CryptoInsightUK reiterated a resolutely bullish macro stance. “The next stage I’m most certain about is that we’re going to go significantly higher for crypto,” he told viewers. Drawing parallels with gold’s record weekly close, he argued that an undercurrent of global risk aversion is quietly supporting non-sovereign stores of value, positioning both Bitcoin and XRP for accelerated appreciation once the technical reset concludes. For long-term holders, his advice was unequivocal: avoid wholesale portfolio shifts and instead treat any sub-$2.00 wick as a final accumulation window. “Dollar-cost averaging from here is a good thing to do,” he said, revealing that 97% of his own capital remains in spot positions, with only a single-digit percentage reserved for surgical bids in the $1.80–$1.92 zone. Whether XRP respects that script will become clear in the days ahead. Should the market indeed sweep into the high-$1.80s and rebound with the aggressive thrust the analyst expects, the right shoulder will be complete—and the runway clear—for the long-awaited take-off. At press time, XRP traded at $2.23.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As mainstream platforms tighten control, Promeet gives creators a web3-powered escape, with instant payouts, real ownership, and no censorship. Table of Contents Overview About Promeet Features of Promeet Pros Cons Conclusion It is no secret that a small handful of media moguls have disproportionate control over the internet. From social media to streaming platforms, tech elites seem to decide what we watch, what we consume online, who watches the content we upload, and how we get paid. One noteworthy example of this control is how OnlyFans, the subscriber-based social media platform, banned explicit content in 2021, without any warning to its hundreds of thousands of creators. This is especially interesting since explicit content is what OnlyFans is known and used for. The platform backtracked on this decision within days; however, the dangers of this sort of centralized control persist even today. Another interesting example is how the popular streamer Kai Cenat was suspended during a live campaign on the streaming platform Twitch, reportedly costing him $100k+ in sponsorships. These are not isolated incidents. Most of the leading platforms today are notorious for shadowbanning artists, activists and accounts with controversial content. These platforms often demonetize or suspend accounts and channels for content they deem to violate community guidelines. This has led to significant income loss and raised questions about the’ transparency and fairness of several leading platforms today. As alarmist it may sound, the truth remains that these platforms can make or break a creator overnight. Amid these dire conditions, what we need are platforms that are creator-first, censorship-resistant, and free from centralized control. One such platform is Promeet. Let’s take a closer look at this new content monetization platform and find out how it stands out in this era of content control. Overview Website: go.promeet.live Sector: Web3 content monetization, livestreaming Services: Video streaming, live meetings, monetization tools Fees: 10% platform fee, creators retain 90% KYC-verification: Not required User support: Community and direct support via website Language support: English About Promeet Promeet is a platform that helps creators monetize their videos, images, live streams, and meetings. It combines the capabilities of YouTube, Zoom, and Twitch into a single platform. However, Promeet is different from the numerous other streaming platforms in the market today. Promeet uses web3 so that creators on the platform can get paid immediately for their work via USDC. Promeet aims to reshape live video communication and transform how people monetize and function in the virtual realm. Promeet’s founders have deep roots in blockchain and finance, and this has helped the team build an inventive tool in the live streaming monetization space. Fundamentally, Promeet is a dynamic program that provides a reliable space where content creators can share their content with their audience and receive instant, direct, and cross-border payments. One of Promeet’s goals is to unshackle creators from the limitations of traditional payment gateways. This means that Promeet uses open, decentralized payment rails to remove the red tape of approvals and high transaction fees. What this means for creators is that they get to monetize content instantly and globally. The platform’s commitment to self-custodial wallets means users retain true ownership of their earnings. Promeet’s real-time, peer-to-peer model ensures that payments flow directly to creators without involving middlemen. You might also like: Social media is finally breaking free from the shackles of Big Tech | Opinion Features of Promeet Instant USDC payments: What sets Promeet apart from similar platforms in the market today is that creators get paid immediately. There are no delays and no middlemen in the payment process. When a viewer supports the creator, the funds go straight to the creator’s wallet. Using USDC on Promeet provides several advantages, such as stability, quick payments, and a straightforward way for creators to receive payments without being affected by cryptocurrency price fluctuations or minimums. In addition, creators will never have accounts receivable. Promeet ensures all viewers have enough USDC to cover the cost of the event and deducts money from the viewers on all the content they consume. Private content distribution: Another key aspect worth mentioning is that Promeet allows creator content to stay private. It is never shown in public feeds or search results. Anonymity and independence: Promeet eliminates the need for KYC checks, bank links, and withdrawal limits. Creators can skip the paperwork and get rolling as soon as possible. Promeet lets its users stay anonymous, independent, and in full control. There are no minimum withdrawals, and no platform approval is needed. Earning retention: A standout feature of Promeet is how it lets its creators keep 90% of their earnings. The platform fee is only 10%. Compared with the 30% and 50% fees on other major platforms, this is a solid deal. Pay-as-you-go model: On Promeet, viewers are charged per second of watch time, ensuring a fair and transparent pricing model. User-friendly interface: On top of all of the other features mentioned, Promeet simplifies the process of going live and managing payments. This accessibility makes the platform easy to use even for those new to live streaming or digital content. Blockchain-powered transparency: A defining characteristic of Promeet is its use of blockchain technology. This technological innovation makes the platform more secure. Plus, the transparent transactions create a trustless and reliable experience. Self-custodial wallets: Another aspect users appreciate about Promeet is the self-custodial wallets. Creators’ earnings are stored in self-custodial wallets. This avoids third-party access and ensures true ownership of earnings. No taxes or extra fees: Unlike other major platforms, all the payments on Promeet are private and secure, without hidden deductions. Pros Promeet has a range of benefits for its users. The first and most important of its pros is the immediate revenue generation. Creators can earn from their content instantly, without relying on ad revenue or subscriptions. Another reason creators are opting for Promeet is its global reach and payment accessibility. The platform supports cross-border transactions and helps creators access a worldwide audience. The control and independence Promeet offers are other points in its favor. Creators can retain full control over their earnings and content without platform-imposed restrictions. Additionally, the platform provides stability via USDC payments. Moreover, creators using the platform can enjoy transparent transaction dealings. Lastly, Promeet ensures all viewers prepay for content, eliminating the risk of unpaid views.

Also, since the channels are private and the content is not easily searchable, discoverability can become a problem. Another limitation is that creators need to already have an existing audience elsewhere, since all content on the platform is private, it’s not designed for organic growth or discovery. Conclusion The social media and content creation space is currently monopolized by a few platforms that often treat their content creators unfairly. Creators who have large followings and enjoy massive profits may one day wake up and find their accounts suspended or even deleted if the platforms choose to do so. This puts the creators in a vulnerable position. However, newer platforms are rewriting the rules of the game. Promeet stands out in this space in being a unique platform that boldly rethinks how creators earn, connect, and thrive in a digital world. With no middlemen, no KYC, instant USDC payments, and full ownership of earnings, Promeet empowers content creators to build sustainable, censorship-resistant businesses. By merging the best aspects of YouTube, Zoom, and Twitch into one platform and backing it with the power of web3, Promeet is leading the way in democratizing content monetization.

Though the company has not yet released an official press statement, the move adds to its growing crypto treasury and signals deepening interest in Ripple’s native token from institutional players. At XRP’s current trading price of $2.20, the acquisition represents an investment of approximately $220,000. This latest addition builds on Quantum’s broader crypto strategy, which has already seen it allocate millions to digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) over the past six months. Inside Quantum’s Crypto Playbook Quantum Biopharma entered the crypto space in December 2024 with an initial $1 million investment in BTC and other selected tokens. On May 19, 2025, the company expanded its digital portfolio to $4.5 million, followed by another capital injection on June 10, bringing its total crypto holdings to $5 million. The XRP purchase is believed to be part of this most recent treasury expansion, as per Xaif’s disclosure. Just In: Quantum Biopharma has added 100,000 $XRP to its crypto treasury! Pharma meets crypto — are more institutions eyeing #XRP next? #Ripple #XRPL #CryptoNews pic.twitter.com/MjM8v5Rm9W — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) June 17, 2025 All assets are held in custody by BitGo, a trusted institutional provider offering cold storage, multi-signature wallets, and regulatory-grade compliance. This custodial arrangement ensures the company’s crypto holdings remain secure and auditable. Quantum’s CEO, Zeeshan Saeed, has previously emphasized that crypto is not merely a speculative bet, but a deliberate part of the company’s treasury management strategy. According to Saeed, the goals include protecting shareholder value, hedging against currency depreciation—especially the Canadian dollar—and exploring opportunities for yield generation through staking where applicable. Why XRP? XRP’s inclusion in the portfolio highlights the company’s interest in assets with real-world utility. Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily viewed as a store of value, XRP is designed for fast, low-cost international transactions and is already used by financial institutions and payment providers through Ripple’s growing network. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Quantum’s decision to add XRP comes when the token regains institutional attention, buoyed by ongoing regulatory clarity and Ripple’s expanding partnerships across the financial sector. Though not XRP’s highest historical price, its current valuation of $2.20 reflects the asset’s resilience. A Pioneer in Pharma-Fintech Integration Quantum Biopharma stands out in the pharmaceutical industry for its proactive adoption of blockchain assets. While most biotech and pharma firms have avoided exposure to crypto due to perceived volatility and regulatory uncertainty, Quantum is carving a different path—one that blends traditional healthcare with modern finance. The company’s crypto strategy has also been well-received by investors. Quantum’s stock (QNTM) has attracted increasing attention from both individual and institutional investors since its initial investment in December 2024, thanks to its forward-thinking financial strategy. As the line between traditional finance and digital assets continues to blur, Quantum Biopharma’s latest XRP acquisition sends a clear message: blockchain-based finance is no longer confined to the tech sector. With this move, the company strengthens its position as a leader in integrating decentralized tools into legacy industries.

46216131,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/smart-capital-is-paying-attention-these-web3-projects-deserve-a-closer-look,1750174483,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/46216131.jpeg,Smart Capital Is Paying Attention—These Web3 Projects Deserve a Closer Look,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/smart-capital-is-paying-attention-these-web3-projects-deserve-a-closer-look,"In a digital landscape crowded with fleeting trends and overhyped tokens, a new set of Web3 projects is rising through sustained attention from developers, enterprise partners, and protocol-level thinkers. As the conversation around blockchain technology matures, focus is shifting toward infrastructure that actually enables scale: decentralized data layers, cross-chain interoperability, and AI-aligned compute power. Whether you're building, researching, or tracking where the momentum is truly gathering, these are the four names that keep showing up in all the right conversations. Chainlink Extends Infrastructure Lead as Regulatory Shift Nears Chainlink is consolidating its role as a foundational layer of Web3 infrastructure, just as U.S. lawmakers move closer to formalizing a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The project is positioning its Configuration Runtime Environment (CRE) as a turnkey compliance solution geared toward stablecoin issuers and institutional finance. CEO Sergey Nazarov has repeatedly emphasized the necessity of modular, regulatory-ready infrastructure, and Chainlink’s strategy appears to be resonating beyond the crypto-native space. Notably, its oracle protocol is currently being piloted within Project mBridge, a cross-border central bank digital currency initiative involving Hong Kong and Australia. That participation highlights Chainlink’s expanding relevance to the public-sector financial stack. The company is also scaling horizontally. Recent integrations across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and BNB Chain—along with onboardings from firms like Coinbase and Mux Protocol—have pushed Chainlink’s total value secured above $65 billion , a 50% increase this year. As Chainlink’s oracle network continues to underpin the data logic of decentralized finance, its presence across regulated stablecoin systems signals a broader institutional pivot well underway. Celestia Gains Strategic Ground as the Modular Blockchain Thesis Matures While many Layer 1 blockchains continue to compete on execution throughput, Celestia is redefining the space with its modular architecture—separating consensus from execution and enabling developers to launch application-specific blockchains without building from scratch. At the heart of Celestia’s approach is its role as a dedicated data availability (DA) layer . This model has gained traction as Ethereum and other ecosystems increasingly embrace rollup-centric scalability. Celestia’s infrastructure is already powering dozens of rollups and Layer 2 solutions, offering a lightweight foundation where developers can maintain sovereignty while outsourcing consensus. Partnerships with projects like dYdX, Manta, and Sovereign SDK reinforce Celestia’s status as an essential back-end layer for decentralized applications requiring both flexibility and throughput. Rollkit , an open-source toolkit for launching rollups on top of Celestia, has further lowered the barrier to entry, making it easier for teams to deploy custom execution environments with robust data integrity guarantees. As the industry shifts toward modular design principles, Celestia’s focus on scalability-as-a-service continues to draw developers, tooling integrations, and early-stage applications seeking long-term infrastructure independence. Render Network Rises as GPU Infrastructure Draws AI Capital Render Network is emerging as a crucial player in the decentralized GPU economy, precisely at the moment when AI workloads and digital rendering demand are pushing centralized infrastructure to its limits. With a decentralized model that connects artists and developers to idle GPU power, Render is well-positioned to serve both creative industries and compute-heavy AI projects. Recent technical upgrades, including differential uploads and deep integration with Blender Cycles , have improved network performance while optimizing rendering workflows for power users. These features are not just quality-of-life improvements—they represent a maturation of Render's value proposition for enterprise content pipelines and independent studios alike. The upcoming RenderCon 2025 conference will serve as a critical litmus test for the project’s growing ecosystem. Designed as a convergence point for developers, studios, and AI researchers, the event reflects Render’s ambitions to sit at the intersection of real-time 3D content, AI innovation, and decentralized infrastructure. With GPU availability becoming a strategic asset in AI and creative industries, Render’s early mover advantage and active developer community could soon elevate it from niche protocol to indispensable middleware across multiple verticals. The Attention Is Real—And So Is the Strategy That Sustains It As developer activity, enterprise partnerships, and institutional curiosity converge around these headline-making projects, a broader truth becomes clear: in Web3, visibility alone isn’t enough. Capturing attention is one thing—but sustaining it, shaping it, and converting it into traction requires strategy. That’s where agencies like Outset PR are setting a new bar. Outset PR’s Proprietary Techniques Deliver Tangible Results If PR has ever felt like trying to navigate a foggy road without headlights, Outset PR brings clarity with data. It builds strategies based on both retrospective and real-time metrics which helps to obtain results with a long-lasting effect. Outset PR replaces vague promises with concrete plans tied to perfect timing, narratives that emphasize the product-market fit, and performance-based media selection. Clients gain a forward-looking perspective: how their story will unfold, where it will land, and what impact it may create. While most crypto PR agencies rely on standardized packages and mass-blast outreach, Outset PR takes a tailored approach. Each campaign is calibrated to match the client’s specific goals, budget, and growth stage. This is PR with a personal touch, where strategy feels handcrafted and every client gets a solution that fits. Outset PR’s secret weapon is its exclusive traffic acquisition tech and internal media analytics. Proprietary Tech That Powers Performance One of Outset PR’s most impactful tools is its in-house traffic acquisition system. It fuses organic editorial placements with performance-level traffic acquisition, enabling clients to appear in high-discovery surfaces and drive multiples more traffic than through conventional PR alone. Case in point: Crypto exchange ChangeNOW experienced a sustained 40% boost in reach after engaging Outset PR’s proprietary system paired with a well-polished organic campaign. Outset PR Notices Media Trends Ahead of the Crowd Outset PR obtains unique knowledge through its in-house analytical desk which gives it a competitive edge. The team regularly provides valuable insights into the performance of crypto media outlets based on the criteria like: domain activity month-on-month visibility shifts audience geography source of traffic By consistently publishing analytical reports, identifying performance trends, and raising the standards of media targeting across the industry, Outset PR makes a significant contribution to crypto PR as a whole, which poses it as an influential player in this field. Case in point: The careful selection of media outlets has helped Outset PR increase user engagement for Step App in the US and UK markets. Outset PR Engineers Visibility That Fits the Market One of the biggest pain points in Web3 PR is the disconnect between effort and outcome: generic messaging, no product-market alignment, and media hits that generate visibility but leave business impact undefined. Outset PR addresses this by offering customized solutions. Every campaign begins with a thorough research and follows a clearly mapped path from spend to the result. It's data-backed and insight-driven with just the right level of boutique care. Final Words The momentum around Chainlink, Celestia, and Render Network is no accident. These projects are earning attention because they’re solving real problems, laying real infrastructure, and enabling real applications. But in an increasingly competitive, narrative-driven space, building isn’t enough—how a project is positioned and perceived can be just as critical as the technology itself. That’s why the next phase of Web3 adoption won’t just be powered by modular architectures or GPU distribution networks—it will also be shaped by the clarity of the message, the quality of the media execution, and the strength of the story being told. As the field grows more crowded and more mature, the projects that break through will be those that not only build at the protocol level but communicate with precision at the market level. Agencies like Outset PR, with their data-backed approach and performance-oriented strategy, are helping define what it means to not just launch, but lead. Because in Web3, attention is the spark—but strategy is what keeps the fire going. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Eigen Labs has launched EigenCloud, a new platform built on the Ethereum resttake protocol that aims to offer verifiable trust for Web2 and Web3 applications, Forbes reported. The launch was prompted by a $70 million investment from a16z crypto, the blockchain-focused arm of Andreessen Horowitz. Accordingly, a16z crypto led Eigen Labs’ $100 million Series B round by purchasing $70 million worth of EigenLayer’s EIGEN tokens. The funds raised in the Series B funding round will help accelerate the launch and commercialization of EigenLayer’s new developer platform, EigenCloud. Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joe Lubin said: “We are entering a new era where verifiability is a fundamental building block of the internet, and EigenCloud is a bold step in that direction. “By bringing verifiability to the cloud-based developer experience, Sreeram and Eigen Labs have become best-in-class leaders in expanding what is possible on Ethereum and advancing the infrastructure for more trustworthy digital systems.” EigenLayer allows Ethereum stakers to “re-stake” their ETH to secure third-party services known as autonomous verifiable services.

The token dropped steadily through multiple support levels after a late-session sell-off began around 22:00 UTC on June 16. Despite a brief recovery attempt earlier in the session, the bearish structure remained intact heading into midday Tuesday. The correction mirrors broader risk-off behavior across digital assets as global macroeconomic conditions remain tense. Trade disputes and monetary tightening across major economies have added pressure to risk markets, dragging ADA and other large-cap tokens lower. Still, some technical analysts have pointed to potential signs of a reversal in ADA’s structure. A brief bounce from $0.622 to $0.626 earlier in the session formed a small upward-sloping channel, with price testing the $0.624–$0.625 band multiple times. That area has now emerged as a potential pivot zone, though volume has since tapered and volatility has narrowed. With ADA trading just above its daily low, bulls are watching for stabilization around $0.615–$0.620. A clear directional move from here may depend on whether that support zone holds and if broader market conditions begin to recover. Technical Analysis Highlights A sharp decline began at 22:00 UTC on June 16 as ADA broke below the $0.650 support level on high volume. Multiple failed attempts to reclaim $0.630 created a new resistance band around $0.640. Lower highs formed with each bounce, confirming downward pressure throughout the period. A support zone developed between $0.620 and $0.622 as volume picked up at those levels. Price entered a descending channel with consistent lower highs and lower lows. A brief recovery from $0.622 to $0.626 created an upward-sloping micro channel amid increasing volume. Resistance formed at $0.626, with the $0.624–$0.625 area acting as a pivot range during repeated tests. Recent candles showed decreasing volatility and volume, signaling consolidation near local lows.

46216883,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=748218,1750174836,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46216883.jpeg,The oil market's supply and demand balance is off - IEA report,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-the-oil-market-at-risk-in-2025-iea/,"The International Energy Agency says that in 2025, the world will produce more oil than it needs, even as the Israel-Iran conflict raises the risk of supply disruptions. It forecasts a 1.8 million barrels-per-day rise in output to 104.9 million b/d, against demand of 103.8 million b/d. In its report , the IEA says that unless a major disruption occurs, oil markets in 2025 will be well supplied. The rise in output comes from OPEC+ reversing production cuts and from producers outside the cartel, which will add about 1.4 million b/d. At the same time, weaker consumption in China and the United States will limit global demand growth to 720,000 b/d, down from a prior forecast of 740,000 b/d. With supply outpacing demand, the volume of oil held in storage has risen by an average of 1 million b/d since February. In May alone, stocks jumped by a hefty 93 million barrels. Despite the latest gains, total inventories worldwide are still roughly 90 million barrels lower than they were a year earlier, the IEA added. The report also warned that fighting between Israel and Iran could pose serious risks to oil supply security. So far, the agency said Iran’s oil exports have not been affected. But Iran did cut output at its large South Pars gas field after an Israeli air strike. However, it was not clear whether that hit production levels. A nearby oil depot and refinery at Shahran were also targeted without reported damage. China’s oil demand now expected to peak by 2027 In the second part of its study, the IEA looked ahead to 2030. It said that global oil supply would keep growing faster than demand, boosting production capacity by more than 5 million b/d to 114.7 million b/d by the decade’s end. Demand is seen rising by only 2.5 million b/d between 2024 and 2030, reaching a plateau of about 105.5 million b/d. The IEA now forecasts that China’s oil use will peak in 2027 at a maximum of 16.9 million b/d, roughly two years earlier than previous estimates. It said rising electric vehicle sales, more high-speed rail and trucks running on natural gas will cut into crude consumption. China National Petroleum Corp. warned in December that demand might peak even sooner. “Oil markets look set to be well supplied in the years ahead,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said. The agency, which was set up in the 1970s to advise major oil consumers, noted that recent fighting had triggered price jumps but left actual exports untouched. Oil prices spiked the most in three years after Israel struck Iran, then eased back to around $70 per barrel by Monday. The IEA sees consumption peaking at about 105.5 million b/d in 2029, roughly in line with its previous outlook. After that, it predicts a slight drop in usage in 2030, as emerging markets like India provide most of the modest gains in consumption. With China’s demand peaking, the IEA sees India and other developing countries as the main sources of demand growth to 2030. U.S. oil demand revised up as EV shift slows The report says that oil demand in the U.S. was revised up by about the same amount that China’s was revised down. This is because the U.S. is moving more slowly toward electric vehicles. Even so, U.S. oil production is still expected to keep growing. Ahead of 2030, global oil production capacity is expected to grow by about 5.1 million b/d, according to the IEA, roughly double the total rise in demand over the same period. The United States will remain a leading producer, joined by gains in Brazil, Canada and Guyana. Still, the agency warns that OPEC+ may find it hard to win back significant market share. Not every major oil player agrees with the IEA’s view. Vitol, the world’s biggest independent trader, and some banks such as Bank of America have said that global demand might not peak until after 2030. Others, including the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, still expect demand to rise well beyond the middle of the century, though OPEC has already pulled back overly bullish short-term outlooks in recent years.

46216408,https://bitzo.com/2025/06/bitcoin-rebounds-as-institutions-buy-the-dip-jpmorgan-says-hashrate-hits-record,1750174848,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/46216408.jpeg,Bitcoin Rebounds as Institutions Buy the Dip — JPMorgan Says Hashrate Hits Record,https://bitzo.com/2025/06/bitcoin-rebounds-as-institutions-buy-the-dip-jpmorgan-says-hashrate-hits-record,"Bitcoin is making a quiet but notable comeback, with institutional buyers stepping in to scoop up the dip. JPMorgan’s latest report reveals that the Bitcoin network’s hashrate has hit an all-time high—often seen as a sign of long-term confidence from miners and big-money players alike. While price action remains tense, this surge in network strength hints at a possible shift in momentum. As BTC stabilizes, eyes are turning to which other cryptocurrencies could ride the wave next. In this analysis, we break down Bitcoin’s current setup and explore where the smart money may flow next. Bitcoin Price Struggles as Bulls Show Weakness Source: tradingview Bitcoin's current range sits between roughly $102,000 and $110,000, marking a slight tension in its movement. Recent data points to bulls losing their grip, with prices dipping about 3.7% in the past week. The coin is approaching the support level near $98,600, while resistance looms at around $114,000. With an RSI under 40, bearish tendencies appear stronger now. However, over the last month, Bitcoin has grown by nearly 3%, showing potential for resurgence. If bullish momentum gains, it could aim for the second resistance, just over $121,000, capturing a near 20% gain from the current lower price of $102,000. Yet, for now, cautious optimism prevails. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rebound, paired with record-breaking hashrate growth, sends a clear signal: institutions are far from bearish. Despite short-term price hesitations, the long-term fundamentals are strengthening—laying the groundwork for a broader market recovery. If BTC pushes beyond key resistance levels, it could trigger a wider rally across altcoins. For now, cautious optimism prevails, but with deep-pocket investors stepping in and network health surging, Bitcoin’s next big move may be closer than it looks—and other major coins may soon follow.

XYZVerse (XYZ) Could Offer a Sharper Edge This Quarter,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/considering-a-shift-away-from-polkadot-dot-or-polygon-pol-xyzverse-xyz-could-offer-a-sharper-edge-this-quarter/,"This quarter, some investors might think about leaving mainstays like Polkadot and Polygon among continuous changes in the blockchain field. Rising as a candidate with a better edge in the current quarter is XYZVerse (XYZ). Examining its unique benefits could help one negotiate approaching changes in the market. For astute investors, could XYZVerse be the next major action? Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZ is the meme coin that has attracted news with its audacious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. It has thus gone halfway so far, generating over $14 million, and the value of the $XYZ token right now is $0.0033. Early investors have the possibility to get a larger discount since the $XYZ token value will increase to $0.005 at the next 13th stage of the presale. $XYZ will be listed on main centralized and distributed exchanges after the presale. The team has put ateaser for a major release but not revealed the specifics yet. a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is creating a community for the driven, aspirational ones aiming for supremacy—those hungry for large profits in crypto. This is a coin for real fighters—a perspective that sportsmen and players both relate to. The token used by thrill-seekers hunting the next major meme coin is $XYZ. XYZepe, a fighter in the meme coin space striving to ascend the charts and reach the top on CoinMarketCap, forms central to the XYZVerse narrative. Will it replace the current DOGE or SHIB? Time will reveal itself. HIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes The show runs at XYZVerse from the community. One of the biggest airdrops on record, active participants get significant rewards; the team has set aside a staggering 10% of the total token supply—about 10 billion $XYZ—for airdrops. Supported by consistent token burns, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and strong tokenomics, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every action is meant to increase momentum, propel price increase, and unite a devoted society aware of this could be the beginning of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Polkadot (DOT): The Cryptocurrency Connecting the Blockchain World Polkadot is a newly invented form of cryptocurrencies that is aimed at connecting multiple blockchains through the creation of bonds between them, through a system designed by co-founders of Ethereum (Gavin Wood). Extremely secure, it allows the blockchains to communicate (like Ethereum and Bitcoin), but without intermediaries. Data and value can thereby travel easily across various networks. Polkadot streamlines transactions and offers greater scalability via parachains, which are basically an equivalent of Indeed, it will be a successful contender in the crypto business as it will be able to process more transactions than those processed by Bitcoin and Ethereum. The DOT token is also staked by the Network and utilized in governance actions, thus allowing its owners to contribute to the development of the protocol and, in such a way, help in transactions verification. Polkadot has The Potential of Changing how Blockchains Interact The connection between multiple networks yields a more coherent and productive system. Distributed finance and applications open new possibilities with this interoperability. Speed and scalability, which the technology of Polkadot can offer more than other cryptocurrencies, are simply essential in the growing crypto market. Polkadot is especially an attractive option of the current market cycle as the increasing demand in blockchain solutions capable of handling more transactions and interconnecting multiple platforms demands. With the evolution of the market, this coin is worth seeking attention as its focus on the connection with the crypto world brings change in the sphere. Polygon Ecosystem Token: Unlocking the Potential of a Growing Network The Polygon Ecosystem Token (POL) is the beating core of the Polygon network, not only a digital asset. Acting as a utility token, POL helps users to interact extensively with the large ecosystem. Staking POL allows holders to protect the network and engage in its consensus systems, so earning rewards throughout. POL also gives holders governance rights so they may vote on ideas that will determine Polygon’s course. POL’s value is increased even more by access to special services and apps inside the ecosystem. POL is unique in the changing crypto scene of today because of its multifarious use and expansion of the Polygon network. POL will become more in demand as more developers choose Polygon for its scalable solutions. POL is an interesting alternative in the present market compared to tokens with limited purposes since of its influence in staking, governance, and exclusive access. Although the crypto markets are known for their volatility, Polygon technology’s growing application and acceptance might affect POL’s future demand. Conclusion Although DOT and POL are strong, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out in this bull run since it provides a distinctive sports meme experience and targets huge development.

These Underrated Altcoins Is the Market’s Best-Kept Secret",https://bitzo.com/2025/06/100-in-100k-out-these-underrated-altcoins-is-the-markets-best-kept-secret,"What if a $100 bet on the right altcoin could turn into a six-figure win? While the headlines chase Bitcoin and Ethereum, a few underrated altcoins are quietly positioning for massive upside. These under-the-radar projects may not be trending yet—but the charts are showing signs that a breakout could be brewing. In this article, we explore three of the market’s best-kept secrets—HBAR, Algorand, and THORChain—and why they could deliver outsized returns when the next bull wave hits. Hedera (HBAR) Building the Base for a Bullish Reversal Source: tradingview Hedera (HBAR) is showing signs of gearing up for a turnaround after recent consolidation between $0.1422 and $0.1763. Although it faced a modest 13.8% dip last week, its current RSI of 38.11 suggests the asset is entering oversold territory—a zone where reversals often begin. Hedera’s powerful enterprise partnerships and scalable DAG-based architecture continue to position it well for long-term growth. A breakout above the $0.1973 resistance could open the door to a rally toward $0.2314, representing a potential 30%+ upside. As market sentiment stabilizes, HBAR may prove to be one of the most overlooked comeback stories of the next bull run. Algorand (ALGO) Positioned for a Rebound with Long-Term Upside Source: tradingview Algorand is navigating a temporary downtrend between $0.16 and $0.20, but key indicators suggest a potential setup for a strong bounce. Despite recent declines, ALGO’s proof-of-stake infrastructure and focus on institutional-grade scalability remain its core strengths. A move past the $0.23 resistance could trigger a short-term surge of around 15%, with room to stretch toward $0.27 for a total 30% gain. Oversold RSI and Stochastic readings hint at a possible reversal zone. For investors with a long-term view, Algorand’s current price may represent a rare opportunity to enter before momentum returns. THORChain (RUNE) Prepares for Potential Breakout After Sharp Correction Source: tradingview THORChain (RUNE) is currently trading between $1.38 and $1.72, forming a potential accumulation zone after a 70% correction over six months. This pullback could be setting the stage for a bullish breakout as the platform continues to solidify its position in the cross-chain DeFi space. A breakout above $1.92 would clear a major hurdle, opening the path toward $2.26—offering over 30% upside from the current lower range. With oversold signals flashing on multiple indicators and long-term fundamentals still intact, RUNE may be quietly setting up for a powerful comeback as market conditions improve. Conclusion HBAR, Algorand, and THORChain may be flying under the radar now, but their current price action and technical setups hint at serious upside potential. With RSI levels nearing oversold zones and room for double-digit percentage moves if resistance is broken, these altcoins are quietly building pressure. While nothing in crypto is guaranteed, the combination of low entry prices and strong long-term fundamentals makes them compelling picks for high-risk, high-reward investors. If the broader market turns bullish, these could be the breakout stories no one saw coming—until it was too late. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The plan has been confirmed by the Deputy Finance Minister of Thailand, Chulaphan Amornvivat, and was publicly announced . The move aligns with the nation’s effort to establish its footprint in the blockchain and digital currency space across Southeast Asia. The new policy, which takes immediate effect, applies to individual investors trading on authorized platforms and will remain in place until 2029, according to the Ministry of Finance. Previously, such profits from crypto trading were part of a person’s income and were subject to progressive tax rates. That was a source of tension for both small-time investors and big players, some of whom looked to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions. Now, with the tax removed, the Thai government believes it will be able to foster a way for fresh capital to flow into the market and encourage the global adoption of blockchain technology. The waiver is limited to transactions on government-approved platforms. The new tax relief will not apply to unauthorized exchange investors; some could even face fines . Thailand welcomes the world to crypto investment The tax-free period is one aspect of a broader national initiative to turn Thailand into a hub for digital asset innovation. The government aims to promote a strong financial technology sector, including cryptocurrencies, asset-backed or “tokenized” currencies, and blockchain-based financial services. Thailand has gradually been opening to digital finance. The SEC endorsed using stablecoins such as Tether’s USDt and Circle’s USDC on regulated venues in early 2024. The country is also considering crypto-tied debit and credit card services for tourists as part of a broader commitment to digitizing spending and increasing financial inclusion . Heavyweights in the industry will see the tax policy as a game-changing event. Social media reaction has been almost universally good. Crypto influencers and traders on X (formerly Twitter) describe the move as a breath of fresh air when contrasted with restrictive regimes in other countries. Thailand’s largest digital asset exchange, Bitkub, has the most to gain, particularly after Bitcoin’s recent price hike. With more than 5 million registered users and daily trading volumes approaching 2 billion baht ($54 million), it’s in a good place for that rebound in investor appetite. Thailand balances crypto tax relief with tight oversight The policy has generated optimism but also some wariness among experts. Removing taxes from a highly volatile and speculative asset class might cause a chronically stretched government to lose some much-needed funds – especially as digital assets are increasingly being used and viewed as “store of value” vehicles. Others also caution that bringing in speculative capital may disrupt Thailand’s financial markets with inadequate regulation. Additionally, there is worry about investor protection, particularly for less sophisticated retail traders who may be attracted to the siren song of tax-free profits without a real grasp on the risks. Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has responded swiftly. The commission said it would maintain onerous licensing standards and closely monitor the market. In the last few months, the SEC has moved against unlicensed crypto platforms, such as Bybit and OKX, preventing them from serving Thai users. The Thai cabinet has also agreed on changes to the Digital Asset Business Act to protect crypto investors better, enhance cybercrime surveillance, and increase the transparency of the cryptocurrency industry.

Coinbase insiders continue to offload stock on the market. On Tuesday, June 16, Coinbase filed a Form 144 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, reporting all insider sales. The company disclosed that insiders sold 26,243 shares of Coinbase stock since March 2025. The net proceeds from these sales totaled $5,673,636. The largest, and possibly only, seller was CFO Alesia Haas. Haas personally sold 21,020 shares in three transactions, one each month since March, netting $4.53 million. On the same dates, ABC 2021 LLC also sold a total of 5,223 shares for $1.14 million. Coinbase securities sold by insiders since March 2025 | Source: SEC.gov These sales appear to be a part of routine financial management by the executive. According to Investing.com , Alesia Haas owned 114,866 shares of Coinbase stock in March of 2025 directly. She also owned 15,673 shares through ABC 2021 LLC, of which she is a sole member. Coinbase executives continue to offload shares Management of publicly traded companies can freely sell their shares on the market. However, such sales are closely watched by other investors. Large sales, in particular, can sometimes signal that executives are losing confidence in the company or believe the stock is overvalued. For this reason, the SEC requires that public companies disclose these sales. However, in a fourth quarter of 2024 investor call, Haas denied that these sales reflect a lack of confidence in the company. “All of our insiders—myself, Brian, Emilie, Paul, those on the phone and all of our insiders—we all have shared long-term conviction in Coinbase,” Haas stated. “It’s important to note that these sales account for a small portion of insiders’ total holdings in Coinbase.” CEO Brian Armstrong has been one of the biggest sellers of Coinbase stock. Armstrong sold nearly $290 million worth of Coinbase shares in 2021, soon after the company went public.

So far, Monero (XMR) has not delivered those massive returns. Once a major contender for the top spot, the privacy coin has faced fading momentum. A major reason for this loss in momentum is that Monero (XMR) has been delisted from many leading exchanges to appease authorities. As a result, the dwindling options to trade XMR tokens have dampened their price. In its place, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a viable alternative for growth. This project, which is built on the foundation of utility, is turning heads all over the crypto sector. Analysts and investors are all excited about its prospects, forecasting 20x growth in the upcoming altcoin bull cycle. Discover Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The Future Of DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to launch a revolutionary lending protocol where users can participate as lenders or borrowers. The protocol allows lenders to deposit their assets in exchange for passive income in interest payments. The payments they receive on their assets are based on the pool utilization rate. As the rate rises, it encourages borrowers to repay their loans, while lenders rush to deposit more funds to benefit from the higher yields. The result is that the interest rate falls, while at the same time, the protocol liquidity expands, attracting more users. This self-correcting feedback loop ensures optimal capital utilization, allowing users to access the best rates possible in the DeFi industry. A Focus On Security Mutuum Finance is laser-focused on the safety of its users. In line with this, the platform has implemented various on-chain and off-chain security measures. One of these is token vetting. All tokens added to the protocol will be carefully vetted to ensure they meet the highest standards possible. It is especially so when it comes to tokens used as collateral. The protocol will check various aspects of these tokens, including their level of centralization and the independence of the price oracles. If the platform detects any signs of price manipulation, such tokens could be stopped from operating on the protocol until an in-depth assessment has been conducted. As part of the protocol safeguards, all tokens used for collateral will have to be overcollateralized. That simply means borrowers will need to deposit more than the value of the collateral they are using. The level of overcollateralization will be determined based on the specific traits of a token. For instance, tokens that show a high level of price volatility, coupled with low liquidity, will face a stricter overcollateralization regime. In some cases, Mutuum Finance may limit the options for a token. For instance, they could limit it to only borrowing assets of the same type. In other cases, it could be banned from being used as collateral. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also impose lending and borrowing caps on some tokens. This measure is meant to ensure that, in case of massive price movements or the infinite minting exploit, the ecosystem’s overall solvency is not severely impacted. A Commitment To Transparency As part of its commitment to transparency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will issue mtTokens to lenders who deposit their assets into the protocol. For instance, when a user deposits $1,600 worth of BNB in a pool, they will receive mtBNB tokens on a 1:1 ratio. The mtTokens represent the value of their initial deposit plus any interest accrued. They will allow users to transparently track how much interest they have earned on their deposits in real time. Since the tokens are based on the ERC20 token standard, users can also trade them on secondary exchanges that support the standard to benefit from market opportunities in real time. MUTM Token Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is currently in phase 5 of its presale, where tokens are going for $0.03 each. So far, over $10.7 million worth of tokens have been sold to around 12,100 unique buyers. In phase 1 of the presale, the tokens were going for $0.01, and the price has since risen by 200%. One of the reasons for this massive price increase is the positive forecasts for MUTM tokens by analysts. The latest forecast states that the price of MUTM tokens could rise by 2,450%. Based on this forecast, a $1,300 investment in the presale could grow to $31,850. The presale price will rise by 16.67% in phase 6 to $0.035. This stepped increase will continue until the listing price of $0.06. If you get your tokens at the current price, you stand to make 100% bigger returns than those who wait until the token listing price. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an innovative crypto project that has caused a lot of excitement amongst XRM investors looking for growth. You too can join them in the ongoing MUTM presale for a chance at over 20x growth when the tokens go live.

Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) token plunged to a low of $0.00001160, its lowest level since April 9. It has dropped by 35% from its recent peak on May 12. SHIB price dropped because of the ongoing crypto market crash that has pushed Bitcoin and most altcoins lower. The sell-off intensified as whales dumped their SHIB holdings. According to Nansen data, whale holdings have declined by over 80% in the last 12 months to 34 billion tokens. Similarly, smart money holdings have fallen by over 35% to 13.1 billion during the same period. Shiba Inu’s ecosystem is also under pressure. Shibarium’s total value locked (TVL) has dropped by 23% over the past 30 days to $2.6 million. Its total value locked remains significantly smaller than more established layer-2 networks like Arbitrum, Polygon, and Base.

Artemis data shows that the number of transaction users dropped to 89 from a high of 374 in March. Similarly, the number of daily transactions has dropped to 141, down from 937 in March. On the positive side, Shiba Inu’s daily token burn rate surged by 809% on Tuesday, rising to over 17.69 million SHIB. Token burns reduce circulating supply and are generally seen as a bullish signal by long-term investors. Shiba Inu price technical analysis SHIB price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that SHIB has been in a sustained downtrend over the past few weeks, falling from its May high of $0.00001765 to its current level near $0.00001150. SHIB has broken below both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. Most notably, the price is nearing its year-to-date low of $0.00001030. Technically, SHIB appears to be forming a potential double-bottom pattern, with the neckline at $0.00001765. If the bearish momentum continues, SHIB may test the support level at $0.00001030. A successful hold could trigger a bounce back toward resistance at $0.00001765. However, a drop below the year-to-date low of $0.000010 would invalidate the double-bottom pattern and suggest further downside ahead.

The broader market gauge, the CoinDesk 20 was 2% lower at publication time. Technical Analysis: FIL-USD underwent a notable 5.8% decline over the 24-hour period, dropping from a high of $2.569 to a low of $2.406. Heavy selling pressure occurred between 22:00-00:00 UTC when volume spiked to over 7 million units. The token found support at the $2.41-$2.42 range, forming a potential consolidation zone after the sharp decline. Technical analysis reveals a breakdown of the $2.52 support level that had previously held during the first half of the period. Resistance is now established at $2.56, where multiple rejection wicks formed before the downtrend accelerated. The high-volume selling suggests institutional distribution and potential further downside unless buyers can reclaim the $2.45 level. In the last hour, FIL-USD demonstrated notable volatility with a recovery attempt from the previous correction. Price action formed a V-shaped pattern, initially dropping to a low of $2.411 before staging a significant rally to reach $2.427 Volume peaked during the upward movement at over 55,000 units traded, suggesting strong buying interest at support levels. The asset has since consolidated between $2.415-$2.418, establishing a potential short-term horizontal support zone. Multiple rejection wicks formed at the $2.420 resistance level. This price action indicates potential stabilization following the earlier decline, though modest volume in the final minutes suggests caution before confirming a trend reversal.

Each offers unique investment opportunities and technological promises. This article delves into their potential, unpacking which coin might emerge stronger in the evolving market. Exploring these narratives reveals valuable insights for those eyeing future growth in the crypto space. Helium HNT Price Analysis Amid Steep Declines Over the past month, Helium has seen a drop of nearly 38%, while its six-month decline has reached approximately 68%. The recent one-week decline of around 19% contributes to a trend of significant downward movement. The price history indicates a consistent loss of value, reflecting sustained bearish pressure across both short and long time frames. Currently, Helium trades within the range of $2.73 to $3.97. The immediate support is near $2.30, with resistance around $4.79 acting as key trading levels. Additional support at about $1.07 and resistance near $6.03 also play vital roles. Bears dominate the market, as shown by continued declines and technical indicators. Traders may look for potential rebounds at the $2.30 support before entering trades, while some might consider short positions near the upper resistance level, depending on prevailing downward signals. Careful trading is advised until a clear trend emerges. Filecoin Shows Declining Trend Amid Key Support and Resistance Levels Filecoin experienced significant downtrends over the past month and half-year. The coin dropped approximately 11.2% in the last 30 days, with a six-month decline nearing 56.4%. A one-week drop of about 4.9% adds more pressure to its overall performance. This continuous downturn indicates a market struggling to maintain upward momentum amid increasing selling pressure. Currently, Filecoin’s price action remains confined between a support level near $1.90 and a major resistance at $3.65, with the trading band around $2.25 to $3.12. Bears are maintaining pressure, leaving the trend muted and lacking a clear direction. Indicators show negative readings, while an RSI of 43 suggests selling pressure is not at oversold levels. A break below $1.90 could lead to a drop closer to $1.03, while overcoming $3.65 may open gains toward $4.52. Caution is advised as the market remains under bearish influence. Conclusion Helium (HNT) and Filecoin (FIL) each offer unique benefits for investors. HNT focuses on supporting decentralized networks for the Internet of Things, providing rewards for coverage. FIL, on the other hand, aims to decentralize data storage, making it efficient and secure. Both have strong use cases and potential for growth. The decision to invest will depend on which vision aligns more closely with individual goals for the future of technology and data management.

The trader, known as AguilaTrades on X, entered a bitcoin long position at $106,000, and sat through at Monday's high of $108,800 before the largest cryptocurrency took a tumble to trade recently around $104,000. Bitcoin volatility has been relatively low for months, with the price ranging between the $100,000 level of support and record highs around $110,000. That hasn't perturbed derivatives traders, who are continually betting on upside with leverage, subsequently getting chopped in a tight range. It's not the first time AguilaTrades has recorded a losing trade at these levels. Last week they were up $5.8 million on a BTC long before losing $12.5 million, according to Lookonchain . On paper the trade has credentials because BTC has managed to remain above $100,000 despite escalating conflict in the Middle East, which is typically a catalyst for downside in risk assets. However, remaining agnostic to price action in this range and simply buying support and selling resistance would have yielded far greater results.

The firm announced the groundbreaking development Monday, stating that quoted prices for the products will reference Nasdaq Ether and Solana indices. With this, B3 is consolidating its reach in the crypto derivatives sector as it already offers Bitcoin futures contracts with around $4 billion in daily trading volume on the exchange. Derivative contracts expose investors to the expected price adjustments for crypto assets without owning a single coin. The exchange wrote: “With the new cryptoasset futures, B3 meets the growing market and investor demand for products with exposure to cryptocurrencies, bringing more innovation and sophistication to products.” The announcement added that each unit of the Ethereum futures contract will be 0.25 ETH while the Solana contract unit will be 5 SOL. Thus, this will make the product more accessible while offering users familiar with crypto a safe and regulated way to trade on price volatility. B3 has a long history of offering crypto-focused products for investors, with the exchange launching its first digital assets-related product, HASH11, in 2021. It now has 21 crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Brazilian Depositary Receipts (BDRs) of ETFs available for investors. B3 announces changes in Bitcoin futures contract size Meanwhile, the stock exchange has also reduced the unit size of its Bitcoin futures contract by ten times, with a unit now worth 0.01 BTC (approximately 6,000 Brazilian Real). This follows approval by the Brazilian securities regulator (CVM). This move is part of its efforts to make the Bitcoin futures contract, which launched in 2024, more accessible, not only for Brazilian traders but also for international investors. For instance, US investors have enjoyed access to Bitcoin Future and Bitcoin Future Scrolling products on B3 since May. Unlike the Ethereum and Solana futures contract, the Bitcoin futures trade in Brazilian Real and the reduction in unit size also took effect on June 16, the same day as the launch of the two new products. In one year of having Bitcoin futures, 41 million contracts were negotiated, and in April 2025 alone, 4 million were negotiated. Brazil’s crypto sector continues to grow With many countries still struggling to understand and regulate crypto, B3’s new products capture how Brazil is growing into a major crypto hub in Latin America. By pricing its new products in US Dollars, the exchange particularly shows its interest in attracting international investors to the country. Interestingly, the country has seen significant levels of adoption as it ranks ninth globally on the Chainalysis Global Adoption Index for 2024 while ranking second in value received for the Latin America region with $90.3 billion. Brazilian fintech Meliuz also recently adopted the Bitcoin treasury. However, there are regulatory pressures from several angles. The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) has expressed concerns about stablecoin use in the country, claiming it enables money laundering and tax evasion. It is now making efforts to regulate stablecoins, with recently proposed rules that could limit the transfer of stablecoins across wallets. However, stakeholders have warned that rules must not overregulate the sector to avoid killing innovation. Still, more setbacks might be coming with the recent removal of tax exemptions on capital gains for small-scale crypto holders. The move, part of new tax policies under Provisional Measure 1303, imposed a flat 17.5% tax on all gains from crypto assets. However, the new rules have already faced pushback from crypto stakeholders who believe that they could affect the competitiveness of the country’s crypto sector. Lawmakers have queried the new tax regime for not involving stakeholders, with some even pushing to repeal it. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash both show promise once again. This article dives deep into their potential, weighing their strengths and weaknesses. Which coin stands out as the better investment today? Discover the answers that could shape future crypto investments. Litecoin Trading Range as Bears Hold Near Key Levels Last month, Litecoin declined by around 9.66%, with a six-month decrease nearing 20%. The weekly performance showed a smaller dip of 4.50%, indicating consistent downward pressure over time. Price action has been characterized by falling momentum, and technical indicators have remained on the negative side, reflecting a bearish bias during these periods. Currently, the coin trades within a range from approximately $76 to $102, with near-term support at $65 and resistance around $117. A second line of support is near $40, while a higher resistance is approximately $143. Negative readings from the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator, along with an RSI at 44.78, suggest active sellers. Although bearish sentiment prevails, the relatively tight trading range allows for range-bound strategies. Traders should watch the floor at $65 for potential rebounds and consider selling opportunities around the $117 resistance. The price lacks a clear trend, indicating possible reversal or further declines. Bitcoin Cash: Short-Term Gains vs. Long-Term Stability Analysis A 20.56% price increase recorded over the past month reflects a powerful rally, contrasting with a modest half-year change of -1.62%. A sharp 11.29% surge in the past week indicates strong buying interest amid overall subdued long-term movement. The recent upswing highlights a period of intense activity that temporarily overrode the broader downtrend, suggesting that traders have capitalized on short-term opportunities while longer-term performance calls for caution. Price movements show that momentum can shift quickly, underscoring the dynamic nature of Bitcoin Cash’s market behavior. Current BCH price levels sit between $356 and $468, with key levels playing a vital role in trading decisions. The nearest resistance at $520.77 and a secondary barrier at $632.71 provide clear targets for bulls to signal a sustained upward move. Support levels at $296.91 and another cushion at $184.97 offer strategic entry points for buyers if the price retraces. Momentum indicators suggest high buying pressure, though the coin may be approaching overbought territory. Bulls appear to lead, but the lack of a firmly established trend leaves room for volatility. Trading within these levels presents opportunities to capture gains by monitoring resistance breakouts and rebounds near support. Conclusion Both LTC and BCH present unique strengths. LTC is known for its faster transaction times and lower fees. BCH offers larger block sizes for more transactions per block. Investors should consider their priorities. If faster transactions and lower fees are crucial, LTC may be the better choice. However, if higher transaction throughput is a priority, BCH could be more appealing. Ultimately, the decision depends on individual needs and market outlook. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

At this point, tomorrow's FED June interest rate decision will be more important, while the general expectation in the market is that the FED will keep interest rates constant. While the possibility of the FED making a surprise move is almost non-existent, analysts argue that the FED is actually in a position to cut interest rates. FED May Cut Interest Rates But…! Accordingly, analyst Nick Timiraos said the FED will keep interest rates steady and evaluate the impact of tariffs on inflation. Nick Timiraos expects the Fed to keep interest rates on hold this week despite recent inflation improvements, amid ongoing concerns about the potential impact of tariffs on price expectations. According to the analyst, although inflation data has moderated in the last three months, Fed members remain concerned about how tariff-related cuts could affect future inflation data. At this point, the Fed will continue its cautious approach, according to the analyst. The Reason FED Doesn't Cut Interest Rates Is Only Political! Billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya also claimed that the FED could cut interest rates right now, but it did not do so for just one reason. Speaking on the All-In Podcast, Chamath Palihapitiya argued that the Fed will not be cutting interest rates in the near future, pointing to politics as the reason for this. Stating that the possibility of a rate cut in the summer months is quite low, the famous name argued that the FED could make a 100 basis point cut right now. Stating that such a move would reduce the US debt by $300 billion, the famous name claimed that it would be good for the US and the economy in every way, not just debt savings. “If there's a numerical justification for lowering interest rates and it has all these positive effects for the U.S. economy, why not do it? “The only answer is political.

The declines come as watchdogs, lawmakers, and scholars level serious allegations that Trump is using his presidency to orchestrate profitable crypto deals alongside Tron founder Justin Sun. The $Trump token is changing hands at $9.6, a 4.5% drop. MELANIA, a separate memecoin associated with the First Lady, is down 17.56% from its weekly peak and trades at $0.2597, despite a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $13 million. Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), another Trump-affiliated venture, dropped 0.05% down to $18.66 in early US Tuesday trading. Economists wage outcry on Trump’s ‘open corruption’ In a private dinner held on May 22 at Trump’s Virginia golf course, attended by 25 of the top buyers of the $Trump memecoin, Sun received a $100,000 Trump-branded watch for being the top purchaser, having invested $20 million in the token. A White House tour followed the next day. The initiative reportedly generated an estimated $148 million in memecoin sales, much of it from anonymous and foreign wallets. Trump’s team has not denied that these events were tied directly to financial incentives for both the president and his inner circle. “ Self-enrichment is exactly what the founders feared most in a leader ,” said Paul Rosenzweig, a former federal prosecutor. “ Trump’s profiting from his presidential memecoin is a textbook example of what the framers wanted to avoid .” Justin Sun, the founder of TRON who is under regulatory watch for the collapse of stablecoin Terra, is more closer than anyone to Trump’s crypto ventures. His involvement began well before the May dinner. Sun reportedly invested $75 million into another Trump-led project, World Liberty Financial (WLF), a crypto platform the Trump family launched last fall. Trump and his sons reportedly own a 60% stake. Following Trump’s return to office in January, Sun’s firms were among those that saw investigations halted or paused by regulatory bodies. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in February paused three cases involving Sun’s crypto entities. According to multiple reports, those decisions came as the administration quietly reversed several Biden-era crypto regulations. On Monday, after news broke out that Tron had plans to go pubic and form a MSTR type company with Eric Trump, the president’s sun went on X to refute the claims, saying: “ I’m the biggest fan of Tron and love Justin Sun. He is a great friend and an icon in the crypto space. That said, the news below is inaccurate. I don’t have public involvement in this company .” Ethics watchdogs and lawmakers demand accountability Ethics experts, legal scholars, and congressional leaders have condemned the president’s crypto dealings as blatant corruption. Steven Levitsky, a Harvard political scientist and co-author of How Democracies Die , said, “I have never seen such open corruption in any modern government anywhere.” Julian Zelizer, a professor of political history at Princeton University, called Trump’s actions “explicit.” “ Policy decisions are being made regarding parts of the financial industry that are being done not to benefit the nation, but his own financial interests ,” Zelizer explained. Rosenzweig added, “ Not only do Trump’s extravagant crypto ventures benefit him personally… they also benefit his tech bro backers who will take full advantage of the end of regulatory enforcement. ” The State Democracy Defenders Fund estimates the Trump family’s crypto ventures were worth approximately $2.9 billion as of March. Reuters reported that WLF alone raised over $500 million, with 75% of token sale proceeds flowing to Trump and his family.

46222049,https://zycrypto.com/?p=107520,1750181614,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,America’s Largest Bank JPMorgan Applies for Possible Stablecoin JPMD Trademark,https://zycrypto.com/americas-largest-bank-jpmorgan-applies-for-possible-stablecoin-jpmd-trademark/,"JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in America, has filed for a trademark for a digital currency titled JPMD with the US Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). At this stage, it is unclear what JPMD represents or whether it is a new stablecoin developed by JPMorgan in secret. A stablecoin pegs a digital currency to a real-world asset such as the US dollar. JPMorgan has taken an interest in stablecoins, signalling a change in the bank’s stance regarding using digital assets in the finance industry. The PTO website described the JPMD trademark as representing a service that would provide trading and exchange services for digital assets. The trademark is categorised as relating to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Traders on X have surmised that the new crypto trademark is JPMorgan’s stablecoin and will be accompanied by a coin offering. JPMD, the new trademark by JPMorgan, seems to imply that the “D” represents the word “dollar”, making the new crypto trademark a stablecoin issued by JPMorgan. Other stablecoins of note include Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. The Wall Street Journal published an article on May 22 suggesting that JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America planned to create a stablecoin shared between them. The WSJ article indicated that the stablecoin would speed up routine transactions and make cross-border payments. Therefore, the stablecoin could be used as an advanced accounting tool to save on transaction costs and record financial details within the bank. However, one can only speculate as to the legitimacy of the WSJ article at this stage. The Genius Act, meanwhile, is being considered by US lawmakers as a way to install regulatory guardrails on stablecoin use. Many expect the new laws to pass through this summer. Various companies plan to capitalise on the looser regulations relating to stablecoin use. JPMorgan may be one such company that intends to profit by investing early in stablecoin technology. The Trump administration may continue to provide incentives for the crypto industry. Therefore, companies from non-crypto industries may take a proactive approach to stablecoin investing. The Trump-backed crypto World Liberty project debuted its stablecoin USD1. The crypto company BitGo announced its stablecoin, USDS. Tether, however, remains the most popular stablecoin by market capitalisation with its token USDT. The World Liberty token USD1 is backed by real-world assets such as US dollars to legitimise the project. JPMorgan has adopted Bitcoin into its financial business model, accepting Bitcoin spot ETFs as collateral for loan applications. When assessing creditworthiness, JPMorgan will consider digital assets alongside fine art and vehicles to ascertain an individual’s net worth. JPMorgan has started considering BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as a loan collateral. The largest bank in America has surely begun to embrace Bitcoin within its business practices. Therefore, it seems reasonable to suggest that they will adopt their own stablecoin, especially with the current climate that may favour the stablecoin market. The major banks in America may be trying to control the issuance and circulation of stablecoins while applying traditional finance rules to use these assets. The PTO website has formally accepted the trademark application but is awaiting further review by a separate examiner. The trademark application allows JPMorgan to connect a trade name to an underlying process so that they have exclusive rights to use that name. Kinexys Digital Payments is the blockchain specialist that JPMorgan uses to complete its crypto projects. Kinexys completed their second test batch of transactions on a public blockchain last week. JPMorgan has the specialists lined up to adopt blockchain more fully within their bank. However, they have a lot of competition to contend with, such as with Tether, the largest issuer of US stablecoins.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|JPMorgan|stablecoin,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|USDT,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-17 17:33:34

SEC: Case enters new waiting phase,https://finbold.com/ripple-v-sec-case-enters-new-waiting-phase/,"The long-running legal battle between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has entered a fresh period of uncertainty as both parties await a pivotal court decision that could shape the outcome. In a joint status update filed on June 16, Ripple and the SEC requested the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to continue holding the appeals in abeyance. According to defense attorney James Filan, who shared the update on X on June 17, the move is linked to a pending motion for an indicative ruling in the lower court, an essential step toward modifying the final judgment and implementing a proposed settlement. As part of the latest timeline, the SEC has been directed to submit a status report by August 15, 2025. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP In light of the pending motion for an indicative ruling, the parties have requested that the Second Circuit continue to hold the appeals in abeyance, with the @SECGov to file a status report by August 15, 2025. https://t.co/7oQvL5Rx7U — James K. Filan 🇺🇸🇮🇪 (@FilanLaw) June 17, 2025 Ripple and SEC settlement deal The settlement proposal, first revealed in a May 8 agreement, would see Ripple pay the SEC a $50 million civil penalty and return $75 million currently held in escrow to the blockchain company. However, the deal hinges on the district court formally lifting an existing injunction. A procedural hurdle emerged when the court rejected a joint request for an indicative ruling on May 15, citing the absence of “exceptional circumstances” required to alter a final judgment. In response, the parties filed a revised motion on June 12, seeking to clarify their legal grounds and urging the court to reconsider. With the revised motion still under review, Ripple and the SEC have effectively paused the appellate process while awaiting the lower court’s decision. If approved, the ruling could pave the way for a final settlement and bring the case to a close. XRP price analysis Meanwhile, XRP continues to trade in line with the broader crypto market , which is facing bearish sentiment. As of press time, XRP was trading at $2.15, down over 7% in the past 24 hours. The token has also slipped more than 5% over the past week. XRP seven-day price chart.

In 2028, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $15,431 and $17,750, with an average expected price of $15,859. In 2031, ETH could trade between $47,322 and $56,126 with an average price of $48,649. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps traders trade Ethereum more easily So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2025 through 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Token ETH Price $2,552 Market Cap $305.82M Trading Volume (24h) $40.64B Circulating Supply 120.7M ETH All-time High $4,891.70 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time Low $0.4209 on Oct 21, 2015 24-hour High $2,680.09 24-hour Low $2,528.20 Ethereum price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Volatility 2.49% 50-day SMA $2,300.76 200-day SMA $2,420.46 Sentiment Bullish Fear and Greed Index 62 (Greed) Green days 16/30 (53%) 14-day RSI 52.65 Ethereum price analysis ETH/USD 1-day chart ETH/USD 1-day chart The one-day chart shows Ethereum (ETH) exhibiting indications of stabilization inside a consolidation range. Suggesting neutral to slightly optimistic attitude, the price is trading near the mid-Bollinger Band at $2,502.69 and somewhat above it at $2,557.11. At 50.94, the RSI is hovering about the middle and shows balance between buying and selling pressure. A breakout above the upper Bollinger Band at \$2,766.21 could set off more upward movement, maybe aimed toward the $2,900–$3,000 zone. But failing to maintain above the mid-band could cause fresh weakness given support at $2,399.17. Momentum is still wary and calls for a forceful action to bring trends clear. ETH/USD 4-hour chart analysis ETH/USD 4-hour price chart The 4-hour chart shows Ethereum (ETH) displaying modest increasing momentum. Suggesting continuous consolidation, the price is trading somewhat below the mid-Bollinger Band ($2,563.10) and hovered about $2,554.18. With the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting optimistic momentum is developing, the MACD is positive. At 0.08, balance of power is also good and reflects a minor buyer advantage. Should ETH surpass the mid-Bollinger Band, it may try to ascend to the top band at $2,648.89. Ignoring opposition could cause a pullback toward $2,477.30 support. Momentum still is delicate, thus volume confirmation is required. Ethereum technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $ 2,303.63 BUY SMA 5 $ 2,460.59 BUY SMA 10 $ 2,566.04 SELL SMA 21 $ 2,585.85 SELL SMA 50 $ 2,441.09 BUY SMA 100 $ 2,133.26 BUY SMA 200 $ 2,393.17 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $ 2,520.85 BUY EMA 5 $ 2,396.26 BUY EMA 10 $ 2,188.13 BUY EMA 21 $ 2,051.13 BUY EMA 50 $ 2,136.97 BUY EMA 100 $ 2,401.23 BUY EMA 200 $ 2,649.41 SELL What can you expect from the ETH price analysis next? Based on both the 4-hour and 1-day charts, Ethereum (ETH) is exhibiting neutral to mildly bullish momentum. On the 1-day chart, ETH is holding above the mid-Bollinger Band at $2,582.69, with RSI at 50.94 suggesting balanced market sentiment. The 4-hour chart confirms this stance, showing ETH consolidating just below mid-band resistance at $2,563.10, while MACD indicates a weak bullish crossover and Balance of Power favors buyers slightly. A break above $2,582–$2,600 could spark a move toward $2,766.21. However, rejection at resistance may push ETH back toward $2,477–$2,399. Momentum remains cautious, with confirmation needed from volume and trend strength. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. What is a realistic price for Ethereum in 2025? The realistic price for Ethereum in 2025 is around $5,458 at the maximum. What will 1 Ethereum be worth in 2030? One Ethereum is expected to be worth $38,085, maximum in 2030. How high can ETH realistically go? Ethereum’s price potential depends on multiple factors, including market trends, institutional adoption, network upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Realistically, ETH could reach $5,000 to $7,000 in the next bullish cycle if demand increases and Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements boost adoption. If institutional interest strengthens, ETH may push past $10,000 over the long term, especially if Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. However, volatility remains a key risk, with price corrections likely along the way. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) efficiency could also positively influence its long-term valuation. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2027, with its potential low starting at $10,333 and a high of $12,545 Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to surpass the $25,000 level by 2029 and reach a potential high of $26,554. This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, so long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum will likely reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $56,126 in 2031. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $56,126 mark by 2031, so holding it longer can be beneficial.

Vitalik Buterin’s RISC-V plan might make Ethereum’s technical infrastructure stronger, which could bring in more developers and make it easier to scale. But the sudden drop in base layer activity and gas costs that are lower than they’ve ever been raise doubts about how many people want to utilize the network and how long it will last. Ethereum might pick up speed again if it successfully executes protocol changes and Layer 2 solutions become more popular. Changes in the broader crypto market, new rules, and the adoption of crypto by businesses will also be very important. Ethereum’s price path in 2025 is still unclear and will be affected by both internal and external market factors, even if it has room to develop. Ethereum’s price outlook remains optimistic, with projections suggesting the potential for new all-time highs, possibly reaching near $6,000, driven by adoption, innovation, and network growth. However, external economic uncertainties or unfavorable conditions could press ETH prices toward an annual low of $4,825, with average estimates based on market sentiment hovering around $5,458. Year Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 $4,825 $5,022 $5,458 Ethereum price predictions 2026 – 2031 Year Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2026 $7,189 $7,440 $8,605 2027 $10,333 $10,705 $12,545 2028 $15,431 $15,859 $17,750 2029 $21,969 $22,603 $26,554 2030 $32,258 $33,162 $38,085 2031 $47,322 $48,649 $56,126 Ethereum price prediction 2026 The price projection for Ethereum in 2026 shows that it has a lot of room to grow. The lowest expected price is $7,189, and the average price is $7,440, if the market is good. The highest price, on the other hand, may go up to $8,605. Ethereum ETH price prediction 2027 Ethereum is expected to maintain its upward trajectory in 2027. However, the year’s predictions suggest a minimum price of $10,333, an average trading value of around $10,705, and a maximum price of $12,545. It is important to do your research before investing. Ethereum price prediction 2028 Ethereum’s price forecast for 2028 demonstrates steady appreciation. The potential low is estimated at $15,531, while the average price may reach $15,859 and the maximum price could rise to $17,750 Ethereum ETH price prediction 2029 Ethereum’s 2029 prices are expected to match those of 2029. The price range will be from a low of $21,969 to a high of $26,554 with an average of $22,603 signaling steady growth. Ethereum price prediction 2030 By 2030, Ethereum’s forecast minimum price could rise to $32,258– while the expected average trading price is projected at $33,162.

Filan (@FilanLaw) June 17, 2025 The request comes after the two parties submitted a renewed joint motion on June 12 to the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. As ZyCrypto reported , lawyers for Ripple and the SEC asked the court to grant their joint motion to lift the injunction against Ripple and allow for $50 million worth of fines held in escrow to go to the SEC, with the rest being returned to the blockchain payments firm. The renewed filing follows the court’s rejection of their initial joint motion for an indicative ruling in May. Judge Analisa Torres denied that request, emphasizing that it failed to show the “exceptional circumstances” required to amend a final ruling. Unfazed, the SEC and Ripple refiled their motion for an indicative ruling last week, highlighting those required exceptional circumstances that warrant amendment of the final ruling. Specifically, they argue that the proposed settlement would efficiently resolve the case without further litigation and would be consistent with the SEC’s approach in other crypto enforcement actions. Yesterday’s filing seeks to pause further appellate proceedings while settlement terms are finalized. The SEC intends to submit a status report by August 15, 2025. SEC And Ripple Wind Down Long-Standing Case In July 2023, Judge Torres found that secondary sales of the XRP cryptocurrency did not qualify as securities, granting Ripple and the broader crypto industry a major win . However, the Judge also declared that Ripple’s sale of XRP to institutional investors did violate securities laws. As such, Ripple was ordered to pay a $125 million penalty to the SEC as per a subsequent judgment from the Judge in August 2024. Unsatisfied with the outcome of the case, the SEC lodged an appeal in October 2024 — approximately a month before President Donald Trump won the presidential election against Democrat Kamala Harris. Suffice it to say that SEC vs Ripple is a landmark lawsuit for crypto regulations in the US, and formally ending the litigation will be a symbolic victory for an industry that has already largely won its battle for legal legitimacy in the world’s largest economy.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|SPONSORED|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-17 17:40:32

A significant step in this direction has just been announced, promising to make access to digital assets easier than ever before. Alchemy Pay , a leading crypto payment gateway, has officially teamed up with Ripple to enable a crucial service for Ripple’s recently announced, fully backed stablecoin, RLUSD. What Does the Alchemy Pay and Ripple Partnership Mean for RLUSD? This collaboration is centered around providing robust fiat on-ramp crypto services specifically for RLUSD. Announced via Alchemy Pay’s official channels, the partnership leverages Alchemy Pay’s extensive network to allow users worldwide to convert their local fiat currencies directly into RLUSD. This removes significant friction typically associated with entering the crypto market, especially for stablecoins. For those unfamiliar, a fiat on-ramp is essentially a service that allows individuals to use traditional money (like USD, EUR, GBP, etc.) to buy cryptocurrencies directly, often through familiar payment methods such as bank transfers, credit cards, or local payment systems. By integrating this service for RLUSD, Alchemy Pay is making it straightforward for users in a vast number of regions to acquire Ripple’s stablecoin. Accessing RLUSD Stablecoin in 173 Countries One of the most impressive aspects of this partnership is the sheer scale of accessibility it promises. Alchemy Pay’s integration is set to enable fiat on-ramp services for RLUSD in an astounding 173 countries. This global reach is critical for the widespread adoption of any digital asset, particularly a stablecoin aiming for stability and utility across diverse markets. Users in these countries will no longer need to navigate complex processes involving multiple exchanges or intermediaries to get their hands on RLUSD. They can potentially use their preferred local payment methods, making the transition from fiat to the RLUSD stablecoin much smoother and more intuitive. This level of accessibility is a powerful catalyst for onboarding new users into the digital asset ecosystem. Why is RLUSD Significant? Ripple’s entry into the stablecoin market with RLUSD is a noteworthy development. As a fully backed stablecoin, RLUSD aims to maintain a stable value, typically pegged 1:1 with a reserve asset like the US dollar. Stablecoins are crucial components of the crypto economy, providing a bridge between volatile cryptocurrencies and stable fiat currencies. They are used for trading, lending, payments, and as a safe haven during market downturns. Ripple’s decision to launch RLUSD signals their commitment to participating in the growing stablecoin sector, which is vital for facilitating smoother transactions and fostering greater confidence in digital currencies for everyday use and institutional adoption. A reliable fiat on-ramp is essential for any stablecoin to achieve broad utility, and this is where the Alchemy Pay partnership plays a pivotal role. Alchemy Pay: A Key Crypto Payment Gateway Alchemy Pay has established itself as a significant player in the crypto payment gateway space. Their infrastructure is designed to connect traditional finance with the crypto economy, offering solutions for businesses and individuals. Their services typically include: Fiat On-Ramp: Enabling users to buy crypto with fiat. Fiat Off-Ramp: Allowing users to sell crypto for fiat. Crypto Payroll: Facilitating salary payments in crypto. NFT Checkout: Simplifying the purchase of NFTs using fiat. Their strength lies in integrating a wide array of local payment channels across numerous jurisdictions. This existing infrastructure is precisely what makes them an ideal partner for Ripple to ensure RLUSD is easily accessible globally. Their network covers diverse payment methods, from major credit cards like Visa and Mastercard to regional mobile wallets and bank transfer systems. The Benefits of This Partnership for Users and the Ecosystem The collaboration between Ripple and Alchemy Pay brings several tangible benefits: Enhanced Accessibility: Users in 173 countries gain a direct, easy way to acquire RLUSD using their local currencies. Simplified Onboarding: The fiat on-ramp service reduces the technical barriers for new users entering the stablecoin market. Increased RLUSD Adoption: Greater accessibility naturally leads to increased potential usage and adoption of the RLUSD stablecoin. Broader Utility for Ripple Ecosystem: As RLUSD becomes easier to acquire, it can be more readily used within applications and services built on or connected to Ripple’s infrastructure. Strengthened Alchemy Pay Network: Partnering with a major player like Ripple enhances Alchemy Pay’s reputation and expands its transaction volume. Support for Local Payments: The focus on local payment methods makes the process feel familiar and trustworthy to users worldwide. How Does the Fiat On-Ramp Process Work? While the exact user interface will depend on the platform integrating Alchemy Pay’s service, the general process for a user wanting to acquire RLUSD stablecoin via the fiat on-ramp typically involves: Selecting RLUSD as the desired cryptocurrency to purchase. Entering the amount of RLUSD they wish to buy or the amount of fiat they wish to spend. Choosing their country and preferred local payment method (e.g., bank transfer, credit card, specific regional wallet). Completing identity verification (KYC – Know Your Customer), if required by regulations or the platform. Authorizing the payment using their chosen local method. Receiving the purchased RLUSD directly into their designated crypto wallet. This streamlined process contrasts sharply with older methods that might require users to first buy a more common crypto like Bitcoin or Ethereum on one platform, transfer it to another exchange, and then trade it for the desired stablecoin. Looking Ahead: The Future of Fiat On-Ramps and Stablecoins The partnership between Alchemy Pay and Ripple for RLUSD’s fiat on-ramp is indicative of a larger trend in the crypto space: the increasing focus on usability and integration with the traditional financial system. As stablecoins like RLUSD aim for wider adoption, easy and reliable fiat on-ramps become non-negotiable necessities. This development not only benefits individual users but also lays groundwork for businesses looking to interact with digital assets. A readily accessible stablecoin like RLUSD, backed by a major entity like Ripple and easily purchasable via a global payment gateway like Alchemy Pay, has the potential to be used for cross-border payments, settlements, and various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Actionable Insight: How to Access RLUSD via Alchemy Pay Users interested in utilizing this new service should look for platforms, exchanges, or wallets that have integrated Alchemy Pay’s fiat on-ramp solution for RLUSD. Once integrated, the option to buy RLUSD directly using local fiat currency via various payment methods will become available within those platforms’ interfaces. Keep an eye on announcements from exchanges and wallets popular in your region regarding their integration with Alchemy Pay’s RLUSD service. Conclusion The partnership between Alchemy Pay and Ripple to provide a comprehensive fiat on-ramp for the RLUSD stablecoin across 173 countries marks a significant leap forward in making digital assets more accessible globally. By leveraging Alchemy Pay’s robust crypto payment gateway infrastructure and wide network of local payment methods, acquiring RLUSD is set to become easier and more convenient for millions of potential users. This collaboration not only boosts the potential adoption and utility of RLUSD but also underscores the growing importance of seamless fiat-to-crypto solutions in the evolving financial landscape. It’s a powerful example of how strategic partnerships are paving the way for broader participation in the digital economy.

Table of Contents Retail giants warm up to stablecoins JPMorgan Chase’s JPMD filing hints at big-bank stablecoin ambitions Cutting fees is the easiest way to unlock billions Experts say it’s not if, but when — and how Retail giants warm up to stablecoins Three global players in commerce and payments, Amazon, Walmart, and Alibaba’s Ant Group, are reportedly exploring stablecoins , the digital assets typically pegged to fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar. According to a June 2025 report from The Wall Street Journal, both Amazon and Walmart are holding internal discussions around launching their own stablecoins. Amazon’s interest in digital currency is not new. In 2021, the company posted a job listing for a blockchain product lead focused on digital payments. Although the role did not result in a consumer-facing product, it reflected early engagement with blockchain-based financial tools. Walmart’s engagement dates back to 2019, when it filed a patent for a blockchain-based U.S. dollar token aimed at supporting unbanked customers. That project never launched, but the company has since revived its stablecoin ambitions and is now building out infrastructure for a proprietary coin. Amazon, meanwhile, is said to be weighing multiple options, including the use of third-party stablecoins or developing its own. No formal roadmap has been shared, but internal discussions remain ongoing. Ant Group, the fintech arm of Alibaba, appears to be further along. Its Singapore-based subsidiary, Ant International, has confirmed plans to apply for stablecoin issuance licenses in Hong Kong and Singapore . Both jurisdictions have recently introduced formal regulatory frameworks, including Hong Kong’s Stablecoin Ordinance passed in May 2025, which takes effect in August. Ant Group is also preparing to apply for a license in Luxembourg, signaling intent to expand into the European market. While the three companies are at different stages, their efforts point to a common factor. Regulatory clarity around stablecoins is improving across major financial hubs. In the U.S., the proposed Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act , aims to create clear rules for reserve backing and compliance. The bill has received bipartisan support and remains under active consideration. Across Asia, regulatory progress has been faster. Hong Kong and Singapore have already finalized stablecoin licensing regimes, giving firms like Ant Group a more immediate route to launch. JPMorgan Chase’s JPMD filing hints at big-bank stablecoin ambitions There are clear financial and operational incentives for companies like Amazon, Walmart, and Ant Group to explore issuing their own stablecoins. One of the most immediate motivations is cost reduction. Merchants typically pay 2% to 3% in interchange fees on each card transaction. For Amazon, which reported over $447 billion in global e-commerce revenue in 2024, that equates to an estimated $9 billion to $13 billion in annual fees. Shifting even a portion of these payments to a blockchain-based system, where transactions cost just a few cents or less, could significantly reduce expenses. At scale, those savings could either boost margins or translate into lower prices for customers. Simplifying international payments is another driver. Amazon serves global consumers, Walmart manages international supply chains, and Ant Group handles payments across borders through Alipay. In 2024, Ant processed over $1 trillion in transactions, with one-third routed through its in-house blockchain platform, Whale. Stablecoins can move across borders instantly without requiring expensive wire transfers or currency conversions, creating faster, cheaper, and more reliable payment flows in regions where banking infrastructure is limited. A proprietary stablecoin also enhances data control. When users pay through bank cards, some transaction data remains with third-party providers. If a company like Amazon issued its own currency for use across its ecosystem, it would retain full visibility into customer spending behavior. That data could be used to refine recommendations, improve logistics, and shape marketing campaigns across Amazon’s core platform, subsidiaries, or partners. Stablecoins also create financial upside through reserve holdings. To maintain price stability, issuers must hold equivalent fiat reserves, often in government bonds or cash. With interest rates still elevated in 2025, those reserves can yield meaningful returns. For example, if $10 billion worth of a stablecoin is backed by the U.S. Treasuries yielding 5%, the issuer earns $500 million annually in interest. This float income mirrors how banks profit from deposits and could become a major revenue stream for companies with large-scale stablecoin adoption. There is already precedent for this approach. JPMorgan Chase has been active in the blockchain space for years, and its stablecoin infrastructure is evolving. The bank’s Kinexy platform, formerly known as Onyx, has already processed over $1.5 trillion in interbank payments using JPM Coin, a private digital token backed 1:1 by the U.S. dollar, British pound, or euro. In June 2025, JPMorgan filed a new U.S. trademark application for the term “JPMD,” outlining a wide range of digital asset services, including crypto trading, transfers, clearing, and payment processing. While the filing does not explicitly mention the word “stablecoin,” its scope has sparked speculation that the bank may be preparing to expand its digital currency offerings. Hence, a well-managed proprietary stablecoin could provide the same benefits to tech and retail firms looking to improve efficiency and capture new value from payments. Cutting fees is the easiest way to unlock billions Stablecoins have quietly become a foundational layer of the global digital economy. With a market cap now exceeding $250 billion, these tokens play a central role in payments, remittances, and cross-border transfers, offering a digital alternative to traditional banking systems. The current market is dominated by a handful of established players. Tether ( USDT ) remains the most widely used stablecoin, especially on international exchanges. USD Coin ( USDC ), issued by Circle in partnership with Coinbase, is often viewed as a more transparent and regulator-aligned option. Other stablecoins, such as Pax Dollar (USDP), MakerDAO’s ( DAI ), and Binance USD ( BUSD ), serve more limited or specialized use cases. BUSD saw a sharp decline in usage in 2023 after regulatory action against its issuer. More recently, PayPal launched PayPal USD ( PYUSD ), although adoption remains modest compared to the leading incumbents. Most of these tokens are pegged to the U.S. dollar, which has emerged as the preferred settlement currency in crypto markets, even in regions where it is not the local tender. If Amazon or Walmart were to introduce their own stablecoin, it would mark the entry of globally recognized consumer brands into a space historically driven by fintech firms and crypto-native platforms. The user experience may not even feel like crypto. Customers could view balances in Amazon Coin or Walmart Pay directly within existing apps, use them for everyday purchases, and receive loyalty rewards or discounts, all without engaging with the underlying technology. Such a shift could have broader implications for payments infrastructure. A widespread move toward retailer-issued stablecoins may reduce reliance on credit card networks, which currently collect fees on every transaction. Merchants could choose faster, lower-cost payment rails that settle instantly, bypassing intermediaries. Banks could also face pressure if consumers begin storing balances in merchant wallets instead of traditional checking accounts. Several major U.S. banks, including JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Citi, have reportedly explored the idea of a jointly issued digital dollar as a way to respond to private stablecoin expansion. At the policy level, lawmakers and advocacy groups have raised concerns. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren and multiple consumer organizations have warned that stablecoins issued by retail giants could allow companies to consolidate control over payments, track spending habits more deeply, and influence consumer behavior in ways that sidestep existing financial regulation. Critics argue that letting commercial firms issue digital money at scale blurs the line between commerce and banking, a separation historically designed to protect financial stability and consumer autonomy. In China, authorities have already taken a more centralized route. The government’s e-CNY, a central bank digital currency, is operational and would likely limit how Ant Group’s stablecoin could be used domestically. Other countries may follow with accelerated CBDC efforts, either to preserve monetary oversight or to match the technical capabilities of private issuers. Experts say it’s not if, but when — and how crypto.news reached out to Blake Jeong, CEO of IOST, Chuck Zhang, CFO of PolyFlow, and Josip Rupena, CEO of Milo, to understand how seriously Amazon, Walmart, and Ant Group are considering stablecoins, and what the wider impact of their potential entry could be. While none of the companies have publicly confirmed their intentions, all three experts agree that discussions are likely well beyond the exploratory stage. Jeong pointed out that the economic incentive is simply too large to ignore, especially for businesses that rely heavily on tight margins and high transaction volumes. “There’s a strong likelihood they’re at least testing stablecoin strategies behind the scenes. For Amazon and Walmart, who operate on razor-thin margins and pay billions in card processing fees annually, stablecoins are a logical next step.” Rupena approached it from the infrastructure angle. In his view, the necessary foundation already exists within these companies’ ecosystems, making the move more a matter of timing than strategy. “I don’t think it’s a matter of if these companies pursue stablecoins, but when. Amazon, Walmart, and Ant Group have already built the infrastructure. They control wallets, own massive ecosystems, and are always looking for ways to streamline payments.” Zhang added that regulatory momentum, particularly the GENIUS Act in the U.S., is now creating the kind of policy certainty that these companies need to move forward. “All three of these companies have the volume and the user base to support their venture into stablecoins, especially now that the GENIUS Act clearly defines stablecoins as payment coins. It falls right into these firms’ core business.” Beyond intent, all three experts mentioned the potential to reduce dependence on card networks and lower the costs of everyday transactions. Jeong described the shift as fundamental to payment economics. “Stablecoins could drastically reduce the $225 billion paid in merchant fees by enabling near-zero-cost peer-to-peer settlement, especially at scale. That’s not just a minor improvement; it’s a margin-transforming shift.” Rupena echoed the point, putting the scale of savings into clearer terms. “When you’re processing hundreds of billions in payments, even a 1% savings translates to billions of dollars. Traditional rails are expensive because of intermediaries. Stablecoins settle nearly instantly, at a fraction of the cost.” Zhang acknowledged the efficiency but noted that success will depend heavily on how frictionless the experience is for users. “On Amazon’s volume alone, we’re talking tens of billions in potential annual savings. But the checkout flow needs to prioritize stablecoin payments without friction, otherwise users will default to what’s familiar.” The technical readiness is not in doubt. Instead, the challenges lie in integration, scale, and regulatory coordination. Jeong noted that many of the components already exist, but deploying them across global markets involves much more than plugging in blockchain infrastructure. “They’d need scalable, compliant, and interoperable networks, ideally ones that already support RWAs, subnets, and programmable compliance. The tech exists, but building it at Amazon or Walmart scale requires deep integration and jurisdiction by jurisdiction legal readiness.” Zhang pointed out that some of the most basic expectations of retail finance, such as refunds and chargebacks, still lack clear mechanisms in crypto-based systems. “Refunds, chargebacks, and dispute resolution are all areas that need proper attention before these solutions can scale. Blockchain infrastructure must also be robust enough to handle traffic spikes during peak seasons.” Rupena agreed, adding that even with the right blockchain rails, companies will still need to address operational details like custody, fraud controls, and compliance layers. “These companies would need to build or integrate secure custody solutions, fraud prevention systems, and compliance tools. It’s technically possible today, but the scale and regulatory complexity are what make it difficult.” On adoption, all three experts stressed that success will come from invisibility, not explanation. In other words, consumers don’t need to understand stablecoins to use them. They just need a compelling reason to opt in. Jeong pointed to platform-native integration as the key factor. “Adoption will come when stablecoins are embedded into platforms people already use. That’s where Ant, Amazon, and Walmart have a massive advantage.” Rupena took that further, suggesting that habit formation could happen quickly if the user experience is aligned with existing loyalty programs and everyday payments. “If Amazon gives you a wallet, offers a discount for using it, and ties it to your Prime account, you’ll use it without thinking about what’s under the hood. Same with Walmart. These companies know how to drive user behavior at scale.” Zhang noted that this is exactly where others have struggled. PayPal’s stablecoin launch, for instance, showed that technical rollout alone is not enough. “PayPal’s PYUSD is instructive here. They’ve dangled a 3.7% yield to encourage usage, yet adoption has still been slow. Mainstream consumers need extra incentive to shift habits. That means perks, seamless UX, and zero friction.” As for how this affects incumbents, Jeong argued that if stablecoin rails succeed, they could gradually erode the role of traditional processors. “For Visa and Mastercard, this could be existential. Stablecoin rails remove the need for intermediaries that take a cut of every transaction. Whoever builds the next generation payment layer owns not just the checkout but the monetary operating system behind it.” Zhang agreed that Visa and Mastercard would feel the impact, though he suggested they are unlikely to sit still. “The moment these firms start bypassing Visa and Mastercard, even for a small percentage of their users, the impact will be felt. But Visa is also investing heavily in their own stablecoin rails. It’s going to be a race, one where consumer behavior and integrated incentives will decide the winner.” Compliance, in the end, will likely determine not just if these companies enter the space, but how their stablecoins are structured. Jeong explained that regulatory design will heavily influence architecture from day one. “Any stablecoin from these giants would likely need full reserve backing, real-time transparency, and jurisdictional safeguards, especially in light of the GENIUS Act and upcoming MiCA enforcement.” Zhang described it as a shift from tech-led experimentation to finance-grade accountability. “The GENIUS Act dictates that issuers must hold massive liquid reserves and undergo regular audits. That’s a significant shift, more like operating a bank than a tech firm. The regulatory burden could heavily influence how their stablecoins are structured.” Rupena noted that regulatory volatility is the biggest uncertainty and predicted that these companies would likely begin with conservative, closed-loop models before expanding. “If Walmart or Amazon moves forward, they’ll likely start with a closed ecosystem, full transparency, and strict oversight built in from day one.” Whether these giants move toward full public launches or continue testing internally, the shape of the future is already changing. Payments are no longer controlled solely by banks and card networks. What happens next will depend on how regulators respond, how these platforms execute, and whether users are ready to transact in currencies designed by companies they already trust.",Exclusive|Feature|Amazon|Regulation|Stablecoin|Walmart,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-06-17 17:41:37

In a recent proposal, Hoskinson introduced the idea of a $1 billion Cardano Sovereign Wealth Fund, aimed at accelerating ecosystem development, boosting ADA adoption and reshaping global perceptions of crypto governance. Could this be the move that propels Cardano to the top? Analysts feel that another altcoin is set to play a leading role in 2025 and could become a bigger challenger to Bitcoin than ADA. Cardano Aims To Dethrone Bitcoin's Dominance With Next-Generation Capabilities Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently stated that Cardano offers the most significant threat to Bitcoin, thanks to its next-generation technical structure and governance model. He explained how Cardano's UTXO-based smart contract development and governance on-chain are radical advancements over Bitcoin's more inflexible structure. Source: TradingView Hoskinson believes Bitcoin's plan is something Cardano has already integrated. He contends Cardano doesn't merely take up ""unfinished work"" early Bitcoin developers started but never completed, making ADA a future-proof solution for secure and scalable blockchain transactions. Remittix Investors Have Actual Real World Use While Ada Is Focused On Enhancing Structure Remittix has focused on functional problems in global finance. With a Q3 wallet release, RTX enables users e.g., remote workers or overseas merchants to convert crypto to fiat in under 24 hours. An East African logistics company already uses Remittix to pay European suppliers without waiting for traditional banks. Here, Remittix is a more instant attraction for customers looking for fast and inexpensive transfers. It is for this reason that the majority of early adopters are already thinking of it as a valid XRP alternative with much higher potential. Hoskinson's $1b Fund Can Redefine The Cardano Ecosystem Hoskinson proposed to introduce a $1 billion decentralized sovereign wealth fund to boost Cardano's DeFi and stablecoin sectors. The fund would invest treasury ADA in assets like Bitcoin and stablecoins, encouraging network liquidity while limiting inflation risk. The move echoes Ethereum's adoption of treasury-backed projects. It could also help Cardano make up lost ground in the DeFi domain with networks like Solana, which currently dominate in Total Value Locked and stablecoin activity. Nevertheless, some pundits warn that it could cause market imbalances if poorly tracked. Conclusion: A New Era Of Ecosystem Competition? Both ADA and RTX are two of the biggest aspects of blockchain technology. Cardano is technical prowess and formal regulation, whereas Remittix provides speed and convenience. Hoskinson's 2025 vision also includes BTC integration and privacy tools, but such innovations may not show up in the price of ADA immediately. With its clear use case, strong presale momentum and upcoming product releases, Remittix may offer quicker gains. If you’re looking to back the next breakout crypto, now might be the time to get in early.

UNI’s price broke above crucial resistance. Analysts predict higher prices for Uniswap in the coming months. UNI, the governance token of the Ethereum-based Uniswap decentralized exchange, has maintained a sustained bullish momentum for the first time since the beginning of 2025. The crypto asset has returned seven bullish weekly candles in the past eight weeks, breaking out of a prolonged downward trend and setting up a classic bullish structure. Uniswap bounced off a $4.551 yearly low on April 7 after experiencing one of the steepest declines in the 2025 cryptocurrency market.

Standing prominently among these is Cardano, directed by its visionary leader Charles Hoskinson. His latest proposal for a monumental $1 billion Sovereign Wealth Fund seeks to not just accelerate ADA's adoption but fundamentally alter the ecosystem's dynamics. Cardano's Disruptive Technology and Strategic Moves Unlike Bitcoin, which has primarily focused on stability and security, Cardano aims to revolutionize the blockchain arena through advanced technical frameworks and on-chain governance . These innovations make Cardano a significant contender in the race to redefine the blockchain's future. Charles Hoskinson argues that Cardano's approach is not about picking up where Bitcoin left but about pushing the boundaries of what blockchain technology can achieve. The Vision for a $1 Billion Sovereign Wealth Fund Hoskinson's ambitious strategy includes the creation of a decentralized fund as detailed in his recent Cardano treasury conversion proposal . This fund aims to invest in a mix of assets to foster network liquidity and curb inflation, drawing parallels with strategies employed by massive networks like Ethereum. Real-World Applications and Market Dynamics While Cardano focuses on infrastructural evolution, other cryptocurrencies like Remittix are carving niches by solving practical financial dilemmas. Remittix offers rapid conversion between crypto and fiat, appealing to users needing efficient, economical international transactions. Such dual paths highlight the diverse approaches within the crypto industry, where some entities like Remittix directly address user needs, whereas others like Cardano innovate at a foundational level. Future Prospects and Industry Positioning In the fast-evolving crypto world, the future lies in both technological innovation and practical utility. Cardano, with its robust technological advancements and strategic initiatives such as Hoskinson's 2025 vision , alongside practical solutions offered by platforms like Remittix, reveal the multifaceted nature of blockchain advancements.

BlackRock became the leader in issuing tokenized securities based on money markets. RWA projects increased their value under management by 300% year-on-year. The RWA market extended its gains from May, reaching another all-time high . Tokenized securities that use public chains are one of the gradually expanding sectors, led by BlackRock and other financial giants making their forays into crypto. Ondo Finance and Ethena Labs also participate with a significant share of tokenized securities, this time originating from crypto-native projects. The value under management in RWA projects climbed to an all-time high of $12.51B, rivaling some of the top DeFi protocols. The accrued value has multiple use cases within the crypto and DeFi ecosystem, multiplying the effect of inflows. In June 2024, TVL locked with tokenized securities projects was just around $3.72B, with some outflows linked to the market correction. Tokenized US treasury debt rose from $1.77B in June 2024 to more than $7.1B currently. In the past year, BlackRock’s BUIDL token was the main source of tokenized securities with a sufficiently high reputation. The BUIDL token was used in several protocols, serving as collateral for lending and other reserves. Ondo remains one of the leaders in creating tokenized assets, along with BlackRock as the issuer of BUIDL tokens on Ethereum. | Source: Dune Analytics BUIDL now expanded to 49 holders , spreading within the crypto ecosystem. The supply remains under 500K tokens, created after on-demand issuance from specific known protocols. BUIDL is still not circulating like a regular token, as there are no rules on trading RWA on the open market. Based on the latest data, tokenized RWA products are used in lending, securing over $648M in DeFi loans . Currently, RWA is still testing out its use cases and working out a standard. Recently, Coinbase applied with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer tokenized stocks and other assets. Other exchanges and DEX offer RWA with no permission and no clear reporting and transparency requirements. RWA tokens mostly tap debt The profile of RWA tokens shows most of the mints are linked to debt instruments for their predictable passive income. Tokenization has not delivered the promised expansion of multiple types of assets or alternative investments, including stocks, real estate, or commodities. Currently, tokenized private debt and US T-bills are the main basis of value for issuing tokens. Ethereum remains the busiest chain for RWA transfers and some decentralized activity. The one big exception is tokenized gold, where Tether is the monopolist with XAUt. However, most of the DeFi and lending activity is linked to short-term US Government debt. RWA tokens are also found in over 206K wallets in 2025, double the number of holders from 2024. A total of 533,606 addresses interacted with RWA tokens in some capacity to date. Despite the asset growth, RWA tokens have been sliding for the past year. RWA tokens are valued at a total $36B, with drops over 15% in the past week. The selection of tokens includes leaders like Chainlink (LINK) and Ondo (Ondo), following the crash of the Movement (MOVE) project. RWA narrative tokens still have on average 28% returns since 2023.

But while the big names inch forward, one under-the-radar altcoin is quietly preparing for a breakout of its own. Remittix(RTX) , a real-world crypto-to-fiat solution, is gaining rapid investor attention, and here’s why. Solana Dips Into Key Zone As Bulls Prepare For Next Move Solana is setting up for what many believe could be its next major leap. Despite recent price dips, SOL has quietly returned to a key demand zone between $144 and $145 a level that has triggered rallies in past cycles. As the wider market has started trading on the edge of optimism after the bearish fatigue, Solana is once again on the radar of the bulls. Traders are zooming in on its Relative Strength Index, which now sits in oversold territory, a classic signal for a coming reversal. At the time of writing, SOL trades at $145.05, with a massive $6.13 billion in daily volume and a $76.27 billion market cap. Yes, it’s down about 8.7% in 24 hours and 4.15% for the week. Source: X One top analyst even pointed out how this exact $145 region has historically served as a launchpad for triple-digit runs. If momentum returns and Solana breaks past its near-term resistance, it could easily lead the charge in a broader altcoin breakout. New Utility Partnerships Set XRP Up for Long-Term Growth XRP price may be facing short-term resistance, but under the surface, something bigger could be brewing. After multiple failed attempts to push past $2.33, the price dipped just 3%. Yet behind the scenes, whales are playing a different game. A massive $151 million transfer out of Binance signals potential accumulation from deep-pocketed investors, possibly preparing for the next leg up. There’s also growing chatter around macro tailwinds, lower interest rates, and increased liquidity. The long-term projections are far from modest. Some analysts are eyeing $73 as a realistic top XRP price, especially if tokenomics improve and key partnerships start to deliver. One such partnership is with Flare, whose integration could turn XRP into more than just a payment token. Early Investors See Remittix As The Real Utility Play While Solana and XRP continue to tease massive moves, another contender is already winning over sharp investors, Remittix (RTX) . This Ethereum-based altcoin is delivering real financial utility by turning crypto into spendable fiat in minutes. What’s making waves is Remittix’s wallet drop, expected in Q3, built for both everyday users and businesses. This will offer passive income through transaction cost sharing and applies token burns to every transaction. The numbers speak: over $15.7 million raised in presale and more than 544 million tokens sold at just $0.0781, with a 50% bonus currently live. As the team eyes an $18M soft cap, analysts now suggest that RTX could surge by 5,000% or more once it hits exchanges, especially if it captures even a slice of the $190 trillion remittance market. It’s no surprise many long-term holders of XRP and SOL are rotating into Remittix.

This analysis delves into the specifics of their market movements and contrasts their potential with that of a rising star in the altcoin space, Remittix (RTX) . Market Dynamics and Technical Indicators Favoring Solana Solana has recently re-entered a critical price zone, historically known for sparking substantial price rallies. Despite a recent drop to around $145, this zone has previously catalyzed significant bullish runs. Currently, with a market cap nearing $76.27 billion and daily trading volumes reaching $6.13 billion, Solana is in a prime position for a reversal, especially as its Relative Strength Index suggests an oversold condition. XRP: Set for a Breakthrough with Strategic Partnerships XRP, while experiencing immediate resistance near $2.33, is quietly setting the stage for substantial long-term growth. This is driven by significant transactions amongst major players, including a noteworthy $151 million transfer, suggesting accumulation phases that might precede a price surge. Analysts are optimistic, with some forecasting a potential rise to $73, contingent on improved tokenomics and successful partnerships, like the one with Flare, which could expand XRP's utility beyond mere transactional capabilities. The Ascendancy of Remittix: A Crypto-to-Fiat Innovator In the shadow of giants like Solana and XRP, Remittix is paving its path with a unique value proposition. This Ethereum-based platform is designed to convert crypto into fiat swiftly, positioning itself as a pivotal player in the PayFi sector. The upcoming wallet feature, expected to launch in Q3, aims to revolutionize the market by enabling transaction cost sharing and implementing token burns with every transaction, enhancing both utility and demand. Fueled by over $15.7 million in presales and backed by more than 544 million tokens sold, Remittix is on track for an explosive growth, potentially up to 5,000%, especially as it gears up to tap into the $190 trillion remittance market.

Speaking to Reuters, Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal confirmed that the company has filed with the SEC to offer “tokenized shares” to its customers. The move would put Coinbase in direct competition with retail investment platforms like Robinhood and Charles Schwab, and it could also open up an entirely new line of business for the company. Tokenized stocks are created by converting traditional company shares into digital tokens. Investors do not own shares directly, but rather the tokens representing those shares. Advocates argue that this model could reduce transaction costs, make transactions instantaneous and enable 24/7 trading. Related News: BREAKING: Major Airdrop and Token Launch Announcement Released - Could Heat Up Competition But critics say there are significant challenges that need to be addressed before such digital assets become widespread. The World Economic Forum highlighted hurdles such as a lack of liquidity in secondary markets and a lack of global standards in a report last month. Tokenized stocks are not currently legally tradeable in the U.S., but some crypto companies have begun experimenting in this area. Last month, rival exchange Kraken announced tokenized versions of U.S. stocks it calls “xStocks,” which will be offered in select countries. In order for Coinbase to offer this service in the U.S., it would need to either obtain a “no-action letter” from the SEC or obtain certain exemptions. Such letters provide assurance that the SEC will not take enforcement action against a particular practice. Coinbase is not currently registered as a securities broker.

The site, developed with BlueFlare Energy, marks the company’s first operational milestone in a broader strategy to turn off-grid natural gas into energy-backed digital infrastructure. The Berwyn facility currently draws 425 kW and delivers more than 32 petahashes per second (PH/s) of compute power. A second phase under development will expand capacity by another 200 kW. BlueFlare’s systems monitor emissions and provide real-time telemetry through its proprietary OS and carbon tracking tech. The use of flared gas to mine bitcoin is one way miners are looking to use a cheaper source of energy to offset some of the margin squeeze hurting the industry. For several years, flared gas bitcoin mining has been a trend for miners to monetize otherwise wasted excess natural gas produced when oil and gas companies drill for fossil fuels.

That approach gained traction with a new binding agreement between AgriFORCE and BlueFlare to expand operations to two additional Alberta sites, in Oyen and Hinton. Combined, these deployments could add 1.3 MW of natural-gas-powered compute, supporting tasks beyond bitcoin mining — such as AI model inference and edge computing for industrial devices. The model AgriFORCE is pursuing sidesteps grid dependencies by tapping unused energy reserves and bringing them online quickly. The company says it has already mined seven BTC across its Alberta and Ohio sites and plans to retain up to half of its bitcoin holdings while using the rest for operational expansion. AgriFORCE aims to scale to 1 exahash per second (EH/s) of compute capacity by Q1 2026, positioning itself as a player in the intersection of energy markets and decentralized infrastructure.",Markets|Bitcoin Mining|Canada|News,EN,0,0,BTC|COMMODITY|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-17 17:50:25

These digital currencies, pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, offer a bridge between the volatility of traditional cryptocurrencies and the stability required for everyday transactions. Yet, despite their promise, using stablecoins for payments often faces hurdles. This is where a new player, Ubyx , steps in, aiming to tackle a critical challenge: stablecoin interoperability. This ambitious blockchain startup recently announced a significant step forward, raising substantial seed funding to build a network designed to make crypto payments smoother and more accessible globally. What Problem is Ubyx Trying to Solve with Stablecoin Interoperability? Imagine you want to send a payment using one type of stablecoin, but the recipient’s platform only accepts a different one. Or perhaps you want to integrate stablecoin payments into your business, but connecting to various stablecoin networks and traditional financial systems is complex and costly. This lack of seamless connection is the core issue Ubyx is addressing. The current stablecoin landscape is somewhat fragmented: Multiple stablecoins exist (USDT, USDC, DAI, etc.), often on different blockchains. Integrating stablecoins with traditional banks and fintech applications is not standardized. Cross-border payments using stablecoins can still involve friction and intermediaries. Ubyx believes that true widespread adoption of stablecoins for payments hinges on solving this interoperability puzzle. They envision a world where stablecoins can flow easily between different networks and financial institutions, much like traditional currencies move between banks today. How Does Ubyx Plan to Build This Interoperability Network? According to reports, Ubyx plans to build a ‘global clearing system’. This isn’t just a simple bridge between two blockchains; it’s a more comprehensive network designed to connect the key players in the stablecoin ecosystem: Stablecoin Issuers: The entities that create and manage stablecoins. Banks: Traditional financial institutions that hold customer funds and handle settlements. Fintechs: Innovative financial technology companies building payment apps and services. By creating a standardized layer or network connecting these participants, Ubyx aims to facilitate easier clearing and settlement of transactions involving various stablecoins. This could significantly reduce the complexity and cost associated with using stablecoins for payments, whether for individuals or businesses. Think of it like the underlying infrastructure that allows you to use your debit card at different stores and ATMs, regardless of which bank issued the card. Ubyx is aiming to build a similar foundational layer for the stablecoin economy. Who is Backing This Blockchain Startup’s Vision? The recent funding round highlights significant confidence in Ubyx’s approach. The startup successfully raised $10 million in a seed round. This level of early-stage funding is substantial and signals strong investor belief in the team and their proposed solution. The round was led by Galaxy Ventures , the venture capital arm of Galaxy Digital, a prominent player in the crypto and blockchain space. Their leadership indicates a strategic investment aligned with the broader growth of the digital asset ecosystem. Equally noteworthy is the participation of other high-profile investors: Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund: Known for early investments in transformative technology companies. Coinbase Ventures: The investment arm of one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, showing interest in infrastructure that could boost crypto usage. Paxos: A regulated blockchain infrastructure company and stablecoin issuer itself, bringing direct industry expertise. VanEck: A global investment manager with a growing focus on digital assets and blockchain technology. The presence of these diverse and influential investors — from traditional VC and crypto-native firms to stablecoin issuers and asset managers — underscores the perceived importance of solving stablecoin interoperability for the future of finance. What are the Potential Benefits of Improved Stablecoin Payments? If Ubyx’s initiative is successful, the impact on crypto payments could be significant: Reduced Friction: Easier movement of stablecoins between different platforms and systems. Lower Costs: Potentially fewer intermediaries and fees involved in stablecoin transactions. Increased Adoption: Making stablecoins simpler to use could encourage more businesses and individuals to accept and use them for everyday transactions. Faster Settlements: Blockchain technology inherently offers faster settlement times compared to traditional systems, a benefit enhanced by better interoperability. Innovation: A robust interoperability layer could spur the development of new financial products and services built on stablecoins. For businesses, this could mean easier integration of stablecoin payment options. For individuals, it could simplify sending money globally or making purchases using digital currencies without worrying about which specific stablecoin is required by the recipient. Are There Challenges for Ubyx and Stablecoin Interoperability? While the vision is compelling, building a global clearing system for stablecoins is no small feat. Ubyx will likely face several challenges: Regulatory Landscape: Navigating different regulations across various jurisdictions regarding stablecoins and payment systems will be complex. Adoption by Institutions: Gaining widespread buy-in and integration from traditional banks and large fintechs requires trust, compliance, and significant technical work. Competition: Other projects and companies are also working on improving crypto payment infrastructure and interoperability. Technical Execution: Building a secure, scalable, and reliable network capable of handling global transaction volumes is a significant technical challenge. Network Effects: The value of a clearing network increases with the number of participants. Ubyx needs to attract a critical mass of issuers, banks, and fintechs. Overcoming these hurdles will be key to Ubyx’s success in making stablecoin interoperability a reality. What’s Next for This Ambitious Blockchain Startup? With the $10 million in seed funding secured, Ubyx is now poised to accelerate the development of its network. The focus will likely be on building out the core technology, establishing partnerships with stablecoin issuers, banks, and fintech companies, and navigating the necessary regulatory pathways. The success of Ubyx could serve as a significant catalyst for the broader adoption of crypto payments . By reducing the technical and operational friction associated with stablecoins, they could help unlock the potential of digital currencies for everyday commerce and global remittances. It’s an exciting development in the ongoing evolution of finance, watching a blockchain startup like Ubyx tackle fundamental infrastructure challenges to pave the way for a more connected and efficient digital economy. Summary: Ubyx’s $10M Boost for Stablecoin Payments In conclusion, Ubyx’s successful $10 million seed funding round, backed by major players like Galaxy Ventures, Founders Fund, Coinbase Ventures, Paxos, and VanEck, represents a significant investment in the future of stablecoin interoperability. The company’s plan to build a global clearing system connecting stablecoin issuers with banks and fintechs aims to streamline crypto payments , reduce friction, and accelerate the adoption of digital currencies for everyday use. While challenges remain, the strong financial backing and the clear focus on solving a critical infrastructure problem position Ubyx as a key player to watch in the evolving landscape of digital finance and blockchain technology.

Some of the key factors contributing to this surge include Solana’s broader ecosystem and developer engagement, thanks to the network’s high speed and ultra-low fees to the tune of $0.02. Solana is also known to experience a beehive of meme-coin activity, contributing to its high monthly usage. Solana Remains Locked in a Consolidated Market According to market analyst Crypto Joe, “SOL has been chopping in a sideways range for over a year — bouncing between Fib levels and shaking out the weak hands. $140 remains the key level to hold for any real continuation upward.” Source: Crypto Joe The analyst added that Solana’s ranging market is not a sign of giving up because the one-year sideways grind is a volatile base-building phase. At the time of this writing, Solana was hovering around the $146 zone, and the altcoin’s consolidation between the $140 and $160 zones was intensifying. As previously reported by ZyCrypto, popular crypto analyst AltcoinGordon recently opined that the next leg up for Solana would be violent to the extent of surpassing Bitcoin’s recent all-time high (ATH) move.

The crypto industry has always had revolutionary roots. It emerged in 2008 with the Bitcoin whitepaper, a direct response to the financial crisis that decimated livelihoods while protecting a systemically flawed, corrupt banking system. Bitcoin wasn’t just a technical innovation—it was a political and ideological statement. A signal that builders and thinkers were ready to challenge the status quo with tools, not just words. As someone who’s worked in crypto for years, I should be celebrating. Today, decentralized technologies are no longer on the fringe. Fintechs are adopting stablecoins. Bitcoin ETFs are trading on traditional exchanges. The average person has heard of blockchain. From Capitol Hill to Davos, crypto is no longer being laughed out of the room. But despite this surface-level “legitimacy,” I can’t help but feel that something essential is lost. The ethos of crypto—the cypherpunk values that got us here—is being diluted, co-opted, and in some cases, directly betrayed. The Cypherpunk movement’s core belief is that technology can and should be used to rebalance power—away from overreaching governments and monopolistic corporations, and toward individuals. Peer-to-peer networks, end-to-end encryption, censorship-resistant platforms—these aren’t buzzwords; they’re commitments to improve our society. Stripe acquiring crypto infrastructure startups? Great, but it doesn’t create legitimacy in the crypto industry. That’s a survival move by big fintech to stay relevant and improve their product offering. Circle going public is a corporate milestone, not a validation of crypto’s principles. A Bitcoin ETF may bring liquidity, but it doesn’t bring ideological alignment. These fintech brands aren’t leading a movement—they’re reacting to it. They’re trying to keep pace with the crypto-native upstarts that are quickly rendering their legacy models obsolete. Let’s not confuse acquisition with validation. Just because the suits are now interested in the tools we’ve built doesn’t mean they understand, respect, or intend to preserve the reasons those tools exist. Crypto wasn’t supposed to be another tool in the hands of the state. It is supposed to be the counterweight. So it's understandable that the recent uptick in political engagement and clearer regulatory frameworks—like the GENIUS Act —feels like progress. Applications like Coinbase and Polymarket are gaining household recognition. President Biden’s successor has even extended an olive branch to the industry. But somewhere along the way, many of us seem to have lost the plot. A glaring example? Coinbase’s recent sponsorship of a military parade affiliated with President Trump. This isn’t a partisan critique. It’s a principled one. Coinbase’s mission statement emphasizes that political causes are a “distraction from our mission.” Yet, in practice, the company has repeatedly aligned itself with political events—from sponsoring presidential inauguration funds to courting political favor with expedited hiring of ex-DOGE staffers. CEO Brian Armstrong’s recent solicitation of former DOGE employees is quite poignant: “If you are looking for your next mission after serving your country, consider helping create a more efficient financial system for the world at Coinbase.” That framing—tying Coinbase’s mission to the state—epitomizes the creeping fusion between crypto’s stewards and the very power structures we were meant to counterbalance. Yes, Coinbase is a publicly-traded company. Yes, it operates in a jurisdiction governed by laws and politics. But being compliant does not mean being co-opted. Sponsoring political events, aligning with political figures, and turning a profit from proximity to power undermines the ethical foundation of decentralized technology. And Coinbase is not alone. Crypto-funded super PACs are pouring money into elections at every level. Ripple is now a lobbying juggernaut in D.C. We’re still reckoning with the staggering corruption that was FTX—where political donations and influence-peddling were tools of manipulation, not participation. This is not a slippery slope. We’re already sliding. Cypherpunkism is more than an aesthetic or an ideology. It’s a commitment to building systems that make centralized power obsolete—not tolerated or negotiated with, but irrelevant. It’s about building tools that empower individuals, preserve privacy, and promote a more open and resilient society. Crypto founders, investors, and institutions need to revisit these roots. Blockchain’s purpose isn’t to replicate traditional systems with shinier branding at politicized military gatherings—it’s to fundamentally alter how those systems work. To create a future where financial freedom, privacy, and open access are not privileges, but defaults. Yes, we must engage with regulators. Yes, we must work within legal frameworks. But that is a far cry from becoming their cheerleaders. There’s a difference between navigating the system and being consumed by it. There’s a difference between playing the game and forgetting why you joined it in the first place. We owe it to the movement—and to ourselves—to remember why crypto exists. Not to appease governments, but to hold them accountable. Not to win political favor, but to render such favor unnecessary. Not to build brands, but to build freedom. The real cypherpunks are still out there. But it’s time we make our voices heard again.",Opinion|Opinion,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-17 17:54:50

Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the next-generation meme coin built for laughs and legendary gains. While XRP braces for a potential 300% surge and DOGE anticipates its next surge, LILPEPE is poised to unleash a meme explosion with substantial potential. If you’re watching the charts, it’s time to zoom in on the real underdog. Ripple (XRP): The Institutional Darling Prepares for a Breakout Ripple (XRP) has consistently garnered attention and is currently positioning itself for further gains. Technical projections aiming for $8, along with the increasing pace of significant institutional adoption , are reawakening XRP bulls. The long-awaited resolution of Ripple’s battle with the SEC could serve as a catalyst, unlocking sidelined capital and legitimizing the asset on a global scale. According to analysts at Bitget, if XRP breaks above its current resistance around $3, a push toward $8 or even $8.40 becomes plausible. Impressive? Sure. But this kind of move—roughly a 300% gain—might be just a warm-up compared to what’s brewing in the meme trenches. institutional adoption Dogecoin (DOGE): Still the King of Memes? DOGE remains resilient. Despite numerous “is it dead?” moments, the Shiba-powered meme coin continues to push forward. Whales recently scooped up over 1 billion DOGE , showing confidence as DOGE bounces off support at $0.21. Technical levels suggest that a breakout above $0.202 could spark a run to $0.30 and beyond, particularly as long-term holders accumulate their positions. However, DOGE faces serious competition with stronger technology, faster chains, and actual utility in the meme coin world. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Next Meme King on a Mission LILPEPE isn’t here to play games—it’s here to take the meme crown and bring a full-blown Layer-2 blockchain with it. That’s right: LILPEPE is the first meme coin with its ultra-fast, ultra-cheap Layer-2 network built just for memes. Let that sink in. While XRP and DOGE continue to follow traditional routes, LILPEPE is paving a new path. Here’s why you want to APE in before the rest of the market catches up: Presale Price: $0.0011 Listing Price: $0.003 Projected 2025 Price: $0.19 Potential ROI from Current Price: 172x The presale is currently in Stage 2, with over $784,070 raised . Stage 2 is already 60.66% filled, and once it hits 100%, the price jumps to $0.0012. Early investors from Stage 1 are already sitting on a 10% gain. Now imagine what happens when LILPEPE lists on 2 top centralized exchanges and aims for the biggest exchange in the world. The growth potential is incredibly promising. What Makes $LILPEPE Different? Meme coins typically thrive or falter based on hype. This one is an exception. LILPEPE is Built on Ethereum (ERC-20) for accessibility Creating a dedicated Layer-2 chain just for memes Immune to sniper bots—a significant win for real investors Offering a memes-only Launchpad, opening up meme projects to a broader audience Backed by anonymous experts who have supported some of the biggest meme coins in history Designed with zero transaction tax—more profit, less friction Here’s the exciting part: $LILPEPE has a total supply of 100,000,000,000, with a large chunk allocated to the presale.

The world premiere of this first EV was scheduled for spring 2025, with initial customer deliveries expected in October 2026. Two sources who refused to be named due to the matter’s sensitivity claimed that the Maranello, Italy-based company delayed the plan for a second Ferrari EV twice. They mentioned that there was initially a one-year postponement, but the model will launch in 2028 at the earliest, adding that demand for high performance in the luxury EV sector was currently zero. One of the sources pointed out that although the lack of market interest remained a major problem, the delay would provide Ferrari additional time to further develop in-house technology for its second electric vehicle. The second source said the second EV model aligned more with the company’s strategy of delivering around 5,000 to 6,000 units over a five-year lifespan for a typical Ferrari model. Vigna says Ferrari will only show the ‘technological heart’ of its electric car Ferrari's pivot to electric is a classic case of chasing a trend without understanding the market's pulse. Low demand for high-performance luxury EVs? That’s a red flag. The elite want exclusivity, not just a shiny battery pack. Keep an eye on their execution. https://t.co/ijGrpBSlQC — 007ofWallST (@007ofWallSt) June 17, 2025 Vigna recently said Ferrari would only show its electric car’s “technological heart” in October as part of a three-stage unveiling process. However, an analyst who declined to be named said it sounded like there was some delay to Ferrari’s launch plan, as one could have expected to see the car itself at the meeting. Vigna also stressed that his company would continue to “enrich” its products, as Ferrari unveiled the 296 Speciale plug-in hybrid model and its convertible version in May. Internally, Ferrari’s second electric car was reportedly seen as the “real game changer” for its EV strategy. At the same time, the first car was more of a low-volume, symbolic milestone model that would meet its promise to launch its first EV in 2026. Ferrari’s first EV, which was co-designed by former Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive, will allegedly cost over $500K. One of the anonymous sources described it as an atypical model for Ferrari, saying it would be larger than usual, but it would not be an SUV. Ferrari’s Chief Executive Benedetto Vigna mentioned in February that the much anticipated first EV, a departure from its roaring petrol engines, would be presented at the company’s capital market day on October 9. Ferrari disclosed plans to continue offering petrol, hybrid cars, and EVs. Hybrid models, which it started to sell in 2019, made up 51% of Ferrari’s car sales last year. Aston Martin pushes back its first electric car from 2025 to 2026 Aston Martin also pushed back its first electric car from 2025 to 2026 due to low consumer demand. The company’s Chairman, Lawrence Stroll, said it was scheduled to launch a high-riding, four-wheel-drive electric GT in 2025, but consumer demand was not what it was when the plans were first outlined. He, however, confirmed that Aston Martin had designed four EVs but stopped short of confirming whether they were envisioned as direct replacements for the current line-up, which comprised three front-engined sports cars and the DBX SUV. The Aston Martin team said it will continue to use plug-in hybrid powertrains as a “bridging” technology for its customers as the company transitioned from pure-ICE to a pure-EV line-up. The British brand’s first PHEV was the mid-engined Valhalla supercar, which was scheduled for launch in the final quarter of 2024 with an electrified V8 arrangement supplied by Mercedes-AMG. Ineos founder Sir Jim Ratcliffe said consumers should have a choice, adding that automakers could not force them and that, at the moment, they were “voting with their feet” not buying high-end EVs. He recognized that not all consumers wanted luxury EVs but acknowledged that there was surely a use case for them. Lamborghini also said it would postpone the launch of its first electric model to 2029 instead of 2028, and Germany’s Porsche cut back its plans for EVs amid soft sales of its electric Macan SUV and Taycan models. Earlier this year, Maserati canceled plans for an electric version of its MC20 sports car.

This increase follows an impressive 500% rise, hinting at a growing interest from the institutional sector and heightened adoption for cross-border transactions. The market cap for XRP now stands robust at $127.98 billion, although there has been a 44.53% decline in daily trading volume, which now amounts to $2.45 billion. Emergence of Remittix: A New Challenger in the Crypto Payment Arena New platforms are constantly emerging in the crypto world, aiming to bridge the gap between digital and fiat currencies swiftly and seamlessly. Among these, Remittix , with its innovative crypto-to-fiat solutions, has started to make headlines. The Impressive Journey of XRP and the Rising Star: Remittix Even though XRP has cemented itself as a reliable asset for cross-border payments, the financial technology landscape is never static. Here, Remittix emerges with a promise to offer faster and cheaper transaction capabilities, directly challenging XRP's current market position. The trading price of Remittix stands at $0.0781, inclusive of a 50% token incentive for early backers, signaling a potent entry into the $190 trillion global payment sector. Project Highlights and Investor Opportunities Noteworthy is Remittix's approach to reducing transaction friction by enabling direct crypto-to-fiat exchanges that are completed within minutes.

With over 544 million tokens already sold and $15.6 million raised, approaching its $18 million softcap soon, Remittix is captivating investors' attention. Futuristic Outlook: XRP Stability and Remittix's Market Potential While XRP maintains a stable trading atmosphere, the innovative features of Remittix are drawing interest from traders who once relied on XRP's growth. The potential for Remittix to supplement or even replace slower networks in certain scenarios is being closely monitored by market experts.

This comes after a staggering 500% jump that caught people by surprise. With XRP's market cap being $127.98 billion and daily trading volume dropping 44.53% to $2.45 billion, experienced traders now have their eye on another new payment token with great potential. Apart from XRP, newer platforms such as Remittix are toiling behind the scenes to close the gap, with even faster crypto-to-fiat features. XRP Price Prediction: What's Propelling The Next Step? The previous 500% price surge in XRP surprised the majority of the crypto community. This is due to increasing adoption in cross-border transactions and increased institutional interest. However, volumes have dissipated, indicating a period of consolidation. The current XRP price of $2.17 is one of optimism with caution. There are people who believe that the rally can continue if XRP breaks significant resistance levels. Others prefer more decisive signs that XRP will be able to keep going on an upward trend. Veteran Trader Sees Remittix as Next Big Payment Token After a successful XRP's massive price rally forecast, one leading trader has been monitoring Remittix , a firm that is changing global payments. Unlike XRP, Remittix offers an unbroken crypto-to-fiat portal that enables users to send digital currencies to regular bank accounts in just minutes. Remittix's recent wallet reveal and near Q3 release have caught the attention of investors. With over 544 million tokens sold and raising $15.6 million+, RTX is getting close to reaching its $18 million softcap. The present price of $0.0781 includes a 50% token incentive, attracting early supporters who see Remittix as a more viable solution within the $190 trillion global payments sector. How Remittix Could Shape XRP's Future While XRP has established a niche in cross-border payment, Remittix's cheaper and faster real-world use presents a formidable alternative. Immediate crypto-fiat conversion by the project reduces friction and enhances usability. Experts note that as Remittix picks up traction, it could supplement the function of XRP or potentially capture market share from slower networks. For those tracking the XRP price forecast, this new contender is something to track. XRP Holds Steady, But Remittix Emerges as a Top Crypto to Watch in 2025 The XRP price prediction remains positive but tempered by trends in market volume. Experienced traders who built their fortunes from XRP's runaway increase are diversifying, eyeing promising tokens such as Remittix that offer real-world applications. With Q3 pending for Remittix wallet release and a strong funding campaign underway, RTX is among the most promising payment tokens in 2025. Investors must watch out for both XRP and Remittix as the cryptocurrency payments space unfolds.

Following the latest Bank of Japan (BoJ) policy decision, a major player in the financial sector, UBS, has reiterated its medium-term bearish stance on the USD JPY forecast . This perspective carries weight, prompting investors and traders to re-evaluate their positions and consider the potential implications for the broader market, including how macro trends influence asset classes like cryptocurrencies. What Prompted This UBS Forecast? UBS’s maintained bearish view isn’t a sudden shift but rather a reinforcement of their existing perspective, significantly influenced by the recent BoJ decision . The Bank of Japan’s policy meetings are closely watched events, often dictating the trajectory of the Japanese Yen. While market speculation often surrounds potential changes, the BoJ’s communication and actions provide the fundamental basis for expert analysis like that offered by UBS. Key factors contributing to UBS’s outlook likely include: Policy Divergence: Despite minor adjustments or signals, the fundamental difference in monetary policy between the BoJ and other major central banks (like the US Federal Reserve) remains a critical driver. While others have hiked rates aggressively, the BoJ has maintained a significantly looser stance, though recent moves hint at potential future shifts. Inflation Dynamics: The BoJ’s response to inflation, or lack thereof compared to peers, plays a vital role. UBS’s view suggests they believe the current policy path, shaped by the latest BoJ decision , will continue to weigh on the Yen relative to the Dollar in the medium term. Economic Outlook: Differing economic growth trajectories and outlooks between the US and Japan also feed into currency valuations. UBS’s analysis incorporates these macro factors when formulating their UBS forecast . Breaking Down the Latest BoJ Decision Understanding the specifics of the most recent BoJ decision is crucial for grasping UBS’s perspective. Central bank meetings involve evaluating economic data, assessing inflation risks, and deciding on interest rates and asset purchase programs. Market reactions often hinge on whether the decision meets, exceeds, or falls short of expectations, as well as the language used in the official statements and subsequent press conferences. Typically, a BoJ decision involves: Reviewing the current economic situation and price developments. Deciding on the policy interest rate (often negative in Japan). Setting targets for long-term government bond yields (Yield Curve Control). Providing forward guidance on the future path of monetary policy. UBS’s bearish stance indicates their interpretation of the latest decision suggests no immediate, significant catalyst for a sustained Yen appreciation against the Dollar in the medium term. They likely see the pace of any policy normalization as too slow or the policy divergence as still too wide. Why a Bearish Japanese Yen Outlook Matters A bearish Japanese Yen outlook has far-reaching implications beyond just currency traders. Japan is a major global economy and a significant player in international trade and finance. A weaker Yen affects: Japanese Exports: A weaker Yen makes Japanese goods cheaper for foreign buyers, potentially boosting exports. Japanese Imports: Conversely, imports become more expensive, impacting domestic consumers and businesses reliant on foreign goods. Global Carry Trade: The Yen has historically been used in ‘carry trade’ strategies due to low interest rates. A sustained weak Yen environment can influence global capital flows. Investment Flows: International investors evaluate the Yen’s strength when considering investments in Japanese assets (stocks, bonds) and vice versa for Japanese investors looking abroad. For those tracking global financial stability and market sentiment, the Japanese Yen outlook is a key piece of the puzzle. Exploring the USD JPY Forecast Factors Predicting currency movements is complex, involving numerous interconnected factors. The USD JPY forecast is influenced by a blend of economic indicators, central bank policies, market sentiment, and global events. UBS’s bearish view highlights specific elements they believe will dominate the pair’s movement. Consider these influencing factors: Factor Influence on USD/JPY (General) UBS’s Potential Interpretation Interest Rate Differentials (US vs. Japan) Higher US rates typically support USD vs JPY Differential remains significant, supporting USD strength medium-term. Inflation Data (US & Japan) Higher US inflation/lower Japan inflation supports USD vs JPY US inflation persists, Japan’s remains moderate, reinforcing policy divergence. Economic Growth (US & Japan) Stronger US growth vs. Japan supports USD vs JPY Relative growth dynamics favor USD in the medium term. Central Bank Communication (Fed & BoJ) Hawkish Fed / Dovish BoJ supports USD vs JPY BoJ language post-decision not hawkish enough to offset Fed stance medium-term. Global Risk Sentiment ‘Risk-off’ often supports JPY (safe haven), ‘Risk-on’ supports USD or other currencies Medium-term view less dependent on short-term sentiment swings, focuses on fundamentals. UBS’s Forex analysis synthesizes these factors to arrive at their conclusion. They likely see the enduring impact of interest rate differentials and the pace of monetary policy normalization as the primary drivers keeping them bearish on the pair over the coming months. Challenges to the UBS Forecast No forecast is without potential challenges or risks. While UBS maintains a bearish stance, several developments could potentially alter the trajectory of the USD JPY forecast : Faster BoJ Policy Shift: If the BoJ were to accelerate the pace of policy normalization (e.g., ending negative rates sooner, adjusting yield control more aggressively) in response to unexpected inflation spikes or economic strength, it could significantly strengthen the Yen. US Economic Slowdown: A more rapid or severe economic slowdown in the United States could lead the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates sooner or more aggressively than currently anticipated, narrowing the rate differential and weakening the Dollar against the Yen. Major Global Events: Geopolitical shocks or unforeseen global crises can trigger significant shifts in currency markets as investors seek safe-haven assets. The Yen is often considered a safe haven, though its role can vary depending on the nature of the crisis. Market Positioning: Extreme market positioning (too many traders heavily short or long the pair) can sometimes lead to sharp, counter-trend movements if positions are unwound rapidly. UBS’s Forex analysis would need to adapt if any of these factors materialized in a significant way. Investors should be aware of these potential headwinds to the bearish view. Actionable Insights from Forex Analysis What does this Forex analysis from UBS mean for market participants? While this is not financial advice, understanding institutional views provides valuable context: Monitor Central Banks: Keep a close eye on communications from both the BoJ and the US Federal Reserve. Any hints of policy shifts are critical. Track Economic Data: Pay attention to key economic releases from Japan and the US, such as inflation reports, GDP growth, and employment figures. Consider Time Horizon: UBS specifies a ‘medium-term’ view. Short-term fluctuations can still occur due to daily news flow or market sentiment. Risk Management: Any trading or investment decision based on a forecast like this requires careful risk management, including setting stop-losses and position sizing. A bearish USD JPY forecast from a major institution like UBS serves as a signal for market participants to refine their strategies and remain vigilant regarding incoming economic data and central bank commentary. Conclusion: Navigating the Japanese Yen Outlook UBS’s decision to maintain a medium-term bearish view on USD/JPY following the latest BoJ decision underscores the persistent influence of monetary policy divergence and economic fundamentals on this key currency pair. Their UBS forecast , rooted in detailed Forex analysis , points towards continued challenges for the Japanese Yen outlook against the US Dollar in the coming months. While potential risks and counter-arguments exist, the institution’s stance provides a clear perspective for investors navigating the complexities of the Forex market. Staying informed about central bank actions, economic indicators, and expert analysis is paramount for making informed decisions in this environment.

With over 60M users currently on the Pi network, this could be a catalyst that promotes more buying. But as we continue to see this boost in Pi Users, the Angry Pepe Fork meme coin is also gradually becoming the meme token to watch out for this year. Accessing Global Utility With Pi Token The surge in Pi users follows its long-standing mining campaign lasting over 4 years that sees the Network experiment with different features. As the coin migrates its users to the mainnet, the Pi token expands its global reach with more utility. One recent report shows the Pi Network is already working on merchant testing that allows the Pi Network to be used in e-commerce and other offline, real-world use cases. This utility approach stands at the forefront of its adoption effort, which could play a crucial role in the growth of the coin over time. Deciding Factors for Pi Coin's 160% Price Surge Analysts predicting Pi's 160% growth have also commented on other factors that could play key roles in the coin boost. Some points to note include its functionality, compliance with regulations, adoption rate, and utility. While the user base continues to grow, sustained demand for the token will be crucial to keep the price strong as it continues integrating with other blockchain applications. Furthermore, with a maximum supply of 100 billion tokens and just about 7.5 billion currently in circulation, the supply mechanism will also influence how the tokens are absorbed. A loose supply system could overflood the market, reducing the demand-to-supply ratio. However, for the coin price to continue upward, the focus needs to go beyond the number of its users to a substantial use case that increases its demand. $APORK's Growth Setup Beyond Presale Pushing beyond other regular meme coins, the Angry Pepe Fork meme coin has set a mechanism that ensures its continuous growth, first with the deflationary mechanism capped to the token supply. The $APORK meme coin has a fixed supply of 1.9 billion tokens, distinguishing it from other unlimited meme coins. However, even with the fixed supply, $APORK has a mechanism to ensure continuous token burn to reduce the circulating supply and ensure long-term value growth. Boosting Security And Transparency With SOLIDProof Audit The Angry Pepe Fork is a project built on transparency to ensure it stands the test of time through a SOLIDProof audit. This helps promote the project's authenticity and transparency, putting it above other vague meme coin projects. By implication, investors have continued to troop into the APORK presale, pumping a whopping $240k within its first 8 days. Investors' trust is already helping the Angry Pepe Fork meme coin presale close the gap toward achieving its first-round target. While the presale continues, investors joining can easily buy a stake in the ICO with the current price of $0.0269. However, while the meme coin continues towards a multi-chain expansion, investors can still easily buy the $APORK token in presale using ETH or USDT. The Angry Pepe Fork promises to be the most viral meme coin this year, setting an opportunity for investors to hit a high-growth target.

Bitcoin BTC is down 3.8% in the last 24 hours, trading under $104,000 yet again. The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins, exchange coins and memecoins — lost 6.1% in the same period of time, with ether ETH and solana SOL both slumping 7% and sui SUI dipping almost 10%. Crypto stocks are also taking a hit, with Coinbase (COIN), Strategy (MSTR) and Circle (CRLC) all down 2%-3%, and bitcoin miners such as Bitdeer (BTDR), Riot Platforms (RIOT), CleanSpark (CLSK), HIVE (HIVE) and Hut 8 (HUT) losing 6%-7%. The market move came as President Donald Trump suggested that the U.S. could soon get involved in the conflict between Israel and Iran. “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding,” Trump posted on social media, referring to Iranian head of state Ali Khamenei. “He is an easy target, but he is safe there - we are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don’t want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin.” Trump also called for Iran to surrender unconditionally, and for residents of Tehran to evacuate the city. The national security council was convened, according to the White House, and Trump himself cut short a G7 summit to focus on the issue. Odds of U.S. military action against Iran before July have soared to 65% on Polymarket. “The sudden and severe escalation of the Iran-Israel conflict introduced a significant geopolitical risk premium, prompting an immediate flight from risk assets across the board, to which crypto has not proven immune,” said Javier Rodriguez-Alarcón, Chief Investment Officer at XBTO. “The geopolitical situation remains a wildcard; any credible de-escalation in the Middle East could serve as a significant risk-on catalyst, while a further deterioration would likely trigger another move down across risk assets,” he added. Matteo Greco, senior analyst at Finequia, shared the same sentiment, adding that the war could end up having significant consequences on the U.S. economic outlook. “Should Israeli military actions impact Iran’s oil production, a spike in oil prices could follow, fueling renewed inflationary pressures,” Greco said.",Markets|Bitcoin|Trump|Iran|Israel|News,EN,0,0,BTC|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-17 18:04:35

This latest filing marks another step toward ending the long-running legal battle over XRP’s regulatory status. The update was first shared by prominent crypto legal analyst James K. Filan on X, who posted images of the court document filed on June 17, 2025 (Dkt. 988). In the letter, Ripple joins the previously submitted joint motion with the SEC and provides further clarification to support the request for an indicative ruling. Ripple Maintains Respect for the Court’s Prior Rulings In the letter, Ripple makes clear that it is not asking the Court to overturn or revise the Summary Judgment Order issued in July 2023. That landmark ruling found that Ripple’s institutional XRP sales violated securities laws, while programmatic sales on exchanges did not. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP @Ripple has filed a Supplemental Letter in support of the Motion for an Indicative Ruling. pic.twitter.com/yPTTugNIj8 — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) June 17, 2025 Ripple states that the settlement does not seek to “absolve” it of compliance with securities laws. Rather, the company remains bound by the Summary Judgment and any future injunctions the Court may impose. The letter emphasizes that Ripple will continue to comply with all legal obligations, whether or not an injunction is ultimately issued. This clarification aims to dispel any misconceptions that Ripple is attempting to reverse the Court’s previous findings. Ripple Calls for Practical Resolution in Light of Evolving Regulation Ripple’s filing urges the Court to consider the broader benefits of approving the settlement. Specifically, it argues that the negotiated resolution would significantly reduce the burden on both Judge Torres’ docket and the Second Circuit’s, without disturbing the substance of the Court’s previous rulings. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The company also highlights the SEC’s evolving approach to digital assets. Citing the agency’s Crypto Task Force and recent comments on creating a “clearer path” for crypto regulation, Ripple argues that resolving the case through a settlement aligns with the broader regulatory shift. As one of the earliest crypto companies targeted by the SEC, Ripple contends that it has been subjected to disproportionately drawn-out litigation. The company believes a settlement would place it on equal footing with other firms whose cases were resolved much earlier or dismissed outright. With the supplemental letter now on record, attention turns to Judge Torres, whose forthcoming decision will determine whether the settlement can proceed. A favorable ruling could finally bring closure to one of the most high-profile legal battles in crypto history, while also setting a precedent for how similar cases might be resolved in the future. Ripple’s latest filing underscores its commitment to compliance, its desire for finality, and its ongoing efforts to help shape a more consistent and transparent regulatory environment for the broader crypto industry.

Private credit is emerging as a top alternative asset for family offices, according to a new survey by BlackRock, reports Bloomberg. Of the 175 family offices around the world that were surveyed, more than half have a bullish outlook on private credit and nearly one-third say they are planning to increase allocations to the asset class this year. Says Armando Senra, head of the Americas institutional business at BlackRock, “They are diversifying their exposure within private markets. While allocations used to be primarily into private equity growth, now what you see is high interest in private credit, the beginning of interest in infrastructure.” The survey also finds that 30% of respondents plan to commit more of their money to the infrastructure market. Lili Forouraghi, BlackRock’s head of family offices, health care, endowments, foundations and official institutions in the US, says the super-rich are increasingly interested in the potential of private credit to generate a higher yield than public bond markets. She also says that infrastructure investments related to decarbonization and “the whole buzz of AI plus data centers, those are the areas that have intrigued a lot of our clients.” The survey finds that, on average, alternative investment comprises 42% of assets in family office portfolios, up from 39% in a prior 2022-2023 survey, and that private credit holdings make up anywhere from 15% to 30% of some family offices’ portfolios.

This is where market makers come in. Market makers are companies which provide liquidity to financial markets (say, Bitcoin -USD) by using their own funds to buy and sell your coin at the predetermined market price. These entities are needed in financial markets because there might not be enough people in the world holding a specific financial asset to allow it to be traded instantly. Without market makers, traders could have to wait days, weeks, or even months to find someone willing to buy or sell an asset at the price you desire. In short, market makers ensure there’s always a liquidity pool available to enable efficient order execution, and stabilize token values by minimizing bid-ask spreads, and lowering volatility in general. Let’s take a quick look at ten important factors to consider when choosing a market maker. Reputation and Experience One of the first things to consider is the reputation and experience of the market maker in question. Have they handled assets in financial markets similar to yours before–- be they cryptocurrencies, DeFi tokens, or futures contracts? How did those markets perform under their guidance? There have been plenty of cases of market makers dumping their clients’ tokens or manipulating prices in an effort to profit off of unknowing retail investors. On the other hand, there are also a strong selection of industry stalwarts that have provided liquidity for diverse financial markets for decades. Companies like Caladan and Wintermute have years of experience managing liquidity for a variety of cryptocurrency tokens, throughout a constantly evolving regulatory landscape. Don’t just go by hype. Look at your market maker’s past record and judge them by their actions, not their words. Incentives and Payment Structure Market makers need to get paid. For some, this means profiting off the miniscule spread between token prices. It might only amount to a fraction of a cent, but when this is done for thousands of trades per day, it adds up pretty quickly. Other market makers simply take a monthly retainer. Some have been known to use a model known as “loan and option”. This is where the maker takes some of your tokens on loan and tries to profit from trading them. Naturally, this can cause conflict, since if the maker isn’t very confident in your project, they may end up selling your assets too soon, thus driving the price down. Make sure your market maker’s goals align with yours. It’s your responsibility to lay out clear rules, incentives and penalties to make sure they are working hard for your token or asset. Technology and Infrastructure Market making isn’t just a case of throwing money at an asset and hoping for the best. The most efficient market making firms utilize the latest, most advanced trading algorithms which can execute trades in mere milliseconds. What’s more, the best algorithms can react instantly to changing market conditions, moving quickly to balance the orderbook and keep prices stable. You should always investigate the level of technology used by a market maker, just as you’d inspect the engine of a new car. Find out if their tech can be applied to only centralized exchanges (like Binance or Coinbase), or also decentralized exchanges (like Uniswap). Is it compatible with your specific blockchain or token? Can it adjust rapidly if the market makes a sudden movement? Multi-Chain and Multi-Exchange Support Most modern cryptocurrency tokens don’t exist on a single network. The majority of newly-launched projects aim for multi-chain functionality, with tokens that are able to be transferred from Ethereum , to Polygon, to Binance Smart Chain, for example. This means that market makers must manage liquidity across all of these different networks, otherwise your asset could end up being priced differently on different platforms, causing market confusion and arbitrage risks. Modern market making firms like Caladan and Wintermute focus on providing liquidity across as many chains as possible. Caladan, for instance, integrates with over 70 centralized and decentralized exchanges, and its low-latency infrastructure, advanced algorithms, and extensive connectivity across CEXs and DEXs gives new token launches a way around the “cold start” problem. In other words, new tokens which are compatible across multiple networks can access deep liquidity from day one. Risk Management Risk is a given in financial markets, but good market makers will have plans in place to manage any risk that arises in various situations. When selecting a market maker, query their risk management strategies. Find out about their rules regarding stop-loss limits during market crashes, and which wallets are used in conjunction with the tokens they manage. What steps do the makers take to discourage or stop people from dumping large amounts of tokens into the market all at once? You’ll also want to know about how they store client assets. Do they use reputable custodians? Are they insured? Do they align with legal compliance rules, like KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti-money laundering) checks in the various jurisdictions they operate in? Final Thought Picking the right market maker is one of the most important decisions you’ll make after launching a token. It will affect how your token trades, how investors see your project, and whether you can attract serious partners down the line. Fortunately, there are several high-end market makers out there to choose from. So keep these five points in mind, and start making your market.

If so, there’s some truly exciting news coming out of Thailand that could significantly impact your investment strategy. The Thai government has officially approved a substantial five-year exemption on the capital gains tax for cryptocurrency investments. This move, effective immediately and running through 2029, is a landmark decision aimed at boosting the digital asset market within the country. Understanding the New Thailand Crypto Tax Exemption Let’s break down what this new policy actually entails. At its core, the approval grants a waiver on the 15% capital gains tax that was previously applicable to profits derived from cryptocurrency trading and investment. However, there’s a crucial condition: this exemption applies specifically to transactions conducted through licensed digital asset operators regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of Thailand. This detail is key and underscores the government’s effort to encourage trading within the regulated financial ecosystem. The news, initially reported by Solid Intel on X (formerly Twitter), signals a clear intent from Thai authorities to foster a more favorable environment for digital asset investors and businesses. For years, the question of crypto tax Thailand has been a significant point of discussion and, at times, uncertainty for both domestic and international participants in the market. This five-year holiday on capital gains is arguably the most significant positive development on the taxation front to date. Previously, investors faced a potential tax burden on profits, which could act as a deterrent to active trading or long-term holding. The removal of this tax for a significant period could potentially unlock more liquidity and encourage greater participation in the market, assuming trades are conducted via approved platforms. Why Did Thailand Introduce This Capital Gains Tax Break? Governments introduce tax policies for various reasons, often related to economic goals. In the case of Thailand crypto tax policies, this exemption appears to be driven by a desire to: Stimulate the Domestic Digital Asset Market: By reducing the tax burden, the government makes crypto investment more attractive compared to other asset classes or compared to investing in crypto in jurisdictions with higher taxes. Encourage Use of Licensed Platforms: The condition that the exemption only applies to transactions on licensed exchanges is a direct incentive for investors to move away from potentially risky or unregulated platforms towards those overseen by the SEC. This enhances investor protection and regulatory oversight. Attract Foreign Investment: A favorable tax environment can make Thailand a more appealing destination for international crypto investors and businesses looking to establish a presence in Southeast Asia. Foster Innovation: A thriving digital asset market can spur innovation in blockchain technology, fintech services, and related industries within Thailand. This move aligns with Thailand’s broader ambition to become a digital hub in the region. By addressing one of the major concerns for investors – taxation on profits – they are signaling a commitment to integrating digital assets into the formal financial system. Who Benefits from the Thailand Capital Gains Tax Exemption? The primary beneficiaries of this policy are investors trading cryptocurrencies and other digital assets through licensed platforms in Thailand. This includes: Individual Retail Investors: Thai citizens and residents trading on platforms like Bitkub, Satang Pro, Zipmex (if operating under license), and others approved by the SEC. Institutional Investors: Funds and corporations investing in digital assets via licensed Thai operators. Licensed Digital Asset Operators: Exchanges and brokers will likely see increased trading volume and potentially new users attracted by the tax benefit, reinforcing their position within the regulated framework. It’s crucial to remember the ‘licensed operator’ condition. Trading on peer-to-peer platforms, foreign exchanges not licensed in Thailand, or engaging in direct wallet-to-wallet transfers where the gain isn’t realized through a licensed entity might not qualify for this exemption. Investors need to verify the regulatory status of the platform they use. Are There Any Caveats or Remaining Crypto Tax Obligations in Thailand? While the crypto tax exemption on capital gains is significant, it’s not a complete tax holiday on all crypto-related income. Investors and users of digital assets in Thailand still need to be aware of other potential tax liabilities: Income Tax on Other Crypto Activities: The exemption specifically targets capital gains from trading/investment. Other forms of income derived from crypto activities may still be subject to income tax. This could include income from: Mining rewards Staking rewards Airdrops (depending on classification) Income from providing liquidity in DeFi protocols Income received in crypto for goods or services These types of income are generally treated as assessable income under personal or corporate income tax laws and are taxed at standard rates. VAT on Transactions: While initial proposals sometimes included VAT discussions, the primary focus of this exemption is on capital gains. It’s important to stay updated on any potential Value Added Tax implications, though typically, the focus has been on the income/capital gains aspect. Definition of Capital Gains: While generally understood as profit from selling an asset for more than its purchase price, the specific interpretation within the Thai tax code for digital assets, especially complex scenarios like crypto-to-crypto trades, needs careful consideration. Trading on licensed exchanges simplifies this as the platform usually provides clear transaction records. Therefore, while the major hurdle of capital gains tax on trading profits via licensed platforms has been removed for five years, it is essential for investors to understand their tax obligations regarding other potential sources of crypto income and to maintain diligent records. How Does This Compare to Other Thailand Crypto Regulations? This tax exemption is part of a broader landscape of Thailand crypto regulations that have been evolving over the past few years. Thailand has been relatively proactive in regulating the digital asset space compared to some of its neighbors, establishing a clear legal framework under the purview of the SEC and the Ministry of Finance. Key aspects of Thailand’s regulatory approach include: Licensing Framework: Requiring digital asset exchanges, brokers, and dealers to obtain licenses and adhere to strict operational and security standards. Investor Protection: Implementing rules around customer suitability, risk disclosure, and asset custody. AML/CFT Compliance: Mandating robust Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism measures for licensed operators. The tax exemption complements this regulatory structure by making the regulated path significantly more appealing financially. It’s a carrot-and-stick approach: regulate the industry stringently (the stick) but offer a significant tax break for operating and trading within that regulated space (the carrot). Compared to some countries that have imposed strict bans or high taxes on crypto trading, Thailand’s approach seems geared towards integrating digital assets into the formal economy while mitigating risks. Other countries in the region, like Singapore, have different tax treatments, often not taxing capital gains for individuals unless trading constitutes a business. Malaysia also generally doesn’t tax capital gains, but income from crypto-related business activities is taxable. Thailand’s five-year exemption provides a specific, time-bound advantage for trading on its licensed platforms. Actionable Insights for Investors in Thailand Given this significant development regarding Thailand capital gains tax on crypto, what should investors do? Verify Platform Licensing: Ensure that any platform you use for buying, selling, or exchanging cryptocurrencies in Thailand is officially licensed by the Thai SEC. A list is usually available on the SEC’s official website. Consolidate Trading on Licensed Platforms: If you currently trade on foreign or unlicensed platforms, consider moving your activities to a licensed Thai operator to benefit from the capital gains tax exemption. Understand Other Tax Obligations: Don’t assume all crypto income is tax-free. Identify if you have income from staking, mining, airdrops, or other activities and understand how these might be taxed under standard income tax rules. Maintain Meticulous Records: Even with the capital gains exemption, keeping detailed records of all transactions (dates, amounts, prices, platform used) is crucial for demonstrating eligibility for the exemption and for calculating any other potential tax liabilities. Seek Professional Advice: Tax laws can be complex, especially concerning digital assets. Consult with a tax professional familiar with Thai tax law and cryptocurrency to ensure full compliance. This five-year window provides a fantastic opportunity for investors to potentially increase their net returns from trading activities without the drag of capital gains tax, provided they navigate the regulated landscape correctly. What Happens After 2029? The exemption is set to expire at the end of 2029. This raises questions about the future of crypto tax Thailand policies. Will the exemption be extended? Will a different tax regime be introduced? It’s impossible to say for certain, but the government will likely evaluate the impact of this exemption on the market, tax revenue, and regulatory compliance over the next few years. The hope is that by 2029, the Thai digital asset market will be more mature, with a larger user base primarily operating within the regulated ecosystem. This might make future taxation policies easier to implement and enforce. Investors should view this five-year period as a valuable opportunity while staying aware that the tax landscape could change in the future. Conclusion: A Bold Step for Thailand’s Digital Economy The approval of a five-year Thailand crypto tax exemption on capital gains for transactions on licensed platforms is a significant and positive development for the country’s digital asset ecosystem. It demonstrates the government’s willingness to use tax policy to foster growth and encourage participation within a regulated environment. For investors, it presents a substantial opportunity to trade and invest without the burden of capital gains tax until 2029, provided they utilize SEC-licensed operators. While the exemption is a major win, investors must remain mindful of other potential tax obligations related to different types of crypto income and ensure they comply with all existing Thailand crypto regulations . This move positions Thailand as an increasingly attractive jurisdiction for digital asset activities in Southeast Asia and signals a promising future for the integration of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream Thai economy.

According to TokenTerminal data , Tron has generated over $3.65 billion in revenue over the past 365 days, with $1.6 billion recorded so far this year. Most of these fees are either burned or distributed to super representatives. The token-burning mechanism contributes to Tron’s deflationary nature. Its circulating supply has dropped from 96.3 billion in June last year to 94.8 billion today. Tron price technical analysis TRX price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that TRX has been in a gradual uptrend in recent months, rising from a February low of $0.20 to $0.2743 today. The price has moved above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), signaling that bulls remain in control. Tron has also formed a cup-and-handle pattern, a popular continuation formation, and is currently developing the handle portion. If the pattern holds and TRX breaks above the year-to-date high of $0.2958, a continuation rally toward last year’s high of $0.4497, a roughly 60% upside, becomes increasingly likely.

A notable event in the tech startup scene involves Coralogix, an Israeli company specializing in full-stack observability and security. Coralogix recently announced a substantial funding round, propelling it to unicorn status and signaling ambitious plans, particularly focused on the burgeoning Indian market and advancements in AI technology. This news is highly relevant to anyone following the tech investment landscape, including those interested in the broader implications for innovation and global market strategies. Coralogix Secures Significant Startup Funding Coralogix has successfully closed a Series E funding round, raising an impressive $115 million. This all-equity, all-primary round was led by NewView Capital, a venture growth firm based in California. Prominent participants included the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and NextEquity, a venture firm founded by former Apple executives Avie Tevanian and Fred Anderson. Existing investors also contributed to this round. This latest funding round values Coralogix at over $1 billion pre-money, nearly doubling its valuation in just three years since its last funding in 2022. Achieving unicorn status is a significant milestone for any startup, reflecting strong market traction and investor confidence in its technology and future prospects. The Growing Importance of Observability Data Observability has become increasingly critical in today’s technology landscape. As companies store and leverage vast amounts of data, particularly to capitalize on the benefits of AI, understanding system behavior and performance is paramount. Observability platforms provide insights into the health and performance of complex systems, allowing teams to identify and resolve issues quickly. However, analyzing complex data streams and diagnosing problems can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. This is where innovative solutions like those offered by Coralogix play a crucial role, simplifying the process and making data more accessible and actionable for various stakeholders within an organization. Introducing Coralogix’s AI Agent: Olly Coralogix is addressing the challenge of data analysis with its advanced AI Agent named Olly. Olly is designed to automate data observability, making it easier for companies to understand complex issues using simple text prompts. The agent utilizes a semantic layer that incorporates both internal data, such as metadata, and external sources, including information from the internet. Olly can help users understand complex problems, like identifying the root causes of slow service or resolving common system errors. According to Coralogix co-founder and CEO Ariel Assaraf, Olly is trained to answer broader questions beyond just identifying what is wrong. It can assist customers in understanding which features cause frustration, how much those customers pay, or who their relevant account representative is. Key features of the Olly AI Agent include: Anomaly detection Access monitoring Real-time alerts These features automate data observability, providing proactive insights and reducing the manual effort required for monitoring and troubleshooting. The development of Olly is a key focus for Coralogix, and a portion of the new capital will be used to expand its AI research center responsible for its creation. Strategic India Expansion Plans A major focus for Coralogix following this funding round is a significant India Expansion . The startup plans to invest approximately $100 million in India over the next five years. This investment is aimed at leveraging India’s strong engineering talent pool to support its AI ambitions and overall growth. The expansion involves: Expanding its existing office in Gurugram. Hiring additional staff in Bengaluru and Mumbai. Building engineering, R&D, and customer success teams. Coralogix currently has about 100 employees in India out of a total headcount of nearly 550. The company plans to double its Indian employee base over the next three years. CEO Ariel Assaraf highlighted the cultural fit between Israeli and Indian engineering teams, describing it as a ‘get-it-done, very independent, very committed to the mission’ type of engineering culture that aligns well with Coralogix’s needs. India: A Key Market and Talent Hub India represents Coralogix’s second-largest market in terms of revenue and user base, following the U.S. The company serves over 100 customers in India, including prominent names like Postman, Jupiter Money, Meesho, BookMyShow, BharatPe, CoinDCX, and Razorpay. Coralogix also serves banks and enterprises in India and is looking to secure the Indian government as a potential large client. Beyond hiring, Coralogix is also considering the acquisition of Indian startups as a strategy to accelerate its footprint and acquire strong core teams for its expanding engineering operations. While discussions have occurred, no deals have been finalized yet. Growth Trajectory and Future Outlook Since its Series D round in June 2022, Coralogix has experienced substantial growth, reporting a 7x increase in revenues. Despite this rapid growth, the company is not yet profitable. Coralogix views Datadog as its primary competitor in the market. Looking ahead, Coralogix has set its sights on a U.S. IPO on Nasdaq within the next three years. The company aims to demonstrate significant progress on key initiatives – its unique architecture, customer engagement models, expansion into new geographies like India, and its innovative AI experience (both monitoring AI systems and using AI for monitoring) – before pursuing the public offering. This latest Startup Funding round provides Coralogix with the capital needed to accelerate these strategic initiatives, particularly its expansion in India and the continued development of its AI capabilities, positioning the company for further growth and a potential future IPO. Summary: Coralogix’s $115 million Series E funding round not only solidifies its status as a unicorn but also fuels significant expansion plans, with a major focus on investing $100 million in India over five years to build engineering, R&D, and customer success teams. The company is also heavily investing in its AI observability agent, Olly, leveraging the new capital to expand its AI research center. With India already being its second-largest market and a strong talent pool, Coralogix is strategically positioned for continued growth, eyeing potential acquisitions in the country and a future IPO on Nasdaq.

The market structure remains decisively bearish, and unless bulls step in at this final support, a breakdown toward $0.12 becomes the dominant scenario. Sonic is trading at its lowest level of the year, having breached the previous swing low, a significant structural support. This places SONIC ( SONIC ) at a high-risk inflection point where bulls must defend or risk triggering a full-blown bearish expansion. While a swing failure pattern could still be confirmed with a rapid recovery, the current trend, marked by lower highs, lower lows, and weak volume, paints a fragile picture. Key technical points Swing Low Break Signals Weakness: Price is now trading below key yearly support, increasing downside risk. $0.49 Resistance or $0.12 Breakdown: A recovery could target $0.49, but a failure to hold current levels may trigger a bearish move to $0.12 (Fibonacci extension). No Volume Support Yet: Bullish volume remains absent, reducing the probability of a reversal without significant demand. SUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView Price action on Sonic has continued to deteriorate, with the asset now closing below the prior swing low, establishing a new yearly low. This is a strong bearish signal, especially given the consistent pattern of lower highs and lower lows that has dominated the chart in recent weeks. The current zone is a make-or-break level. A bullish recovery from here would form a swing failure pattern (SFP), where price reclaims the broken low and rallies. If confirmed with a spike in volume, this would likely trigger a move back toward the $0.49 resistance, a level that has previously held on higher timeframes. You might also like: Pepe price down 13% on Tuesday: is a crash coming? However, if the price continues to close weakly below this last line of defense, the probability of a further breakdown sharply increases. The next major target lies at $0.12, based on the Fibonacci extension of the latest bearish swing. Currently, volume is not supporting a bullish reversal. There’s been no sign of meaningful buy-side participation, and without that, the path of least resistance remains to the downside. What to expect in the coming price action Sonic is at a critical inflection point. Bulls must reclaim the broken support zone quickly to prevent a deeper collapse. If support fails, expect price to target the $0.12 region in the coming weeks. Until volume returns and structure shifts, bearish momentum remains in control.

However, the bubble burst after Dominari securities were linked with Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. It all started after Tron’s announcement on Monday that it plans to go public in the US. According to reports, the digital platform will go public via a reverse merger with SRM Entertainment. This Nasdaq-listed company previously designed merchandise for theme parks before transitioning to crypto. The deal was brokered by Dominari Securities, which operates out of Trump Tower. The president’s sons joined their parent company, Dominari Holdings’ advisory board, earlier this year, which means they were involved in the setup. According to reports, the two joined Dominari Holdings’ advisory board in February and received 750,000 shares each in part. They were given 250,000 and another 500,000 upon joining when the company hit a market cap milestone. SRM Entertainment plans to raise $100 million from a private investor to buy TRON tokens and issue preferred shares and warrants that value the deal up to $210 million. SRM said it plans to rebrand as Tron Inc., with Sun joining as an advisor. SRM said it will stake the TRON token, distribute dividends, and build long-term shareholder value through digital asset exposure, like Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Eric Trump has been mentioned in the new TRX treasury firm. Although the President’s sons have been linked to Dominari’s holdings, Eric Trump has since denied any “public involvement” with Sun’s new venture. Sun has long been seen as one of the most controversial people in the crypto business, and he is known for pulling stunts to get attention. Dominari securities linked to Musk American Bitcoin, the US crypto miner backed by the pair, was originally a wholly owned subsidiary of Dominari Holdings. It was previously called American Data Centers but rebranded in late March in a joint venture with another miner, Hut 8, to develop Bitcoin mining and a strategic reserve of the token. Several of Elon Musk’s private companies, such as SpaceX and xAI, have also raised millions of dollars with help from Dominari Securities. In addition, the new crypto-friendly rules put in place by Trump have helped big campaign donors who run crypto firms and Elon Musk, who spent almost $300 million to help Trump win. He has big Bitcoin interests through his electric car company, Tesla, and other businesses. Although Trump and Musk have a bad relationship now, the tech mogul’s crypto fortunes seem to have gotten better because of Trump’s plan to loosen regulations. Justin Sun’s relationship with the Trump family According to reports, Justin Sun has had ties with Trump and his crypto ventures. Soon after Trump was elected, Sun became an adviser and investor in World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto company. He also bought $75 million worth of their memecoin, $TRUMP, as soon as it came out in January. The bond was built further after Sun claimed to be the largest holder of Trump’s memecoin and won a dinner invitation with the president as a top token holder. He publicly flaunted a $100,000 Donald Trump-branded watch he was awarded at a private dinner at Trump’s Virginia golf club. Thank you Tron!!! @justinsuntron @worldlibertyfi #USD1 https://t.co/6CvSaIs04H — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) June 11, 2025 On June 11, Sun announced that the first batch of USD1, a stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial, a so-called DeFi project linked to the Trump family, had been minted on the Tron network.

A significant on-chain movement has caught the attention of analysts, revealing a massive deposit into one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. This move isn’t just a routine transfer; it’s directly tied to an important strategic decision by AltLayer to address a critical market challenge. According to insights shared by on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, a multi-signature address controlled by AltLayer recently transferred a staggering 200 million ALT tokens to Binance . At the time of the report, this deposit was valued at approximately $6.42 million. While large deposits to exchanges can sometimes signal potential selling pressure, AltLayer has clarified the purpose behind this substantial transfer, linking it directly to an upcoming token swap initiative. Why is AltLayer Depositing 200M ALT on Binance? The primary reason behind this substantial deposit of ALT tokens onto the Binance platform is to facilitate a planned token swap . AltLayer is transitioning its ALT token from the BEP20 standard (used on the Binance Smart Chain, now BNB Chain) to the ERC20 standard (used on the Ethereum network). This strategic shift aims to consolidate liquidity and improve the overall trading experience for ALT token holders on the exchange. Depositing a large reserve of the token onto the exchange before initiating the swap is a crucial step. It ensures that Binance has sufficient supply of the token to manage the conversion process and provide adequate liquidity for users trading the ERC20 version once the swap is completed and implemented on the platform. This proactive measure helps prevent potential price volatility or trading disruptions that could arise from a sudden lack of available tokens. Understanding the BEP20 to ERC20 Token Swap For those new to the technical side of cryptocurrencies, understanding token standards is key. ERC20 is the technical standard for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain used for fungible tokens (meaning each token is exactly the same as another). BEP20 is a similar standard on the Binance Smart Chain (BNB Chain). While they share many similarities, tokens on one chain cannot be directly used or traded on the other without a bridging mechanism or an exchange facilitating the swap. A token swap , in this context, involves converting tokens from one standard or blockchain to another. In AltLayer ‘s case, they are moving from BEP20 to ERC20. This often means that tokens held on the BEP20 standard will eventually become obsolete or lose primary support on major platforms like Binance , with the ERC20 version becoming the standard. Why make this change? Ethereum’s Dominance: ERC20 is the most widely adopted token standard in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and broader crypto ecosystem. Many wallets, protocols, and exchanges primarily support ERC20 tokens. Ecosystem Alignment: AltLayer ‘s technology is deeply integrated with modular blockchain ecosystems, which often have strong ties to Ethereum and its Layer 2 solutions. Aligning the primary token standard with this ecosystem can simplify future integrations and partnerships. Consolidating Liquidity: Having the token split across multiple chains (like BEP20 and ERC20) can fragment liquidity. By focusing on one standard, AltLayer aims to create deeper liquidity pools, particularly on major exchanges like Binance , leading to better price execution for traders. Addressing the Liquidity Shortage on Binance AltLayer explicitly stated that the token swap is intended to address a liquidity shortage on the exchange. This suggests that perhaps the BEP20 version of the ALT token currently traded on Binance was experiencing issues with trading depth, order book spread, or overall availability, making it difficult for users to buy or sell larger amounts without significantly impacting the price. A lack of liquidity can be detrimental to a token’s health on an exchange. It can lead to: Increased Volatility: Small trades can cause large price swings. Poor Price Execution: Traders may not get the price they expect due to wide bid-ask spreads. Difficulty for Large Holders: Users with significant amounts of ALT token may struggle to enter or exit positions efficiently. By depositing a large sum and facilitating the swap to the ERC20 standard, AltLayer and Binance are working together to ensure there is ample supply of the now-standardized token available for trading, aiming to create a more stable and efficient market on the platform. What Does This Mean for ALT Token Holders? For users holding ALT token , especially on Binance , this announcement is significant. While Binance typically handles token swaps automatically for funds held on the exchange, users holding BEP20 ALT tokens in external wallets will need to pay close attention to official announcements from AltLayer and Binance regarding the swap process and deadlines. Key considerations for holders: On Binance: If your ALT tokens are on Binance , the exchange is expected to manage the swap process seamlessly. You likely won’t need to do anything, but it’s always wise to monitor their official announcements. Off Exchange (BEP20): If you hold BEP20 ALT tokens in a private wallet (like MetaMask, Trust Wallet connected to BNB Chain), you will need to follow AltLayer ‘s specific instructions on how to swap these tokens for the new ERC20 version. This might involve using a dedicated swap portal or bridging mechanism. Missing the deadline could result in your tokens becoming difficult or impossible to swap later. Off Exchange (ERC20): If you already hold ERC20 ALT tokens (perhaps acquired on a different platform or via a bridge previously), these tokens are likely already in the desired standard and may not require action, but verification via official channels is crucial. This move is a positive step towards standardizing the token and improving its market health on major platforms. While temporary adjustments might be necessary for some holders, the long-term goal is a more robust and liquid market for ALT token . Benefits and Challenges of the Swap Like any significant technical and market-oriented change, the AltLayer token swap presents both opportunities and potential hurdles. Benefits: Improved Liquidity: As stated by AltLayer , the primary goal is to fix the liquidity shortage on Binance , leading to better trading conditions. Wider Compatibility: ERC20 is the standard for Ethereum’s vast ecosystem, potentially opening up more opportunities for ALT token integration into DeFi protocols, wallets, and other platforms. Simplified Ecosystem: Consolidating the token onto one main chain reduces complexity for users and developers alike. Enhanced Market Stability: Deeper liquidity generally contributes to a more stable market price. Challenges: User Awareness: Ensuring all BEP20 holders are aware of the swap and the necessary steps (if holding off-exchange) is critical to avoid stranded tokens. Technical Execution: The swap process itself needs to be seamless and secure to maintain user trust. Temporary Disruptions: Trading or withdrawals of BEP20 ALT tokens might be temporarily paused on exchanges during the transition period. Potential for Scams: Token swaps can sometimes be exploited by scammers promoting fake swap portals. Users must rely only on official AltLayer and Binance channels for information and swap procedures. The success of the swap hinges on clear communication and smooth technical execution by AltLayer and its partners, including Binance . AltLayer’s Position in the Crypto Landscape To fully appreciate the significance of this move, it’s helpful to understand AltLayer ‘s role. AltLayer is a decentralized protocol that offers ‘Restaked Rollups’, combining optimistic and ZK rollup technology with EigenLayer’s restaking mechanism. This allows developers to quickly deploy application-specific rollups that are highly scalable, secure, and customizable. The ALT token is integral to the AltLayer ecosystem, used for staking, governance, and potentially as gas tokens for rollups. As AltLayer continues to build out its infrastructure and attract developers to deploy rollups, having a widely accessible and liquid token on a major standard like ERC20 is crucial for its growth and adoption. Actionable Insights for the Community Here’s what you should do if you hold or are interested in ALT token : Stay Informed: Follow official AltLayer and Binance announcements regarding the exact timing and procedures for the token swap . Check Your Holdings: Identify where you hold your ALT tokens (on Binance , another exchange, or a private wallet) and what standard they are (BEP20 or ERC20). Prepare for Swap (if off-exchange BEP20): If you hold BEP20 ALT tokens off-exchange, be ready to follow AltLayer ‘s instructions for swapping. Do NOT use unofficial links or services. Monitor Trading: Be aware that trading on Binance might see temporary changes or pauses related to the swap. Assess Risk: Understand that market reactions to such events can vary. Conclusion: A Strategic Move for AltLayer and ALT Token The deposit of 200 million ALT tokens onto Binance and the accompanying announcement of a BEP20 to ERC20 token swap represent a significant strategic maneuver by AltLayer . By addressing reported liquidity shortages and standardizing the token on the widely adopted ERC20 format, AltLayer aims to improve the trading environment for its community and pave the way for easier integration within the broader Ethereum-centric ecosystem. While token swaps require careful execution and clear communication, this move signals AltLayer ‘s commitment to strengthening the market infrastructure for the ALT token and supporting its future growth within the competitive modular blockchain landscape.

The news came from a staff meeting held inside the plant, where employees were told the pause was for maintenance work on the production lines. This will be the third shutdown at that same facility in the past year. The company hasn’t said a word publicly about it. Inside the factory, workers have already experienced two previous shutdowns. One in late May and another in December, both affecting the same vehicle lines. The December halt was blamed on a battery shortage, workers told Business Insider. The May shutdown included voluntary training sessions, focused on what the company described as improving the workplace environment. Tesla keeps halting production in Austin The April slowdown didn’t involve a complete shutdown, but the Cybertruck line was scaled back, and some staff were reassigned. This string of production pauses shows a growing pattern. And while it’s not unusual for automakers to pause lines for scheduled maintenance or low demand in the summer, it used to be rare for Elon Musk’s company. Four Tesla employees told Business Insider that these pauses were not part of the regular workflow before. The context matters. Ford stopped making its F-150 Lightning for seven weeks last fall. During the chip shortage in 2021, both Ford and GM shut down certain plants. So while industry-wide comparisons exist, this kind of recurring disruption is still a big deal for Tesla, especially at its Austin Gigafactory, which plays a central role in producing its most hyped vehicles. Right now, Tesla is under pressure across multiple fronts. First-quarter delivery numbers were already down 13% compared to the previous year. The company is expected to report its Q2 numbers in July. But as of March 20, it had delivered less than 50,000 Cybertrucks, according to a recall filing. And it’s not like the Cybertruck is the only focus. The Model Y, which remains Tesla’s top-selling model, is also part of the shutdown. A refreshed version of the Model Y launched back in January, and now that too is being pulled off the line again. Tesla ties robotaxi launch to Model Y, despite shutdown While Tesla halts production of the very model it sells most, it’s also getting ready to roll out something completely different. The company plans to launch a robotaxi service in Austin on June 22, just eight days before the scheduled production stop. The robotaxi program will use Model Y vehicles loaded with an upgraded version of the company’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software. Elon has personally been pushing the robotaxi story. He posted a video clip of a Model Y robotaxi driving itself through Austin last week. That post blew up, and anticipation for the service spiked online. Elon said the launch would include 10 to 20 vehicles to start. He said rides would begin on June 22, assuming everything goes to plan. But even he admitted the timeline might change. “We are being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift,” Elon wrote in a post on X. He added that by June 28, the robotaxi vehicles should be able to drive themselves from the factory directly to a customer’s house. That’s just two days before the scheduled production halt kicks in. Which means the cars being used for the robotaxi service are the same ones whose production is being stopped—at least temporarily. That overlap raises serious questions. There’s also no indication if the pause is related to inventory issues, part shortages, or just routine factory upkeep. The only detail offered was that the June 30 halt is “for maintenance.” Employees said no official timeline has been shared for when full production resumes. All of this is happening while Tesla prepares to report its next set of delivery data in a few weeks. Any more delays or weak production numbers could put even more pressure on the company’s stock.

According to a report by Reuters, BBVA has advised its top money clients to have 3% to 7% of their portfolio allocated to Bitcoin ( BTC ) and cryptocurrencies. The suggested allocation depends on an investor’s risk appetite, said Philippe Meyer, Head of Digital & Blockchain Solutions at BBVA Switzerland. Speaking at the DigiAssets conference in London, Meyer revealed that the bank has been advising its private clients on BTC investment since September 2024. “The riskier profile, we allow up to 7% of crypto,” Meyer noted. The Spanish lender announced announced plans to offer crypto trading and custody services to customers in Spain. The initial rollout allowed a select group of private clients to purchase Bitcoin Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ), with full access gradually expanding to all private banking customers.

Notably, the European Securities and Markets Authority has previously warned that crypto could pose risks to the global financial stability. An ESMA report also noted that most EU banks do not engage in crypto activities. Despite this, the overall sentiment is that more and more are willing to make a foray. Market experts believe its a matter of time before banks begin to stockpile Bitcoin . BBVA, on its part, has executed client requests for BTC purchases since 2021 when it launched bitcoin trading for private clients in Switzerland. Elsewhere in the industry, JPMorgan recently announced it would allow clients to buy and hold Bitcoin . While CEO Jamie Dimon has long been a vocal crypto skeptic, he acknowledged earlier this year that he would defend the right of the bank’s customers to access digital assets. JPMorgan has also said it will accept spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as collateral for loans to wealthy clients.

Binance leads crypto inflows. During the Nov–Dec rally, it saw 59K altcoin deposit txs/day vs. 26K on Coinbase. This week: 384K USDT txs on TRON, more than Bybit + HTX combined. pic.twitter.com/zba38IxNHe — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 17, 2025 At the peak of last year’s November-to-December altcoin rally, Binance handled as many as 59,000 deposits in a single day—more than double Coinbase’s roughly 26,000 and far above the 24,000 total going to all other exchanges combined. Even in calmer market conditions, Binance maintains its lead, averaging approximately 13,000 altcoin inflow transactions per day. In contrast, Coinbase averages 6,000, and other platforms average around 10,000. Altcoin inflows typically increase in the wake of strong market rallies, suggesting traders are moving assets onto exchanges to lock in profits. These spikes often coincide with local price peaks and increased speculative activity, reports CryptoQuant. Binance’s sustained inflow dominance is due to its broad altcoin offerings and deep liquidity, making it the preferred destination for both retail and institutional traders during periods of heightened market momentum. Stablecoin Activity on Ethereum Favors Binance Binance also holds a commanding position in stablecoin inflows on the Ethereum network, particularly in transactions involving USDT and USDC, reports CryptoQuant. Over a recently observed period, Binance received around 53,000 Ethereum-based stablecoin transactions, compared to 42,000 for Coinbase, 28,000 for Bybit, and just 11,000 for OKX. This trend demonstrates Binance’s status as the primary entry point for dollar-denominated capital entering the crypto market via Ethereum. Stablecoin inflows are often seen as a precursor to increased trading activity, as they represent capital being parked on exchanges for potential deployment. Binance’s dominance in this segment indicates strong trader and investor confidence, further reinforcing its position as the go-to platform for liquidity and execution. TRON Network Data Further Confirms Binance’s Edge The trend extends to the TRON network, where Binance consistently receives the highest volume of USDT deposits. In the past seven days alone, Binance registered approximately 384,000 USDT inflow transactions, outpacing Bybit with 321,000 and HTX with 163,000. With its low fees and quick transaction times, TRON has become the go-to rail for moving stablecoins. Most of that traffic ends up at Binance, showing just how firmly the exchange has positioned itself in stablecoin trading. CryptoQuant notes that exchanges with dominant stablecoin inflows are often positioned to benefit from increased trading volume and user trust. Binance’s consistent lead across both Ethereum and TRON networks confirms its central role in global crypto liquidity and capital allocation.

The nation has officially launched a Digital Asset Innovation Hub, a development poised to reshape the landscape for the Malaysia digital asset sector and broader fintech industry. This initiative isn’t just another government program; it’s a strategic step designed to provide a controlled environment for testing and developing cutting-edge financial technologies, particularly those involving digital assets. At its core, the hub includes a crucial element: a regulatory sandbox. Overseen by Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), the country’s central bank, this sandbox acts as a safe space. It allows companies – from established fintech players to ambitious startups – to experiment with new technologies, products, and services related to digital assets and other financial innovations without facing the full weight of existing regulations initially. Think of it as a controlled laboratory where innovation can thrive under careful observation. This launch signals Malaysia’s commitment to staying ahead in the rapidly evolving digital economy. By providing a structured pathway for innovation, the country aims to attract investment, foster local talent, and ensure that its regulatory framework evolves in step with technological advancements. But what exactly does this mean for firms, regulators, and the public? How Will the Regulatory Sandbox Drive Fintech Innovation? The inclusion of a robust regulatory sandbox is perhaps the most impactful feature of Malaysia’s new Digital Asset Innovation Hub. Sandboxes have become popular tools for regulators globally to manage the inherent risks of emerging technologies while still encouraging progress. Here’s how it works and why it’s a powerful driver for fintech innovation : Controlled Testing Environment: Firms can test their innovations with real consumers but within defined parameters set by BNM. This limits potential harm if something goes wrong. Reduced Regulatory Uncertainty: Instead of navigating complex, potentially outdated regulations for novel tech, firms can work closely with the regulator to understand requirements and receive guidance specific to their innovation. Faster Time to Market: The streamlined process within the sandbox can significantly reduce the time it takes for innovative products and services to get to market compared to traditional regulatory approval processes. Direct Dialogue with Regulators: Companies gain invaluable direct access to Bank Negara Malaysia, allowing for a collaborative approach to regulation-building. This helps regulators understand the technology and its implications firsthand. Data Collection: BNM can collect real-world data on how these new technologies perform, their risks, and their benefits. This data is crucial for developing appropriate, risk-proportionate permanent regulations in the future. For firms operating in the digital asset space, this sandbox is a golden opportunity. It lowers the barrier to entry for testing groundbreaking ideas, from new tokenization models to innovative digital wallets or cross-border payment systems leveraging blockchain technology. It acknowledges that the existing rulebook wasn’t written with these technologies in mind and provides a mechanism to build the new one collaboratively. What Opportunities Does the Digital Asset Hub Unlock? Beyond the sandbox, the broader digital asset hub concept provides a foundation for ecosystem growth. It’s envisioned as a focal point for the industry, facilitating collaboration and knowledge sharing. The hub aims to: Foster Collaboration: Bring together startups, established financial institutions, technology providers, and regulators under one umbrella or within a connected ecosystem. Attract Investment: A clear regulatory path and a supportive environment make Malaysia a more attractive destination for both local and international investors interested in the digital asset and fintech space. Develop Talent: The hub can become a center for expertise, encouraging the development of skills in blockchain, digital assets, cybersecurity, and regulatory compliance specific to this sector. Promote Education: By acting as a central point, the hub can help educate the public and businesses about digital assets, their potential uses, and associated risks, promoting responsible adoption of Malaysia digital asset technologies. Showcase Innovation: Provide a platform for companies to demonstrate successful innovations tested within the sandbox and beyond, encouraging wider adoption and further development. This integrated approach, combining a regulatory sandbox with a broader innovation hub, creates a powerful synergy. It addresses both the regulatory hurdles and the ecosystem development needed for the Malaysia digital asset sector to flourish. It positions Malaysia as a forward-thinking nation actively embracing the potential of digital finance. The Pivotal Role of Bank Negara Malaysia The central bank, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), is not just an observer in this process; it is the orchestrator. BNM’s involvement is critical for several reasons: Ensuring Stability: As the guardian of financial stability, BNM ensures that innovations tested within the sandbox do not pose systemic risks to the wider financial system. Protecting Consumers: BNM sets conditions within the sandbox to protect consumers participating in the testing, ensuring transparency and recourse if necessary. Developing Informed Regulation: Direct interaction with new technologies allows BNM to build regulatory expertise and craft future regulations that are effective, proportionate, and encourage responsible innovation. Maintaining Confidence: BNM’s oversight provides a level of credibility and trust for both participating firms and the public regarding the safety and legitimacy of the innovations being explored. BNM’s leadership in this initiative demonstrates a proactive stance towards managing the opportunities and risks presented by digital assets and broader fintech innovation . Their involvement ensures that growth in this sector is guided by principles of safety, soundness, and integrity. What Challenges Might Fintech Innovation Face? While the launch of the hub and sandbox is overwhelmingly positive, the path forward for fintech innovation in Malaysia, particularly concerning digital assets, isn’t without potential challenges. These include: Balancing Innovation and Risk: Finding the right balance between encouraging groundbreaking innovation and mitigating risks like money laundering, terrorist financing, and cyber threats is an ongoing challenge. Developing Expertise: Both regulators and industry participants need deep technical and regulatory expertise in complex areas like decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenization, and smart contracts. Building this talent pool takes time. Interoperability: Ensuring that new digital asset systems can interact effectively and safely with existing traditional financial infrastructure is crucial for widespread adoption. Public Understanding and Adoption: Educating the public about digital assets and building trust in new digital financial services is necessary for their successful implementation. Evolving Landscape: The digital asset space is constantly changing. Regulators must remain agile and adaptable to keep pace with new developments and emerging risks. Successfully navigating these challenges will require continued collaboration between BNM, the industry, and other government bodies. The regulatory sandbox is specifically designed to help address some of these challenges by providing a structured environment to identify and manage potential issues early on. Benefits and Actionable Insights The potential benefits of this initiative for Malaysia are substantial. Economically, it could lead to job creation, attract foreign direct investment, and position Malaysia as a leader in the digital economy within Southeast Asia. For consumers and businesses, it could result in more efficient, cheaper, and innovative financial products and services. For companies in the fintech and digital asset space, the actionable insight is clear: explore the opportunities presented by the Digital Asset Innovation Hub and the regulatory sandbox. Understand the application process, identify potential innovations that align with BNM’s focus areas, and engage with the central bank and the wider ecosystem. For investors, Malaysia is becoming a more interesting market for digital asset and fintech ventures due to this clearer path for development and regulation. Conclusion Malaysia’s launch of the Digital Asset Innovation Hub and its accompanying regulatory sandbox marks a significant and positive step forward. By providing a controlled environment for testing and fostering collaboration, Bank Negara Malaysia is creating fertile ground for responsible fintech innovation and the growth of the Malaysia digital asset sector. While challenges remain, this proactive approach positions Malaysia to harness the transformative potential of digital assets, driving economic growth and shaping the future of finance in the region.

46226864,https://coinpaper.com/9600/how-flare-is-bringing-xrp-to-defi,1750188148,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,How Flare Is Bringing XRP to DeFi,https://coinpaper.com/9600/how-flare-is-bringing-xrp-to-defi,"Flare is making headlines because it is transforming the place XRP will hold in decentralized finance (DeFi). Utilizing its native data infrastructure and applying new cross-chain asset protocols, Flare is unlocking opportunities for XRP holders to participate in the growing DeFi landscape—without sacrificing security or token custody. Key Takeaways Flare's native oracle and data validation stack ( FTSO + FDC ) enables safe, verifiable cross-chain action and distinguishes Flare from other Layer-1 blockchains. FXRP allows XRP holders to mint a 1:1 token representation on Flare, bringing one of the most liquid assets in crypto into DeFi in a non-custodial, EVM-compatible manner. The launch of USD₮0 stablecoin via LayerZero injected a spark into Flare's total value locked (TVL) to reach triple in under two weeks. Flare is designed to scale, and it's planned to support Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and other major assets via its FAssets protocol. Flare's canary network, Songbird, is crucial for update testing as well as keeping mainnet secure. What is Flare? Flare (FLR) is a Layer-1, full-stack blockchain optimized for data-hungry use cases and cross-chain interoperability. Its three core features are: Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO) , provides decentralized, enshrined data feeds natively on Flare. Flare Data Connector (FDC) , authenticates external blockchain data for Flare's EVM state, enabling trustless interoperability. FAssets , allows creation of fully collateralized Flare representations of non-smart-contract assets (e.g., XRP). How FAssets Work Compared to traditional wrapped tokens relying on custodial agents, Flare's FAssets system is collateralized and decentralized. Customers send XRP to a registered agent of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The agent freezes collateral on Flare and, upon verification via FDC , FXRP is minted in a 1:1 ratio for the customer. The system uses multiple layers of collateral: 1x underlying asset (XRP) FLR pool collateral (typically >1.5x FXRP value) Stablecoin collateral (~1.2x FXRP value) More than 2x system collateralization for robust protection. Multi-signature escrows, daily release of funds, and an Alert Mode in the event of emergencies lock up user funds. Regular audits and bug bounties add to security too. Songbird: Flare's Canary Network Songbird is Flare's production-grade testnet, where new protocols and features (like FAssets v1.1) are piloted in real economic conditions before being deployed on mainnet. The rapid uptake—$2 million of FXRP minted over four days—is a sign of strong demand and provides helpful learnings for Flare's mainnet launch. The USDT0 Effect The introduction of USDT0 (an omnichain version of Tether's USDT, issued via LayerZero) was a breakthrough for Flare. Over a remarkable 13-day period, Flare’s total value locked (TVL) surged from $37.1 million to more than $120.9 million, reflecting a rapid influx of liquidity and user engagement. This momentum has continued, and as of June 2025, Flare’s TVL has soared past $148 million —a testament to the platform’s growing appeal in the DeFi space. A significant driver of this growth has been the introduction of USD₮0, which now makes up 63% of all stablecoin liquidity on Flare. The addition of other stablecoins like USDC and USDX has further diversified the ecosystem, reducing the platform’s dependence on any single issuer and enhancing its overall stability. To incentivize participation, Flare launched the USDT₀ Boost programme, offering users up to 30% APY in rFLR tokens. This attractive yield, combined with Flare’s policy of refunding gas fees for USD₮0 transactions, has made it easier and more cost-effective for users to engage with DeFi protocols on the platform. These initiatives have not only fueled TVL growth but have also positioned Flare as a welcoming and innovative environment for both new and experienced DeFi participants. XRP's DeFi Moment XRP's vast liquidity and user base were, for years, excluded from DeFi, as XRPL lacked support for smart contracts. Flare's FAssets protocol turns this on its head. Companies like Uphold and VivoPower are offering significant XRP on Flare, affirming the FAssets thesis and freeing up new yield potential for institutional investors. Incidentally, XRPFi unlocks DeFi for the masses, enabling them to lend, borrow, yield farm, and provide liquidity with their XRP — at the expense of custody. stXRP and Firelight Flare will introduce liquid staking to XRP through the Firelight protocol. How It Works: Investors lock up FXRP in Firelight's Launch Vault and receive stXRP (an ERC-20 token) on a 1:1 basis. stXRP can be applied in any DeFi protocol while the underlying FXRP is staked, earning rewards. stXRP can be collateral, liquidity, or a yield-generating asset anywhere in the XRPFi ecosystem. Beyond XRP Flare’s vision extends beyond XRP. The FAssets protocol will soon support other major assets like Bitcoin (FBTC) and Dogecoin (FDOGE), using the same trust-minimized bridge architecture to mobilize liquidity from additional ecosystems. Flare’s Pivotal Role in DeFi’s Next Wave Flare is positioning itself as the go-to platform for XRP-based DeFi activity through its strong infrastructure, strict security standards, and increasing institutional attention. By connecting XRP's idle liquidity to the programmable universe of DeFi, Flare is not just adding to XRP's utility but also pushing wider blockchain adoption. With liquid staking and newer FAssets coming online, the XRPFi story gains traction. Flare's methodology sets a new standard for cross-chain DeFi innovation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-17 19:22:28

Unlike traditional cloud services where trust is centralized with the provider, EigenCloud leverages the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network through the innovative mechanism of restaking. Ethereum restaking , pioneered by EigenLayer (the underlying protocol developed by Eigen Labs), allows users who have staked ETH on the Ethereum Beacon Chain to ‘restake’ their staked ETH or liquid staking tokens to simultaneously secure other decentralized services built on top of Ethereum. These services, known as Actively Validated Services (AVSs), can include decentralized oracles, bridges, sequencers for rollups, and now, cloud-like services offered by EigenCloud. By restaking, validators extend Ethereum’s cryptoeconomic security to these AVSs. If a restaking validator acts maliciously or fails to perform its duties for an AVS, its staked ETH can be subject to ‘slashing’ – a penalty that reduces their staked amount. This creates a strong economic incentive for validators to behave honestly and reliably across multiple services, inheriting Ethereum’s robust security guarantees. EigenCloud is essentially an AVS itself, or perhaps a platform *hosting* multiple AVS components. It aims to provide a suite of decentralized services necessary for building and running complex Web3 applications and even enhancing Web2 services with verifiable properties. Why is Verifiable Trust Crucial for Web2 and Web3 Applications? The concept of ‘verifiable trust’ is central to the promise of EigenCloud . In traditional Web2 systems, users and applications rely on trusting centralized entities – cloud providers, data centers, certificate authorities, etc. While often reliable, this trust is based on reputation and audits, not cryptographic or economic proof inherent in the system itself. For Web3 applications , which are fundamentally designed to minimize reliance on central authorities, verifiable trust is paramount. It means that the correct execution of code, the integrity of data, and the outcome of computations can be cryptographically verified by anyone, without needing to trust a single provider. This is essential for applications dealing with sensitive data, financial transactions, identity, or complex logic where transparency and provable correctness are non-negotiable. EigenCloud seeks to bring this level of verifiable trust to a broader range of computing tasks. Imagine a decentralized AI model inference service: EigenCloud could potentially use restaking to ensure that the computation was performed correctly and the result is verifiable on-chain or through cryptoeconomic guarantees. Or consider a supply chain application: data integrity and computation regarding product provenance could be verifiably secured. How Does EigenCloud Integrate Key Decentralized Components? According to reports, EigenCloud integrates several critical components to deliver its verifiable trust capabilities: Data Availability: Ensuring that data required for computation or verification is accessible and available to all participants. This prevents scenarios where data is hidden or censored, which could compromise trust. Compute: Providing decentralized or verifiable computation environments where tasks can be executed and their correctness potentially attested to using cryptoeconomic security. Dispute Resolution: Establishing a clear and economically secured process for resolving disagreements or identifying malicious behavior among participating nodes or services, leveraging the restaking mechanism for slashing penalties. By combining these elements, EigenCloud aims to offer a more robust and trustworthy infrastructure layer for developers building the next generation of decentralized applications, whether they are purely Web3 or hybrid Web2/Web3 systems looking to incorporate verifiable components. The Significance of a16z Crypto’s Investment in Eigen Labs The reported $70 million token purchase by a16z crypto is a major validation for Eigen Labs and the EigenLayer restaking ecosystem. Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto fund is one of the most influential and well-capitalized investors in the blockchain space. Their backing signals strong confidence in Eigen Labs’ technology, team, and the potential market demand for services like EigenCloud. Such a significant investment provides Eigen Labs with substantial resources to accelerate development, expand its team, and foster the growth of the EigenLayer ecosystem and the nascent EigenCloud platform. It also sends a powerful message to the market, potentially attracting more developers, validators, and users to build on or utilize EigenLayer and its AVSs. For a16z crypto , this investment aligns with their thesis of supporting foundational infrastructure that enables the broader adoption and scaling of Web3 applications . They are betting on EigenLayer’s restaking mechanism becoming a crucial middleware layer for decentralized services on Ethereum. What Benefits Does EigenCloud Promise for Developers and Businesses? For developers and businesses looking to build or enhance applications with decentralized properties, EigenCloud offers several compelling potential benefits: Enhanced Trust & Security: Leverage Ethereum’s cryptoeconomic security via restaking to provide verifiable guarantees for critical application logic or data. Reduced Operational Overhead: Potentially abstract away some complexities of building and managing decentralized infrastructure by offering ready-made, verifiable components. New Use Cases: Enable entirely new categories of Web3 applications that require decentralized computation, verifiable data, or robust dispute resolution beyond simple smart contract execution. Cost Efficiency: Restaking can potentially make securing multiple AVSs more capital-efficient than establishing independent trust networks for each service. Interoperability: Facilitate interactions between different decentralized services and potentially bridge aspects of Web2 infrastructure with Web3 verifiable properties. These benefits aim to lower the barrier to entry for creating sophisticated decentralized systems and encourage innovation across various sectors, from DeFi and gaming to enterprise solutions requiring enhanced transparency and security. Potential Challenges and the Road Ahead for EigenCloud While the launch is exciting, the path forward for EigenCloud and the broader EigenLayer ecosystem isn’t without challenges. Key considerations include: Slashing Risks: The complexity of managing slashing risks across multiple AVSs for restaking validators is significant. Ecosystem Development: Success depends on attracting developers to build AVSs and utilize EigenCloud services. Security Audits: As a foundational layer, rigorous security audits are paramount. Economic Modeling: Fine-tuning the economic incentives and security models for restaking and AVSs is an ongoing process. Despite these challenges, the launch of EigenCloud marks a pivotal step for Eigen Labs . It demonstrates the practical application of the EigenLayer protocol beyond just securing bridges or oracles, extending into more general-purpose decentralized computing. The backing from a16z crypto provides a strong tailwind for navigating these challenges and accelerating adoption. Conclusion: A New Era for Verifiable Computing? The introduction of EigenCloud by Eigen Labs , significantly bolstered by the support of a16z crypto , represents a bold step towards realizing the full potential of Ethereum restaking . By integrating essential components like data availability, compute, and dispute resolution, EigenCloud is positioned to offer a robust platform for building Web3 applications and bringing verifiable trust to aspects of Web2. While challenges remain, the vision of a decentralized cloud-like environment secured by the collective stake of the Ethereum network is compelling and could pave the way for a new era of verifiable computing, fostering greater innovation and trust in the digital realm.

Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Dogecoin (DOGE) Source: TradingView Dogecoin (DOGE) has seen a significant decline over the past six months, dropping by 54.53%. In the last month alone, its value decreased by 18.78%. Even in the past week, the coin experienced a 3.30% downturn. Currently, Dogecoin is trading between $0.16 and $0.20. Despite recent losses, there are signs that Dogecoin might stabilize. The nearest support level is at $0.15, which could prevent further declines. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 62.02, suggesting the coin is nearing overbought territory. The Stochastic oscillator is at 93.90, indicating similar conditions. Both the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are at $0.18, showing consistency in the short and long term. If Dogecoin rebounds, it may test the nearest resistance level at $0.22, offering potential gains. This move would be an increase from the current price range. The second resistance level is at $0.26, which would represent a more substantial rise. However, if the price falls below the $0.15 support, the next support level is at $0.11, signaling a possible further decrease. Investors are watching these levels closely to gauge Dogecoin’s next move. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Source: TradingView Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a turbulent period recently. Over the past week, its price has decreased by 2.16%, and in the last month, it has dropped by 16.00%. The six-month picture is even more stark, with a decline of 53.53%. These numbers highlight the challenges SHIB is facing in the current crypto market. Despite the downward trend, there are signs that might suggest a potential change. SHIB’s current price range is between $0.00001109 and $0.00001330, which is close to both its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $0.00001212 and $0.00001210, respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 63.99, nearing the overbought threshold, while the Stochastic oscillator is high at 92.41. These indicators could imply that SHIB is gaining momentum and may experience a price movement soon. If SHIB manages to break through the nearest resistance level at $0.00001456, it could aim for the second resistance at $0.00001677, representing a significant potential gain. Conversely, if the price falls below the nearest support level of $0.00001014, it might head towards the second support at $0.000007936, indicating a possible further decline.

The crackdown, which began late on June 16, instantly cut off a vital communication channel for one of the most active and controversial corners of the crypto ecosystem, leaving traders, developers, and influencers scrambling for answers and alternatives. A Policy Shift—But No Clear Reason X has yet to provide an official explanation for the suspensions, displaying only its standard “violates the X Rules” message on affected profiles. Industry speculation is rampant. Some users point to the use of unauthorized third-party APIs as a likely trigger, with several banned platforms allegedly using unofficial tools to access X data and skirt the platform’s steep API fees. Others suspect the crackdown is related to mounting regulatory scrutiny, with rumors swirling of ongoing SEC investigations into Pump.fun’s rapid-fire launches and potential securities violations. The platform has faced lawsuits over allegedly unregistered securities and controversial tokens, and its high-profile, sometimes chaotic livestreams have previously drawn negative attention. Market Impact: Token Launches and Capital Flight The immediate fallout was dramatic. Within an hour of the suspensions, blockchain analytics showed a surge of new memecoins minted in reference to the bans, with five of these tokens breaking into the top 10 trending on DEX Screener and collectively driving over $10 million in volume. Meanwhile, 15 out of 31 tokens that “graduated” from Pump.fun’s bonding curve in the hour after the ban were directly linked to the incident, representing nearly 9% of all memecoins that completed the process that day. The removal of Pump.fun’s X account and those of other trading tool providers like GMGN, BullX, and Bloom Trading disrupted the flow of information and coordination for new token launches. Founders and traders, suddenly cut off from their main audience, reported sharp drops in engagement and liquidity. Real-time dashboards showed capital flowing out of affected tokens, with some traders fleeing to rival launchpads or even experimenting with decentralized social platforms to regroup. Community Response The memecoin community’s reaction was swift and chaotic. Within minutes, users began minting protest tokens and sharing screenshots of their favorite accounts’ suspensions. Telegram and Discord groups saw a spike in activity as traders and influencers sought new channels for updates and coordination. Some, like the GMGN team, announced they were appealing the bans and working with X to restore access, but many remain in limbo. The crackdown has also reignited debate over the role of centralized social media in crypto. With X’s unpredictable enforcement and lack of transparency, some memecoin founders and community leaders are now openly discussing a migration to decentralized social networks—platforms where account bans are impossible and community governance is the norm. Whether this shift gains traction remains to be seen, but the incident has highlighted just how vulnerable crypto communities are to sudden policy changes by major tech platforms. What’s Next for Memecoin Markets? As Pump.fun’s website and other affected platforms remain operational, the memecoin sector faces a period of heightened uncertainty. Upcoming token launches are likely to see reduced hype and liquidity, and the absence of major influencers and trading bots could reshape how new projects gain traction. At the same time, the crackdown may force the community to innovate—either by finding new ways to coordinate or by embracing decentralized alternatives for both trading and social interaction.",News|Memecoins,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-17 19:32:35

According to GrowThePie’s research lead, Lorenz Lehmann, Polygon zkEVM has seen little meaningful progress since its rebranding and is now operating at an annual loss of over $1 million. “Development Quietly Abandoned” Lehmann claims development on the chain has been “quietly discontinued” and that it was never upgraded to incorporate Ethereum’s Blob data structure, which drastically reduces data availability costs for rollups. His comments arrive amid broader changes at the Polygon Foundation, where co-founder Sandeep Nailwal has recently stepped into the role of CEO. The leadership transition follows the quiet exit of co-founder Mihailo Bjelic, leaving Nailwal as the only founding member still actively involved. Two other co-founders, Jaynti Kanani and Anurag Arjun, exited operational roles in 2022. With this shift, Nailwal is now overseeing structural changes aimed at consolidating Polygon’s focus. While official communication has set 2026 as the target date to sunset zkEVM, Lehmann’s latest claim suggests that the shutdown process is already well underway behind the scenes. His remarks imply the decision to wind down zkEVM predates any formal announcement, and that Polygon’s current narrative may understate the degree to which the product has been deprioritized. Polygon zkEVM was once positioned as a major milestone of the project’s commitment to zero-knowledge scaling. But with continued losses, stagnating development, and a shift in focus toward its proof-of-stake chain and new initiatives like AggLayer, the chain’s role has been effectively marginalized. TVL Down By 80% Polygon zkEVM’s total value locked (TVL) reached an all-time high of $187 million in March 2024, according to data from L2Beat. Although it briefly rebounded to $111 million later that year, the overall trend has been downward. In 2025, the decline has accelerated, as the TVL dropped nearly 80%, from $80.2 million to just $16.25 million at the time of writing.

A significant step forward has just been announced by Ondo Finance , a key player in bringing real-world assets onto the blockchain. They have formed the Global Markets Alliance , a powerful coalition aimed at tackling one of the biggest hurdles to mainstream adoption: standardization in the realm of tokenized securities . Why is Standardization Crucial for Tokenized Securities? Imagine trying to use different types of currency that couldn’t be exchanged, or trying to connect devices that use incompatible plugs. That’s a simplified view of the challenge facing digital assets today, particularly tokenized securities . While the concept of representing ownership of real-world assets like stocks, bonds, or real estate on a blockchain is incredibly promising, the lack of unified standards creates significant friction. Here’s why standardization is paramount: Interoperability: Without common standards, different platforms, wallets, and protocols cannot easily interact. This makes it difficult to move tokenized securities between different blockchains or trading venues. Liquidity: Fragmentation hinders liquidity. If assets are siloed on specific platforms due to compatibility issues, it’s harder for buyers and sellers to find each other, leading to wider spreads and less efficient markets. Investor Protection: Clear, agreed-upon standards can help define asset characteristics, ownership rights, and transfer rules, offering better clarity and protection for investors. Regulatory Clarity: Standard practices can provide regulators with a clearer framework to understand and potentially supervise the market for tokenized securities . Ease of Adoption: Standard interfaces and processes make it easier for traditional financial institutions and individual investors to engage with digital assets without needing bespoke solutions for every interaction. Introducing the Global Markets Alliance Recognizing these challenges, Ondo Finance has taken a proactive step by initiating the Global Markets Alliance . Announced via their official blog, this coalition brings together a diverse group of prominent entities from the blockchain and digital asset space. The stated goal is clear: to collaboratively establish shared standards for the issuance, management, and trading of tokenized securities . The initial members represent various crucial layers of the digital asset ecosystem: Blockchain Infrastructure: Solana Foundation (representing a major blockchain network) Wallet Providers: Bitget Wallet, Trust Wallet, Rainbow Wallet (critical for users to hold and interact with assets) DeFi Protocols: Jupiter, 1inch (important for trading and liquidity) Custodians & Infrastructure: BitGo, Fireblocks (essential for institutional adoption and secure asset handling) Trading Platforms/Brokers: Alpaca (bridging traditional and digital trading) Issuer/Protocol: Ondo Finance (pioneering RWA tokenization) This mix of participants is key. It ensures that the standards developed consider the needs of different stakeholders, from the underlying blockchain layer to the end-user’s wallet and the institutional infrastructure required for broad market participation. What Benefits Can the Global Markets Alliance Bring? The formation of this alliance signals a collective effort to unlock the full potential of tokenized securities . The anticipated benefits are substantial and could significantly accelerate the growth of the digital assets market. Key advantages include: Enhanced Interoperability: By agreeing on common token standards (like variations of ERC-20 or new, purpose-built standards), assets could move more freely across different platforms and potentially different blockchains via bridges. Increased Liquidity: Greater interoperability naturally leads to pooled liquidity. Assets wouldn’t be confined to a single platform, making them easier to buy and sell, thus improving market efficiency. Streamlined Development: Developers building applications or services around tokenized securities would have clear guidelines, reducing complexity and speeding up innovation. Improved Investor Confidence: Standardized practices regarding asset representation, transfer restrictions (like know-your-customer requirements), and legal frameworks can build trust among potential investors, both retail and institutional. Reduced Costs: Interoperable systems can lower the operational costs associated with managing and transferring securities compared to legacy systems. Think of it as building the foundational plumbing for a new financial system. Without agreed-upon pipe sizes and connections, every building would need a custom solution, which is inefficient and expensive. The alliance aims to provide that standardized plumbing. Challenges on the Path to Universal Blockchain Standards While the formation of the Global Markets Alliance is a positive development, the path to establishing widely adopted blockchain standards for tokenized securities is not without its hurdles. This is a complex undertaking involving multiple parties with potentially differing technical approaches and business interests. Potential challenges include: Achieving Consensus: Getting a diverse group of companies, some of whom might be competitors, to agree on specific technical standards and governance models can be difficult and time-consuming. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for digital assets and tokenized securities is still evolving globally. Standards need to be flexible enough to adapt to different jurisdictional requirements. Integration with Legacy Systems: For widespread adoption, new standards must find ways to interface with existing traditional financial infrastructure, which is a significant technical challenge. Security Considerations: Standards must incorporate robust security measures to protect against hacks, fraud, and operational risks inherent in digital systems. Adoption Inertia: Even with established standards, convincing the broader market – including traditional financial institutions and other blockchain projects – to adopt them requires significant effort and time. The alliance will need strong leadership and a clear roadmap to navigate these complexities effectively. Their success will depend on their ability to find common ground and demonstrate the practical benefits of their proposed standards. What Does This Alliance Mean for the Future of Digital Assets? The initiative by Ondo Finance and its partners is a significant indicator of the maturing digital assets market. It shows a move beyond simply tokenizing assets towards building the necessary infrastructure for a functional, scalable, and widely accessible market for tokenized securities . If successful, the Global Markets Alliance could: Accelerate Institutional Adoption: Standardized, predictable frameworks are crucial for traditional financial institutions to confidently enter the space. Drive Innovation: Clear standards provide a stable base upon which developers can build new financial products and services leveraging tokenized securities . Improve Market Efficiency: Enhanced interoperability and liquidity will make the trading and management of digital assets more efficient. Expand Use Cases: As standards become established, we may see a broader range of assets being tokenized, from private equity and debt to unique collectibles and intellectual property. This collaborative approach, bringing together different parts of the ecosystem, is essential. No single company can establish universal blockchain standards alone. Alliances like this are vital for fostering industry-wide cooperation. Actionable Insights for the Community For investors, developers, and market participants interested in the future of digital assets and tokenized securities , the formation of the Global Markets Alliance is something to watch closely. Stay Informed: Follow the progress of the alliance and the standards they propose. Understanding the technical and operational standards will be key. Evaluate Platforms: As standards emerge, consider which platforms and protocols are adopting them, as this may indicate future interoperability and liquidity benefits.

The news come just a day after JP Morgan filed a trademark for the JPMD ticker. JPMorgan Chase made another step toward crypto integration by announcing it would issue its own JPMD token on the Base network. JPMD will represent dollar deposits in the world’s biggest bank, bridging another gap between fiat and crypto. The pilot JPMD token will also be launched on Coinbase for early tests. The first transaction is expected to happen within days. JPMorgan has already minted tokens in a digital wallet and will deposit them to the crypto exchange, using the Base L2 chain. While Base is open to anyone, the JPMD token will be restricted only to the whitelisted clients of JPMorgan. For JPMorgan, the new token is the first foray into a crypto ecosystem outside its internal distributed ledger testing. The bank already runs an exclusive access chain, Kinexys Digital Payments, formerly JPM Coin, which allows the bank’s clients to move their funds in the form of tokens. JPMD will be available for institutional clients The JPMD asset will be denominated in US dollars and represent deposits in the bank. The asset will be used in a pilot program running for several months and will be available to Coinbase’s institutional clients. The token will not be freely used among users and retail clients. JP Morgan has also hinted at other currencies, launching additional specialized stablecoins pending regulator approval. The bank will launch its stablecoin as acceptance of digital dollar-denominated assets is growing. The launch arrives just a week after the Genius Bill on stablecoins passed a key vote and headed to the US Senate. Deposit tokens are not totally similar to stablecoins, as they represent a deposit claim against a commercial bank. They are a digital version of the deposits belonging to customers, hence fully backed by fiat. The JPMD asset will be the first instance of tokenizing direct bank deposits on a public blockchain, in this case, the widely used Base. “ From an institutional standpoint, deposit tokens are a superior alternative to stablecoins,” said Naveen Mallela, global co-head of the bank’s blockchain division. Unlike stablecoins, the deposit tokens can also bear the same interest as the deposit. The bank’s idea is that the JPMD asset will target users who are looking for an alternative to stablecoins produced by a commercial bank. Currently, stablecoins may have trouble securing banking services and showing proof of deposits, which would be trivial for JPMorgan. JP Morgan manages roughly $10T transactions daily, of which $2B go through its native chain. Adopting Base will give the bank another access to a public network with minimal costs and a chance to connect to the wider Ethereum ecosystem, as well as Coinbase’s institutional user base. The bank will continue to grow its Kinexys network, with a different user base. The bank has tested multiple on-chain payment techniques and believes deposit tokens may become a widely used form of money for the digital ecosystem. Currently, transferring fiat into stablecoins is not always smooth for either retail or institutional investors, with each stablecoin having different requirements. With deposit tokens, the bank’s clients may easily find their balance on Coinbase. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

This move would put the leading crypto exchange in direct competition with major trading platforms like Robinhood and Charles Schwab. This would allow Coinbase to provide stock trading through blockchain technology, expanding its service beyond crypto. How Tokenized Stocks Could Transform Market Trading Tokenized equities are digital versions of company shares that exist on a blockchain. Instead of owning the actual stock, investors hold a digital token representing it. These tokens can be traded on blockchain platforms like Bitcoin (BTC). Supporters say tokenized stocks could lower costs by cutting out middlemen, making trades faster, and allowing trading outside regular market hours. In 2024, industry leaders predicted that the Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization could reach over $600 billion in assets under management (AUM) by 2030. However, a recent World Economic Forum report said tokenized stocks often lack enough buyers and sellers, making trading harder. There are also no clear global rules yet, which could slow their adoption. In May, Robinhood proposed a federal framework to the SEC to help support tokenizing real-world assets. The goal is to modernize U.S. markets and make them more efficient and accessible. Coinbase Seeks SEC Approval to Trade Tokenized Stocks Trading tokenized stocks is currently not allowed in the U.S. For Coinbase to move ahead, it needs special approval from the SEC, which is called a “no-action letter.” This means the agency will not take legal action if the company offers the service. Coinbase is not registered as a broker-dealer, which is usually required to trade securities. In 2023, the SEC sued the exchange for acting like one without permission. However, the case was later dropped during President Trump’s administration. Coinbase’s top lawyer, Paul Grewal, recently said this is a significant priority. He did not confirm if the trading platform has officially asked the SEC yet, but said a no-action letter would give companies more confidence to move forward. Trump Administration Takes Softer Stance on Crypto Coinbase’s move comes as the U.S. government shifts to a more crypto-friendly approach. President Trump has supported the industry by meeting with crypto leaders at the White House and nominating pro-crypto regulators. This regulatory change has boosted confidence in the market. As a result, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have hit new highs this year as more investors get involved. Under Trump, the SEC has also dropped lawsuits against big crypto firms like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken. A new task force is now working on more explicit rules for digital assets, marking a fresh start for the industry.

The company is trying to raise $9.3 billion in a mix of debt and equity, but even before locking that down, more than half of it is already earmarked to be spent in just three months, based on deal terms shown to investors. That cash drain is tied to the company’s $13 billion projected burn rate for 2025—over $1 billion every month, without pause, according to Bloomberg. Elon’s company is behind the AI chatbot Grok, and despite all the buzz, it expects to make just $500 million in revenue this year. Meanwhile, OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, expects to rake in $12.7 billion in the same period. xAI struggles to match rivals while cash keeps vanishing Despite being backed by the world’s richest man, xAI is still fighting for air in an industry where hardware, not hype, decides who wins. The cost of building out AI infrastructure—which includes custom server farms and rare high-powered chips—is punishing. Harvey Schwartz, CEO of Carlyle Group, told shareholders that AI buildout globally will require $1.8 trillion by the end of the decade. All this has left startups like xAI burning through investor cash at a breakneck speed. “Model builders will look to raise debt and they’re going to burn lots and lots of cash,” said Jordan Chalfin, senior analyst and head of tech at CreditSights. “The space is very competitive, and they are battling for technical supremacy.” That battle is costing xAI more than it’s making. The company has been bleeding cash trying to catch up with better-funded and more established competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI, both of which have clearer monetization paths. Source: Bloomberg Elon’s team believes it has an edge, though, because it isn’t renting servers and chips like some competitors—it’s buying the infrastructure outright. That access comes from xAI’s ties to X, Elon’s social media company formerly known as Twitter. X bought up a large stash of specialized AI chips, and xAI now has direct access to them. Elon has also told investors that xAI plans to keep buying more chips. xAI leans on social media data and investor hype to stay afloat After merging with X, xAI is using the platform’s massive, constantly updating archive of user content to train its models. That lets them dodge the costs that come with paying for licensed datasets like others in the space. This setup is what has Elon’s team claiming xAI will be profitable by 2027. OpenAI, by comparison, expects cash flow positivity in 2029, per Bloomberg’s earlier report. That projection, mixed with Elon’s name recognition and political clout, has kept investors interested—at least for now. Before tensions recently rose between Elon and President Donald Trump, the company’s value was climbing. xAI’s valuation hit $80 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2025, up from $51 billion at the end of 2024. Notable investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, and VY Capital. But fundraising hasn’t come easily. Since its founding in 2023, xAI has raised $14 billion in equity. By the start of this year, just $4 billion of that was left. Internal forecasts expected almost all of it to be gone by the end of Q2. To stay ahead of the burn, xAI is now finalizing a new $4.3 billion equity round, and it’s already told investors it plans to raise another $6.4 billion in 2026. That’s not even counting the $5 billion in corporate debt that Morgan Stanley is helping xAI rais e. That debt is supposed to fund data center development. Unlike some competitors that choose to fund each project separately, Elon’s company is choosing to go big all at once. To ease the burn slightly, the company told investors it expects a $650 million rebate from one of its chip manufacturers. That won’t solve the problem but might buy them a bit more time. The original pitch didn’t go over well with some investors. Bloomberg said there were early signs of resistance to the deal’s terms. In response, xAI gave a few select investors a deeper look at its financials earlier this week. That helped. Interest improved after the company adjusted the terms to be more investor-friendly and closed the equity raise. Elon is racing to outrun the fire he started. Every dollar raised is already half-spent. The money’s flowing out faster than it’s coming in, and the company’s still betting everything on a future that hasn’t shown up yet.

Pi Network (PI) is facing a challenging stretch. On Tuesday, June 17, the token dropped 11%, hitting a daily low of $0.5311 and wiping out its gains from the previous few days. A generally negative market trend further dampened enthusiasm for the network’s latest updates. The two-day slide, which took Pi from a high of $0.6345 to its current level of $0.5450, began shortly after June 15. This timing coincided with an announcement that the .pi domain auctions would become a standalone app, separate from Pi mining. The news failed to spark interest among Pi holders. Most remain far more engaged with the network’s core mobile crypto “mining” feature, which rewards users for app activity. However, those rewards continue to decline . You might also like: Pi Network price prediction: technicals hint at possible 160% breakout This caused users to complain that rewards are so low that engaging with the network is no longer worthwhile. Some users noted that by March 20205, even diligent miners could now only earn 2.1 Pi per month, which was less than $2. As a declining mining rate is a core feature of the project, Pi Network will likely continue to bleed users and value. That is, unless the team inspires the users to become long-term holders and investors, instead of just trying to cash out their mining rewards.

This development underscores a growing trend among forward-thinking companies to integrate Bitcoin into their financial strategies. What Does This $250M Equity Facility Mean for Fold App? According to a press release via GlobeNewswire, Fold Holdings has entered into a $250 million equity purchase facility. This isn’t a direct cash injection upfront, but rather an agreement that allows Fold to sell up to $250 million worth of its equity (stock) to a specific investor over time, at Fold’s discretion. The key takeaway? Fold plans to use the vast majority of the proceeds generated from selling this equity primarily to acquire more Bitcoin for its corporate treasury . For users of the Fold App , which is known for offering Bitcoin rewards on everyday spending, this move signals a deepening commitment to the Bitcoin ecosystem. It positions Fold not just as a platform for earning Bitcoin, but as a company fundamentally aligned with Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Why Are Companies Building a Corporate Bitcoin Treasury? Fold isn’t the first company to strategically add Bitcoin to its balance sheet. MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, pioneered this approach, accumulating billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin. Other companies have followed suit, albeit on a smaller scale. The primary reasons companies opt for a corporate Bitcoin strategy often include: Hedge Against Inflation: Bitcoin’s fixed supply is seen by many as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Store of Value: Bitcoin is viewed as a digital gold, offering a durable store of value outside traditional financial systems. Growth Potential: Companies anticipate potential significant appreciation in Bitcoin’s value over time, boosting their balance sheet. Innovation and Signaling: Holding Bitcoin can signal a company’s forward-thinking approach and embrace of digital innovation. Fold’s decision to use a significant equity facility specifically for this purpose highlights the strategic importance they place on accumulating this digital asset. Understanding the Equity Facility Mechanism An equity purchase facility, also known as a committed equity facility or standby equity distribution agreement (SEDA), is a funding arrangement where a company (Fold) has the right, but not the obligation, to sell shares to an investor (the facility provider) over a set period and up to a maximum amount ($250 million). Here’s a simplified breakdown: Fold needs capital, in this case, to buy Bitcoin . They decide to draw down on the facility, selling a certain number of shares to the investor. The investor buys the shares, providing cash to Fold. Fold uses this cash to purchase Bitcoin for its corporate treasury . This process can be repeated until the $250 million limit is reached or the agreement expires. This method provides Fold with flexible access to capital, allowing them to raise funds when market conditions are favorable for selling equity and, subsequently, for buying Bitcoin . Analyzing Fold’s Specific Bitcoin Strategy Fold’s Bitcoin strategy appears multifaceted. Firstly, it’s about strengthening the company’s balance sheet with what they believe is a appreciating asset. This aligns with the broader corporate Bitcoin trend. Secondly, it could be seen as a strategic alignment with their core business. A company focused on rewarding users in Bitcoin naturally enhances its brand and mission by holding a significant amount of Bitcoin itself. It builds trust and demonstrates a long-term belief in the asset they promote. Thirdly, utilizing an equity facility offers flexibility. Fold can time their equity sales and subsequent Bitcoin purchases based on market conditions, potentially allowing them to acquire Bitcoin at opportune moments. Placing Fold’s Move in the Context of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Fold’s significant funding round specifically aimed at increasing its Institutional Bitcoin holdings is a strong indicator of the continued maturation and adoption of Bitcoin by corporate entities. While not as large as MicroStrategy’s holdings, a $250 million facility dedicated primarily to Bitcoin acquisition is a substantial commitment for a company like Fold. This move contributes to the overall narrative of Institutional Bitcoin adoption, showing that it’s not just large, publicly traded companies considering this asset class, but also growth-stage companies within the crypto ecosystem itself. Key Considerations: Benefits and Challenges Like any strategic financial decision, building a Crypto Treasury with a volatile asset like Bitcoin comes with potential benefits and challenges: Benefits: Enhanced Balance Sheet: Potential for significant asset appreciation if Bitcoin’s value increases. Strategic Alignment: Reinforces Fold’s brand identity as a Bitcoin-centric company. Inflation Hedge: Provides potential protection against the declining purchasing power of fiat currency. Flexibility: The equity facility allows for opportunistic funding and purchasing. Challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, potentially leading to significant paper losses on the balance sheet. Market Timing Risk: Deciding when to draw on the facility and when to buy Bitcoin involves market timing risk. Execution Risk: Successfully executing the equity facility agreement requires navigating financial markets. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for corporate crypto holdings is still evolving. Actionable Insights for the Reader What can we learn from Fold’s strategic move? Corporate Confidence: This action signals continued confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition among companies operating within the space. Alternative Funding: It demonstrates how companies are using innovative financial structures like equity facilities to fund strategic asset acquisitions. Alignment Matters: For companies whose business is tied to Bitcoin, holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet reinforces their commitment and vision. Risk is Present: While the potential upside is clear, the inherent volatility of Bitcoin means this strategy is not without risk. Conclusion: A Bold Step for Fold’s Bitcoin Strategy Fold’s securing of a $250 million equity facility with the primary goal of acquiring more Bitcoin for its corporate treasury is a powerful statement. It reflects a calculated Bitcoin strategy aimed at leveraging the potential growth of the digital asset while reinforcing the company’s identity within the ecosystem. This move adds another notable example to the growing list of companies embracing Institutional Bitcoin adoption, further solidifying Bitcoin’s position as a legitimate asset class for corporate balance sheets. As the Fold App continues to grow its user base, its own financial health, potentially boosted by a strong Crypto Treasury , could become an increasingly important factor.

While Trump said the U.S. would not target him “for now,” he called for Iran’s “unconditional surrender,” comments that reignited concerns about possible U.S. military involvement.

46228464,https://coinpaper.com/9602/ark-invest-dumps-52-m-in-circle-shares-signal-or-strategy,1750190239,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,ARK Invest Dumps $52M in Circle Shares—Signal or Strategy?,https://coinpaper.com/9602/ark-invest-dumps-52-m-in-circle-shares-signal-or-strategy,"Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest has sold $52 million worth of Circle (CRCL) shares just 11 days after the stablecoin giant’s blockbuster IPO, sparking debate over whether the move signals broader concerns about Circle’s valuation or is simply a textbook portfolio rebalance after explosive gains. The Sale: Timing, Size, and Context ARK offloaded 342,658 Circle shares across three of its flagship ETFs—ARK Innovation (ARKK), Next Generation Internet (ARKW), and Fintech Innovation (ARKF)—on June 16, 2025. This marks ARK’s first sale of Circle stock since acquiring 4.49 million shares at IPO, a stake then valued at $373 million. Despite the sale, ARK still holds over 4.15 million shares worth roughly $628 million, maintaining Circle as a top holding in its funds. The timing is notable: Circle’s stock price has soared nearly 5x from its $31 IPO price to close at $151, with an intraday high of $165.60—an astonishing 387% surge in less than two weeks. ARK’s average purchase price was around $96, meaning the firm locked in a 50% gain on this tranche. Is This a Red Flag for Circle’s Valuation? Some market watchers see ARK’s move as a classic case of profit-taking after a parabolic rally, not an indictment of Circle’s long-term prospects. ARK has a history of trimming positions after sharp run-ups—recently doing the same with Coinbase and Robinhood—while maintaining core exposure to high-conviction names. On the day of the Circle sale, ARK also reduced Meta holdings and added to Nvidia and DoorDash, underscoring its dynamic approach to portfolio management. Equity analysts are split on Circle’s outlook. Bulls point to Circle’s massive USDC ecosystem, strong regulatory compliance, and a capital-light, high-margin business model. Bears, however, warn that Circle’s revenues are highly sensitive to interest rates, with 99% of Q1 2025 net income coming from interest on USDC reserves. If rates fall or stablecoin competition heats up, Circle’s earnings could face pressure. Comparing to Other ARK Fintech Exits ARK’s Circle sale fits a broader pattern: the firm frequently trims fintech winners after major rallies, as seen with Coinbase, Robinhood, and others in 2024–2025. These moves are typically framed as risk management rather than a loss of faith in the underlying business. Circle remains a top-3 holding in ARKW and ARKF, just behind Coinbase. On-Chain USDC Velocity: What’s the Data Say? On-chain data shows USDC’s velocity—how often the stablecoin changes hands—has climbed steadily in 2025, rising from 3.45e-12 to 5.50e-12 in Q1 alone. This uptick signals growing usage in DeFi, payments, and institutional settlements, supporting bullish arguments for Circle’s long-term growth. USDC’s expansion to new blockchains like XRP Ledger and World Chain further boosts its utility and network effects. Analyst Commentary: Q3 Outlook for Circle Looking ahead, equity analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Some see Circle’s stock as a potential $300 candidate if USDC circulation and platform revenues continue to scale. Others urge caution, citing the risk of post-IPO insider selling and the company’s reliance on interest income. The consensus: Circle’s Q3 earnings and USDC adoption trends will be critical in justifying its lofty valuation. The Bottom Line ARK Invest’s $52 million Circle sale is more a sign of disciplined portfolio management than a red flag for Circle’s future. With USDC adoption rising and Circle’s stock still a core ARK holding, all eyes now turn to Q3 earnings—and whether the stablecoin leader can maintain its momentum in a fast-evolving fintech landscape.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|USDC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-17 19:57:19

He also discussed his crypto working group, designed to help guide policy on the crypto sector. Trump also mentioned legislation in Congress, where they are working with governors to pass the GENIUS Act that will support the creation of dollar-backed stablecoins. Additionally, he said they would seek to create simple market frameworks, allowing the US to dominate Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto. The appearance at the conference is the second time Trump has addressed the crypto sector since he took office. In March, he addressed a crypto summit in New York and attended the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville in person during the campaign. His addresses mark the first time a sitting US president has addressed the crypto sector, marking a major shift in policy at the federal level. As a result, with clear crypto market rules set to be adopted, it could take crypto to new heights. Amid this expected wave of capital that will flood the crypto sector, investors are looking for ways to grow their holdings to new heights. One of the most popular options being considered is presales. However, unlike past years, this time the focus is on utility, and not meme coins. A project that is popping up constantly in discussions is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is built to take decentralized finance (DeFi) to the next level. So far, analysts are quite upbeat about the project, forecasting massive gains when the MUTM tokens go live. A Deep Dive Into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project built for utility in the DeFi sector. It is designed as a decentralized non-custodial lending protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. When they join as lenders, they deposit the funds and begin to earn interest. The interest rate that they earn is based on the pool utilization rate. This rate is determined by measuring the assets in a communal pool being actively borrowed versus the total amount in that pool. Borrowers in the pools can choose between stable and variable rates. The stable rate is reserved for highly liquid tokens that have low volatility. When a borrower is granted a stable rate, it typically begins at a higher rate than the variable rate based on a time-weighted average. That accounts for the initial advantage that they get, and any changes in the future. If the variable rate gets much higher than the stable rate, it can be rebalanced to maintain fairness in the ecosystem and to protect protocol liquidity. Lenders get access to mtTokens when they deposit assets in a pool. For instance, if they deposit $1,400 worth of ADA in a pool, they receive mtADA tokens in return on a 1:1 ratio. These tokens are based on the ERC20 token standard and represent the value of the deposit, plus any accrued interest. The mtTokens make it easy for the holders to track the value of their assets in the pools on-chain. Additionally, it simplifies the process as users do not have to actively claim or compound their earnings in the pools over time. Details Of The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is currently in phase 5, and over $10.7 million worth of tokens have been sold so far. Tokens in the current phase are going for a 200% discount compared to the phase 1 price of $0.01. Despite this massive increase, over 38% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 have been sold, barely two weeks after they launched. The presale has seen passive participation numbers from investors seeking to benefit from the upcoming changes in crypto regulation. So far, around 12,100 unique buyers have secured their tokens. One of the main drivers of this growth is recent updates in the analysts’ forecasts. They now predict that MUTM tokens could rise by 2,550% once the tokens go live. Based on these forecasts, a $2,400 investment in the presale right now could grow into $61,200 when the tokens launch. One of the reasons why analysts are so optimistic about the presale is the planned beta version launch of the platform when it goes live. The beta version launch will occur on the token listing day, when the tokens are released for $0.06 each. That is expected to lead to a massive surge in the price of the tokens. However, if you wait until the token listing price, the return you could get will be half of what those who buy in the current phase can get. Bottom Line Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an exciting project in the presale phase that could deliver massive returns once it goes live. With an expected return of over 20x, it represents an opportunity to make up for any losses you may have suffered elsewhere in the crypto sector. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that you should not miss.

Matthew Sigel, the head of digital assets research at VanEck, says that no public BTC treasury companies have traded below their Bitcoin NAVs for a sustained period. However, Sigel notes that one company, the US medical tech firm Semler Scientific, is approaching parity. “As some of these companies raise capital through large at-the-market (ATM) programs to buy BTC, a risk is emerging: if the stock trades at or near NAV, continued equity issuance can dilute rather than create value. That is not capital formation. It is erosion. Companies pursuing a Bitcoin treasury strategy should adopt safeguards now, while premiums still exist. Some ideas: Announce pause to ATM issuance if the stock trades below 0.95 times NAV for 10 or more trading days. Prioritize buybacks when BTC appreciates, but the equity fails to reflect that value. Launch a strategic review if NAV discount persists. That might include a merger, spinoff, or sunset of the BTC strategy.” Sigel also argues that executive compensation should align with NAV per share growth, not with total share count or size of the Bitcoin position. “We’ve seen this movie before with the miners: persistent issuance and outsized executive pay. No need for a sequel. Once you are trading at NAV, shareholder dilution is no longer strategic. It is extractive. Boards and shareholders should act with discipline now, while they still have the benefit of optionality.” Last week, top pseudonymous trader DonAlt warned that he thinks Bitcoin treasury companies will be the source of massive selling pressure in the next bear market. “Bitcoin treasury companies… will be the reason for the next bear market being as violent as prior bear markets, and no one can convince me otherwise.

What happens when someone from the cutting edge of artificial intelligence decides to tackle the seemingly traditional world of payroll? That’s exactly the story behind Volante Chain, a new crypto payroll startup founded by a former OpenAI employee. From AI Frontiers to Blockchain Payroll Solutions Joey Bertschler, who previously worked at OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, made a significant pivot. His journey from a leading AI research lab to launching a blockchain payroll platform highlights a growing trend: leveraging cutting-edge technology to solve real-world financial problems. Bertschler’s decision wasn’t made lightly; reports suggest a level of disillusionment with the internal culture at OpenAI and perceived limitations for non-U.S. based staff played a role in his shift towards the fintech sector. This move underscores a belief that blockchain technology offers unique advantages, particularly in areas like payments and financial access, that even advanced AI alone cannot fully address. The focus shifted from developing large language models to building infrastructure that enables more equitable and efficient financial systems. What is Volante Chain and How Does it Work? Volante Chain is designed to disrupt traditional payroll systems by offering unprecedented speed and flexibility. At its core, the platform is built on blockchain technology, which provides a decentralized and transparent ledger for transactions. This is crucial for ensuring security and immutability in financial operations. Here’s a breakdown of key features: Daily Wage Access: Unlike traditional bi-weekly or monthly pay cycles, Volante Chain aims to give employees access to their earned wages on a daily basis. This is a game-changer for financial liquidity and planning. Crypto and AI Integration: The platform uses cryptocurrency for faster, potentially cross-border payments. It also incorporates AI, reportedly to assess employer risk and perhaps optimize payment processes. Blockchain Foundation: Leveraging blockchain ensures that payment records are secure, verifiable, and resistant to tampering. Global Reach: While currently testing in specific markets, the underlying technology is designed for global application, potentially addressing challenges in international payroll. The combination of crypto for swift transactions and AI for intelligent risk assessment creates a powerful synergy aimed at making payroll more dynamic and responsive to employee needs. Why Did an OpenAI Employee Make This Shift? Bertschler’s departure from a high-profile AI company to start a fintech startup in the payroll space is telling. While the original content mentions dissatisfaction with OpenAI’s culture and limitations for non-U.S. staff, it also points to a recognition of the potential for blockchain and crypto to solve fundamental financial problems that impact people globally. The desire to build something with tangible, immediate financial impact, especially for workers who might benefit most from flexible pay access, seems to be a driving force. It highlights that talent from even the most advanced tech sectors sees immense opportunity in applying blockchain solutions to improve existing financial infrastructure, particularly in areas underserved by traditional systems. Addressing the Need for Daily Wage Access The concept of daily wage access is perhaps the most compelling feature of Volante Chain. For many individuals, living paycheck to paycheck is a reality. Waiting two weeks or a month for earned income can lead to significant financial stress, reliance on predatory short-term loans, or difficulty managing unexpected expenses. Providing access to wages as they are earned can: Improve employee financial well-being. Reduce the need for payday loans. Increase employee satisfaction and retention for employers offering the service. Provide greater financial flexibility and control. Volante Chain’s approach, enabled by the speed and efficiency of crypto transactions on a blockchain, makes this daily access a practical possibility, moving beyond traditional banking limitations. Early Traction and Future Outlook Volante Chain is not just an idea; it’s already in the testing phase. The startup is currently running pilot programs with users in Vietnam and Japan. These markets represent diverse economic landscapes and regulatory environments, providing valuable testing grounds for the platform’s scalability and adaptability. The startup has also secured initial funding, raising $2 million from private investors. This capital injection provides a runway for development and operations. According to reports, this funding is expected to sustain the company for five years without needing additional investment, indicating confidence from early backers and a lean operational model. This early traction and solid financial backing position Volante Chain as a promising player in the evolving landscape where fintech, blockchain, and AI converge to redefine how people get paid. Conclusion: A Bold Step for Payroll Joey Bertschler’s transition from the cutting edge of AI at OpenAI to launching a crypto payroll platform like Volante Chain is a testament to the transformative potential of blockchain technology. By focusing on providing daily wage access through a secure and efficient blockchain payroll system, this new fintech startup addresses a fundamental need for financial flexibility in the modern workforce. Motivated by a desire for greater impact and perhaps a different work environment than found as an OpenAI employee , Bertschler’s venture is poised to challenge traditional payroll models. As Volante Chain continues its testing in key markets and leverages its initial funding, it will be fascinating to watch how this innovative approach reshapes the future of how we get paid.

According to the analyst, the 2-hour chart is beginning to shape a potential double bottom pattern. Should this structure be confirmed, it might signal a renewed upward push for DOGE, catching the interest of short-term traders and long-term holders. Make-or-Break Moment For Dogecoin: The Neckline Battle Ahead Dogecoin is currently displaying the characteristics of a double bottom formation, a classic reversal setup that could signal a shift in momentum, as noted by Crypto Sat. The first bottom was established around the $0.170 mark, following a significant price drop, where buyers initially stepped in to defend the zone. Related Reading: Dogecoin Must Hold This Level—Or Risk A 30% Price Crash Shortly after, DOGE made a move back down for a second test of the same support area, with a higher low structure forming, suggesting weakening bearish pressure and the emergence of early accumulation. The key area to watch is the neckline resistance, which sits in the $0.198 to $0.200 range. Crypto Sat emphasizes that a breakout above the neckline would serve as strong technical confirmation of a shift in market sentiment. If bulls manage to push through, it might open the door for a sustained upward rally, as traders gain confidence in the reversal setup taking hold. Here Are Key Signals To Watch In the analysis, Crypto Sat has outlined several key signals to watch as Dogecoin’s price action tightens. One early bullish sign, he notes, is the rising volume on the second bottom, a subtle but important clue that buyers may be stepping in with growing conviction. Volume often leads price, and this uptick could mark the start of renewed upward momentum. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Out Of Bull Pennant—What’s The Target? The crucial level to monitor is the resistance zone around $0.200. A strong breakout above this zone could trigger a technical shift, paving the way for a potential rally toward the $0.220 and $0.230 range. Such a move would confirm the double bottom formation and likely attract more bullish participation as confidence builds. However, if price fails to break through the neckline, support around $0.165 becomes the next critical level. A bounce from that zone would keep the pattern alive, but a clean drop below it could invalidate the setup and suggest further downside risk. Sharing his personal outlook, Crypto Sat believes DOGE may be positioning for a breakout, but cautions traders to be patient. “Let the neckline decide the next big move,” he advises, underscoring the importance of watching for confirmation before making aggressive plays.

Brazil is taking a significant step towards potentially integrating Bitcoin into its national financial strategy. A bill proposing the allocation of a portion of the country’s foreign exchange reserves to Bitcoin has successfully navigated its initial legislative hurdle. This move, if fully enacted, could position Brazil as a major player in the sovereign adoption of digital assets. What is the Brazil Bitcoin Reserve Bill (RESBiT)? The core of this legislative push is Bill 4501/2023, known as the RESBiT initiative. This proposal outlines a plan to allocate up to 5% of Brazil’s foreign exchange reserves into Bitcoin. Foreign exchange reserves are assets held by a central bank or monetary authority, usually in foreign currencies like the US dollar, Euro, or Yen, along with gold and other financial instruments. They serve crucial purposes such as stabilizing the national currency, managing liquidity, and providing confidence in the country’s financial stability. The idea behind RESBiT is to diversify these reserves by including Bitcoin. The bill has recently passed its first committee stage, a critical step in the long legislative process. This initial success signals growing interest and potential acceptance within Brazilian political circles regarding the strategic role of Bitcoin. Why Would Brazil Consider Bitcoin Reserves? Allocating national reserves to a volatile asset like Bitcoin is a bold move. Several potential motivations could be driving this initiative: Diversification: Reducing reliance on traditional reserve assets and currencies. Inflation Hedge: Viewing Bitcoin as a potential store of value against inflation, similar to gold. Innovation and Technology Adoption: Signaling Brazil’s embrace of digital assets and blockchain technology. Attracting Investment: Potentially making Brazil a more attractive destination for cryptocurrency businesses and investors. Strategic Positioning: Following the lead of other nations or positioning Brazil as a leader in the digital asset space. The proposal suggests a maximum allocation of 5%, indicating a cautious approach rather than a full pivot. This percentage allows for exposure to Bitcoin’s potential upside while limiting the overall risk to the nation’s critical foreign exchange reserves. How Does This Compare to El Salvador’s Bitcoin Strategy? If Bill 4501/2023 becomes law, Brazil would become the second Latin American nation to formally adopt a Bitcoin reserve strategy at the sovereign level, following El Salvador. However, the approaches differ significantly. El Salvador: Made Bitcoin legal tender, acquired significant Bitcoin holdings directly using state funds, and built infrastructure like the Chivo wallet. Their strategy is more integrated into the national economy and aims for broader adoption. Brazil: The RESBiT bill focuses specifically on allocating a portion of existing foreign exchange reserves. It does not propose making Bitcoin legal tender or integrating it directly into daily transactions for citizens on the same scale as El Salvador. It’s primarily a reserve management strategy. Brazil’s potential move is less about making Bitcoin a currency for its citizens and more about treating it as a strategic asset within its national treasury management. This distinction is crucial when evaluating the potential impact and goals of the RESBiT initiative. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges of Bitcoin Reserves? Adding Bitcoin to national reserves comes with potential rewards and significant risks. Potential Benefits: Exposure to a high-growth asset class. Potential hedge against global economic instability or currency devaluation. Increased financial sovereignty by holding an asset not tied to any single government or central bank. Setting a precedent for other nations, potentially increasing Bitcoin’s global legitimacy. Potential Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is known for dramatic swings, which could impact the value of reserves. Security: Ensuring the secure storage of private keys for national Bitcoin holdings is paramount and complex. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for Bitcoin is still evolving. Public and Political Opposition: Skepticism about Bitcoin’s stability and utility could lead to significant internal debate. Liquidity: While Bitcoin is highly liquid, managing large national holdings during times of crisis could present unique challenges. The 5% allocation proposed in the RESBiT bill suggests an awareness of these challenges, aiming for a balance between potential upside and risk mitigation for Brazil’s financial stability. What Happens Next for the Bitcoin Bill in Brazil? Passing the first committee stage is a positive signal, but it is only one step in a multi-stage legislative journey in Brazil. The bill must proceed through other relevant committees, potentially undergo revisions, and ultimately face votes in both houses of the Brazilian National Congress before it can be signed into law by the President. The process can be lengthy and is subject to political dynamics and public opinion. Monitoring the progress of Bill 4501/2023 through the Brazilian legislature will be key for anyone interested in the intersection of national finance and digital assets. The debates and discussions surrounding this bill could also influence how other nations perceive and potentially approach their own Bitcoin reserves or digital asset strategies. Conclusion: Brazil’s Bold Step in the World of Bitcoin Reserves Brazil’s advancement of the RESBiT bill marks a significant moment in the global conversation around sovereign Bitcoin adoption. While distinct from El Salvador’s approach, the potential allocation of foreign exchange reserves to Bitcoin signals a growing recognition of digital assets at the highest levels of national finance. The journey for this bill is far from over, but its initial success highlights a willingness within Brazil to explore innovative strategies for managing national wealth in an increasingly digital world. The outcome of this legislative process could have ripple effects, encouraging further discussion and potential action from other countries considering the role of Bitcoin in their own reserve strategies.

Currently trading at $2.19, XRP is holding a critical level that could determine whether it confirms a long-term bullish reversal or slips back into consolidation. Seven Years in the Making: The Technical Landscape Van Lagen’s analysis is built on a rare and powerful pattern: a seven-year double-bottom formation, visible on the two-week chart. This pattern began with a major low of around $0.11 in March 2020, followed by a surge to $1.96 in April 2021. XRP then dipped again to $0.29 in mid-2022 before rallying back near $2.00 by the end of 2024, completing a textbook “W”-shaped bottom. Top analyst @GertvanLagen says $XRP is on the edge of a massive breakout. Only the patient will win the impatient are about to face the toughest test of their lives. Are you ready? pic.twitter.com/Tihywn50uJ — Amonyx (@amonbuy) June 17, 2025 But that’s not all. Running parallel to the double bottom is an ascending triangle, a bullish continuation pattern marked by rising support levels and a horizontal resistance band around the $2 mark. These two technical formations overlapping at the same price level only strengthen the bullish case. The $2 Level: A Pivotal Breakout Zone The $2 price point isn’t just another resistance. It’s the neckline for both the double-bottom and ascending triangle patterns—a critical threshold that XRP broke in December 2024, rallying to as high as $3.40 in January 2025. Since then, XRP has pulled back to retest the $2 level multiple times and continues to find support there. This successful retest is crucial. According to traditional technical analysis, when a breakout is followed by a confirmed support retest, it often paves the way for a sustained rally. Price Target: $38 and Beyond? Based on the height of the double-bottom formation, van Lagen projects a conservative target of $38, an increase of more than 1,600% from current levels. He draws parallels with the 2013–2017 cycle, where XRP far surpassed its technical targets, suggesting that even $38 might be modest if bullish momentum builds. While many price predictions are often driven by hype, van Lagen’s projection is grounded in long-term structural patterns and historical performance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Legal Clarity and Growing Fundamentals The optimism isn’t limited to technicals. Ripple’s legal battle against the U.S. SEC is approaching a critical stage; a favorable ruling on the motion before the court will be vital to removing a cloud of regulatory uncertainty that loomed for years, and XRP will be better positioned for broader institutional adoption. That said, recent on-chain data shows a rise in open interest, much of it likely driven by leverage, suggesting a mix of speculative activity. While this can boost price action in the short term, it also adds risk and volatility. The Final Test of Patience Van Lagen’s thesis, amplified by Amonyx, comes with a clear warning: patience is essential. XRP’s $2–$3 range may act as a pressure zone, shaking out short-term traders before a true breakout. But for those willing to wait, the setup could lead to a once-in-a-cycle move. The technical and fundamental pieces are aligning. With XRP hovering just above its critical neckline, the market may soon decide its next chapter. As Amonyx put it, “Are you ready?” For many XRP holders, this could be the moment they’ve been waiting for. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

33767162,[object Object],1750194058,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin CDD Momentum Turns Negative – Experienced Holders Pause Selling,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-cdd-momentum-turns-negative-experienced-holders-pause-selling/,"Bitcoin is currently consolidating in a tight range between two major historical price levels—the all-time high (ATH) of $112,000 and the previous cycle’s peak at $103,600, set back in December. Despite heightened global tensions, particularly the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, Bitcoin has held firm above key demand zones, signaling strong bullish intent even in an uncertain macro environment. Market participants are closely watching this consolidation phase, as it may serve as the base for Bitcoin’s next expansive move. Bulls appear confident, with price action showing resilience against multiple dips, and strong buyer interest emerging near the $104K mark. Supporting this bullish structure, fresh insights from CryptoQuant reveal a notable decline in CDD (Coin Days Destroyed) Momentum below the zero level over recent weeks. This metric, which compares the average CDD over the past 30 days to that of the previous month, highlights a reduction in spending activity by long-term holders. Historically, this kind of behavior reflects conviction among experienced investors and often signals the start of new accumulation phases . Bitcoin Fundamentals Strengthen Amid Volatility And Uncertainty Bitcoin continues to confuse both bulls and bears as it consolidates within a tight range, failing to produce a clear breakout or breakdown. While short-term traders remain on edge, Bitcoin’s fundamentals appear to be strengthening beneath the surface. Institutional adoption is on the rise, long-term supply is tightening, and the amount of BTC held on centralized exchanges continues to decline—a classic sign of increased investor confidence and long-term accumulation. Meanwhile, global tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty remain elevated. The Middle East conflict between Israel and Iran has shaken markets, while fears of rising inflation and US Treasury yields add additional pressure. Furthermore, geopolitical shifts in global trade dynamics are fueling a volatile environment. Yet, Bitcoin appears to thrive in this chaos, reinforcing its narrative as an emerging store of value and alternative to traditional financial systems. CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler shared key insights into this long-term strength by analyzing the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) Momentum indicator. This metric measures how actively long-held coins are moving. A drop below zero typically signals reduced selling from long-term holders, indicating accumulation rather than distribution. In recent weeks, CDD Momentum has shown a sustained decline below the zero level, aligning with a notable slowdown in older coin transfers. After multiple local peaks earlier in the year, this cooling-off period suggests that experienced investors are now stepping back from the market, not by exiting, but by choosing to hold. This behavior historically precedes significant upside momentum. If Bitcoin maintains its current support levels and long-term holders continue to stay sidelined, it could set the stage for a powerful breakout and the beginning of a new leg up in the cycle. BTC Price Analysis: Bulls Hold Support After Rejecting $109K Bitcoin is currently trading around $106,127 after rejecting resistance near the $109,300 level, as shown in the 4-hour chart. The price attempted to reclaim that key resistance zone but failed to gain momentum, leading to a brief pullback. Despite the rejection, BTC is still holding above the 200-period moving average (red line) and the $106,000 mark, which now acts as short-term support. Volume remains relatively stable, suggesting that the market is in a wait-and-see mode amid broader uncertainty. The 50 SMA (blue) and 100 SMA (green) have flattened, highlighting the consolidation pattern that has formed between $103,600 and $109,300. This range continues to dominate short-term price action, with bulls defending the lower boundary and bears rejecting higher levels. A sustained move above $109,300 would open the door for a test of the all-time high at $112,000 and potentially begin a price discovery phase. Conversely, if BTC loses the $103,600 support zone, downside targets could shift toward $100,000. Until a breakout occurs, this range remains key for short-term traders. Consolidation near key moving averages and support levels suggests that bulls still have a strong grip, but volatility remains a constant risk as macro conditions unfold.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Whale buys $127m in ETH during dip, boosting confidence as options expiry and global tensions shake markets. Ethereum (ETH) is hovering around $2,547 and sparking major interest after a whale scooped up 48,825 ETH for $127 million, at an average of $2,605. This large purchase came during a short dip in price, largely due to global tensions and option expiries, signaling solid long-term confidence. The same investor had already profited $30 million from previous ETH trades, confirming this wasn’t a gamble. Middle East concerns and the expiry of over 242,000 ETH options on Deribit led to market jitters, but the whale’s buy-in helped stabilize sentiment. With a current put-call ratio at 1.20 and a max pain point at $2,700, many believe a strategic move is underway.

With President Donald Trump back in the Oval Office and openly demanding interest rate cuts, and with the Israel-Iran conflict threatening global oil prices, Chair Jerome Powell is surrounded on all sides. But despite the chaos, no one expects a rate change this week. The main focus is on what Powell says about the rest of 2025. Investors want to know if the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will still forecast two cuts this year, how inflation expectations are evolving, and how Powell responds to Trump’s calls for looser policy. The Fed’s messaging will carry more weight than any actual move. FOMC will reveal rate expectations as markets look for clues The key feature tomorrow will be the dot plot, where all FOMC members submit their interest rate forecasts. In March, the group predicted two quarter-point cuts in 2025. But that was a narrow outcome. Just two members changing their votes could drop the forecast to one cut. That could move markets. The meeting is happening in a tense geopolitical climate. Trump’s tariff threats haven’t moved prices much yet, but no one knows what the impact will be later. At the same time, the Israel-Iran war is raising concerns about oil supply and inflation. That conflict adds more uncertainty to every policy decision the Fed will make. Powell is expected to repeat the same message from May: the Fed isn’t in a rush to act. But that posture could change fast if the data moves. A key issue is inflation. While the unemployment rate is still low at 4.2%, the May jobs report showed hiring is slowing. Inflation data has also stayed soft despite tariffs. The Fed may not act yet, but it’s watching. Robert Kaplan, former Dallas Fed President, said in a CNBC interview, “We’re in a disinflating world. If it weren’t for these prospective tariffs that will flow through and are flowing through, I think the Fed would be on their front foot looking to cut rates.” Powell likely to hold firm as Trump increases pressure Markets are betting the next rate cut will come in September, a year after the Fed’s last move. In 2024, the FOMC cut rates by half a point in response to labor weakness, then made two more quarter-point cuts before pausing. Since then, inflation has stayed low and the economy hasn’t shown major signs of damage. David Mericle, an economist at Goldman Sachs, said the firm still expects one cut this year. “Aside from the tariffs, the inflation news has actually been fairly soft,” he wrote. He added that if the Fed cuts this year, it likely won’t happen until December because the full effects of tariffs will still be fresh in the summer inflation data. Goldman also expects new economic projections. Inflation expectations for 2025 could rise to 3%, up from 2.8% in March. GDP could be revised slightly lower to 1.5%, and unemployment could move up to 4.5%. These are small moves, but markets will watch closely. Another factor shaping the Fed’s path is Powell’s term. He leaves office in May 2026, giving him just eight more meetings. History shows Fed chairs tend to take a cautious stance in their final stretch. Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, noted that “The last 3 Fed Chairs—Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and Janet Yellen—all ended their terms on a hawkish note.” Colas said Powell is continuing that pattern, “focused on exiting the job with his inflation-fighting credibility and political independence intact.” That legacy concern may explain why Powell isn’t rushing to cut even with slow inflation and weak job growth. Trump’s demands could complicate things, especially if new tariffs kick in, but the Fed wants to be seen as independent. Right now, traders expect two cuts by the end of 2025, but more recently, the odds have moved toward just one. That reflects the market’s view that Powell won’t act unless absolutely necessary.

A deep dive into the data reveals a significant disconnect between the network’s booming on-chain activity and its recent price action, a dynamic that some analysts see as a potential long-term opportunity.

Qubetics ($TICS), Hedera (HBAR), and SUI (SUI) are each advancing a new standard for blockchain infrastructure. SUI remains near the $3.00 level despite a recent 2.9% decline, while Hedera is working to break past the $0.160 resistance level. The competition among leading protocols is intensifying, making the search for the best crypto to buy now more relevant than ever. Among them, Qubetics ($TICS) is approaching the close of its public sale, signaling a pivotal shift in digital finance participation. While many projects have attempted to address real-world asset tokenization, they have often relied on centralized trust layers or inefficient processes. Qubetics moves beyond these limitations with a Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace that ensures programmable, transparent, and transferable ownership—on-chain and without intermediaries. These innovations are placing $TICS in a strong position as one of the best crypto to buy now. Qubetics Transforms Asset Ownership and Investment Through Tokenization and a Dynamic Digital Marketplace Qubetics is revolutionizing traditional finance and investment by harnessing the power of tokenization through its blockchain-based marketplace. By enabling financial institutions to deploy their own native tokens on the Qubetics blockchain, the platform offers unprecedented flexibility and control. These institutions can tailor tokens to specific use cases, such as internal settlements, customer reward programs, or custom financial products, thereby gaining full control over distribution and utility. At the core of the Qubetics platform lies its tokenized assets marketplace, which unlocks new avenues for ownership and investment. By converting physical and digital assets—such as real estate, commodities, and intellectual property—into tradable digital tokens, Qubetics introduces the concept of fractional ownership. This allows investors to access high-value assets in smaller portions, democratizing access to wealth-generating opportunities that were once limited to large institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals. The marketplace acts as a vibrant ecosystem, offering a broad selection of tokenized assets to cater to a wide range of investor preferences and risk appetites. Each tokenized asset is designed to provide diversification, stability, or innovation, empowering users to build portfolios that align with their unique financial goals. One of the key challenges Qubetics addresses is the limited liquidity and opacity that plague traditional asset markets. By introducing a transparent and efficient secondary market for tokenized assets, the platform facilitates seamless trading, increased liquidity, and easier portfolio management. This not only accelerates asset value appreciation but also provides investors with greater flexibility and more opportunities to realize financial gains. Only 10M Tokens Left: Why Qubetics Could Be the Best Crypto Buy Right Now Currently, Qubetics has raised over $18 million in its crypto presale , with more than 28,000 unique token holders and 516 million $TICS tokens already sold. As of now, only 10 million tokens remain at the fixed price of $0.3370. The protocol recently executed a supply overhaul, slashing the total supply from 4 billion to 1.36 billion, enhancing scarcity and token value. By allocating 38.55% of its supply to the public sale, Qubetics ensures real decentralization—empowering its community to influence governance and utility from the ground up. With a approximately 20% listing price jump to $0.40 and analyst projections placing $TICS between $5 to $10 post-mainnet, $1,000 in today’s presale could realistically translate into $15,000–$30,000. Early participants are racing the clock—and every $TICS acquired now represents ownership in a protocol designed for the future of tokenized finance. If there’s one best crypto to buy now, this could be it. Hedera (HBAR): Momentum Returns Amid Technical Resistance Hedera has spent much of this year fluctuating between hopeful uptrends and bearish retreat. Currently priced below $0.160, it finds itself pinned under a strong resistance zone. Technical indicators present a nuanced picture: while short-term exponential moving averages still trail long-term ones—a bearish sign—the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has surged from an oversold 26.6 to a neutral 50.39, suggesting increased buying appetite. One of the reasons Hedera is considered among the best crypto to buy now by infrastructure-focused communities is its use of the Hashgraph consensus. Despite these strengths, the market isn’t giving HBAR an easy runway. The Bollinger Band Trend at –12.41 indicates rising volatility and potential downward continuation. For traders seeking a bullish confirmation, $0.160 is the critical breakout point. Failure to close above could send HBAR back toward the $0.150 level. However, the mixed technical picture may also present a low-risk entry for those seeking accumulation during consolidation. SUI (SUI): High Liquidity, Low Volatility, and Steady Climb SUI continues to intrigue analysts and participants alike with its unique Move-based programming and parallel execution model. Sitting tightly around $3.00 today—with an intraday high of $3.15 and low of $2.95—it’s clear the market is cautiously optimistic. Trading volume ranges between $800 million to $1 billion, reflecting high liquidity and serious engagement from participants. SUI’s circulating supply stands at 3.4 billion tokens, roughly 34% of the full 10 billion supply. This puts its market cap near $10.3 billion and an FDV of approximately $30 billion. Since its all-time high of $5.35 in January 2025, SUI has corrected around 44%, yet remains up 700% from its October 2023 low. In short, SUI has weathered market rotations without losing its edge. It’s being discussed widely among those tracking the best crypto to buy now. Final Thoughts: Choose with Precision While the Window Is Open In a market full of noise, clarity comes from substance—and Qubetics ($TICS), Hedera, and SUI are offering it in distinct ways. For those seeking real-world impact, Qubetics is taking tokenization beyond theory and turning it into usable infrastructure. With its final presale stage closing fast, and a 20% ROI already baked into listing, the moment to act is now. Hedera stands at a crossroads, backed by strong architecture and signs of technical stabilization. SUI maintains a firm hold with solid liquidity and long-term potential. All three projects deserve their place in conversations around the best crypto to buy now , but only one offers a ticking countdown with an immediate upside—Qubetics. This is a rare moment in crypto where timing, technology, and opportunity align. The next question isn’t whether these projects will grow—it’s whether action was taken in time. Secure your $TICS before the listing, explore HBAR for mid-term consolidation strategies, and watch SUI for long-haul dominance. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com/ Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics/ Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics/ FAQs What makes Qubetics ($TICS) different from Hedera and SUI in solving real-world blockchain problems? Qubetics focuses on tokenizing real-world assets with precision, enabling secure, transparent, and decentralized ownership unlike traditional digital tokens. Is Qubetics ($TICS) presale still open, and how much is left to buy? Yes, Qubetics is in its final presale phase with only 10 million tokens remaining at $0.3370 before the listing price increases by 20%. How does SUI’s current market position compare with Hedera in terms of supply and technical indicators? SUI holds a stronger position by market cap and liquidity, while Hedera is facing short-term bearish pressure but shows signs of technical stabilization.

Pump.fun Fee Revenue Sold; On-Chain Data Points to Anticipation According to blockchain analytics firm LookOnChain , Pump.fun has systematically converted its fee revenue by selling approximately 4.1 million SOL tokens worth $741 million at an average price of around $180 since May 2024. Source: LookOnChain The platform deposited 3.84 million SOL worth $699 million directly to Kraken exchange while converting an additional 264,373 SOL into $41.64 million USDC, demonstrating the scale of value extraction from its user base. This revenue generation occurs despite data showing that 99.6% of traders on the platform have failed to realize profits exceeding $10,000, with only 293 wallets out of 13.55 million total addresses achieving earnings above $1 million. OK. • If you've realized $1,000,000 trading pumpfun's you're a top 0.00217% wallet. • If you've realized $100,000 trading pumpfun's tokens you're a top 0.048% wallet. • If you've realized $10,000 trading pumpfun's tokens you're a top 0.412% wallet. https://t.co/LnOwFfs2kk — Adam (@Adam_Tehc) January 9, 2025 The controversy surrounding Pump.fun extends far beyond financial metrics, encompassing serious concerns about its live-streaming feature, which has been linked to disturbing content. The platform initially suspended its live-streaming capabilities in November 2024 after users began broadcasting increasingly extreme content designed to manipulate token prices. However, it quietly reintroduced the feature to 5% of users in April 2025, promising enhanced moderation systems, but failed to deliver. The Dark Side of Memecoin Mania: From Profits to Peril Pump.fun’s rise since its January 2024 launch has transformed it into a dominant force within the Solana ecosystem, processing over $66 billion in cumulative trading volume while launching an estimated 27,305 new tokens daily as of recent data. Source: Dune Source: Dune The platform’s fee structure reveals the stark asymmetry between user losses and platform profits. Pump.fun collects a 0.25% fee on every trade and has recently introduced an additional revenue-sharing model that directs 0.05% of trading fees to token creators . This new structure has drawn criticism for potentially rewarding malicious developers who abandon their projects after initial launches, commonly known as “rug pulls.” This system incentivizes the creation of low-quality tokens designed purely for quick profit extraction rather than genuine utility or community building. The human cost of Pump.fun’s operations extends beyond financial losses to documented cases of psychological distress and harmful behavior broadcast on the platform’s livestreaming feature. Hey @pumpdotfun there is currently someone using your livestreams to threaten to hang themselves if the coin does not reach a set marketcap. Absolutely heinous and It needs to come down + see if you can get them help. Shut down the livestream feature. This is out of control. — Beau (@beausecurity) November 25, 2024 In fact, it was reported that users were threatening self-harm or violence if their tokens failed to reach specific price targets. Regulatory Pressure Makes Pump.fun’s Future Uncertain The recent suspension of Pump.fun’s X account alongside several other memecoin-related platforms shows growing regulatory and platform pressure on the industry’s most controversial corners. While X has not officially disclosed the reasons for the suspension, speculation centers on potential violations related to unauthorized API usage, SEC investigations, or the platform’s connection to securities law violations. https://t.co/BB5leCKHRh allegedly sold unregistered securities disguised as meme tokens. #Pump .fun #memecoins #UnregisteredSecurities https://t.co/gNnyRynRWx — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 31, 2025 Pump.fun already faces a lawsuit alleging securities law violations for selling unregistered securities disguised as meme tokens. It also faces scrutiny for promoting “highly volatile” financial instruments to retail investors. The timing of the X suspension proves particularly problematic for Pump.fun’s reported $1 billion fundraising plans , as the platform relied heavily on social media for user engagement and token promotion. Sources familiar with the matter indicate that the token sale would value the company at $4 billion, potentially making it one of the top 30 cryptocurrency projects by valuation.

(NYSE: JPM) has unveiled its permissioned stablecoin on the Base network, a top-tier Ethereum (ETH)-based layer two scaling solution backed by Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN). The well-established bank, with around $4 trillion in assets under management (AUM), intends to offer stablecoins services to approved institutional clients. “Kinexys by JPMorgan is launching JPMD, a USD deposit token for institutional clients, on Base. It will be the first token of its kind on a public blockchain, enabling fast, secure, 24/7 money movement between trusted parties,” Base noted . JPMorgan Enters Stablecoins Market On Time After many years of criticizing Bitcoin and the digital asset market, JPMorgan has fully embraced the nascent technology to remain relevant in the future. On Tuesday, the U.S. Senate is expected to pass the GENIUS Act , which will regulate the stablecoins industry. According to Scott Bessent, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, the Stablecoins market could grow from its current $261 billion to about $3.7 trillion by the end of this decade. “A thriving stablecoin ecosystem will drive demand from the private sector for US Treasuries, which back stablecoins. This newfound demand could lower government borrowing costs and help rein in the national debt,” Bessent noted .

The company disclosed that it increased its corporate Bitcoin treasury from 66 BTC to 100 BTC, an addition of 34 BTC worth approximately $3.42 million, which brings the total value of its holdings to $10.06 million at an average purchase price of $100,600 per Bitcoin. Genius Group Ramps Up Bitcoin Treasury The move comes just weeks after a US Court of Appeals ruling on May 6 lifted restrictions that had temporarily blocked the firm from acquiring additional Bitcoin due to a legal dispute tied to its merger with FatBrain AI. The company resumed its BTC accumulation on May 22 with a $2.7 million investment, a move that signals a broader return to its Bitcoin Treasury Reserve Strategy. The Singapore-based firm has reaffirmed its long-term ambition to grow its holdings to 1,000 BTC, which aligns with a rising trend of institutional adoption amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. In an official statement , Genius Group CEO, Roger Hamilton, said, “We’re pleased to be able to have regained the right to manage our company’s capital in the way our Board and shareholders sees fit. Our 100 Bitcoin milestone is a significant step towards our 1,000 Bitcoin target.” Genius Group suffered a turbulent period earlier this year when it was legally forced to downsize its treasury amid ongoing litigation. In April, the company began liquidating part of its Bitcoin reserves after a US District Court order barred it from raising capital or investing in BTC. At the time, Hamilton criticized the court’s ruling as being rooted in false statements and financial coercion, and claimed the legal actions were orchestrated by individuals already facing fraud allegations. From Crisis to Comeback Data from Google Finance shows that Genius Group’s share price has fallen sharply in 2025, dropping by 68% from highs above $0.70 in early January to a low near $0.22 in April, which closely mirrored the timeline of the company’s legal challenges. However, the stock has shown signs of recovery in recent weeks, trading at $0.36 as of June 17. The modest rebound suggests renewed investor confidence following the May court ruling.

According to a post on X , Gemini accuses the agency of running a seven-year campaign of “lawfare” instead of properly enforcing regulations. Gemini Claims CFTC Spent Years Making False Accusations In the filing, Gemini claims that the CFTC has spent years making false accusations against the crypto platform while ignoring real problems in the digital asset world. The complaint says the regulator used unreliable testimony from a former employee who is no longer credible and has not shown any proof of intentional wrongdoing after seven years of investigation. As U.S. lawmakers and agencies discuss the future of cryptocurrency rules, this lawsuit could influence how regulations are applied in the digital asset industry. The case highlights the frustration among crypto companies that want fair and consistent rules instead of what they see as harsh enforcement without proper procedure. Gemini’s Regulatory Hurdles: A Case of Misrepresentation? The controversy dates back to 2017 when the brainchild of the Winklevoss twins submitted proposals to the CFTC to launch futures contracts for Bitcoin (BTC). The CFTC alleged that the exchange misrepresented critical safeguards to prevent price manipulation. These safeguards were supposed to form the backbone of a trusted financial product, yet the regulator argued Gemini fell short of expectations. Fast-forward to January 2025. Weeks before a trial was set to unravel in Manhattan federal court, Gemini and the CFTC struck a deal. Gemini agreed to pay $5 million to settle the claims , neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing. This settlement underscores the legal tightrope walked by crypto firms aiming to push boundaries while facing increasing scrutiny. SEC Sues Gemini for Earn Program Recall that the Winklevoss brothers’ crypto exchange was under intense scrutiny a few years ago. The scrutiny concerned their Earn Program , which ordinarily allowed users to earn interest on their assets. All they had to do was lend the crypto assets to Genesis Global Capital, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG). However, the program turned negative when FTX imploded in 2022, and Gemini Earn users could not access their funds. It got worse when the US SEC sued both Gemini and Genesis, citing that Gemini Earn was an unregistered offering of securities. On the progress of the Earn Program, the exchange has paid out a $50 million settlement to compensate the investors.

As geopolitical tensions rise and global markets grapple with uncertainty, risk assets like BTC have faced increased pressure. Yet despite this turbulent backdrop, Bitcoin has managed to maintain its footing above key support levels, demonstrating notable resilience. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Continues – Altseason May Follow A Clean Break Above Resistance Currently trading just under its all-time high, Bitcoin is in a consolidation phase that many analysts view as the calm before a potential breakout. Top analyst Rekt Capital shared insights indicating that the final major Weekly resistance, which has previously capped price rallies, may now be weakening as a point of rejection. If confirmed, this shift could signal a critical turning point in the market structure and open the door to price discovery. Investors are watching closely as BTC holds strong while macro headwinds—including rising US Treasury yields and fears of energy disruptions—continue to swirl. With the broader market bracing for further developments in the Middle East, Bitcoin’s ability to maintain higher lows and approach resistance with momentum suggests that the bulls may soon reclaim full control. The coming days could prove pivotal for the next phase of BTC’s market cycle. Bitcoin Awaits Clarity As Middle East Tensions Shape Market Sentiment The conflict between Israel and Iran continues to dominate headlines and exert influence over global markets. As tensions escalate, investors remain cautious, closely monitoring geopolitical developments and their macroeconomic ripple effects. In this uncertain environment, Bitcoin has entered a consolidation phase, with neither bulls nor bears fully in control. The lack of a clear direction stems from diverging investor expectations. Optimistic market participants anticipate that a diplomatic resolution may be reached in the coming days or weeks. A peace deal could reduce market anxiety, drive oil prices lower, and reignite momentum across risk assets—Bitcoin included. On the other hand, more cautious investors fear that the situation could worsen. Prolonged conflict may spark volatility in the energy sector, push inflation higher, and strain economic stability, particularly in regions dependent on oil imports. This week may prove decisive for Bitcoin’s next major move. Price action remains tightly bound, but all eyes are on the long-standing Weekly resistance. According to Rekt Capital, the final major Weekly resistance—once a strong rejection point—now appears to be weakening. This shift in structure suggests that Bitcoin may be preparing for a breakout into price discovery territory, should macro conditions stabilize. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Key Range Support – Bulls Set Sights on Higher Levels BTC Price Holds Above Key Support Amid Consolidation The 12-hour chart for Bitcoin shows that BTC continues to trade within a tight range, holding above the critical $103,600 support while struggling to break cleanly through the $109,300 resistance. This zone has repeatedly acted as a ceiling for price action since early May, with sellers stepping in around $109K and buyers defending dips near $104K. The recent bounce from just above the $103,600 level reflects ongoing buyer interest at that range, reinforced by the 100-day SMA (green), which is providing dynamic support. Meanwhile, the 50-day SMA (blue) is curling slightly upward, showing early signs of positive momentum, although the price has yet to clearly reclaim and hold above it. Volume remains moderate, indicating a lack of strong conviction on either side. For bulls to regain full control, BTC must push through the $109,300 resistance with sustained volume and hold that breakout level. A failure to do so may result in another rejection and a potential retest of the lower boundary near $103,600.

The company says its new blockchain-based payment infrastructure could cut the time and cost of international transactions dramatically, with near-instant settlements and fees slashed by as much as 90%. The announcement came from JD’s chairman and founder, Liu Qiangdong, during a public forum this week, where he laid out the company’s vision: faster payments, fewer intermediaries, and a future where businesses and consumers alike transact with digital currencies tied to local fiat. The market reaction was relatively quiet. JD shares opened with a slight uptick to around $33.90 before settling back to $33.47. JD.com wants to reinvent B2B payments At the core of JD’s initiative is a pilot project in Hong Kong’s regulatory sandbox for stablecoins, led by its subsidiary, Jingdong Coinlink Technology. Liu noted that typical cross-border payments between businesses relying on legacy correspondent banking can take two to four days and rack up significant fees. JD wants to compress that to less than 10 seconds. To do this, the company is leveraging its in-house blockchain network, Zhizhen Chain, which is already moving roughly $7 billion annually through its supply chain finance operations. The idea is to eliminate the intermediary banks, clearinghouses, and other third parties and allow companies to settle directly with each other using stablecoins. While the initial focus is on business-to-business transactions, JD has its sights set on something much larger. Once the infrastructure proves stable and scalable, the company plans to expand stablecoin usage to its consumer platforms. That could mean integrating stablecoin payments into JD’s e-commerce checkout experience, opening the door for its nearly 600 million active users to use digital currency for everyday shopping. With a logistics footprint spanning 20 countries, JD has the rails in place to build a truly global payment system. Industry analysts suggest that JD could even require or incentivize merchants on its platform to accept its stablecoin, helping to accelerate adoption. The stablecoin race is attracting a crowd JD isn’t the only major Chinese tech player eyeing the stablecoin sweepstakes. Ant Group —best known for operating Alipay recently said its international arm would apply for a stablecoin license in Hong Kong when the city’s new law goes into effect in August 2025. It’s also exploring regulatory approvals in Singapore and Luxembourg. Hong Kong has emerged as a regional leader for regulated stablecoin innovation. Since launching a sandbox in 2023, the city has seen a flurry of activity from global players, including Standard Chartered and Xiaomi’s Tianxing Bank, all of whom are testing tokenized payment systems under the eye of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). With its new Stablecoin Ordinance set to roll out in full by August 2025, the city is positioning itself as a launchpad for Asia’s next wave of fintech disruption, one that mainland companies like JD and Ant can tap into, despite China’s domestic crypto ban. Analysts estimate the global stablecoin market at roughly $250 billion this year, with projections climbing to nearly $1 trillion by 2030. Western financial giants like PayPal and MasterCard have already rolled out or tested their own token-based settlement systems, adding to the sense that the industry is entering a new phase. JD’s approach, building on its proprietary blockchain and integrating directly with its retail ecosystem, gives it a unique angle. But it also faces hurdles. Stablecoin infrastructure isn’t just a tech problem; it’s a regulatory maze, especially when moving money across dozens of jurisdictions.

The move, which will see SRM rebrand as Tron Inc. and implement a $100 million TRX treasury strategy, has electrified both Wall Street and the crypto community, with trading volume exploding from 2 million to 250 million shares in a matter of hours. Tron IPO Rumors and the Nasdaq Effect The catalyst for SRM’s meteoric rise was the formal announcement of a $210 million reverse merger with Tron, transforming the Florida-based theme park merchandiser into a blockchain-first company. The deal, brokered through Dominari Securities—a firm with ties to the Trump family—has fueled rampant speculation that Tron is angling for a full-fledged Nasdaq listing, offering U.S. investors rare exposure to a top-10 crypto network. SRM shares skyrocketed from $1.45 to an intraday high of $10.84 before closing at $9.19, a 533% gain in three days. The market cap jumped to $140 million, and the stock briefly became one of the most traded tickers on the exchange. Comeback or Caution? Central to the frenzy is Justin Sun’s new advisory agreement with SRM, now Tron Inc.. Sun, who has faced SEC scrutiny and recently settled civil fraud allegations, is positioning himself as the architect of Tron’s U.S. public debut. While Sun’s involvement brings cachet and credibility to the rebrand, it also raises regulatory questions, especially as the SEC continues to scrutinize crypto listings and reverse mergers. Despite rumors of direct ties between Tron and the Trump family, Eric Trump has publicly denied any official involvement, though he praised Sun as a “good friend and icon of the crypto industry”. Is There Real Backing? As part of its transformation, SRM/Tron Inc. will deploy a $100 million equity investment to accumulate TRX tokens, building a substantial on-chain treasury. The company plans to issue convertible preferred shares and warrants, potentially raising up to $210 million to support its blockchain ambitions. On-chain data shows a modest uptick in TRX activity since the announcement, with TRX prices up 2.5%—a sign of cautious optimism but not yet a full-blown bull run. SRM’s new strategy includes a dividend policy tied to TRX staking, aiming to offer shareholders direct exposure to blockchain yields. This treasury move is seen as a bid to mirror the “payment rails” success of Visa and Mastercard, but for the stablecoin-powered global south. Regulatory Hurdles and Market Outlook While the market is euphoric, regulatory experts warn that reverse mergers are likely to face intense SEC scrutiny, especially when crypto assets and offshore founders are involved. The SEC has previously flagged such deals for potential investor risk, and Tron’s prior legal entanglements could complicate the path to a seamless Nasdaq listing. Equity analysts remain divided. Bulls see the merger as a “Visa moment” for stablecoins, with Tron’s network powering over 50% of USDT and 30% of global stablecoin activity. Skeptics, however, point to the volatility of both SRM and TRX, as well as the uncertainty of U.S. regulatory approval. The Bottom Line SRM’s 580% surge is a case study in how crypto hype, strategic rebranding, and high-profile personalities can collide to create stock market fireworks. Whether Tron Inc. can clear regulatory hurdles and deliver real value—or if this is just another speculative bubble—remains the question as Q3 approaches.",News|Business,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRX,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-17 21:41:27

With volatility compressed to multi-month lows and RSI approaching oversold territory at 33.29, o3 Pro identifies $0.18 as the critical pivot between a breakout toward $0.30 and a breakdown to $0.15 . After opening in January 2025 with euphoric highs of $0.4159, Dogecoin has made some dramatic corrections and technical consolidations that have set the stage for the next major directional move. Source: CoinMarketCap The brutal February selloff, which crushed prices to $0.1590, a 58.6% monthly decline , separated diamond hands from paper hands, creating a more mature holder base that has weathered subsequent volatility with substantial stability. Alongside other cryptos that were severely affected by the market-wide liquidation of over $1.4 billion caused by the ongoing Israeli-Iran war, Dogecoin also shared in the massacre, sliding 7.5% on the day. The following analysis was conducted using one of ChatGPT’s most advanced AI models, the new o3 Pro. The predictions were then reanalyzed and edited together after being “humanized” for enhanced readability while maintaining analytical precision. Overview: Dogecoin Technical Analysis and Price Prediction The daily turnover of Dogecoin still commands $1.37 billion despite being down 45.10% from recent peaks. However, sentiment oscillates between cautious optimism and bearish caution as traders position themselves ahead of potential catalysts. With a $24.7 billion market cap, DOGE still remains firmly among the top ten cryptocurrencies. While traditional technical indicators flash warning signals with all major moving averages trading above current prices, a deeper examination shows patterns that historically precede major price movements. Source: CFGI With technicals coiling tighter, on-chain participation maintains healthy levels despite price weakness, and sentiment balances fear and greed. Technical Indicators Expose Oversold Conditions Amid Volatility The latest daily chart reveals Dogecoin wedged into its tightest volatility range since early 2025, with price action compressed between $0.181 and $0.1643 over the past 24 hours. The 24.67% increase in trading volume suggests that explosive moves are building beneath the surface. This compression phase, historically observed before DOGE’s most extensive directional breakouts, creates conditions where even modest catalysts can trigger disproportionate price movements. RSI at 33.59 : Approaching oversold territory but not yet triggering reversal signals MACD below signal line: Confirming bearish momentum but showing signs of stabilization Moving Average Death Cross: All major EMAs trading above the price, creating a resistance constellation Average True Range: Compressed to 0.018, indicating volatility expansion is imminent Volume patterns: 742.24M DOGE daily, moderate but stable participation The Relative Strength Index lingering near 34 creates a particularly intriguing setup. This level sits just above the traditional oversold threshold of 30, representing a zone where selling pressure typically exhausts itself and buyers begin to emerge. Source: Cryptonews Historical analysis shows that when DOGE’s RSI approaches 40 during consolidation phases, subsequent bounces have averaged 23% over the following 30 days, though the sample size demands caution in extrapolation. Key Support and Resistance Framework Primary Support Levels: $0.1645: Recent swing low, immediate support $0.15228–$0.16078: key support zone, multiple tests $0.14500: Psychological level, major demand zone Resistance Constellation: $0.19298: 20-day EMA, immediate resistance $0.19707: 50-day EMA, secondary barrier $0.20386: 100-day EMA, major hurdle $0.21332: 200-day EMA, long-term resistance The flattened EMA cluster between $0.19 and $0.21 is a formidable resistance wall that has consistently rejected upward attempts. Source: TradingView However, the increasing distance between the current price and these averages suggests that when a break finally occurs, the momentum could carry DOGE well beyond initial resistance levels as short covering and FOMO buying accelerate. A clean break above $0.19298 would realign the price with bullish momentum for the first time since January, potentially opening pathways toward the $0.22–$0.25 range. Conversely, failure to defend $0.17560 risks exposing the broader support zone and could trigger accelerated selling toward psychological levels near $0.15. Liquidity & Market Depth: Institutional Interest Meets Retail Resilience Despite recent price weakness, Dogecoin maintains a robust liquidity infrastructure that rivals many top-tier cryptocurrencies. The $26.62 billion market cap provides deep order books capable of absorbing large trading volumes without excessive slippage. The $1.04 billion daily turnover, representing roughly 4% of the market cap, indicates healthy institutional and retail participation. 24-hour turnover: $1.37 billion, maintaining billion-dollar daily flows 7-day volume: $6.8 billion, evidence of sustained market engagement Market cap ranking: Consistently top-10, institutional recognition Exchange distribution: Broad listing across major venues, reducing concentration risk The pair trades most actively on Binance, Coinbase, and other major exchanges where aggregated order books routinely absorb eight-figure transactions without visible market impact. Should volatility spike on major news or technical breakouts, this is a key buffer. This liquidity depth provides the foundation for meaningful price discovery and reduces the risk of flash crashes that plague smaller cryptocurrencies. Volume Composition Analysis Current volume patterns reveal tactical positioning rather than panic selling or euphoric buying. The composition has shifted toward spot markets rather than derivatives, suggesting that leverage is being reduced as traders position for potential breakouts rather than chasing momentum within the current range. Spot dominance: Growing share of total volume, reducing leverage risk Derivative cooling: Options and futures activity normalizing from extreme levels Geographic distribution: Global trading maintains healthy regional participation Institutional flows: Consistent presence of large block trades indicating professional participation Source: TradingView Volume-weighted Moving Average (VWMA-20) trends marginally higher despite classic EMAs flashing sell signals, indicating selective accumulation continues even as technical indicators remain bearish. This divergence often precedes trend reversals as smart money positions ahead of retail recognition. DOGECOIN’s Network Activities Show Growth Defies Price Weakness Even as price action has cooled throughout 2025’s first half, network fundamentals show continued adoption and utility expansion far beyond speculative trading. On-chain metrics reveal a cryptocurrency successfully transitioning from pure meme status to legitimate payment infrastructure, creating organic demand that operates independently of market sentiment cycles. Network Utilization Metrics Source: BitInfoCharts Daily active addresses: Maintaining consistent engagement above the 2024 averages, with the 2025 peak close to 700K in May. Transaction volume: Steady throughout price consolidation, peaking at over 661K transactions in a single day. Payment adoption: Expanding merchant acceptance, creating real-world utility. Mining participation: Stable hashrate despite price declines, network security maintained The persistence of network activity during sideways price action contrasts sharply with many alternative cryptocurrencies, where usage typically decays alongside speculative interest. This stability suggests that underlying demand drivers have matured beyond simple speculation into genuine utility applications. Utility-Driven Demand Expansion Recent developments in DOGE’s utility ecosystem create multiple demand channels that support price levels independent of trading activity: Payment Integration Growth: Major retailers are continuing to add DOGE payment options Online platforms, like rumors around X , are expanding cryptocurrency acceptance Cross-border remittance applications gaining traction Supply Dynamics and Float Reduction: Inflation rate : 3.3% annually , predictable and priced into current levels HODLer accumulation: Long-term holders are increasing positions during consolidation Corporate adoption: Businesses holding DOGE as treasury assets and ETFs Staking mechanisms: Various platforms offering yield on DOGE holdings Current price stability suggests equilibrium has been achieved between new supply and organic demand, setting the foundation for price appreciation when speculative demand returns. DOGECOIN Social Metrics: Community Engagement Surges Despite Price Weakness Social sentiment analysis reveals updated dynamics in Dogecoin’s community engagement patterns, with LunarCrush data showing nuanced shifts that provide deeper insights into market psychology and potential price catalysts. Current Social Performance Overview: Mentions: 30.74K (up 16.08K from the previous period) Engagements: 2.68M (up 95.76K, showing some cooling) Creators: 5.86K (up 1.16K, indicating an increase in content creation) Sentiment: 86% (down 1%, showing a bearish community psychology) Social Dominance: 2.85% (maintaining substantial crypto social mindshare) Key Performance Indicators: AltRank: 354 (positioning within broader altcoin ecosystem) Galaxy Score: 67 (moderate overall social and market performance) Despite competitive pressure from tokens like Hyperliquid’s HYPE surpassing DOGE in futures trading and newer assets like Fartcoin gaining Coinbase traction, DOGE maintains its 2.85% social dominance with 5.86K active creators. The divergence between 86% positive sentiment and current price action around $0.1777 creates historical opportunities. High community conviction provides psychological support during technical consolidation and generates buying pressure on positive catalysts. Recent technical analysis from traders like Trader Tardigrade suggests potential uptrend formations and Adam and Eve bullish patterns, while gaming integration through PlaysOut and DogeOS expands utility narratives beyond speculation. Elon Musk’s continued influence also remains a major catalyst, with sustained discussion around potential influencer impact positioning the community for momentum acceleration. The three-month social outlook reveals bullish indicators, including the strong 87% sentiment foundation, increasing quality technical analysis, and utility expansion creating new engagement narratives. Risk factors include decreasing total engagements, potentially indicating waning mainstream interest, and competitive pressure from newer tokens. Key monitoring points focus on sentiment sustainability above 80% during price weakness, engagement quality trends, and maintaining social dominance above 2.5%. Twitter Sentiment Deep Dive The qualitative analysis of community sentiment reveals compelling insights into collective psychology and price expectations within the Dogecoin ecosystem. Analysts forecast an incoming “Golden Cross” formation with ambitious $0.30 targets. This formation will require DOGE to reclaim the $0.19298 level and overcome resistance constellations.

Source: SoChain Three-Month DOGECOIN Price Outlook: Scenarios and Catalysts Base Case: Consolidation with Upward Resolution (65% probability) The most probable scenario involves continued consolidation between $0.15–$0.20 through the remainder of Q3 2025, followed by upward resolution toward $0.25–$0.30 levels as technical indicators reset and community sentiment translates into sustained buying pressure.

Technical Convergence Indicates Decision Point Dogecoin’s current market structure reveals a key convergence as price action compresses within the tightest volatility bands since early 2025. The $0.17775 level represents a 46% decline from January’s $0.3287 peak, yet technical indicators suggest this consolidation may be nearing resolution. RSI approaches oversold extremes while on-chain activity maintains steady growth despite price weakness, creating conditions where patient capital could be rewarded through asymmetric risk-reward positioning. The next 60-90 days will determine whether current conditions represent accumulation before substantial upward movement or distribution preceding deeper correction.

The bill, which passed with the support of some Democratic senators, has begun to put pressure on the House of Representatives on the future of digital assets. The bill, introduced by Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, has passed the Senate, becoming the first major piece of legislation in US history regarding cryptocurrencies. Hagerty thanked senators who expressed their support ahead of the vote. The bill successfully passed the final vote, as expected, in the preliminary vote that was held by a large majority last week. Related News: Nasdaq-listed Tech Company Plans to Purchase $50 Million Worth of This Altcoin The final Senate vote came after weeks of committee deliberations, procedural votes and a failed vote last month when Democrats withdrew their support. Since US President Donald Trump took office this year, his administration has been calling on Congress to create a clear legal framework for cryptocurrencies. The new law requires stablecoins to be fully backed only by US dollars or similar liquid assets. It also requires annual audits for stablecoin issuers with a market value of over $50 billion. The law also includes regulations for foreign issuers. The law also places strict criteria on large publicly traded companies, such as tech giants Meta and Amazon, from issuing stablecoins. These companies will not be able to issue stablecoins unless they meet specific conditions regarding financial risk and user data privacy. Another noteworthy article of the law is related to bankruptcy cases: Stablecoin owners are given “bankruptcy priority”, giving them the right to get their funds back first in the event of a possible bankruptcy. This situation is designed to protect existing depositors in banks. *This is not investment advice.

Reports have it that Ripple has filed a new letter in support of a joint motion asking the court for an indicative ruling. The letter to Judge Torres explains why giving an indicative ruling motion is very important for ending the Ripple vs. SEC case for good. The company provided three reasons why the court should grant the parties’ request. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP @Ripple has filed a Supplemental Letter in support of the Motion for an Indicative Ruling. pic.twitter.com/yPTTugNIj8 — James K. Filan 🇺🇸🇮🇪 (@FilanLaw) June 17, 2025 This comes after both Ripple and the SEC have asked the Second Circuit Court to continue to pause the ongoing appeal process. TThe US court has asked Atkin’s SEC to report on the way forward by August 15, 2025. Ripple says it does not want to overturn the summary judgment order As things stand, neither side wants to overturn nor change the summary judgment order. The order will remain binding on the parties and useful to other courts. The parties request only to modify the relief granted in this Ripple vs. SEC case by dissolving the injunction and adjusting the penalty. Ripple also made it clear that removing the “obey the law” injunction would not change its responsibility to follow securities laws. Like every other business, the company said that it must always comply with legal regulations, whether or not a court order is in place. The company wrote, “As one of the earliest crypto industry players sued by SEC, Ripple’s litigation has been the longest fought, reaching both a full merits and remedies determination.” The SEC and Ripple wind down the case The case, initially filed in 2020, accused Ripple of conducting $1.3 billion in unregistered XRP sales. Judge Analisa Torres said in July 2023 that secondary sales of the XRP coin are not securities. This was a big win for Ripple and the crypto industry as a whole. However, the judge also said that selling XRP to investors during funding rounds was the same as selling stocks because the tokens were given as compensation for investing in a business. Judge Torres later said Ripple had to pay the SEC a $125 million fine. This happened in August 2024. Unsatisfied with the case’s outcome, the SEC filed an appeal in October 2024, about one month before the 2024 US presidential election. In a March 19 X post, Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, said that the SEC was dropping the appeal. He also released a video message praising the decision as the official “ending” of the case. As reported by Cryptopolitan, on June 12, the SEC and Ripple also joined forces to file a motion in a Manhattan district court. Both sides asked the court to release the $125 million civil penalty against Ripple from escrow. Under the proposal, $50 million would go to the SEC, while the remaining $75 million would be returned to Ripple. Meanwhile, as the case between Ripple and the SEC is going on, the XRP ledger has shown strong signs of growth. This covers both a user and a key stakeholder point of view. Santiment said that over 295K active XRP addresses have been trading in the market every day on average for the past week.

It is currently at around $105,000, with tensions causing massive liquidations across the crypto sector. In addition to the liquidation of long positions, trading volume for BTC rose to new highs as traders sold off massive amounts of BTC holdings. On-chain metrics show that Bitcoin is not due for a quick rebound and could stagnate at the $105,000 level for a while. Amid these rising tensions, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been flashing buy signals as Bitcoin (BTC) investors look for market opportunities elsewhere. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in the presale, where it has raised over $10.7 million so far. Participation levels have also risen quite high since the current phase of the presale began. The MUTM Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in the presale phase, where tokens are going for $0.03. At the current price, users are getting a 50% discount on the planned listing price of $0.06. The token presale has attracted around 12,100 buyers who have bought over $10.7 million worth of tokens. The current presale price is a 200% increase from the $0.01 listing price, which has not had an impact on the presale participation pace. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the price will rise by 16.67% to $0.035. One of the reasons why the presale is attracting so much attention is that it is CertiK audited. In the crypto industry, there is a premium placed on projects that are audited by independent third parties. The team understood this, and early on in the project, they submitted the code for an audit. They received a CertiK Token Scan Score of 80, which has been a major boost for trust in the project. Another reason for the high participation rate is the current analysts’ forecast for MUTM tokens. According to them, the MUTM token price could rise up to 3,450% once the tokens go live. Based on that projection, a $2,400 investment in the presale right now could grow into $82,800 once the tokens launch. Every seasoned investor who has studied the analysis agrees with this forecast and is rushing to secure their MUTM presale tokens. They are also anticipating a massive boon from the planned launch of the beta version of the platform. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to continue building trust with its community. In line with this, they plan to launch a beta version of the platform on the same day the tokens go live. That will allow traders to examine the code for themselves and test the promised features in real time. As word about the beta version spreads, it is expected to trigger a wave of new buyers. That will be of huge benefit to those who secure their tokens early in the presale, as they will get double the gains that those who buy the tokens on the token listing day will get. The Mutuum Finance Giveaway Mutuum Finance has organized a $100,000 giveaway that is designed to reward early supporters of the project. Each participant in the prize giveaway will be eligible for a $10,000 reward. To qualify for the giveaway, you only need to make a $50 investment in the ongoing presale. You are then entered into a draw, where you stand to be one of the ten lucky winners who receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. Overall, the entire design of the presale is designed to benefit early participants the most. That includes the stepped increase in the price of the token from $0.01 in phase to the current price of $0.03. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will reward the top 50 participants in the presale. Those top 50 participants will be posted in a leaderboard on the presale dashboard. They will each be eligible to receive MUTM token bonus tokens. The Protocol Design The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) protocol is a decentralized non-custodial protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. The lenders deposit funds in communal pools where they earn interest. Interest rates are decided based on the pool utilization rate. As more borrowers join a pool, they raise the utilization rate and the interest rate. That encourages borrowers to repay their loans to avoid the rising rate and possible liquidation. At the same time, it causes lenders to deposit more assets to benefit from the growing yields. This process creates a positive feedback loop that ensures that the ecosystem remains at optimal capital efficiency. Amid escalating tensions that have spooked institutional investors, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents the best possibility for growth in the crypto sector. Analysts forecast massive gains of over 30x, giving investors an opportunity to recoup losses during the recent BTC dip. At the low price of $0.03 per token, this is one opportunity you cannot afford to miss.

Enter Ruvi AI (RUVI) , a groundbreaking project blending blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) . With an incredible 13,100% ROI forecast for 2025, analysts are calling Ruvi AI one of the most exciting crypto opportunities this year. With structured growth , real-world utility , and an investor-focused model, Ruvi AI is rapidly emerging as a strong contender to overtake Tron in terms of growth potential. Why Analysts Favor Ruvi AI Over Tron Tron has focused heavily on content creators and decentralizing the web, which has undoubtedly carved a valuable niche. However, Tron’s gradual growth model and tight focus might not appeal to investors looking for massive returns. Ruvi AI steps into the spotlight with a broader, more scalable approach . By integrating AI with blockchain, Ruvi AI addresses pressing needs in marketing , entertainment , and finance . At the heart of Ruvi AI’s appeal is its structured presale pricing model , offering both predictability and high ROI potential. Currently priced at $0.015 per token during Phase 2 of its presale, early investors are guaranteed a 5x ROI when the price moves to $0.07 post-presale. Analysts anticipate Ruvi AI could reach $1 per token , translating into an incredible 13,100% return for early backers. This growth pathway is a stark contrast to Tron’s more conservative performance and sets Ruvi AI apart as a forward-focused investment. Presale Success and Growing Momentum Ruvi AI’s presale success underscores its immense potential. The project has already raised more than $1.8 million , with over 1,600 holders purchasing tokens during the early phases. These numbers reflect the market’s confidence in Ruvi AI as a game-changing opportunity. Unlike Tron, where token performance relies heavily on ecosystem adoption, Ruvi AI provides guaranteed milestones. The post-presale price increase to $0.07 is a built-in feature, ensuring tangible returns before the token is even listed on exchanges. VIP Investment Tiers for Maximized Returns For investors eager to amplify their profits, Ruvi AI offers VIP investment tiers that reward participation with significant token bonuses. Here’s a breakdown of these tiers and their potential ROI: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These VIP tiers offer exceptional incentives , ensuring that early investors not only benefit from the token’s growth trajectory but also position themselves for exponential returns. Security and Transparency Build Confidence While many cryptocurrencies struggle with gaining investor trust, Ruvi AI sets a new standard for transparency and security . The platform has partnered with CyberScope , a respected third-party auditing firm, to verify the safety and integrity of its blockchain infrastructure. Additionally, Ruvi AI’s collaboration with WEEX Exchange guarantees post-presale token liquidity and seamless market accessibility, providing investors with peace of mind and confidence in trading RUVI tokens. Real-World Utility Drives Long-Term Demand Unlike Tron, which focuses primarily on content creators, Ruvi AI addresses broader industries with solutions that ensure long-term scalability and relevance. Here’s how Ruvi AI applies its AI-powered blockchain for maximum impact: Marketing AI-driven analytics enable businesses to enhance their advertising strategies, improving targeting precision and maximizing ROI. Entertainment Ruvi AI empowers creators and consumers with blockchain-secured payments and personalized content recommendations, creating smoother, more transparent partnerships. Finance Ruvi AI offers tools like fraud detection and improved operational transparency, providing scalable solutions for modern financial workflows. These applications put Ruvi AI in a class of its own, ensuring that its token holds stability and demand long after speculative hype fades. Why Ruvi AI Could Leave Tron Behind While Tron continues to build its ecosystem, Ruvi AI presents an opportunity that’s both scalable and immediate. By starting at a presale price of $0.015 per token , guaranteeing a jump to $0.07 post-presale , and aiming for $1 per token , Ruvi AI sets itself apart as a modern, investor-friendly project.

However, for investors seeking exponential returns, another project has stolen the spotlight. Ruvi AI (RUVI) , a blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) hybrid, has already delivered a 50% return for early holders during its presale. Analysts predict this is merely the beginning for Ruvi AI, which could far outpace Binance Coin’s growth potential in both the short and long term. Why Analysts Are Optimistic About Ruvi AI While Binance Coin’s value is largely tied to the Binance ecosystem, growth prospects for an already-mature cryptocurrency can be somewhat limited. Ruvi AI presents a starkly different opportunity, combining blockchain technology and AI to tackle real-world challenges in finance , marketing , and entertainment . With a structured growth model and practical adoption in mind, Ruvi AI’s token is designed for scalability and sustainability. At just $0.015 per token during its Phase 2 presale , it offers an accessible entry point for investors seeking robust returns. Unlike many speculative tokens, Ruvi AI ensures a guaranteed 5x increase when its presale concludes, with the token price rising to $0.07 . Looking ahead, analysts forecast that Ruvi AI could climb as high as $1 per token , equating to a 66x return for early believers. Presale Success Fuels Growth Prediction The ongoing success of Ruvi AI’s presale speaks volumes about its potential. The project has already raised over $1.8 million and gained the trust of 1,600+ holders , establishing a solid base of enthusiastic backers. What stands out about Ruvi AI’s approach is its transparent pricing model . The guaranteed post-presale price of $0.07 provides a sense of predictability and stability in a market often characterized by volatility. For early adopters, this clarity offers significant reassurance and sets Ruvi AI apart from other early-stage cryptocurrencies. VIP Investment Tiers Enhance Profitability Ruvi AI sweetens the deal for presale investors through its VIP investment tiers , which reward higher commitments with valuable token bonuses. Here’s a breakdown of the tiers and their growth potential: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. For investors, these tiers present an outstanding opportunity to multiply returns not only during the presale but in the long term as Ruvi AI grows.

In a note seen by Bloomberg , Goldman analysts led by David Kostin say they expect American households to directly purchase $425 billion worth of US equities this year. In doing so, households would trail only corporations, which the bank predicts will buy $675 billion, as the top sources of stock demand. Goldman partially bases the forecast on the concept that “there is no alternative” (TINA) to US markets. “TINA trade remains alive and well in US retirement accounts.” A separate group of Goldman analysts says that during the “liberation day” stock crash in early April, US households aggressively bought the dip, but have since turned into net sellers. However, that selling pressure has been offset by new institutional demand, according to the bank. “The resilience of household demand for equities is vital because households represent the largest ownership category of the US equity market… Households directly own 38% of the US equity market and control an even larger share including indirect ownership through funds.” Source: Goldman Sachs/Bloomberg The analysts added that Americans, on average, allocate 49% of their total financial assets to equities, which is the highest level on record and just above the previous high of 48% set in 2020. In comparison, people in the euro area only allocate 10% of their total assets to stocks, and just 13% in Japan.

In a thesis published this week, Flashbots said that “MEV has become the dominant limit to scaling blockchains,” pointing to rising inefficiencies across Ethereum rollups and Solana. The group stated that current scaling efforts by major blockchains are being neutralized by increasingly dominant MEV-driven activity. Flashbots Exposes Scaling Illusion on Rollups As layer-1 and layer-2 networks race to boost throughput, the report finds that wasteful on-chain activity from MEV bots is consuming a growing share of available capacity. On Solana, MEV bots are now responsible for 40% of all blockspace . On Ethereum’s OP-Stack rollups like Base and OP Mainnet, spam bots account for over half of all gas usage while paying just a fraction of the network’s fees. Failed transactions consume a disproportionate share of network Compute Units (CUs) relative to the fees they generate. Arb bots are a key factor: their failed txs make up ~40% of _all_ CUs used but only ~7% of total fees paid pic.twitter.com/RJl2O65l2n — chris (@chrischang43) May 17, 2025 The report noted that between November 2024 and February 2025, Base added 11 million gas units per second of throughput, nearly triple the Ethereum mainnet. However, most of that additional capacity was devoured by bots running repetitive, low-value trades. This activity creates artificially high fees for users and renders technical scaling efforts less effective. Flashbots introduced a new metric, “effective gas throughput,” to show the difference. Despite Base increasing its total gas capacity by 11 million gas per second over several months, the throughput available to real users barely changed. Almost all new capacity was eaten up by bots. The report identified spam as a specific kind of wasteful behavior, mostly DEX queries that never result in token transfers. These could be done off-chain, but instead they clog networks and raise the computational load on nodes. On Base, bots were responsible for 56% of gas usage and 26% of L1 data availability usage, but paid just 14% of fees. Spam is also driving up user fees. Flashbots explained that despite technical progress in reducing costs on rollups, fees stay artificially high due to bots continuously bidding for blockspace. “The promise of scaling is to drive fees near zero,” the report stated. “But what we’re seeing is a fee floor created by spam—not user demand.” The report also showed that this spam is highly concentrated. Just two searchers are behind over 80% of all spam on Base. According to Flashbots, the structure of the current market makes spam more profitable than participating in a fair auction, leading to inefficient and wasteful outcomes. “Spam bots are flooding blocks, not to serve users, but to extract MEV,” the report said. “It’s a structural issue, not just a technical one.” Flashbots Proposes MEV Auction Fix Amid Rising Exploits Flashbots has proposed a new framework to address growing concerns around MEV exploitation in Ethereum and other blockchain networks. Rather than relying on gas-heavy spam auctions, Flashbots suggests a shift toward explicit MEV auctions, allowing searchers to bid directly for transaction ordering rights. This, they argue, would reduce network congestion and wasted fees while preserving efficiency for traders and validators. The organization is also advocating for “programmable privacy,” a model that allows bots to view live blockchain state and plan profitable trades without the ability to front-run users or leak sensitive data. Flashbots is currently testing this concept using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), which allow secure transaction backrunning without the back-run transactions to abuse. “We’ve proven this on Ethereum L1,” Flashbots wrote in its latest report. “And we’re actively adapting it for L2s.” The proposal comes at a key time as concerns over MEV-related abuse continue to mount. According to EigenPhi data, more than 33,000 users were victims of sandwich attacks in March 2025, orchestrated by just 101 entities. These attacks now account for nearly $1 billion in weekly trading volume on Ethereum-based DEXs. In 2023, a single MEV searcher earned over $1 million in one day using sandwich attacks on Ethereum. On that day alone, the address accounted for 7% of total gas usage across the network. The same operator continued to profit into 2024 with improved strategies. The issue isn’t limited to Ethereum. On Solana, a well-known MEV bot named “arsc” exploited users through similar tactics, generating around $30 million in just two months. MEV allows validators to extract profits by reordering or inserting transactions. While it can boost DeFi efficiency, it also drives up fees and undermines fairness, especially for beginners unfamiliar with blockchain mechanics. Critics warn that unchecked MEV practices could deter user adoption and erode trust in decentralized finance .
