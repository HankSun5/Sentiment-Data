Ben Zhou, the exchange’s CEO, shared details about the project on his X account. Byreal is the name of this new decentralized exchange (DEX) that will start to operate by the end of the month. Announcing Byreal — our first onchain DEX incubated by Bybit, will be LIVE by end of the month. Starting from scratch and now born on Solana. what's special: 1/ CEX + DEX synergy Byreal isn’t “just another DEX.” It’s combining CEX-grade liquidity with DeFi-native transparency.… https://t.co/JU60e4zHQ4 — Ben Zhou (@benbybit) June 15, 2025 Zhou emphasized that Byreal combines “CEX-grade liquidity with DeFi-native transparency.” It will offer low slippage and prevent miners’ manipulation through MEV protection. Byreal will directly compete with leading decentralized solutions within the Solana ecosystem like Raydium, Orca, and PumpSwap. The token’s significant uptick in the past day indicates how excited market participants are for the news as it could attract significant transaction volumes to this blockchain. The news favors a bullish Solana price prediction. Solana Price Prediction: SOL Eyes Retest of $185 After Support Bounce Solana DEX volumes in the past 24 hours stood at $1.8 billion while they rose by 10.2% in the past 30 days to $77.43 billion according to data from DeFi Llama . The above-mentioned three DEXs account for more than three-quarters of that total with Raydium leading the pack with a 29% market share. Looking at the daily chart, Solana (SOL) has bounced for a third time off the $140 level in the daily chart to solidify the importance of this key threshold. Meanwhile, trading volumes in the past 24 hours have nearly doubled. The price has hit a key resistance at $155. This level acted as a ceiling for the price action previously. If SOL breaks out above this threshold and retests it from above it will confirm a clear runway to $185. Momentum indicators favor a bullish outlook as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has jumped above the 14-day moving average. As the Solana network prepares to receive higher transaction volumes from Byreal, the need for a scaling solution like Solaxy (SOLX) is more evident than ever. This is one of the hottest crypto presales of the year and it is about to end. Solaxy (SOLX) Enters Last 2 Days of Its Presale with $52M Raised Solana has struggled to keep up with rising transaction volumes during peak usage periods like January this year when TRUMP and MELANIA were launched. Solaxy (SOLX) is a layer-2 scaling protocol for the Solana blockchain that bundles transactions offline in a side chain to alleviate the mainnet’s burden. The developing team has already launched the Solaxy testnet and will launch the mainnet this month. A block explorer is available so investors can check the solution’s performance in real time before its official rollout. With just 2 more days ahead before the end of its successful presale, this is the last opportunity that investors will have to grab $SOLX at its heavily discounted presale price of $0.001764. This token will see a spike in its demand once the solution is embraced by top wallets and exchanges. In addition, the project offers attractive staking rewards that currently sit at 80%. To buy $SOLX, simply head to the Solaxy website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or SOL or use a bank card to invest.

Shareholders of Japan-listed company Beat Holdings are making waves with an ambitious push: they’re urging the company to raise a substantial ¥799 billion (approximately $5.6 billion) specifically for a significant Bitcoin acquisition . This bold move, reported by The Bitcoin Historian on X, signals a growing appetite among traditional companies, even in Japan’s sometimes cautious market, to embrace digital assets. Why Are Beat Holdings Shareholders Eyeing a Major Bitcoin Acquisition? The primary driver behind this intriguing shareholder proposal is a desire for Beat Holdings to compete directly with the increasingly prominent Metaplanet strategy . Metaplanet, another Japan-based firm, has garnered significant attention recently for adopting a treasury strategy heavily focused on accumulating Bitcoin. This approach mirrors that of pioneers like MicroStrategy in the U.S. Metaplanet’s stock price has seen notable movements tied to its Bitcoin buys, catching the eye of investors and potentially inspiring others in the Japan crypto market . Shareholders advocating for this massive fund believe that a strategic investment in Bitcoin could: Provide a hedge against currency devaluation (like the Yen). Offer significant potential for capital appreciation in the long term. Enhance the company’s balance sheet strength. Attract a new class of investors interested in crypto-exposed equities. Position Beat Holdings as a forward-thinking leader in the digital asset space within Japan. The proposed ¥799 billion fund is earmarked to acquire up to 50,000 Bitcoin. To put that into perspective, 50,000 BTC represents a substantial holding, potentially placing Beat Holdings among the ranks of major corporate Bitcoin holders globally, though still behind giants like MicroStrategy. Understanding the Metaplanet Strategy and Its Influence Metaplanet’s decision to pivot towards a Bitcoin-centric treasury reserve asset strategy has been a significant story in the Japan crypto market . Instead of holding traditional cash reserves that are subject to inflationary pressures, Metaplanet has opted to convert portions of its treasury into Bitcoin. This strategy is predicated on the belief that Bitcoin, with its fixed supply and decentralized nature, serves as a superior store of value in the long run compared to fiat currencies. Key aspects of the Metaplanet strategy include: Treasury Transformation: Shifting from Yen-denominated cash reserves to Bitcoin. Capital Raises: Utilizing various financing methods (like debt or equity raises) specifically to fund Bitcoin purchases. Investor Communication: Being transparent about their Bitcoin holdings and strategy to attract like-minded investors. This approach has not been without its risks, as the price of Bitcoin is volatile. However, for companies like Metaplanet and potentially Beat Holdings, the perceived long-term benefits outweigh the short-term price fluctuations. The success and visibility of Metaplanet’s strategy have clearly served as a catalyst for this bold shareholder proposal at Beat Holdings. What Are the Benefits and Challenges of Such a Large Bitcoin Acquisition? Embarking on a large-scale Bitcoin acquisition presents both compelling opportunities and significant hurdles for a company like Beat Holdings . Potential Benefits: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s limited supply makes it attractive as a hedge against the potential devaluation of fiat currencies. Growth Potential: Historically, Bitcoin has shown significant price appreciation over multi-year periods, offering potential returns far exceeding traditional assets. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin to the balance sheet can help diversify corporate reserves. Attracting Investment: A clear Bitcoin strategy can appeal to a growing segment of investors interested in digital assets. Potential Challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile, which could lead to significant fluctuations in the company’s reported asset values and potentially impact earnings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, particularly for corporate holdings, is still evolving globally and within Japan. Custody and Security Risks: Safely storing and managing a large amount of Bitcoin requires specialized expertise and robust security measures to prevent loss or theft. Accounting Treatment: Accounting rules for holding cryptocurrencies can be complex and may require mark-to-market adjustments that impact financial statements. Shareholder & Board Alignment: Not all shareholders or board members may agree with such a high-risk, non-core investment strategy. The proposal itself highlights that this is being pushed by *some* shareholders. The success of this shareholder proposal will depend heavily on Beat Holdings’ ability to navigate these challenges while capitalizing on the potential benefits. Comparing Strategies: Beat Holdings’ Proposal vs. Metaplanet’s Holdings While both companies are based in Japan and are looking towards Bitcoin, the proposed scale of Beat Holdings’ potential acquisition is noteworthy when compared to Metaplanet’s current known holdings (as of recent reports). Let’s look at a simplified comparison: Company Proposed/Known Bitcoin Holdings (Approx.) Funding Strategy (Proposed/Used) Beat Holdings (Proposed) Up to 50,000 BTC Raising ¥799B fund Metaplanet (Known) Significantly less than 50,000 BTC (specific number fluctuates with buys) Equity/Debt Financing, Treasury Cash Note: Metaplanet’s exact holdings change as they make further purchases. This table is illustrative based on public reports regarding their strategy. The scale of the proposed Bitcoin acquisition by Beat Holdings is ambitious and, if successful, would represent one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holdings outside of MicroStrategy. This underscores the potential impact such a move could have on both the company’s future and the broader perception of corporate crypto adoption in Japan. What’s Next for Beat Holdings and the Shareholder Proposal? A shareholder proposal is just the first step in a potentially long process. For this proposal to move forward, it would typically need to gain traction among a significant portion of shareholders and ultimately receive approval from the company’s board of directors. The board will need to carefully evaluate the risks and rewards, consider the feasibility of raising such a large sum, and assess the potential impact on the company’s core business and overall financial health. Key factors that will influence the outcome include: The level of support among major shareholders. The board’s risk tolerance and view on digital assets. The company’s ability to successfully raise the necessary ¥799 billion fund. The prevailing market conditions for Bitcoin and the broader economy. Regulatory developments in the Japan crypto market . The outcome of this proposal could set a precedent for other Japanese companies considering similar treasury strategies. It’s a story worth following closely for anyone interested in corporate finance, the evolution of treasury management, and the continued integration of Bitcoin into the traditional financial system. Actionable Insights for Investors and Observers For those watching this space, the situation with Beat Holdings and the proposed Bitcoin acquisition offers several points to consider: Monitor Shareholder Activism: Pay attention to shareholder proposals related to crypto adoption in publicly traded companies. This indicates growing investor interest. Track Corporate Treasury Strategies: Observe how companies like Metaplanet and potentially Beat Holdings implement and manage their Bitcoin holdings. This provides real-world examples of corporate crypto adoption. Evaluate Company Fundamentals: When considering investments in companies adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies, look beyond the crypto holdings and assess the strength of their core business. Understand Market Context: Developments in the Japan crypto market and regulatory environment can significantly impact companies operating there. This development underscores that the trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption is not limited to Western markets and is gaining momentum in Asia, driven by factors like inflation concerns and the desire to emulate successful strategies like the Metaplanet strategy . A Bold Vision for Beat Holdings’ Future? The proposal for Beat Holdings to raise ¥799 billion for a massive Bitcoin acquisition is undoubtedly bold. It reflects a significant shift in how some investors view corporate treasury management and the potential role of digital assets. While the outcome remains uncertain, the very existence of such a high-profile shareholder proposal highlights the increasing legitimacy and appeal of Bitcoin as a reserve asset, even in traditional financial circles within the Japan crypto market . It’s a fascinating development that could pave the way for more Japanese companies to explore similar strategies, further bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset world.

The Cardano Foundation reported that a total of 2,004 decentralized applications are developing and expanding their projects within this blockchain as of June 13, 2025. Meanwhile, the number of native assets minted on the Cardano blockchain currently sits at 10.83 million while transaction volumes rose by 0.2% compared to the previous week to stand at 110.40 million. The number of smart contracts – known as Plutus and Aiken scripts – will soon surpass the 140,000 mark. These figures point to Cardano’s robust and continually-expanding ecosystem. Although the network has been criticized in the past for missing out on some top trends in the crypto space like DeFi and meme coins, there are still developers who are betting on the future of this blockchain as the preferred alternative to deploy real-world applications. Minswap is currently the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) in the Cardano network with 30-day trading volumes of $79 million. Meanwhile, Liqwid is the largest decentralized application. It specializes in lending and currently has a total value locked (TVL) of $80.9 million. The combined TVL of Cardano dApps currently sits at $285 million as per data from DeFi Llama. This is a tiny fraction of Solana’s $8.8 billion TVL and just a breadcrumb of Ethereum’s massive $62.9 billion ecosystem. However, the founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson, has always emphasized that his network’s ambitions are centered on powering real-world applications rather than just DeFi apps. Ecosystem growth is robust according to these latest figures and that favors a bullish Cardano price prediction. Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Could Rise to $1 If This Happens Cardano (ADA) recovered during the week after a 4-day losing streak. The $0.600 level seems to have acted as strong support for the price action and could trigger a move toward the $0.7500 resistance in the near term. The price is currently sitting below its short-term and long-term moving averages and these are currently the key resistances to watch for ADA. A breakout above these markers would favor a bullish Cardano price prediction. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) seems poised to send a buy signal if it rises above the 14-day moving average. If the price rises above $0.730 and retests that level from above, this would confirm a bullish outlook that could push ADA to $1. This means an upside potential of 37% for the token. Apart from Cardano, the Bitcoin blockchain is has significant untapped potential for the development of DeFi applications. A new crypto presale called Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) aims to launch a layer-2 scaling solution that will make it possible for these dApps to thrive and unlock trillions of dollars in liquidity that would flow to Bitcoin native protocols. Bitcoin Hype (HYPER) Raises More than $1M in Less Than 15 Days Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) aims to makes the top crypto’s blockchain a suitable home for meme coins, payment platforms, DeFi applications and more. The developing team aims to achieve this through the launch of a robust side chain powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). The solution will act as a bridge between the two blockchains to facilitate cheap and fast asset transfers of BTC tokens. The demand for HYPER, the native asset of this L2, will skyrocket once the protocol is launched and becomes adopted by top wallets and exchanges. To buy $HYPER at its discounted presale price, head to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or BTC for this token or use a bank card to invest.

ADA’s XRP Yields, Bitcoin’s Gold Faceoff, and Qubetics’ 28K Holders",https://thecoinrise.com/top-crypto-coins-to-buy-now-adas-xrp-yields-bitcoins-gold-faceoff-and-qubetics-28k-holders/,"As crypto markets push deeper into 2025, the debate between innovation and resilience has entered a new chapter. Three coins stand at the crossroads of this dynamic moment: Qubetics , Bitcoin, and Cardano. Each represents a different facet of blockchain evolution, from radical privacy tools to resilient network fundamentals and adaptive scalability. Qubetics features a decentralized VPN (dVPN), redefining how Web3 users access and protect digital content. With major updates and a fast-closing crypto presale, it’s attracting both privacy advocates and serious crypto backers. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s standing as a digital asset is being reassessed amid geopolitical uncertainty, as investors increasingly weigh its position against traditional safe havens like gold. And Cardano is leveraging its layered architecture to pivot toward real-world use cases amid scalability debates. With macroeconomic pressures, shifting regulations, and new decentralized solutions emerging, knowing the top crypto coins to buy now is about timing, technology, and tenacity. Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN: Reclaiming the Internet From Central Control The decentralized VPN built into Qubetics is the centrepiece of a broader vision to reclaim internet sovereignty. Traditional VPNs often store logs, can be compelled to turn over data, or suffer from central points of failure. Qubetics changes the equation by distributing trust. Its dVPN operates on a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer blockchain network. There is no singular authority, no centralized control, and no way for governments or corporations to censor or throttle the system. Using multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption, it masks both user identity and routing metadata. Every connection remains anonymous, with a trustless architecture ensuring verifiable privacy. The dVPN also features tokenized incentives. Users can share unused bandwidth in exchange for $TICS tokens, turning idle resources into rewards. This economic layer strengthens participation and builds out a sustainable node ecosystem. By tying its dVPN into broader decentralized applications, Qubetics reinforces the foundation for DeFi protocols, decentralized storage, and dApps that demand censorship-resistant access. As more of the internet migrates toward tokenized systems, tools like the dVPN become foundational infrastructure amid the top crypto coins to buy now. Qubetics Presale Update: A Rising Opportunity Qubetics has entered its final crypto presale phase, Stage 37, offering $TICS tokens at a fixed rate of $0.3370 with just under 10 million tokens left. Over $18 million has already been raised, and more than 515 million tokens have been sold to more than 28,000 buyers. By cutting the total supply from 4 billion to 1.36 billion, Qubetics has engineered immediate scarcity. And by increasing its public sale allocation to 38.55%, it is handing more control to its users. With fewer tokens and a fairer distribution, Qubetics now stands out among the top crypto coins to buy now, especially for adopters prioritizing transparency, utility, and long-term potential. Growth Scenarios: What $6,000 in Qubetics Could Become Qubetics is on the brink of listing, with analysts forecasting an initial token price of $0.40. If a $6,000 investment is made at the current presale price of $0.3370, it secures approximately 17,802 $TICS tokens. Upon listing at $0.40, the value would rise to $7,120—an instant 18.6% gain. If the token hits $1, that same investment is worth $17,802. At $5, it balloons to $89,010. Should Qubetics reach $10 following its mainnet launch, the investment jumps to $178,020. If the $TICS token touches $15, the final value would be a staggering $267,030. With the dVPN as a key use case, reduced total supply, and momentum from its community-driven distribution, Qubetics could very well surpass expectations. Analysts are watching this project not for speculative buzz but for its grounded fundamentals, placing it firmly among the top crypto coins to buy now. Bitcoin: Is the Digital Gold Narrative Slipping? As geopolitical instability surges, traditional safe-haven assets like gold have soared. Gold recently touched $3,450 per ounce, just shy of its all-time high. Bitcoin, often dubbed “digital gold,” hasn’t kept pace. BTC currently trades 5.3% below its May 22 high of $111,800. While that may suggest resilience, some analysts argue that Bitcoin’s safe-haven appeal is weakening. Instead, it behaves more like a risk asset, echoing moves in US equity markets. Analysts explain that Bitcoin continues to mirror tech-heavy indices. As equity futures rebound, Bitcoin could play catch-up. Holding above its $95,000–$100,000 support zone is crucial. If this support holds, retesting $112,000 becomes feasible, with upside potential toward $116,000 and $120,000. However, caution remains. Bitcoin’s volatility and correlation with liquidity cycles make it vulnerable. Its narrative as a hedge against inflation or war-driven instability is under review. As such, Bitcoin holds its place among the top crypto coins to buy now, not as a hedge, but as a high-risk, high-reward macro play. Cardano’s Midnight: XRP DeFi Yield Revolution Cardano founder Hoskinson proposes using Midnight, a privacy‑centric sidechain, to unlock DeFi yields for XRP holders. Midnight leverages Cardano’s extended UTXO model to enable private smart contracts off the base chain. In 2024, Midnight launched a testnet ahead of a mainnet release later this year. Now, XRP holders may bridge assets into Midnight to earn “much better yields” through liquidity provision and farming. Airdrops under the “Glacier Drop” plan will distribute NIGHT and DUST tokens to 37 million wallets, including XRPL addresses. This aligns with Cardano’s broader vision of cross‑chain modular DeFi and positions it as a leading protocol among the top crypto coins to buy now. Midnight uses privacy-enabled smart contracts without altering Cardano’s base layer. Developers will code in the extended UTXO framework, enabling modular execution, transaction privacy, and side‑chain isolation. Bridging tools will facilitate XRP transfers from XRPL into the Midnight environment. Once bridged, assets can access yield‑based protocols similar to staking, lending, or AMM pools. By retaining privacy while enabling composability, Midnight pioneers a new DeFi paradigm blending secrecy, utility, and interoperability, boosting Cardano into the top crypto coins to buy now narrative. Final Words: Timing the Shift, Not Just the Price—Top Crypto Coins to Buy Now Crypto investment in 2025 is less about wild speculation and more about positioning. Qubetics is rewriting the rules of internet privacy through its dVPN. Bitcoin remains a liquidity-driven instrument with macro potential. Cardano continues to gain traction in key institutional sectors by proposing advanced DeFi tech. Understanding the strengths and trade-offs of each coin is essential. The top crypto coins to buy now are no longer defined by hype alone—they are grounded in architecture, traction, and long-term vision.

It operates on a peer-to-peer blockchain network, eliminating central control and increasing privacy through encryption and decentralization. Is Qubetics’ crypto presale still active? Yes, it’s in its final phase with less than 10 million tokens remaining at a fixed price of $0.3370. Why hasn’t Bitcoin followed gold in recent rallies? Bitcoin currently behaves more like a risk asset than a safe haven, making it sensitive to equities and macro liquidity trends. Is Cardano still a good investment in 2025? Its layered architecture, regulatory alignment, and real-world use cases make it a strong long-term bet. What’s the projected return for $6,000 invested in Qubetics now? If the token hits $15 after launch, the return could be around $267,030. The post Top Crypto Coins to Buy Now?

46167873,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=169469,1750116009,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/46167873.jpeg,Revolutionary Step: France Eyes Nuclear Energy Surplus for Sustainable Bitcoin Mining,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/france-nuclear-bitcoin-mining/,"BitcoinWorld Revolutionary Step: France Eyes Nuclear Energy Surplus for Sustainable Bitcoin Mining Imagine a world where the energy powering the future of finance also helps balance national power grids and utilizes clean energy sources. This isn’t science fiction; it’s potentially the future being shaped in France. Recent developments suggest that French lawmakers are seriously considering a groundbreaking proposal to integrate Bitcoin mining operations into the nation’s existing energy infrastructure, specifically by leveraging the significant surplus generated by its extensive Nuclear energy France network. This bold initiative, initially brought to light via reports from sources like @solidintel_x on X, represents a potentially significant shift in how countries view both cryptocurrency mining and national energy management. By tapping into power that might otherwise go unused or be sold at lower rates, France could position itself as a leader in Sustainable crypto mining , addressing common environmental concerns associated with the industry while simultaneously bolstering its own French energy strategy . What’s Driving This Potential Integration of Bitcoin Mining? At its core, this proposal is driven by a confluence of factors related to energy economics and the evolving landscape of digital finance. France boasts one of the world’s most robust nuclear power programs, providing a large percentage of its electricity. While incredibly reliable, nuclear plants are designed to run continuously at or near full capacity. This can sometimes lead to periods of Energy surplus , particularly during times of low demand or high renewable energy production. Managing this surplus effectively is a constant challenge for grid operators. Simultaneously, Bitcoin mining has emerged as a significant energy consumer globally. The process, which involves powerful computers competing to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and secure the network, requires substantial electricity. This energy demand has often drawn criticism regarding its environmental footprint, especially when powered by fossil fuels. The French proposal sees an opportunity in this dynamic: pair the energy-hungry process of Bitcoin mining with the periods of excess clean energy production from nuclear plants. This could provide a consistent, reliable, and potentially low-cost power source for miners, while also offering the grid a valuable, interruptible load that can consume surplus power when needed, helping to stabilize the network. How Does Nuclear Energy France Fit into the Picture? France’s reliance on nuclear power is a defining feature of its energy profile. Unlike many nations, France made a strategic decision decades ago to invest heavily in nuclear technology to achieve energy independence and reduce carbon emissions. Today, nuclear reactors account for roughly 70% of the country’s electricity generation, making France a global leader in nuclear energy utilization. This extensive infrastructure, while providing clean and stable baseload power, also presents unique challenges in grid management. Nuclear plants are not easily ramped up or down in response to fluctuating demand or variable renewable energy input (like solar or wind). This inflexibility means that during periods of low demand, particularly overnight or on weekends, the grid can experience an Energy surplus . Finding ways to efficiently use or store this surplus energy is crucial for grid stability and economic efficiency. Traditionally, managing surplus involves exporting power, storing it (though large-scale, cost-effective storage is still developing), or in some cases, curtailing production (which is inefficient for nuclear). The idea of directing this surplus to energy-intensive operations like Bitcoin mining offers a novel solution that could be mutually beneficial. Exploring the Potential Benefits of This French Energy Strategy Integrating Bitcoin mining with France’s nuclear surplus could unlock several significant advantages, aligning economic, environmental, and strategic goals: Economic Opportunities: Utilizing surplus energy provides a revenue stream for energy producers that might otherwise be lost. It can also attract Bitcoin mining operations to France, creating jobs (though perhaps not as many as traditional industries, given the automated nature) and potentially generating tax revenue. For miners, access to reliable, potentially cheaper, clean energy is a major operational advantage. Grid Stability and Efficiency: Energy-intensive loads like Bitcoin mining can act as ‘flexible demand.’ When there’s an Energy surplus , miners can increase operations, consuming the excess power. When demand from other sectors is high, mining operations can be curtailed or powered down, freeing up capacity. This interruptible load helps balance the grid, reducing the need for costly curtailment or reliance on less flexible power sources. Promoting Sustainable Crypto Mining: This is perhaps the most compelling benefit from a global perspective. By powering mining with clean, low-carbon nuclear energy, France would significantly contribute to reducing the overall carbon footprint associated with Bitcoin mining . This addresses a major criticism leveled against the industry and promotes a model for Sustainable crypto mining that other nations with significant clean energy sources could potentially emulate. Strategic Integration into French Energy Strategy: Officially incorporating Bitcoin mining into the national energy plan acknowledges its growing importance as an industry and provides a framework for managing its energy needs in a controlled and beneficial manner. It signals France’s willingness to engage with emerging technologies and potentially become a hub for clean crypto operations. Reducing Reliance on Fossil Fuels: By providing a clean power source for mining, this initiative indirectly reduces the pressure on fossil fuel-based electricity generation that might otherwise be used for mining elsewhere. What Challenges Might France Face? While the potential benefits are substantial, implementing such a strategy is not without its hurdles. French lawmakers and energy operators would need to carefully navigate several challenges: Regulatory Framework: Establishing clear regulations for how Bitcoin mining operations can connect to the grid and utilize surplus power is essential. This includes defining tariffs, connection requirements, and protocols for curtailment during peak demand. Infrastructure Requirements: While France has ample generation, ensuring sufficient transmission and distribution capacity to transport surplus power to potential mining sites is necessary. Mining facilities also require specific infrastructure, including cooling systems and secure locations. Public Perception: Despite using clean energy, the energy consumption of Bitcoin mining remains a topic of public debate. Educating the public about the ‘surplus utilization’ aspect and the benefits for grid stability will be crucial to garnering support. Market Dynamics: The profitability of Bitcoin mining is highly dependent on the price of Bitcoin and the cost of electricity. While surplus energy might be cheaper, ensuring long-term viability for miners requires stable energy pricing and a favorable regulatory environment. Technical Integration: Seamlessly integrating energy-intensive, interruptible loads like mining farms into the existing grid management system requires sophisticated technical solutions and coordination between grid operators and mining companies. Addressing these challenges effectively will require careful planning, collaboration between the energy sector and the crypto industry, and potentially new policy innovations as part of the broader French energy strategy . Examples and Global Context: Is France Alone in This Thinking? France’s proposal, while potentially revolutionary in its scale due to the nation’s nuclear capacity, is part of a broader global trend exploring how energy-intensive computing, including Bitcoin mining , can be integrated with energy production, particularly surplus or otherwise wasted energy. For instance: Utilizing Flare Gas: In regions with significant oil and gas production (like parts of the US, Canada, and Africa), miners are setting up operations to use natural gas that would otherwise be flared (burned off). This turns waste energy into productive output and reduces methane emissions compared to flaring. Geothermal Energy: Countries with abundant geothermal resources, like Iceland and El Salvador, are using this clean, renewable energy source to power mining operations. Hydroelectric Power: Regions with significant hydroelectric capacity, such as parts of China (though regulations have changed), Canada, and Scandinavia, have historically attracted miners due to low energy costs, though this also presents challenges during dry seasons or peak demand. Capturing Waste Heat: Some innovative projects are exploring using the significant heat generated by mining operations for other purposes, such as heating buildings or greenhouses, further improving energy efficiency. The French approach, focusing on nuclear surplus, adds a powerful new dimension to this global conversation. It highlights the potential for established, large-scale clean energy infrastructure to play a role in the future of digital assets, moving the narrative around Bitcoin mining towards one of efficiency and Sustainable crypto mining . What Does This Mean for the Future of Bitcoin Mining and Energy? If the French proposal moves forward successfully, it could serve as a significant case study for other nations with substantial nuclear or large-scale renewable energy infrastructure that experience periods of Energy surplus . It could: Shift the geographical landscape of Bitcoin mining , attracting operations to regions with favorable clean energy policies. Accelerate the adoption of Sustainable crypto mining practices globally, pushing the industry towards cleaner energy sources. Influence future energy policy, demonstrating how energy-intensive computing can be managed as a flexible, beneficial load on the grid. Potentially stabilize energy markets by providing a consistent consumer for surplus power. This development underscores the dynamic relationship between technology and infrastructure. As the crypto industry matures, its integration with traditional sectors like energy becomes increasingly important. France’s potential move is a bold step in this direction, seeking to harmonize the energy demands of the digital age with the realities and opportunities of existing national energy resources as part of a forward-looking French energy strategy . Actionable Insights for the Reader For those following the intersection of crypto and energy, this French proposal offers several key takeaways: Monitor Policy Developments: Keep a close eye on legislative progress in France regarding this amendment and related energy policies. Policy is a major driver for where Sustainable crypto mining can thrive. Understand Energy Sources: When evaluating mining operations or investments, pay attention to their energy mix. Initiatives like France’s highlight the growing importance of clean and efficient energy sourcing for long-term viability and public acceptance. Recognize Grid Dynamics: The concept of using interruptible loads like mining to manage Energy surplus is a critical aspect of modern grid management. Understanding this can provide insight into future energy infrastructure developments. Consider the Global Context: France is not in isolation. Look for similar initiatives or discussions in other countries with significant clean energy production (hydro, nuclear, large-scale solar/wind). Engage in the Conversation: As these proposals develop, participate in informed discussions about the role of crypto mining in energy transitions and the potential for Sustainable crypto mining models. These insights are crucial for investors, policymakers, energy professionals, and crypto enthusiasts alike, offering a glimpse into how national strategies are adapting to technological change. In Conclusion: A Strategic Alignment for a Greener Future? The proposal by French lawmakers to explore using surplus Nuclear energy France for Bitcoin mining represents a potentially pivotal moment. It’s a strategic move that seeks to align the energy demands of a burgeoning digital industry with the practical realities of managing a large, clean energy infrastructure. By potentially turning an Energy surplus challenge into an opportunity to foster Sustainable crypto mining , France could set a precedent for how nations can integrate energy-intensive technologies into their national French energy strategy in an environmentally responsible and economically beneficial way. While challenges remain, the core idea is compelling: leveraging existing clean energy assets to power the future of finance. This initiative highlights the innovative thinking required to bridge traditional infrastructure with cutting-edge technology, potentially paving the way for a greener, more stable energy future alongside the growth of the crypto economy.

Polyhedra Network ( ZKJ ) token was trading at $0.374, up 47% from its lowest point this week. This jump brought its market capitalization to $101 million, down from last week’s high of $620 million. In an X post, Polyhedra attributed the crash to a series of abnormal on-chain transactions within a short period on the ZKJ/KOGE trading pair.

Data shows that three wallets drained about $7 million in liquidity. In a note to crypto.news, a Bitunix analyst said in a note: “On-chain analysis revealed that three major wallets executed a coordinated ‘liquidity pull + targeted dump,’ first crashing KOGE, then triggering ZKJ’s collapse — a classic bull trap. Warning signs emerged beforehand: LP withdrawals, plunging APYs, and reduced wash trading.” ZKJ token price also crashed as investors braced for an upcoming token unlock. Tokens worth over $10 million will be unlocked on June 19, with the funds allocated to ecosystem and network incentives, foundation reserves, community, and token purchasers.

However, there is a risk that the rebound is a bull trap or a dead-cat bounce, a situation where an asset in freefall bounces temporarily before resuming its downtrend. A good example of this is Mantra ( OM ), whose token plunged by over 90% on a Sunday a few months ago. At the time, the developers blamed the crash on exchange-driven liquidations and insisted that the underlying technology remained strong, triggering a 500% surge shortly after its drop . However, the surge proved to be a dead-cat bounce, and the token eventually resumed its downtrend. ZKJ may follow a similar path as the bull trap fades and existing holders exit their positions. In the note, the Bitunix analyst added: “Confidence in ZKJ has collapsed — without clear capital inflows, a rebound is unlikely. Cease wash trading or arbitrage strategies, and stay alert to tokens with high FDV, suspiciously stable prices, or abnormal rankings.” ZKJ crypto technical analysis ZKJ crypto chart | Source: TradingView Technicals suggest that the ZKJ price may form either a rectangle or a triangle pattern as it consolidates, potentially a bearish flag or pennant. A pennant or flag formation would indicate further downside, possibly to the support level at $0.20.

The MP has filed his bill in the Chamber of Deputies, the Portuguese-language media outlet Livecoins reported. Brazilian Crypto Tax: Could Levies Be Scrapped? The bill calls for the removal of the clauses in the tax code that explicitly mention the taxation of cryptoassets. The Brazilian lawmaker Eros Biondini calling for support for his bill on social media. The caption reads: “Fight against the taxation of cryptoassets in Brazil.” (Source: @erosbiondini/Instagram) It also calls for the abolition of a 2023 law that spells out the means of collecting income tax from profits derived from cryptoassets. The bill will first be assessed by a Chamber of Deputies committee. The committee will decide whether or not to pass the bill on to the lower house. From there, it could then move on to the Senate and the office of the President. Both the Senate and the President would have the power to veto the bill. Biondini also claims that new taxes on financial transactions, including foreign exchange and insurance transfers, are ill-timed. He claimed that imposing a new tax burden on the population at “a time of economic fragility” would have negative consequences. The lawmaker noted that the Brazilian tax “burden” reached 32.32% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in FY2024. This is the tax-to-GDP ratio’s highest rate in the last 15 years, per Treasury data. Biondini criticized the government’s crypto policy. He complained that Brazil, “instead of leading” the world in crypto adoption, is now “going against the grain.” He said existing and future crypto tax laws “penalize people who are looking for a legitimate, safe, and sovereign store of value.” Formal Recognition for BTC Savers The crypto-adovocating lawmaker has previously authored a bill that seeks to formally recognize Bitcoin as a strategic store of value in Brazil. This proposal seeks to create tax exemption for BTC buyers and holders. It also seeks to spell out citizens’ rights to become self-custodians of their coins, without having to rely on crypto wallet operators.

He suggested that if the topic were to go viral, the lower house would be pressured to reject efforts to boost crypto tax revenues in Brazil. Biondini also called on fellow parliamentarians to back his bill. He explained that it had been designed to defend taxpayers, industry players, and Brazil’s “economic sovereignty.” In November last year, Biondini unveiled a bill proposing the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve . The plan called for the government to convert up to 5% of Brazil’s $372 billion international reserve fund to Bitcoin.

A prime example currently unfolding involves the intricate dance between the United States and Iran concerning a potential revival of the nuclear deal. While seemingly distant from Bitcoin or Ethereum, shifts in this complex geopolitical situation, particularly regarding energy markets and overall risk sentiment, are worth paying attention to. What Are the Odds of a US-Iran Nuclear Deal Right Now? One fascinating way to gauge the market’s collective sentiment on such complex events is through prediction markets. According to data highlighted by Walter Bloomberg on X, the prediction market platform Kalshi currently places the odds of a US-Iran nuclear deal being reached at around 44%. This figure isn’t just a random guess; it reflects the aggregated bets and predictions of participants on the platform, offering a unique, real-time insight into perceived probabilities based on available information and analysis. Prediction markets like Kalshi allow users to bet on the outcome of future events, ranging from political elections to economic indicators and, yes, even international diplomacy. The price of a contract predicting a specific outcome reflects the market’s perceived probability of that event occurring. A 44% chance suggests that while a deal is far from guaranteed, the market sees a significant possibility of progress compared to times when talks seemed completely stalled. Why Are These Odds Shifting? De-escalation Signals Emerge The movement in the Kalshi odds isn’t happening in a vacuum. Recent reports indicate potential de-escalation signals from Iran. Specifically, Iran has reportedly signaled a willingness to resume talks regarding the nuclear agreement, albeit with a significant condition: the U.S. must avoid involvement in the recent protests within Iran. This condition adds another layer of complexity to already delicate negotiations, highlighting the intertwined nature of domestic politics and international diplomacy. Facilitating these sensitive discussions are Arab intermediaries. Diplomacy often thrives behind closed doors, and the involvement of neutral third parties is crucial in bridging communication gaps and finding common ground between nations with deep-seated mistrust. These intermediaries are reportedly working to pave the way for renewed dialogue, which contributes to the perceived increase in the likelihood of talks resuming, as reflected in the US-Iran nuclear deal odds on Kalshi. How Does This Impact Global Markets, Especially Oil Prices ? One of the most immediate and tangible impacts of shifts in the US-Iran nuclear deal prospects is felt in the energy markets, particularly concerning oil prices . Iran is a major oil producer, and sanctions related to its nuclear program have significantly curtailed its ability to export oil globally. A revived nuclear deal would likely lead to the easing or lifting of some of these sanctions, potentially allowing more Iranian oil to enter the international market. When the possibility of more supply hitting the market increases, it typically puts downward pressure on prices, assuming demand remains constant. This is precisely what has been observed recently; oil prices have reportedly fallen as supply concerns eased following the signals of potential de-escalation and resumed talks. For consumers and economies reliant on stable energy prices, this potential increase in supply is a positive sign, helping to mitigate inflationary pressures linked to high energy costs. Here’s a simplified look at the potential chain reaction: Signal of Talks → Increased probability of sanctions easing Sanctions Easing → Potential for more Iranian oil exports More Supply → Easing of global supply concerns Eased Supply Concerns → Downward pressure on oil prices However, it’s crucial to remember that this is a dynamic situation. Other factors, such as global demand, production decisions by OPEC+, and ongoing geopolitical tensions elsewhere, also heavily influence oil prices. Understanding Geopolitical Risk and its Wider Implications The situation between the U.S. and Iran is a prime example of geopolitical risk – the risk that political decisions, events, or instability in one region can significantly impact global markets and economic activity. Geopolitical risk is a constant factor investors must consider, and it can manifest in various ways: Supply Chain Disruptions: Conflicts or sanctions can interrupt the flow of goods. Commodity Price Volatility: Events in key producing regions (like the Middle East for oil) directly affect prices. Investment Uncertainty: Increased risk can lead investors to pull back from certain markets or assets. Inflationary Pressures: Rising energy or food prices due to geopolitical events can fuel inflation. The ongoing tensions, even amidst de-escalation signals, are underscored by the fact that Israel continues to conduct airstrikes. This highlights the volatile nature of the region and the multifaceted security concerns that complicate any diplomatic progress. Such continued military action serves as a reminder that the path to a stable agreement is fraught with challenges and setbacks, keeping geopolitical risk elevated. Connecting the Dots: How Does This Affect the Cryptocurrency Market ? Now, let’s bring this back to the cryptocurrency market . How does a potential US-Iran nuclear deal , Kalshi odds, and fluctuating oil prices relate to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins? The connection is primarily through macroeconomic sentiment and geopolitical risk . Cryptocurrency, while often seen as a decentralized alternative, is not immune to global market forces. In times of high geopolitical tension and uncertainty, investors often move towards perceived ‘safe-haven’ assets. Historically, this has meant assets like gold or government bonds. The role of Bitcoin as a ‘digital gold’ or safe haven is still debated and tested during such periods. Here are some potential ways the US-Iran situation and related market shifts could influence crypto: Risk-On/Risk-Off Sentiment: De-escalation signals (like potential deal progress) can sometimes contribute to a broader ‘risk-on’ sentiment in global markets, where investors become more willing to invest in riskier assets, including stocks and potentially cryptocurrencies. Conversely, rising tensions or deal collapse could fuel ‘risk-off’ sentiment, potentially leading to outflows from crypto. Inflationary Expectations: As mentioned, easing oil prices can help temper inflation. If inflation concerns decrease, central banks might feel less pressure to aggressively hike interest rates. High-interest rates can make riskier assets like crypto less attractive compared to fixed-income investments. Therefore, anything that eases inflationary pressure (like lower oil) could be seen as a positive signal for crypto in the long run, though the link is indirect. Sanctions and Crypto: While not directly tied to the nuclear deal’s success, the broader context of sanctions against Iran has sometimes led to discussions about crypto’s potential use in circumventing traditional financial systems. This remains a complex and often controversial topic, but geopolitical pressures can sometimes inadvertently highlight perceived use cases for decentralized currencies, even if those uses are debated or illegal. Overall Market Volatility: Geopolitical events inject uncertainty, leading to increased volatility across financial markets. The cryptocurrency market is known for its own inherent volatility, but it can be exacerbated by external macro factors. Watching global indicators, including energy prices and geopolitical developments, provides crucial context for understanding broader market movements that can spill over into crypto. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities? The path to a revived US-Iran nuclear deal is fraught with challenges. Deep mistrust, differing interpretations of past agreements, regional security concerns (like Israel’s actions), and domestic political pressures in both the U.S. and Iran make reaching a comprehensive agreement incredibly difficult. The 44% odds on Kalshi reflect this uncertainty – it’s possible, but far from a sure thing. However, the opportunity lies in the potential for increased stability. A successful deal could lead to reduced geopolitical risk in a critical region, potentially easing pressure on energy markets and fostering a more predictable global economic environment. For the cryptocurrency market , reduced external volatility from geopolitical shocks could allow market dynamics to be driven more by internal factors like technological development, adoption rates, and regulatory clarity. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Investor So, what does this mean for you as a crypto investor? While you’re likely focused on Bitcoin charts and blockchain developments, keeping an eye on major geopolitical events and their impact on traditional markets is a wise strategy. Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources covering international relations and energy markets. Understand how events in key regions can influence global economics. Watch Oil Prices: Significant movements in oil prices can be indicators of broader shifts in supply/demand dynamics and geopolitical stability, which in turn can influence inflation expectations and overall market sentiment relevant to crypto. Understand Risk Sentiment: Pay attention to whether the general market mood is ‘risk-on’ or ‘risk-off’. Geopolitical developments are major drivers of this sentiment shift. Consider Diversification: Geopolitical shocks underscore the importance of a diversified portfolio. While crypto offers unique opportunities, understanding its correlation (or lack thereof) with traditional assets during different types of crises is key. Use Prediction Markets (with caution): Platforms like Kalshi offer interesting data points on market expectations for non-crypto events. While not direct trading signals for crypto, they provide insight into the perceived likelihood of events that *could* impact the broader market landscape. Ultimately, navigating the cryptocurrency market involves understanding not just the technology and tokenomics, but also the wider economic and political forces at play globally. The dance between the U.S. and Iran, tracked by platforms like Kalshi and impacting oil prices and geopolitical risk , is a potent reminder of this interconnectedness. Summary: Global Threads in the Crypto Tapestry The recent signals regarding the US-Iran nuclear deal , reflected in the 44% odds on Kalshi prediction market, highlight a moment of potential, albeit fragile, de-escalation. While Iran sets conditions and regional tensions persist with actions like Israeli airstrikes, the involvement of Arab intermediaries offers a glimmer of diplomatic hope. This dynamic immediately impacts markets, notably causing a dip in oil prices as supply concerns temporarily ease. For participants in the cryptocurrency market , these events serve as a crucial reminder that crypto exists within a global financial ecosystem. Shifts in geopolitical risk , energy prices, and overall market sentiment can influence crypto valuations and volatility. Staying informed about these broader macro factors, even those seemingly unrelated like a distant nuclear negotiation, provides valuable context for making informed decisions in the fast-paced world of digital assets.

According to analyst Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT), the digital asset’s breakout from a long-standing technical formation has already produced a substantial rally. But the next stage of its cycle could soon begin. XRP surged more than 500% between November 2024 and January 2025 after breaking above a 7-year pennant formation that had been developing since 2017. The pattern, highlighted in Michael’s July 2024 analysis, revealed a long-term volatility squeeze that could lead to a sharp directional move. The breakout occurred in late September , validating the prediction, with XRP soaring from around $0.55 to briefly touch the $3.39 level before settling above the $2 mark. XRP has been consolidating for 7 months since it pumped 700% after breaking out of the 7-year pennant, which I predicted. It has now reached the end of its healthy consolidation period. The next major move will begin soon and should align with Bitcoin breaking the 8-year line. https://t.co/D4dWE6powa pic.twitter.com/GSnXsghfbW — Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) June 15, 2025 Consolidation and Structural Strength In his new chart, the analyst emphasized that the asset has now undergone a “healthy consolidation” for approximately seven months, trading mostly sideways but maintaining its position above key psychological levels . “It has now reached the end of its healthy consolidation period,” he said, noting that a new major move is expected soon. The chart shows XRP respecting the upper range of its breakout and maintaining elevated price levels, which the analyst interprets as structural strength. The consolidation, while extended, has not led to any sustained retracements, indicating that selling pressure may be limited. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Context and Next Phase Importantly, Michael connects the next stage in XRP’s price development with broader market trends. He specifically mentions the potential alignment with Bitcoin’s trajectory. The asset’s perceived reputation as Bitcoin’s successor positions it to benefit from the largest cryptocurrency’s growth. XRP’s performance post-breakout has largely followed a predictable pattern of explosive upside followed by consolidation. However, what sets this phase apart is the context, both technical and historical. Breakouts from 7-year structures are rare in crypto markets, which typically experience shorter accumulation and distribution cycles. The sustained move and relative price stability over the last two quarters reflect what could be the foundation for another surge. Looking Ahead XRP is currently trading at $2.18, and whether the asset will maintain this momentum depends not only on its chart structure but also on broader crypto market behavior. If Bitcoin does break its 8-year resistance, XRP may benefit from the liquidity and sentiment shift that usually accompanies such moves.

The social media platform also suspended accounts associated with leaders of the Pump.fun platform on Monday, including the founder Alon. The suspension of the Pump.fun X account triggered mixed reactions from the crypto community. While some were disappointed with the closure, some applauded the move as it will reduce crazy speculation and give a chance to utility coins. Possible Reasons Why Pump.fun Was Suspended on X Today The official reasons why X account belonging to Pump.fun was suspended had not been released at the time of this writing. However, research suggests that Pump.fun uses unauthorized third-party X APIs or black-market X trackers to attract more users. Another possible reason for X account suspension was a potential misuse of the Live Stream feature, which has been controversial in the past year. The X accounts associated with Pump.fun were also likely suspended due to potential fraudulent activities, which include autorug. Meanwhile, a potential incoming regulatory scrutiny by the U.S. SEC could have led to the suspension of the X account belonging to Pump.fun. However, there was no official confirmation from the SEC on an investigation on Pump.fun yet. Market Impact The suspension of the pump.fun’s X account will significantly disorient its short-term market outlook.

Tensions between major regional players can send ripples through economies worldwide. Recently, a significant development suggests a potential shift in the ongoing Iran Israel dynamic, offering a glimmer of hope for reduced hostilities. Understanding the Iran Israel Dynamic For years, the relationship between Iran and Israel has been marked by significant tension and proxy conflicts across the region. This animosity stems from a complex mix of historical grievances, ideological differences, and competing strategic interests. While direct confrontation has been rare, indirect clashes and rhetoric have kept the region on edge, impacting everything from oil prices to investment sentiment in various markets, including how investors perceive regional stability. The recent exchange of direct fire marked a notable escalation, raising international alarm. However, amidst this heightened tension, signals are now emerging that suggest a potential off-ramp. Prospects for De-escalation: What Are the Signals? According to sources cited by The Wall Street Journal, Iran has reportedly expressed an interest in cooling down tensions with Israel. This interest was conveyed through Arab intermediaries, indicating a preference for diplomatic channels rather than continued confrontation. The use of intermediaries is a common tactic in complex geopolitical situations, allowing for communication without direct, formal recognition or engagement between adversaries. Furthermore, a report shared by Walter Bloomberg on X highlighted a specific condition mentioned by Iran for resuming discussions: the United States must remain uninvolved in the conflict. This condition underscores the intricate web of alliances and rivalries in the Middle East, where the role of global powers significantly influences regional dynamics. Let’s break down the key elements of these signals: Channel: Arab intermediaries are being used, suggesting a move towards indirect diplomacy. Goal: Expressed interest in de-escalating tensions. Condition: Resumption of talks contingent on U.S. non-involvement. These signals, while preliminary and requiring careful observation, represent a potential shift from the recent tit-for-tat exchanges. Why Middle East Stability Matters Globally The Middle East is a crucial geopolitical hub due to its energy resources, strategic waterways, and complex political landscape. Instability in this region has far-reaching consequences: Energy Markets: Disruptions can lead to volatile oil and gas prices, affecting global economies. Supply Chains: Key shipping lanes pass through the region, vulnerable to conflict. Refugee Flows: Conflict can trigger humanitarian crises and mass displacement. Global Security: Regional conflicts can attract external powers and fuel international terrorism. Financial Markets: Uncertainty leads to risk aversion, impacting stocks, bonds, and commodities, and yes, even the resilience of the crypto market can be tested by such external shocks. Therefore, any movement towards de-escalation is not just a regional matter but a development with global implications for geopolitics and economic stability. Geopolitics and the Crypto Market While the immediate news is about international relations, it’s important for anyone monitoring global markets, including crypto enthusiasts, to understand the broader context. Geopolitical events, particularly those involving major state actors and potential conflict, can significantly influence market sentiment. Periods of high tension often lead investors to seek safer assets, while signs of stability or de-escalation can foster a more risk-on environment. Although this specific news does not directly involve cryptocurrency, it falls under the umbrella of macro-geopolitical factors that savvy investors track. The interconnectedness of global finance means that developments in the Middle East, or any other volatile region, can indirectly affect liquidity, investor confidence, and market direction across asset classes. Challenges and Considerations Ahead While the signals for de-escalation are positive, several challenges remain: Trust Deficit: Decades of animosity have created a deep lack of trust between Iran and Israel. Conditionality: Iran’s condition regarding U.S. non-involvement is complex and may not be easily met or agreed upon by all parties. Proxy Activities: Even if direct tensions ease, activities by proxy groups supported by Iran in the region could continue to be a source of friction. Internal Politics: Both countries have internal political dynamics that can influence foreign policy decisions. Moving from signaling interest to actual talks and meaningful de-escalation is a long and challenging process requiring sustained diplomatic effort and flexibility from all sides. The role of Arab intermediaries will be crucial in navigating these complexities. Actionable Insight: Stay Informed For those interested in global markets, including the crypto space, the actionable insight here is the importance of monitoring geopolitical developments. Events like potential de-escalation in the Iran Israel conflict, shifts in Middle East dynamics, and broader geopolitics are not isolated incidents. They are part of the global tapestry that influences economic conditions and market sentiment. Staying informed allows for a more nuanced understanding of potential market volatility and risk factors beyond just asset-specific news. Conclusion: A Hopeful Sign for Regional Stability? The reports of Iran signaling a desire to de-escalate tensions with Israel, conveyed through Arab intermediaries and conditioned on U.S. non-involvement, offer a potentially hopeful turning point after a period of heightened direct confrontation. While significant hurdles remain, and the path to genuine regional stability is fraught with challenges, these signals are a reminder that diplomatic off-ramps are always possible, even between long-standing adversaries. Monitoring how these signals translate into action will be critical for understanding the future trajectory of Middle East geopolitics and its potential ripple effects across the globe, including in sensitive markets like cryptocurrency.

The aim? To leverage their influence to persuade former U.S. President Donald Trump to pressure Israel for an immediate ceasefire. This intriguing development, initially reported by Reuters and highlighted by Walter Bloomberg on X, signals a complex web of regional dynamics and strategic bartering. Why Turn to the Gulf States for Iran Ceasefire Efforts? The choice of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Oman as intermediaries is deliberate and reflects the nuanced relationships within the Middle East and with the United States. Each of these nations holds unique standing: Qatar: Often plays a mediating role in regional conflicts and maintains channels with various international actors, including the U.S. and groups involved in the conflict. Saudi Arabia: A major regional power and a close strategic partner of the United States. While relations with Iran are complex, there have been recent efforts towards de-escalation and dialogue. Riyadh’s voice carries significant weight in Washington. Oman: Traditionally acts as a neutral broker in the region, often facilitating backchannel communications between adversaries, including Iran and the U.S. By approaching these specific Gulf states, Iran appears to be seeking multiple avenues to influence U.S. policy towards Israel, hoping that their collective or individual pressure points could be effective. The Nuclear Negotiations Link: What Flexibility Means Perhaps the most striking element of this report is Iran’s reported offer of flexibility in nuclear negotiations with the U.S. in exchange for this diplomatic assistance. This ties two seemingly distinct issues – regional conflict and nuclear talks – together, revealing Iran’s strategic approach to international relations. Flexibility in nuclear talks could encompass various aspects, such as: Willingness to return to the negotiating table regarding the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Potential adjustments to enrichment levels or stockpile limits. Greater transparency or access for international inspectors. Discussion on other related issues like ballistic missiles or regional activities (though historically, Iran has been resistant to including these). Offering this flexibility serves as a potential incentive for the U.S. to consider Iran’s ceasefire request seriously, albeit indirectly through its influence on Israel. It positions the ceasefire as a potentially achievable outcome linked to a major U.S. foreign policy goal: curbing Iran’s nuclear program. Challenges and Opportunities in Middle East Diplomacy This reported request highlights the intricate nature of Middle East diplomacy . While the offer of nuclear flexibility presents a potential opportunity for renewed dialogue between the U.S. and Iran, several challenges exist: U.S. Political Landscape: The request specifically names Donald Trump, who is currently not in office. While he remains a significant political figure, the current administration under President Biden handles official foreign policy. This adds a layer of complexity regarding who Iran believes holds the relevant influence or who they prefer to negotiate with. Gulf States’ Position: While willing to mediate, the Gulf states have their own interests and relationships to balance, particularly their security ties with the U.S. and their complex interactions with both Israel and Iran. Israel’s Stance: Any decision regarding a ceasefire ultimately rests with Israel, which has its own security imperatives and strategic objectives in the ongoing conflict. Trust Deficit: Decades of mistrust and conflict between the U.S., Iran, and regional players create a significant hurdle for any substantial diplomatic breakthrough. Despite these challenges, the willingness of Iran to link nuclear talks to a regional ceasefire, and its outreach to key Gulf states, suggests a potential window for de-escalation and negotiation, however narrow. Understanding US Iran Relations Through This Lens The dynamic between the US Iran relations is a constant factor in Middle East stability. This latest development underscores the indirect pathways often used in their interactions. Instead of direct communication, Iran is reportedly using intermediaries to convey a message and an offer to a former U.S. president. This highlights the lack of direct high-level diplomatic channels and the reliance on regional partners to bridge the gap. The U.S. has consistently stated its goals regarding Iran: preventing nuclear weapon acquisition, countering regional destabilization, and addressing human rights concerns. Iran, conversely, seeks sanctions relief, security guarantees, and regional influence. The reported offer attempts to align Iran’s desire for a ceasefire with a U.S. priority (nuclear talks), demonstrating a strategic attempt to find common ground, even if through a convoluted route involving regional partners and a former U.S. leader. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean? For observers of geopolitical events and those tracking international relations, this report offers several key insights: Interconnectedness: Regional conflicts and nuclear proliferation issues are deeply intertwined in the Middle East. Solutions often require addressing multiple fronts simultaneously. Role of Intermediaries: Third-party mediators like Qatar, Oman, and potentially Saudi Arabia remain crucial facilitators in resolving complex international standoffs where direct talks are difficult. Strategic Bartering: Nations like Iran are willing to use leverage points (like nuclear program flexibility) from one area to achieve goals in another (like influencing a ceasefire). Importance of Regional Dialogue: The involvement of Gulf states emphasizes the growing importance of intra-regional dialogue in addressing shared security challenges and facilitating broader diplomatic efforts. While the outcome of this reported request remains uncertain, it provides a fascinating glimpse into the high-stakes diplomatic maneuvering occurring behind the scenes in the Middle East. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Diplomacy? The report of Iran asking Gulf states to press Donald Trump for an Israel ceasefire, linked to flexibility in nuclear negotiations, is a powerful reminder of the complex, multi-layered nature of Middle Eastern geopolitics. It highlights the critical roles played by regional intermediaries and the strategic calculations involved in international relations. While achieving a lasting ceasefire and resolving nuclear standoffs are monumental tasks fraught with challenges, every diplomatic overture, no matter how unconventional, represents a potential step towards de-escalation and dialogue. Keeping a close watch on the responses from the Gulf states, the U.S., and Israel will be crucial in understanding the potential impact of this intriguing development on the future trajectory of the region.

However, on-chain data suggests that both Bitcoin whales and retail investors still anticipate further upside for the leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Whale And Retail Inflows To Binance Tumble According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Darkfost, Bitcoin inflows to Binance crypto exchange from two distinct cohorts – whales and retail investors – have fallen to their lowest levels in the current market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Upward Momentum ‘Highly Likely’ To Continue, On-Chain Data Shows Darkfost shared the following chart illustrating that Bitcoin whale inflows to Binance have hit their lowest point since 2024. Similarly, retail investor inflows are also at their lowest since 2024, signalling a strong preference to hold rather than sell. The contributor emphasized that this alignment in behavior between whales and retail investors is a “highly constructive signal for the market.” Apart from the consistent inflows observed at the start of the current cycle, Darkfost identified two previous instances when both groups acted in sync. Notably, such periods of aligned behavior have typically coincided with previous market tops. These tops were marked by synchronized BTC inflows into exchanges, leading to a significant uptick in selling pressure and, eventually, market demand exhaustion. Commenting on the recent drop in BTC inflows, Darkfost suggested that market participants may be waiting for clearer macroeconomic cues or are simply exhibiting high conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. They added: Such alignment across investor classes may also reflect broader market confidence, with expectations of further profits ahead. Recent trading setups support the aforementioned outlook. In a separate X post, seasoned crypto analyst Ash Crypto highlighted that a Bitcoin whale had opened a massive $200 million long position with 20x leverage. Should BTC Holders Be Worried? Despite the encouraging dip in BTC inflows to major exchanges like Binance, some analysts warn that a deeper correction may be imminent. For example, TradingView analyst MIRZA recently predicted that BTC could fall as low as $85,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Negative Funding On Binance – A Classic Setup For A Short Squeeze? Similarly, veteran trader Peter Brandt shared a cautionary note, that BTC may see a steep slide in the coming months. Brandt stated that if BTC mirrors the 2021-22 market cycle, then it may risk falling to as low as $23,600. That said, BTC outflows from exchanges continue to rise, depleting available reserves – a dynamic that could result in a supply shock. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $106,920, up 1.8% over the past 24 hours.

From old favourites like Litecoin to newer names like BlockDAG, there’s no shortage of choices. Each coin brings something different to the table. Litecoin offers history and stability. Filecoin builds real utility with decentralised storage. Uniswap powers DeFi’s biggest moves. Then there’s BlockDAG, fresh, fast-growing, and already up 2,660% in value. It’s not just hype. BlockDAG has raised $306 million, sold 22.6 billion coins, and its tech is live. This article breaks down what makes each coin worth watching and why they’re all in the conversation for the top crypto to invest in as the next market cycle takes shape. 1. BlockDAG’s Numbers Show It’s Built for Growth BlockDAG is becoming the top crypto to invest in because it has both the numbers and the momentum. It’s priced at $0.0276 in Batch 29, with a launch price set at $0.05. That alone gives a near 81% upside. But those who bought at $0.001 in Batch 1 are already sitting on 2,660% gains. However, a rare opportunity is still open; BDAG is available at a limited-time rate of just $0.0018 until June 20. This gives new participants one last chance to enter at a price close to Batch 1 and aim for similar high-return potential before the price rises further. So far, 22.6 billion coins have been sold and $306 million raised. This isn’t just hype, it’s backed by progress. BlockDAG’s chain combines DAG tech with Proof-of-Work, aiming to handle over 15,000 transactions per second. It’s EVM-compatible, so Ethereum dApps can shift over without rewriting code. Over 20 exchanges are preparing for listings, and a high-profile U.S. partnership is in the works. The project’s dashboard is another draw; it features wallet functions, real-time leaderboards, and automated bonuses that encourage user growth. With 2 million mobile miners onboard and a loyal user base, BlockDAG is growing beyond early hype. For those looking for the top crypto to invest in with high upside and working systems, BlockDAG checks every box. 2. Litecoin Holds Firm as a Reliable Option Litecoin still deserves a spot among the top cryptocurrencies to invest in. It trades around $86.40, gaining over 3% in a week. While monthly losses show a 16% dip, the coin recently bounced off $82 support, showing it still has legs. Its volume stays high across big exchanges, especially on Binance with active LTC/USDT pairs. Technical charts suggest the coin is building strength again. Despite low whale action since the ETF delay, trading patterns show it might be in a steady accumulation phase. If you’re after a long-time player with strong liquidity and low-risk entry points, Litecoin stays on the list of the top crypto to invest in. 3. Filecoin’s Use Case May Catch Up to Price At $2.53, Filecoin isn’t flying, but it may be underestimated as a top crypto to invest in. It’s up 2.5% in the past 24 hours, though still down for the week. The SEC’s focus on the token brought some unwanted attention, but on-chain stats tell a better story. Filecoin’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (FEVM) has processed over 5,000 contracts. It’s also gaining ground in the DePIN sector, where decentralised storage meets real-world use cases. Derivatives trading volume around FIL sits close to $5 billion, proof that traders haven’t lost interest. If regulators back off, and more builders join the ecosystem, FIL could shift from niche to major player. It’s not loud, but it might surprise people looking for the top crypto to invest in. 4. Uniswap’s Return Could Be More Than a Bounce Uniswap has surged past $7.50 with a 25% weekly gain. That move alone puts it back in the conversation as a top crypto to invest in. But the real story is what’s happening behind the scenes. The recently passed “Uniswap Unleashed” proposal means the V4 version is coming fast. That means better features, more trading tools, and more active users. Volume on Uniswap V2 is already up to $3.4 billion. Whales are also returning, with charts showing strong buys above the $7 mark and potential resistance only around $8.25. If governance improvements keep rolling out and DeFi remains hot, UNI could outperform other decentralised protocols. Final Thoughts on Where to Place Your Bet In a sea of choices, only a few cryptos offer the full package of performance, adoption, and upside. Litecoin continues to show its value as a stable veteran. Filecoin offers a real-world use case with growing traction. Uniswap is proving that strong products and governance matter. But BlockDAG is different; it’s checking every box with clear momentum. With 2,660% gains already locked in from Batch 1 and 22.6 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is proving it’s not just noise. The current $0.0018 price still gives major room for growth. If it hits its $1 target, that’s a huge return. If you’re still wondering what the top crypto to invest in is for 2025, this might be your answer.

The fund is scheduled to begin trading on June 18, 2025, and will be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). This development follows the company’s receipt of regulatory clearance from the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), marking a significant milestone for XRP investors in the region. Canada to Host First Spot XRP ETF in North America The new ETF from Purpose Investments will offer direct exposure to XRP, currently the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Unlike futures-based products, spot ETFs are backed by actual holdings of the underlying asset. This enables investors to gain price exposure without managing crypto wallets or dealing directly with exchanges. The approval from the OSC positions Canada as the first jurisdiction in North America to greenlight a spot XRP ETF. This follows the country’s earlier pioneering efforts in digital asset ETFs, including those based on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Status of Spot XRP ETFs in the United States While Canada is moving ahead, the United States has yet to approve any spot XRP ETFs. Several major asset managers, including Franklin Templeton , WisdomTree , and Bitwise , have submitted proposals to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch similar products. However, regulatory approval remains pending. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bloomberg analysts suggest that the SEC may approve these proposals in the fourth quarter of 2025, possibly alongside other spot-based altcoin ETFs. Market watchers note that the launch of regulated XRP futures by CME Group has improved the chances of spot XRP ETF approval in the U.S., raising expectations to an estimated 88% likelihood by the end of the year. Overview of Existing U.S. XRP ETF Products Although no spot XRP ETF has been approved in the U.S. to date, some alternative ETF products have already entered the market. In April 2025, Teucrium introduced a leveraged XRP ETF, which aims to deliver double the daily return of XRP. Additionally, Volatility Shares rolled out a futures-based ETF in May, offering investors one-to-one exposure to XRP’s performance using regulated futures contracts. These products provide some exposure to XRP for U.S.-based investors, but they differ in structure and risk profile from spot ETFs. Market participants continue to monitor the SEC’s next moves, anticipating broader access to XRP investment options.

There’s been a notable development concerning one specific application that has caught the attention of the crypto market. What’s the Latest From the SEC Regarding Franklin Templeton ? Recent reports indicate that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has taken a step back regarding a key feature in one of the pending spot Ethereum ETF applications. Specifically, news circulating from sources like @PhoenixNewsIO on X, cited by Odaily, suggests the SEC has requested that Franklin Templeton remove the staking component from their proposed Spot Ethereum ETF . This isn’t an outright rejection of the ETF itself, but rather a specific instruction regarding a feature that many applicants included to make their products more appealing to investors. It signals the SEC ‘s continued scrutiny over aspects of cryptocurrency that blur the lines between commodities and securities, particularly crypto staking . Understanding Crypto Staking and Why It Matters for an Ethereum ETF So, what exactly is crypto staking , and why is its potential inclusion (or exclusion) in an Ethereum ETF such a big deal? In simple terms, crypto staking on proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum involves locking up cryptocurrency to support the network’s operations, such as validating transactions and securing the blockchain. In return for staking their Ether (ETH), participants can earn rewards, similar to earning interest in a traditional bank account or dividends from stocks. For an Ethereum ETF , the idea was to potentially stake a portion of the underlying ETH held by the fund. This could offer investors a yield on their investment on top of any potential price appreciation of ETH. This yield component was seen as a significant advantage, potentially making the ETF more attractive compared to simply holding ETH directly or through other non-staking investment vehicles. Potential Benefits of Including Staking in an Ethereum ETF (Now Delayed for Franklin) Potential Yield: Earn passive income on the underlying ETH holdings. Enhanced Investor Appeal: Makes the ETF potentially more competitive and attractive to a broader range of investors seeking yield. Network Participation: Indirectly supports the Ethereum network’s security and operations. Challenges and SEC Concerns Regarding Crypto Staking The SEC ‘s stance on crypto staking has been a subject of debate. One major concern revolves around whether staking services constitute an investment contract, which could classify the staked asset (or the staking service itself) as a security under U.S. law. This has significant regulatory implications. Other concerns might include: Custody Complexity: How the staking process and earned rewards would be managed and secured within the ETF structure. Slashing Risk: Although rare, staked ETH can be penalized (slashed) if the validator node acts maliciously or goes offline, potentially impacting the ETF’s assets. Regulatory Clarity: The overall lack of clear regulatory guidelines specifically for staking services offered to large investment vehicles. What Does This Mean for the Broader Spot Ethereum ETF Landscape? While this specific report is about Franklin Templeton ‘s application, it likely has implications for other applicants as well. Major players like BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and others also have pending applications for a Spot Ethereum ETF , and many had initially included staking features. This request from the SEC suggests a potential standardized approach: the regulator may require all approved Spot Ethereum ETF products to exclude staking initially. This would simplify the regulatory approval process by removing a contentious element and aligning these ETFs more closely with the structure of approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, which do not involve staking. If staking is universally excluded, it could impact the potential returns for investors compared to holding and staking ETH directly. However, it might also pave a clearer path for the ETFs to receive approval, potentially opening the door for broader institutional and retail access to Ethereum exposure through a regulated investment product. Let’s look at a simplified comparison of potential scenarios: Feature Potential Staked Ethereum ETF (Delayed) Likely Approved Non-Staked Ethereum ETF Holding ETH Directly (with Staking) ETH Exposure Yes Yes Yes Potential Yield from Staking Yes (if allowed) No Yes Regulatory Structure Complex/Uncertain Simpler/More Certain (like Spot Bitcoin ETF) Self-regulated Accessibility Via Brokerage Account Via Brokerage Account Via Crypto Exchange/Wallet Custody Risk Managed by ETF Provider Managed by ETF Provider Self-custody risk This table highlights that while a non-staked ETF might lack the yield component, it could be the necessary compromise to gain regulatory approval and offer a familiar, regulated investment wrapper for gaining exposure to ETH. What Does This Ethereum ETF Delay Mean for Investors? Actionable Insights For investors eagerly awaiting a U.S. Spot Ethereum ETF , this news, while potentially disappointing regarding staking yield, doesn’t necessarily mean the end of the road for approval. It could simply be a step in the negotiation process with the SEC to get the structure right. Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights: Patience is Key: The regulatory process is often slow and involves back-and-forth between issuers and the SEC . Delays and requested amendments are common. Focus Shifts to Core Approval: The market’s attention may now pivot more towards the likelihood of *any* Spot Ethereum ETF approval, even without staking, by the key deadlines in May. Understand the Product: If an ETF is approved, understand whether it includes staking or not, as this will impact potential returns. Direct ETH vs. ETF: Consider the trade-offs between holding ETH directly (which allows for staking if you choose) and investing in a potentially non-staked ETF (which offers regulatory structure and ease of access via traditional brokerage accounts). Monitor Regulatory Signals: Keep a close eye on further communications or filings from the SEC and the ETF applicants like Franklin Templeton . While the exclusion of staking might slightly diminish the yield potential compared to direct staking, the primary appeal of a Spot Ethereum ETF for many investors is regulated access to ETH price movements within a familiar investment structure. Conclusion: Navigating the Path to a Spot Ethereum ETF The news that the SEC has reportedly asked Franklin Templeton to remove staking from their Spot Ethereum ETF application is a significant signal regarding the regulatory path forward. It underscores the SEC ‘s cautious approach, particularly concerning aspects like crypto staking that have unclear regulatory classification. This development, while a delay for a desired feature, might ultimately help streamline the approval process for a basic Spot Ethereum ETF product by removing a potential hurdle. Investors should stay informed and be prepared for the possibility that initial U.S. Ethereum ETF s may focus solely on providing exposure to the price of ETH, without the added layer of staking yield. The journey towards regulated crypto investment products is complex, but each step, including these detailed requests from the SEC to applicants like Franklin Templeton , brings more clarity, even if it comes with temporary setbacks for specific features like crypto staking .

The U.S. Senate is gearing up for a crucial vote on the GENIUS Act, a piece of legislation that could fundamentally redefine the role of stablecoins in the American economy. This isn’t just another crypto bill; experts like Wall Street-based asset manager Bernstein believe it has a strong chance of becoming law in the coming months, potentially paving the way for stablecoins to function as true Digital cash and a core part of our Internet payment infrastructure . What is the GENIUS Act and Why Does it Matter for Stablecoin Regulation? At its heart, the GENIUS Act aims to establish a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. For years, stablecoins have existed in a legal grey area, raising concerns among regulators about consumer protection, financial stability, and illicit finance. This proposed US stablecoin law seeks to bring clarity and structure. Here’s what the bill reportedly intends to do: Define Stablecoins as Digital Cash: By classifying stablecoins this way, the bill intends to treat them similarly to traditional currency for certain purposes, potentially boosting confidence and usability for everyday transactions. Promote Mainstream Adoption: A clear regulatory path can encourage businesses and consumers to use stablecoins, knowing they operate within established legal boundaries. This could unlock significant potential for their use in commerce and payments. Limit Non-Financial Firms: The bill is expected to place restrictions on companies primarily outside the financial sector, like retail giants Amazon and Walmart, from issuing their own stablecoins. This measure is likely intended to prevent large corporations from creating private currencies that could challenge monetary policy or create systemic risk outside the regulated financial system. Encourage Partnerships: Instead of issuing their own tokens, non-financial firms would likely be required to partner with regulated stablecoin issuers. This could foster collaboration between tech companies and financial institutions, leveraging the strengths of both while maintaining regulatory oversight. This focus on robust Stablecoin regulation is seen by proponents as essential for integrating digital assets safely into the broader financial system. How Could Stablecoins Become True Digital Cash? Imagine a world where paying online is as simple and instant as handing over physical cash, but digitally. That’s the promise of stablecoins operating as Digital cash under a framework like the one proposed by the GENIUS Act . Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar. This stability is crucial for their function as a medium of exchange. If regulated effectively, stablecoins could offer: Instant Settlement: Transactions can often be settled in seconds or minutes, much faster than traditional banking rails. Lower Costs: Fees for processing stablecoin transactions can be significantly lower than credit card or wire transfer fees, especially for cross-border payments. Accessibility: Potentially accessible to anyone with a smartphone and internet connection, including the unbanked or underbanked populations. Programmability: As digital assets, they can be integrated into smart contracts and automated processes, enabling innovative financial applications. The classification as Digital cash by a potential US stablecoin law like the GENIUS Act would lend significant credibility and legal standing to these attributes, accelerating their potential adoption for everyday transactions. Reshaping Internet Payment Infrastructure: What Does That Mean? Currently, online payments often rely on complex networks involving banks, credit card companies, and payment processors. This system, while functional, can be slow, costly, and sometimes inefficient, particularly across international borders. Stablecoins, if regulated and integrated effectively, could become a foundational layer for the future of Internet payment infrastructure . Here’s how: Peer-to-Peer Efficiency: Stablecoins allow for direct value transfer between parties, reducing the need for multiple intermediaries. Global Reach: Internet-based stablecoin payments aren’t constrained by traditional banking hours or national borders in the same way. Integration with Web3: Stablecoins are native to blockchain technology, making them ideal for integrating payments directly into decentralized applications, metaverses, and other emerging digital environments. Wholesale and Retail Payments: They could facilitate faster, cheaper settlements between businesses (wholesale) and also enable smoother consumer transactions (retail). The vision is that a robust Stablecoin regulation framework, potentially enacted by the GENIUS Act , could unleash the potential for stablecoins to become a seamless, efficient, and widely accessible method for conducting commerce and transferring value online, truly building a new layer of Internet payment infrastructure . The US Stablecoin Law’s Impact: Winners and Losers? Any significant regulatory change creates shifts in the market. The potential passage of the GENIUS Act and its approach to Stablecoin regulation could have varied effects on different players: Potential Winners: Regulated Stablecoin Issuers: Companies already operating within or capable of meeting stringent financial regulations are likely to benefit significantly. They could see increased demand for their services as partners for larger corporations. Businesses Adopting Stablecoin Payments: Companies that integrate stablecoins for customer payments or supply chain finance could benefit from lower transaction costs and faster settlements. Consumers: Could eventually benefit from faster, cheaper, and more accessible payment options online and potentially offline. Potential Losers (or those facing challenges): Non-Financial Firms (like Amazon, Walmart) Wishing to Issue Their Own Tokens: These companies would face direct restrictions and would need to adapt their strategies, likely through partnerships, rather than creating proprietary stablecoins. Existing Payment Processors: While stablecoins might integrate with existing systems, their efficiency and lower costs could put pressure on traditional payment service providers. Unregulated or Offshore Stablecoin Projects: The focus on regulated issuers within the U.S. framework could marginalize stablecoins that don’t comply with the new law. The passage of this US stablecoin law would signal a clear preference for regulated, compliant digital assets, aiming to channel growth through established financial oversight. Navigating the Challenges: What Hurdles Remain for the GENIUS Act? While Bernstein’s optimism is notable, the path to the GENIUS Act becoming law isn’t without potential obstacles. Crafting effective Stablecoin regulation is complex, balancing the need for innovation with financial stability and consumer protection. Challenges could include: Political Divisions: Reaching bipartisan consensus on complex financial technology legislation can be difficult in the U.S. Senate. Balancing Innovation and Risk: Regulators must ensure the law doesn’t stifle technological advancement while adequately mitigating risks like bank runs or illicit use. Defining ‘Digital Cash’ Clearly: The precise legal implications and requirements stemming from this classification will need careful consideration and potentially further regulatory guidance. Enforcement and Oversight: Implementing and enforcing the new rules will require resources and expertise from regulatory bodies. The debate around this potential US stablecoin law highlights the ongoing challenge of integrating rapidly evolving technology into existing legal and financial structures. Actionable Insights: What Should You Watch For? For anyone interested in cryptocurrencies, finance, or the future of online payments, the coming weeks are crucial. Here’s what to keep an eye on: The Senate Vote: The outcome of the vote on the GENIUS Act is the immediate key event. Its passage through the Senate would be a significant step forward. House Action: Even if it passes the Senate, similar legislation would need to pass the House of Representatives and be signed by the President to become law. Monitor progress on companion or similar bills in the House. Industry Reactions: Observe how major players in the crypto space, traditional finance, and tech sectors react to the bill’s progress and potential passage. Regulatory Guidance: If the bill becomes law, watch for subsequent rule-making and guidance from regulatory bodies like the Treasury or financial regulators on implementation details for Stablecoin regulation . Market Response: The market value and adoption trends of regulated stablecoins could react positively to clearer legal status. Understanding the nuances of this potential US stablecoin law is vital for anticipating future trends in Digital cash and Internet payment infrastructure . Conclusion: The impending U.S. Senate vote on the GENIUS Act represents a pivotal moment for the future of stablecoins. By potentially classifying them as Digital cash and laying the groundwork for their integration into Internet payment infrastructure , this proposed US stablecoin law could unlock new levels of mainstream adoption and utility. While challenges remain, the movement towards clear and comprehensive Stablecoin regulation signals a maturing landscape for digital assets. Keeping a close watch on legislative developments is essential for anyone navigating the evolving world of digital finance.

This potential Truth Social ETF filing, initially reported by Bloomberg ETF Analyst James Seyffart on X, marks a significant and perhaps unexpected step into the digital asset space by the company. An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is an investment fund that trades on a stock exchange, much like stocks. ETFs hold assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds, and investors buy shares in the ETF. For cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, a spot ETF would hold the actual underlying asset, providing investors with exposure to the price movements of BTC or ETH without requiring them to directly buy, store, or manage the cryptocurrencies themselves. This simplifies access for traditional investors and institutions. What Does the Truth Social ETF Filing Mean? The core news revolves around Truth Social’s reported application for an ETF that would encompass two of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization: Bitcoin and Ethereum . While the specifics of the filing are not yet fully public, the announcement by a reputable ETF analyst suggests a formal step has been taken towards potentially launching a financial product linked to these digital assets under the Truth Social brand. Here’s a quick breakdown: Applicant: Truth Social (Trump Media & Technology Group) Proposed Asset Class: Dual Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) Filing Body: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Source: Reported by Bloomberg ETF Analyst James Seyffart This isn’t just another company filing for a crypto ETF; it’s a social media platform with a distinct user base and political ties venturing into the complex world of digital asset financial products. The move raises questions about strategy, potential market impact, and the regulatory path ahead. Why a Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF Together? Choosing to file for a dual Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF is notable. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two dominant forces in the crypto market, often seen as complementary rather than competitive by many investors. Consider the differences and why pairing them makes sense for a broad ETF product: Feature Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Primary Use Case Digital Store of Value, Peer-to-Peer Cash Platform for Smart Contracts, DApps, NFTs, DeFi Consensus Mechanism Proof-of-Work (PoW) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) (after The Merge) Market Cap Largest Second Largest Regulatory Status (ETFs) Spot ETFs Approved in US Spot ETFs Pending/Approved in US (as of recent developments) Offering exposure to both allows the ETF to capture different segments of the crypto market and cater to investors interested in either or both assets. Bitcoin is often viewed as ‘digital gold,’ while Ethereum is the backbone of the decentralized web. A dual ETF could appeal to a wider range of investors seeking diversified exposure to the top-tier digital assets through a familiar investment vehicle. Navigating the SEC Crypto ETF Landscape The U.S. SEC Crypto ETF landscape has been a complex and evolving terrain. For years, the SEC was hesitant to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, citing concerns about market manipulation and investor protection. This changed dramatically in January 2024 with the approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs from major financial players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale. The approval of spot BTC ETFs was a watershed moment for the industry, opening the door for massive institutional and retail capital to flow into Bitcoin via regulated channels. Following this, attention quickly turned to Ethereum. As of recent developments, the SEC has also moved towards approving spot Ethereum ETFs, signaling a potential shift in regulatory comfort with major proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies. Any new ETF filing, including the potential Truth Social ETF , must go through a rigorous SEC review process. This involves: Initial Filing (S-1): The applicant submits a registration statement outlining the proposed ETF. Review Period: The SEC reviews the filing, often asking for amendments and clarifications. Decision: The SEC must ultimately approve or disapprove the application within specific timeframes, although these can be extended. Given the SEC’s recent actions regarding spot BTC and ETH ETFs, the regulatory environment is arguably more favorable than in the past. However, a filing from a company like Truth Social, with its unique profile, could still face specific scrutiny or delays. Potential Implications for Trump Media and the Crypto Market What does a move like this mean for Trump Media and the broader crypto space? For Trump Media, launching an ETF could be a strategic business diversification, potentially tapping into the significant interest in crypto investing among certain demographics. It could also be a way to generate revenue through management fees if the ETF is approved and attracts significant assets. From the perspective of the crypto market, a Truth Social-branded ETF could have several implications: Increased Awareness: It brings cryptocurrency further into the mainstream, potentially introducing crypto investing to a new audience who are users of the Truth Social platform. Market Legitimacy: Another ETF filing from a recognized (albeit non-financial) brand adds to the growing list of entities seeking to offer regulated crypto products, further legitimizing the asset class. Political Intersection: This filing uniquely intersects the world of finance, technology, and politics, potentially sparking broader public and political discussions about cryptocurrency regulation and adoption. Competition: If approved, the Truth Social ETF would compete with existing and upcoming spot BTC and ETH ETFs from established financial institutions. The success and impact of this potential ETF would, of course, depend heavily on SEC approval, the structure of the fund, and investor appetite. What Are the Potential Benefits? Should the Truth Social ETF gain approval, several potential benefits could arise: Easier Access for Investors: Provides a familiar, regulated pathway for individuals and institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum through brokerage accounts. Potential for Increased Capital Inflow: A new ETF, particularly one associated with a prominent brand, could attract fresh capital into the BTC and ETH markets. Enhanced Liquidity: As with other spot ETFs, this could contribute to increased trading volume and liquidity for the underlying assets. Mainstream Validation: Another ETF product signals growing acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies into the traditional financial system. What Challenges Lie Ahead? Despite the potential benefits, the path to launching the Truth Social ETF is likely fraught with challenges: SEC Approval Uncertainty: While the environment is more favorable, approval is not guaranteed. The SEC will scrutinize the filing, market surveillance, and potential risks. Regulatory Changes: The regulatory landscape for crypto is constantly evolving, which could impact the approval process or the operation of the ETF. Market Volatility: Bitcoin and Ethereum are known for price volatility, which could impact the performance of the ETF and investor sentiment. Competition: The market for BTC and ETH ETFs is becoming crowded with offerings from major financial players. Attracting assets under management (AUM) will be competitive. Political Scrutiny: Given Truth Social’s affiliation, the filing may attract political attention and debate, potentially adding another layer of complexity. Actionable Insights: What Should You Watch For? For those following the crypto market and this development, here are some key things to watch: Keep an eye on official announcements from the SEC regarding the filing. ETF applications have specific review periods, and any updates or delays will be publicly noted. Observe the market reaction to this news. While initial reports may cause a stir, sustained impact depends on the likelihood of approval and investor interest. Look for any further details or statements from Trump Media & Technology Group or Truth Social regarding their intentions, the structure of the proposed ETF, and their strategy for entering the crypto space. A Surprising Turn in the Crypto ETF Race The filing by Truth Social for a dual Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF is undoubtedly a surprising development in the ongoing race to bring regulated crypto investment products to market. It highlights the increasing mainstream interest in digital assets, even from companies outside the traditional finance sector. While the road to SEC approval is never guaranteed, especially for a novel application like this, the filing itself is a significant event, underscoring the expanding reach and influence of cryptocurrencies in the broader financial and technological landscape. The coming months will reveal how the SEC responds and what this could ultimately mean for Truth Social, Trump Media, and the future of crypto investing.

The Aptos network, known for its focus on scalability and usability, is taking a significant step to strengthen its ecosystem’s integrity. A major development recently announced is the collaboration between the Aptos Foundation and leading blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. This Chainalysis partnership is set to significantly enhance Aptos security and foster greater confidence across the network. Understanding the Chainalysis Partnership with Aptos The core of this collaboration involves the Aptos Foundation sharing information regarding addresses identified as being linked to illicit or risky activities directly with Chainalysis. This data exchange is a critical move in proactive defense against financial crime within the blockchain space. Chainalysis, with its sophisticated tools and extensive database, can then integrate this information to improve its monitoring and tracing capabilities specifically for the Aptos network. Here’s what the partnership fundamentally aims to achieve: Enhanced Monitoring: Allowing Chainalysis to better identify and track potentially problematic transactions and wallets on Aptos. Improved Compliance: Providing businesses and services operating on Aptos with better tools and data to meet regulatory requirements. Risk Mitigation: Helping to flag and potentially prevent funds associated with illegal activities from moving through the network. This move aligns Aptos with industry best practices for security and compliance, demonstrating a commitment to creating a responsible and safe blockchain environment. Strengthening Aptos Security Through Collaboration While Aptos is built with robust technical architecture designed for safety and reliability, the threat landscape in the crypto world is constantly changing. Exploits, scams, and illicit financing attempts are persistent challenges. By integrating Chainalysis’s expertise, Aptos is adding a crucial layer of defense focused on the financial flows on the network. Think of it this way: the core Aptos protocol provides the secure rails for transactions. The Chainalysis partnership adds the intelligence layer that helps identify if the *contents* of those transactions or the *participants* involved might be linked to harmful activities. This proactive sharing of information about suspicious addresses allows for faster identification and potential action against bad actors, making the network inherently safer for legitimate users and applications. The Power of Blockchain Analytics in Combating Illicit Activity Blockchain analytics is the process of inspecting, identifying, clustering, and tracing transactions on a blockchain. Firms like Chainalysis are at the forefront of this field, developing sophisticated software that can analyze vast amounts of on-chain data. Their tools can: Identify addresses belonging to known entities (exchanges, darknet markets, sanctioned entities, etc.). Trace the flow of funds across multiple transactions and even different blockchains. Estimate the risk score associated with a particular wallet or transaction based on its history and connections. Detect patterns indicative of fraudulent activity, money laundering, or sanctions evasion. By leveraging Chainalysis’s capabilities, the Aptos ecosystem gains access to world-class tools for understanding the financial activity occurring on its chain. This is vital not just for security, but also for transparency and accountability, which are key to mainstream adoption. Driving Better Crypto Compliance on the Apt Aptos Network For decentralized applications (dApps), businesses, and service providers building on or interacting with Aptos, regulatory compliance is becoming increasingly important globally. This Chainalysis partnership directly supports efforts to improve crypto compliance within the ecosystem. How does this help with compliance? Chainalysis provides compliance software and services that businesses can use to screen transactions and wallets for risk. With the Aptos Foundation sharing specific illicit addresses, Chainalysis’s data for Aptos becomes more accurate and comprehensive. This means: Exchanges and Wallets: Can better screen deposits and withdrawals to avoid interacting with funds from illicit sources. dApps and Protocols: Can integrate compliance checks where necessary, reducing their exposure to regulatory risk. Institutions: Gain more confidence in the network’s integrity, potentially lowering barriers to institutional participation. Improved compliance coverage makes the Aptos network a more attractive and viable platform for businesses that need to operate within regulatory frameworks, ultimately fostering growth and legitimacy. Enhancing On-Chain Security for a Safer Ecosystem Ultimately, the goal of this partnership is to enhance overall on-chain security on the Aptos network. This goes beyond just tracking illicit funds; it contributes to building a safer, more trustworthy environment for everyone. Key benefits for the ecosystem include: Increased User Trust: Users can feel more confident transacting on a network actively working to combat fraud and illicit activity. Developer Confidence: Developers building dApps can do so with greater assurance that the underlying network is being monitored for harmful uses. Ecosystem Growth: A reputation for strong security and compliance attracts more legitimate projects, users, and investment. Reduced Risk of Exploitation: While analytics doesn’t prevent all exploits, tracing funds post-exploit can aid recovery efforts and deter future attacks by making it harder for attackers to cash out. This collaboration signifies Aptos’s commitment to proactive security measures that protect its community and promote responsible innovation in the Web3 space. What This Means for the Future of Aptos This partnership is more than just a technical integration; it’s a strategic move positioning Aptos as a network that prioritizes safety and compliance alongside performance and scalability. In an era of increasing scrutiny on the crypto industry, demonstrating a commitment to combating illicit activity is crucial for mass adoption and positive regulatory engagement. While challenges remain, such as balancing privacy with security and ensuring the accuracy of data, this step is a significant positive development. It provides a foundation for a more secure and compliant ecosystem, paving the way for broader participation from users, developers, and institutions alike. Actionable Insights For Users: While network-level security is enhanced, always practice good personal security habits (secure wallets, beware of phishing). Be aware that increased analytics can sometimes impact privacy, though the focus is typically on illicit activity. For Developers & Businesses on Aptos: Explore integrating Chainalysis tools or similar compliance solutions into your dApps or services, especially if handling significant value or user funds. Stay informed about evolving compliance requirements. For the Community: Support initiatives that enhance network safety and report suspicious activity through appropriate channels if available. Conclusion: A Safer Horizon for Aptos The partnership between Aptos and Chainalysis marks a vital step forward in strengthening the security and compliance posture of the Aptos network. By combining Aptos’s performant architecture with Chainalysis’s leading blockchain analytics capabilities, the collaboration aims to create a safer environment, combat illicit activity, and enhance crypto compliance for all participants. This focus on building trust through robust on-chain security is essential for the long-term health and widespread adoption of the Aptos ecosystem, promising a more secure future for Web3 innovation on the platform.

The latest to make headlines is Universal Digital, a Canadian publicly-listed company, which has announced a significant pivot in its treasury strategy. They are moving towards a Bitcoin treasury strategy , a decision that signals a growing trend in corporate adoption of the leading cryptocurrency. What Exactly is Universal Digital’s Bitcoin Treasury Strategy? Universal Digital has publicly stated its intention to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy . According to a press release highlighted by Crypto Briefing, the company plans to gradually divest its existing portfolio of various altcoin holdings . The funds generated from these sales will then be strategically reallocated into purchases of Bitcoin (BTC). This isn’t just a simple portfolio adjustment; it represents a fundamental shift in how Universal Digital Bitcoin reserves will be managed, prioritizing Bitcoin as the primary digital asset for their corporate treasury. This move suggests a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its suitability as a reserve asset compared to a diversified basket of altcoins. The gradual nature of the sale of altcoin holdings indicates a planned approach to minimize market impact and manage the transition effectively. By consolidating their digital asset exposure into Bitcoin, Universal Digital aims for a more focused and, in their view, potentially more secure and valuable treasury position. Why the Growing Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? Corporate Bitcoin adoption has become a hot topic in recent years, spearheaded by companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla, who have famously added significant amounts of BTC to their balance sheets. But why are more businesses considering a Company Bitcoin strategy ? Several factors contribute to this trend, particularly in the current macroeconomic climate: Inflation Hedge: Many corporate treasurers are concerned about the devaluation of fiat currencies due to inflation and quantitative easing policies globally. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, is increasingly viewed as a potential hedge against this loss of purchasing power. Store of Value: Proponents argue that Bitcoin serves as a digital store of value, akin to digital gold, offering a durable asset that is resistant to censorship and confiscation, unlike traditional financial assets. Potential Appreciation: While highly volatile, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant long-term price appreciation potential since its inception. Holding BTC offers the possibility of substantial returns on treasury capital, potentially outperforming traditional low-yield investments like bonds or cash reserves. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can provide diversification benefits to a traditional corporate treasury portfolio that might be heavily concentrated in cash, government securities, or short-term corporate debt. Leading Digital Asset: Bitcoin’s first-mover advantage, largest market capitalization, deepest liquidity, and robust decentralized network security make it the most established and widely accepted digital asset for institutional adoption. For companies like Universal Digital, moving towards a Corporate Bitcoin adoption strategy is often a calculated decision based on these perceived benefits, a long-term outlook on the future of finance, and a desire to be at the forefront of digital asset integration. Navigating the Shift: Selling Altcoin Holdings for Bitcoin The core of Universal Digital’s announcement involves selling their existing altcoin holdings . This process requires careful execution and strategic planning. Liquidating potentially diverse altcoin portfolios can present challenges related to market depth, execution risk, and timing. Selling large amounts of less liquid altcoins could potentially impact their price, leading to less favorable execution than anticipated. However, the strategic intent behind divesting altcoin holdings is clear: consolidate value into Bitcoin. This move signifies a strategic focus, shifting away from the potentially higher risk and volatility associated with a broader range of digital assets to concentrate on Bitcoin, which is often viewed as the most secure, liquid, and established cryptocurrency in the space. The decision to move from a diversified altcoin portfolio to a concentrated Bitcoin treasury strategy highlights Universal Digital’s specific risk assessment and long-term vision for its digital asset reserves. Is a Company Bitcoin Strategy Right for Your Business? Key Considerations While Corporate Bitcoin adoption is gaining traction, implementing a Company Bitcoin strategy is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Businesses must carefully consider various factors and assess their own circumstances before taking the plunge. It requires a thorough understanding of the risks and complexities involved: Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin’s price volatility is notoriously high. Companies must have a strong appetite for risk and the ability to withstand significant short-term fluctuations in the value of their treasury holdings. This is perhaps the most critical factor. Regulatory Environment: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally and varies significantly by jurisdiction. Companies need to navigate potential compliance, reporting, and licensing requirements, which can be complex and subject to change. Custody and Security: Securing Bitcoin holdings requires specialized knowledge and robust security infrastructure. Losing private keys means permanent loss of funds. Companies must implement secure custody solutions, whether through self-custody best practices or engaging institutional-grade custodians with strong security track records. Accounting and Tax Implications: Managing Bitcoin on the balance sheet involves complex accounting and tax considerations. Rules vary by region, and businesses often need expert advice to ensure compliance with relevant accounting standards (like GAAP or IFRS) and tax laws. Stakeholder Communication: A move into Bitcoin treasury requires clear communication with shareholders, employees, and the public about the rationale, risks, and strategy behind the decision. Long-Term Vision: A Bitcoin treasury strategy is typically a long-term play, focused on preserving or growing capital over years, not a short-term trading strategy. Companies need conviction in Bitcoin’s future role in the global financial system. Here’s a simplified look at some pros and cons to consider when evaluating a Company Bitcoin strategy : Potential Benefits of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Potential Challenges of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Hedge against inflation and currency devaluation High price volatility and potential for significant losses Potential for significant capital appreciation Evolving and uncertain regulatory landscape Diversification away from traditional assets Complex security and custody requirements Increased visibility and perception as innovative Accounting complexities and tax implications Accessibility and global transferability Public and stakeholder perception risks Universal Digital’s decision reflects their specific risk assessment, strategic goals, and confidence in managing the complexities involved in transitioning from diverse altcoin holdings to a concentrated Bitcoin position. The Broader Picture: The Evolving Landscape of Digital Asset Treasuries The move by Universal Digital Bitcoin strategy is part of a larger narrative surrounding the integration of digital assets into corporate finance. While Bitcoin remains the dominant choice for corporate treasury reserves due to its maturity, liquidity, and perceived security, the broader landscape of digital asset treasury management is slowly evolving. Some companies are exploring stablecoins for operational purposes or yield-generating strategies in decentralized finance (DeFi), though these carry different risk profiles than holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset. However, the focus for treasury strategies largely remains on Bitcoin as the primary non-sovereign, hard-capped asset. The trend towards a Bitcoin treasury strategy highlights a growing confidence among certain corporate leaders in the long-term viability and potential benefits of holding cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets. As the infrastructure around digital assets matures, including institutional custody solutions, clearer regulatory frameworks, and better accounting guidance, we may see even wider Corporate Bitcoin adoption in the coming years. This evolving landscape of how companies manage their digital assets, moving potentially from diverse altcoin holdings to more focused strategies like Universal Digital’s, is one to watch closely as it shapes the future of corporate finance. Conclusion: A Strategic Shift in the Digital Age Universal Digital’s announcement to shift its altcoin holdings into a dedicated Bitcoin treasury strategy is a significant development in the corporate world’s increasing engagement with digital assets. It underscores the growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class for corporate balance sheets and aligns with a broader trend of Corporate Bitcoin adoption seen globally. While challenges exist, including volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and operational complexities, the decision by companies like Universal Digital signals a forward-thinking approach to treasury management in the digital age. Their move to consolidate into Bitcoin from diverse altcoin holdings is a clear statement about their preferred digital asset focus and their belief in Bitcoin’s role as a long-term store of value. This strategic pivot highlights the dynamic nature of corporate finance as it adapts to the possibilities and challenges presented by the digital asset revolution.

Recent reports highlight escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, with a specific warning that could have far-reaching implications. Understanding this geopolitical risk is crucial for anyone navigating today’s interconnected markets. According to information shared by Walter Bloomberg on X, the semi-official Iranian news agency Mehr has reported that Iran is prepared to deliver a “major blow” to Israel. This statement, while brief, carries substantial weight given the historical context and ongoing friction in the region. Such declarations often signal potential shifts in military or diplomatic posture, which in turn can send ripples across international relations and financial stability. Understanding the Potential Market Impact of Iran Israel Tensions Geopolitical events, particularly those involving significant regional powers like Iran and Israel, frequently trigger reactions in global financial markets. Why does this matter for assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies? The primary connection lies in increased uncertainty and perceived risk. When major conflicts or threats emerge, investors often seek to re-evaluate their portfolios. Traditional markets, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities, are typically the first to react. Oil prices, for instance, are highly sensitive to Middle East tension due to the region’s critical role in global energy supply. Gold, historically seen as a safe-haven asset, often sees increased demand during times of political instability. The knock-on effect of these movements, coupled with a general rise in investor anxiety, can influence the broader financial ecosystem, including the crypto market. Here are some potential ways escalating Iran Israel tensions could manifest in market reactions: Increased Volatility: Uncertainty fuels volatility. News of potential conflict can lead to sharp price swings in various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Shift in Investor Sentiment: A risk-off sentiment might emerge, prompting some investors to reduce exposure to perceived riskier assets like altcoins or even Bitcoin, at least initially. Safe-Haven Narrative Testing: Bitcoin has, at times, been presented as a digital safe haven. Geopolitical crises can test this narrative, showing whether investors flock to or away from BTC during times of stress. Impact on Traditional Finance: Significant disruption in traditional markets could indirectly affect the crypto space through capital flows or changes in institutional investor behavior. How Does Geopolitical Risk Influence Crypto Market Volatility? While the cryptocurrency market operates 24/7 and is less directly tied to specific national economies than traditional stock markets, it is not immune to global events. Major geopolitical flashpoints contribute to overall market sentiment and liquidity. High levels of geopolitical risk can lead to: Liquidity Crunch: In times of panic, investors might sell assets (including crypto) to raise cash, leading to downward price pressure. Correlation Shifts: The correlation between crypto and traditional assets might change. Sometimes Bitcoin acts like a tech stock; other times, it shows traits similar to gold. Geopolitical events can influence which correlation dominates. Regulatory Uncertainty: Heightened international tensions can sometimes lead to increased scrutiny or calls for stricter regulation of decentralized assets like crypto, adding another layer of uncertainty. It’s important to note that the relationship between geopolitical events and crypto market volatility is complex and not always predictable. While a major negative event might intuitively suggest a sell-off, counter-narratives (like Bitcoin as a decentralized asset outside traditional control) can also come into play. What Should Crypto Holders Consider Amidst Middle East Tension? Given the potential for increased Middle East tension to impact markets, crypto holders might consider several factors: Stay Informed, But Be Skeptical: Follow reputable news sources for updates on the geopolitical situation, but be wary of sensationalism or FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) specifically targeting the crypto market based on these events. Review Your Risk Tolerance: Understand how potential market swings align with your personal financial goals and risk appetite. Diversification: Ensure your portfolio, both within crypto and across different asset classes, is diversified according to your strategy. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term investors, short-term geopolitical volatility might be viewed as noise or even potential buying opportunities, rather than a reason to panic sell. Security: Regardless of market conditions, always prioritize the security of your private keys and exchange accounts. The report from Mehr, relayed by Walter Bloomberg, serves as a reminder that external global factors can and do influence the financial world. While the direct outcome of the reported “major blow” threat remains to be seen, its potential to amplify geopolitical risk and subsequently affect market dynamics is clear. In conclusion, the news of Iran’s preparedness to deliver a “major blow” to Israel, as reported by Mehr news agency, underscores the ever-present reality of Iran Israel tensions. For the crypto community, this serves as a critical reminder that while decentralized, the market does not exist in a vacuum. Global events, particularly those increasing Middle East tension and geopolitical risk , have the potential to drive significant crypto market volatility . Staying informed, maintaining a clear strategy, and understanding the broader market context are essential for navigating these turbulent times.

Dogecoin Is Currently Trading Inside A Symmetrical Triangle In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared a chart that shows where Dogecoin currently stands from a technical analysis (TA) perspective. Below is the graph in question, showing the trend in the 1-day price of the memecoin. From the chart, it’s visible that the Dogecoin price has possibly been trading inside a triangular channel during the last few months. The channel hasn’t appeared to be just any triangle-shaped one, either, but a special type called the Symmetrical Triangle. Related Reading: Ethereum ETF Frenzy: Inflows Jump 5x While Bitcoin Stalls A Symmetrical Triangle forms whenever an asset observes consolidation between two trendlines converging at a roughly equal and opposite slope. The upper line of the pattern tracks lower highs in the price, and the lower one higher lows. As the asset moves inside this channel, its range becomes narrower with time, until it shrinks down to a point at the apex. Generally, volatile moves are more likely to occur when consolidation tightens, so a breakout of the pattern becomes increasingly probable as the price approaches the tip of the triangle Symmetrical Triangle breakouts can signal a continuation of the trend in the direction of the break. This means that a rise above the pattern can be a bullish sign, while a drop below it may be a bearish one. As displayed in the chart, the 1-day price of Dogecoin has recently been nearing the end of the triangle, a potential sign that a breakout could be imminent. Currently, the memecoin is retesting the lower line, so it will be interesting to see whether the level holds or if this is where a break would finally happen. Unlike the Ascending and Descending Triangles, two other popular types of triangular channels in TA, breakouts are usually considered to be equally probable in either direction for a Symmetrical Triangle. The reason is simple: consolidation occurs in an exactly sideways manner in this pattern. In contrast, the Ascending and Descending types slope upward and downward, respectively, which can bias the breakout direction. Thus, even if Dogecoin is retesting the lower level right now, a rebound and then breakout from the upper line may also still be quite possible. That said, in the event that a bearish breakout does take place, things can be especially troubling for DOGE, as there is another level of importance just nearby.

A significant development is set to unfold on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), potentially opening up a new avenue for traditional investors looking to gain exposure to the world of digital assets. We’re talking about the imminent launch of the first-ever XRP ETF Canada , brought to you by a familiar name in the Canadian investment landscape: Purpose Investments. This news, initially reported by Wu Blockchain, marks a pivotal moment for the XRP community and the broader Canadian crypto market. After receiving final regulatory clearance, Purpose Investments is poised to list an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that will directly hold XRP, offering a regulated and potentially more accessible way to invest in XRP compared to navigating cryptocurrency exchanges. XRP ETF Canada : What Does This Mean for Investors? The approval and subsequent listing of an XRP ETF Canada fundamentally changes how Canadian investors can access the XRP market. Unlike purchasing XRP directly on a crypto exchange, an ETF trades on traditional stock exchanges like the TSX. This means investors can buy and sell shares of the ETF through their regular brokerage accounts, alongside stocks and bonds. The structure of this particular ETF is crucial: it will directly invest in XRP. This ‘physical’ backing means the ETF’s performance is intended to track the price movements of XRP itself, minus management fees and operational costs. This direct investment approach is often preferred by investors seeking genuine exposure to the underlying asset’s price action. The listing date is set for June 18th on the Toronto Stock Exchange . This adds XRP to the growing list of cryptocurrencies that have received ETF approval in Canada, further solidifying the country’s position as a leader in regulated crypto investment products. Understanding the Purpose Investments XRP Offering: Tickers Explained Purpose Investments, known for launching North America’s first Bitcoin ETF, is bringing its expertise to the XRP market. Their new offering, the ‘Purpose XRP ETF’, will be available under three different tickers on the TSX to cater to various investor preferences regarding currency exposure: XRPP (CAD hedged): This ticker is designed for investors who want to minimize the impact of fluctuations between the Canadian dollar (CAD) and the underlying asset’s price (which is typically benchmarked against USD). The hedging aims to isolate the performance based primarily on the price movement of XRP in USD terms, reducing CAD/USD currency risk. XRPP.B (CAD unhedged): This ticker offers direct exposure to the price of XRP in Canadian dollars. The performance will reflect both the price changes of XRP and the exchange rate movements between CAD and USD. This is suitable for investors comfortable with currency risk or those who believe the CAD may strengthen relative to the USD. XRPP.U (USD standard): This ticker allows investors to trade the ETF in US dollars directly on the Toronto Stock Exchange. This is convenient for investors who hold USD or prefer to think about their investment performance in USD terms without currency conversion effects from the CAD side. Providing multiple tickers with different currency options gives investors flexibility in how they manage their portfolio’s currency exposure when they decide to invest in XRP via this ETF. The Significance of a Crypto ETF Canada Listing for XRP Canada has been at the forefront of approving cryptocurrency ETFs, starting with Bitcoin and Ethereum. The addition of an XRP ETF is noteworthy for several reasons: Increased Legitimacy: Listing on a major regulated exchange like the Toronto Stock Exchange lends a layer of legitimacy and validation to XRP as an asset class in the eyes of traditional finance. Accessibility: ETFs are highly accessible investment vehicles. They can be bought and sold easily through existing brokerage accounts, bypassing the complexities sometimes associated with setting up accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges, managing wallets, and understanding private keys. This opens the door for a broader range of investors, including institutions and retail investors who prefer traditional investment structures. Institutional Interest: While retail investors benefit from ease of access, a regulated XRP ETF Canada could also pave the way for greater institutional participation in the XRP market. Many institutional mandates restrict investments to regulated securities, making an ETF an ideal vehicle. Market Depth: The introduction of a regulated investment product can potentially increase liquidity and market depth for XRP by attracting capital from traditional financial markets. This move by Purpose Investments, following regulatory approval, highlights the growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into mainstream financial systems, particularly within the Canadian market. Investing via the Toronto Stock Exchange : Benefits and Challenges Accessing crypto assets like XRP through a regulated exchange like the Toronto Stock Exchange offers distinct advantages: Benefits: Regulatory Oversight: ETFs are regulated financial products, offering investor protections not always available when trading directly on unregulated crypto platforms. Ease of Use: Trading through a standard brokerage account is familiar to most investors. Custody Handled: The ETF provider handles the complexities and security risks associated with storing the underlying XRP. Liquidity: ETFs are generally highly liquid, making it easy to enter and exit positions. However, there are also potential challenges when you decide to invest in XRP this way: Challenges: Management Fees (MER): ETFs charge annual fees (Management Expense Ratio) which can eat into returns over time. These are typically higher for crypto ETFs than traditional equity ETFs. Tracking Error: The ETF’s performance might not perfectly mirror the price of the underlying asset due to fees, operational costs, and trading differences. Lack of Direct Ownership: You own shares of the ETF, not the actual XRP. This means you cannot use the XRP for transactions, staking, or participation in any potential network activities. Trading Hours: ETFs trade only during standard stock market hours, unlike crypto markets which operate 24/7. Investors should weigh these factors when considering whether an ETF is the right way for them to gain exposure to XRP. How to Invest in XRP Through the New ETF For Canadian investors interested in gaining exposure to XRP via the Purpose XRP ETF, the process is straightforward if you already have a brokerage account. On or after June 18th, you will be able to search for the ETF using its tickers (XRPP, XRPP.B, or XRPP.U) on your brokerage platform, whether it’s with a major bank or an online broker. You can then place buy or sell orders just like you would for any stock. Choosing the right ticker depends on your view on currency fluctuations and your preferred trading currency. If you are concerned about the CAD/USD exchange rate impacting your returns, the hedged CAD option (XRPP) might be suitable. If you want pure XRP price exposure in CAD, the unhedged option (XRPP.B) works. If you prefer trading in USD, use XRPP.U. This new option sits alongside direct purchases on crypto exchanges, offering an alternative for those prioritizing regulation, ease of access through traditional finance, and professional custody over direct asset control. Conclusion: A New Chapter for XRP ETF Canada The approval and upcoming listing of the Purpose XRP ETF on the Toronto Stock Exchange is undeniably a significant step forward for XRP within the regulated financial landscape. It provides Canadian investors with a familiar, accessible, and regulated pathway to gain exposure to the digital asset, potentially attracting new capital and increasing XRP’s visibility in traditional markets. While direct ownership offers different benefits, the ETF provides a compelling alternative for those prioritizing ease of access and regulatory compliance. As the Crypto ETF Canada market continues to mature, this listing marks another milestone in the ongoing convergence of traditional finance and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies.

The technical signs like a decline through key moving averages and dwindling volumes are whispering about a market that is waiting on new catalysts. Solana remains one of the leaders on the crypto market but lacking adoption by institutional buyers or a growth in network TVL its elevation can be constrained. In the meantime new DeFi crypto token Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting some traction with a price under 1 dollar as investors seek the next major cryptocurrency that can take off. Mutuum Finance currently at $0.03 is starting to gather serious momentum amongst early investors who have made large bets on its DeFi utility and potential gain. Solana Faces Key Technical Hurdles at $160 Level Solana (SOL) is trading at $152.95 experiencing a minor pullback within a broader market consolidation. SOL is however encountering robust selling at the $160-$161 region which has curtailed multiple breakout attempts in recent sessions even as the token recovers the losses suffered in May. Technical charts show that Solana is lower than its 50-day moving average by a small margin and the volume is declining as well which is a sign of absence of short term momentum. Phase 5 of Mutuum Finance Presale Now Underway The fifth phase of Mutuum Finance presale has started as the platform attracts increasing investor interest. The DeFi solution provided by Mutuum Finance operates as a scalable long-term solution instead of risky meme coins. Investor confidence remains high since Phase 5 of the presale has surpassed $10.6 million total sales and attracted more than 12000 token holders before the following price adjustment. The presale token price has reached $0.03 during Phase 5 of the presale while the launch will bring it to $0.06. USD-Pegged Stablecoin and Audited by CertiK Mutuum Finance will launch its fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Built to survive the collapses of algorithmic models, the stablecoin’s robust construction enables long-term stability and price consistency. Underpinned by open-source smart contracts and the success of a Certik audit the platform offers a safe foundation for digital financial transactions. Mutuum Finance is pairing state-of-the-art lending features with a robust ecosystem charting a definite course for the future of DeFi. Early Investors Reap Rewards as Community Expands As the platform gains traction, Mutuum Finance continues to reward its early backers. Ten lucky investors will be selected to share a $100,000 giveaway prize each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens as a thank-you for supporting the project early on. As Solana (SOL) struggles with the resistance at the $160 mark and the decreasing momentum investors are beginning to turn their attention to high-reward projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Having raised the capital of more than $10.6 million and 12,100+ people already on board MUTM is starting to receive recognition as a DeFi heavyweight yet it trades at only $0.03. The basics of the project such as a fully audited Certik security report a USD-pegged stablecoin and a dual-lending protocol can make it enter the top 20 cryptocurrencies in 2025. With SOL failing to deliver the thrills even at the early-stage projects such as Mutuum Finance are proving to be the popular choices among investors aiming to capture more substantial gains. Get your stake now before the price increases to 0.035 during the next presale stage.

The age‑old question is, can cryptocurrency prevent cross‑border crime? Criminals in early 2024 abducted two ethnic Chinese executives in the Philippines, Southeast Asia. They demanded a ransom of $3.75 million paid in cryptocurrency due to a digital trail too complex to follow, funds too fluid to stop, and technology too fast for law enforcement to catch up. What seemed like the perfect crime backfired after the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, stepped in to help. Their Financial Intelligence Unit worked with law enforcement to track the blockchain, identify the wallets involved, freeze the funds in real-time, and uncover the laundering trail the criminals thought would keep them hidden. This case suggests that cryptocurrency’s publicly accessible ledger might be the key to solving crimes. It dismisses the idea that digital currencies make it easier for people to commit offenses across borders and get away with them. However, it only worked because Binance chose to help, which raises some difficult questions. What happens if other platforms don’t do the same? What if a company refuses to give information, takes too long to respond, or doesn’t have the tools or staff to act fast? And if only a few big exchanges like Binance can freeze crypto or recover ransom money, does that mean they now have too much power to decide when to act, who to help, and how to support police or victims? Users say this control raises issues about fairness, trust, and accountability because it could give private companies more influence than some governments. Abductors launder crypto ransom through casino junkets The captors combined the ransom with other funds to make it untraceable. They sent it to multiple crypto wallets based in other countries through casino junkets because they aren’t well-regulated and can quietly move huge amounts of cash or crypto. The abductors took advantage of the junkets’ secrecy to make the investigation extremely difficult. While junkets look like travel planners or casino VIP services that help rich people travel and gamble in luxury casinos, they help move money behind the scenes. The Philippine law enforcement authorities contacted Binance’s Financial Intelligence Unit to help track the ransom payment of nearly $3.75 million in crypto scattered across several digital wallets. Binance FIU steps in Binance’s FIU team used powerful blockchain analytics tools to track the funds through the public ledger by analyzing their movement, mapping out the wallet addresses involved, and connecting them to real user accounts on the platform. They identified key wallets and accounts suspected to be part of the laundering operation. They froze over $3.5 million worth of crypto tied directly to the ransom payment to prevent the criminals from cashing out or transferring the funds to other platforms. Binance’s FIU helped turn what seemed like a hopeless digital trail into a clear path toward justice and gave law enforcement the breakthrough they needed to understand how the operation worked. Crypto solved the case, but critics say not all platforms are up to the task People have long believed that crypto helped criminals hide and move money without a trace. Still, investigators in the abduction could follow the digital trail and connect the dots because the public blockchain records every crypto transaction. Some users claim the case proves crypto can be useful in bringing criminals to justice, with one official close to the case saying, “Binance’s help was crucial. The funds were highly fragmented, but the blockchain doesn’t lie.” However, critics argue that smaller exchanges or offshore platforms lack the resources and experience to handle these complex investigations and may even ignore law enforcement requests or delay action. They say the case raises concerns about uneven capabilities in the wider crypto industry because its success depended heavily on Binance’s ability and willingness to cooperate with police. Is Binance creating a pattern of success—or just riding a lucky break? Binance’s FIU is a powerful crime-fighting team that works closely with police in high-stakes situations other than abduction in the Philippines. It helped recover over $6 million tied to fake investment wallet scams that had affected dozens of victims in “Operation Fox Hunt” in Thailand. It worked alongside Malaysian local authorities to solve yet another abduction and return more than $1.6 million in ransom paid in crypto. The team has a faster turnaround (responds to police requests within three days) than many expect from corporate investigations. It uses blockchain tools to track funds across wallets or exchanges and freeze suspicious assets before they disappear. Binance fills in the gaps that traditional financial systems and local police departments often struggle with, especially when crimes quickly cross borders and currencies. Binance’s good track record shows what’s possible when private platforms and public agencies work together with urgency and shared purpose. But it doesn’t yet prove that the whole crypto ecosystem is ready, or willing, to help stop crime on this level. The company’s assistance in these high-profile cases was voluntary, based on their internal policies and leadership choices. No global rules force crypto exchanges to cooperate with law enforcement, no consistent legal obligations that require them to freeze funds or share data, and no international body that ensures other platforms follow Binance’s example. Fighting crypto crime takes more than luck Law enforcement agencies worldwide must invest time, money, and training into building teams that understand blockchain and follow digital money trails. They should also work with advanced forensic tools to investigate crimes that now move at digital speed. Without this knowledge, they risk falling behind criminals who are already using these tools to hide their tracks. Crypto platforms, on the other hand, should integrate strict compliance rules, real-time transaction monitoring, freezing protocols, and systems that allow them to respond quickly when police request help. Companies need to build dedicated teams like Binance’s FIU and give them the power and tools to step in fast because delays can mean the difference between saving millions or losing everything. Criminals are also aware that the law is quickly catching up because digital money leaves receipts that investigators can follow, even months or years after a crime. Victims can now hope for better policies and measures to protect their money. However, while Binance proved that crypto could stop cross-border abducting, allowing more people to see it as a tool and not a threat, another deep question arises: Can crypto consistently help stop it?

He argues that increased liquidity, low transaction costs , and staking rewards offer SOL an edge over other cryptocurrencies in the treasury asset space. While Bitcoin remains the dominant crypto treasury asset, popularized by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, Shinske believes Solana offers more efficient, scalable solutions for institutional finance, especially as the industry explores tokenized securities. “With increased liquidity making it easier to raise capital, Solana treasury companies can follow the ‘Saylor playbook’ and raise capital at a premium to NAV, purchase SOL, and increase SOL-per-share,” Shinske said Solana-linked firms surge as Shinske flags $250M capital potential Shinske pointed to several firms poised to benefit from Solana’s cachet. DeFi Development Corp. , a blockchain protocol and SOL treasury company came out as the number one choice. With the firm’s US capital markets access and a crypto-native leadership team, the firm is expected to raise $250 million annually at an average premium of 250% to net asset value (NAV). Nasdaq-listed Upexi Inc., an e-commerce company, was also estimated to raise $250 million yearly, even though it has less presence in the Solana ecosystem. SOL Strategies Inc ., a Canadian operation, is another company on the cusp of getting listed in the US and is anticipated to raise the same amount at a 250% premium. Shinske commended the company’s forward-looking approach toward SOL despite a more passive approach to acquiring SOL on the open market. Those companies’ stock rallied on the news, with DeFi Development surging as much as 19% on Monday. Upexi soared 12%, and SOL Strategies rose 9.4%. Staking edge positions Solana treasury firms for faster growth than Bitcoin peers Unlike Bitcoin, Solana allows token holders to stake their assets directly to validate transactions, earning rewards in the process—without diluting equity. This, Shinske says, gives SOL treasury firms a structural advantage. “Combining staking with treasury operations should result in Solana treasury companies growing SOL/share faster than BTC treasury companies growing BTC/share, all else equal,” he wrote. Although SOL remains more volatile than Bitcoin and currently has a lower total value locked (TVL) than Ethereum, Shinske sees it as a potential frontrunner in the evolving treasury asset market. SOL is currently trading around $157, a 19% drop on the year. By contrast, Ethereum (ETH) is nursing 21% losses and changing hands for $2,644, while Bitcoin is up 14% for the period and is exchanging hands for $107,597. Even in the face of market headwinds, Cantor Fitzgerald’s endorsement puts Solana treasury companies in pole position as a new means of crypto exposure, particularly for the investors who can’t go straight to the source or custody a digital asset themselves.

This is up from the current 25%. This change encourages chip manufacturers to invest more in new facilities before the tax benefit runs out at the end of 2026. It will also boost a subsidy for chipmakers to build factories in the US. Chip makers count on the Senate for the fate of the Chips Act President Joe Biden signed the Chips and Science Act in 2022. This was one of the main pillars of his domestic policy, aiming to use government support to reverse a shift in semiconductor production from the United States to Asia. It offered $39 billion in grants and as much as $75 billion in loans, but the biggest advantage of the law was its 25% tax credit for projects. The biggest beneficiaries include Intel Corp., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Samsung Electronics Co., and Micron Technology Inc. The tax credits are likely the largest portion of Chips Act incentives issued to any company in nearly all cases. In the meantime, Trump has urged repeal of the Chips Act, even if lawmakers of both parties have exhibited little enthusiasm for getting rid of subsidies that lead to high-paying jobs in their districts. On the other hand, in place of the legislation, officials from the administration, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, are renegotiating deals with semiconductor makers to negotiate larger investments without new taxpayer funding. The Senators aim to send the tax bill — which would deliver trillions of dollars in tax cuts for households and businesses — to Trump’s desk by July 4. Additionally, the bill is expected to be revised in the Senate before being put to a floor vote. The House must also approve the final version before it can become law. Trump firmly supports his tariff policies as effective in increasing investment in the US President Donald Trump’s trade war and his push to bring manufacturing back to American shores threaten one of his predecessor’s signature achievements: the Chips and Science Act. The bipartisan law is Washington’s $52 billion effort to boost the American semiconductor industry. This plan aims to lessen the United States’ dependence on Asia for the tiny parts essential to today’s economy, as they are used in everything from smartphones to missiles. The Chips Act has prompted nearly $450 billion in promises to create factories in the United States — nearly $10 in private-sector investment for every $1 spent by the government. Despite this, Trump has complained that the program is a “waste” of taxpayer funds, calling it a “horrible, horrible thing” in remarks to Congress. Additionally, the president maintains that tariffs are more effective than subsidies in spurring investment in the US. He has also hinted he would levy fresh import duties on semiconductors “down the road.” Therefore, according to him, these are enough reasons for the Republicans, who hold majorities in both chambers, to repeal the law. However, there are indications that Trump sees import taxes and direct funding as options that can work together. In support of this, a month after he suggested getting rid of the Chips Act, he signed an executive order to create a new office. This office will manage the Chips Act funds and try to negotiate “better deals” than those made by the Biden administration. This shows he might want to put his mark on the program instead of completely eliminating it. Lutnick urges other companies to follow TSMC’s lead Howard Lutnick said at his January confirmation hearing that he plans to take a look at the Chips Act awards given out under the Biden administration and ensure he receives what he refers to as the “benefit of the bargain.” A new group in the Commerce Department, known as the United States Investment Accelerator, is now taking on the review role. Trump established this office in March with an executive order that “aims to negotiate much better deals” than Biden’s. The main goal for Trump’s team is to encourage more announcements like TSMC’s, which said in March it would invest an extra $100 billion in US plants. This adds to a previous commitment of $65 billion — all without increasing its Chips Act grants. Both Trump and Lutnick believe that the threat of tariffs influenced this decision, while TSMC pointed out that strong market demand drove its growth in the US.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Analysis As Asia begins its trading day, Tron DAO's TRX token is trading flat, up 1%. Crypto traders don't seem to be making much out of a recent announcement that Tron – for all intents and purposes – is 'going public' on the NASDAQ via a reverse merger with SRM Entertainment, a lightly traded Nasdaq-listed toy company that is now rebranding as “Tron Inc.” complete with a TRX treasury strategy. While a blockchain going public might be a little different than what traditional investors are used to, in theory, this might be a stablecoin infrastructure play. The proposed public vehicle would give equity traders access to a network that is home to 30% of all stablecoin transactions ( according to DeFi Llama data ) occur, and where half of all USDT in circulation live . In contrast, while Circle is a regulated issuer of USDC, a fiat-backed stablecoin, Tron Inc. would likely provide investors with indirect exposure to a blockchain network that facilitates a significant portion of global stablecoin activity in both the crypto market and the fast-growing global south, where the population is skeptical of the existing banking system. Unlike Circle, which does not control the infrastructure on which USDC circulates, Tron operates the network itself. This is where the two business models differ: Tron captures transaction fees and on-chain activity directly, whereas Circle’s business model is centered on custody, compliance, and interest income on the reserves backing USDC. On-chain data shows that the Tron network hosts massive whale activities, with a recent note from CryptoQuant pointing out that 59% of May’s USDT volume on Tron came from transactions over $1 million. Tron is also the network of choice for countries where the local populace doesn't trust the existing banking system, from Lebanon to Argentina and Brazil. As CoinDesk reported earlier , users in these emerging and underbanked markets typically equite dollar access directly with using Tether on Tron, rather than thinking in terms of stablecoins or blockchain protocols more broadly. While the market reaction has been muted, investors with experience in fintech or infrastructure plays may recognize the pattern. Visa’s IPO in 2008, following MasterCard’s debut in 2006, allowed public markets to gain exposure to the payment rails of the developed world. The health of the western consumer and their desire to spend pushed fees through the respective networks and dividends into investors' pockets. In China, UnionPay never went public, and so equity investors have pinned their hopes on Ant Group’s long-awaited IPO to access Alipay’s rails just as Tencent's listing gave exposure to WeChat Pay. While some once speculated that virtual yuan infrastructure might power commerce in the global south, that thesis has not materialized. Instead, commerce in underbanked regions is increasingly conducted in stablecoins and largely over Tron’s infrastructure. If that trend holds, Tron Inc. may become the most direct public-market proxy for the payment rails of emerging markets. Hong Kong’s First Solana Public Equity Listing Facilitated by OSL OSL has facilitated what appears to be the first Solana (SOL) treasury allocation by a Hong Kong-listed company, enabling MemeStrategy (2440.HK), a digital asset venture backed by 9GAG, to purchase 2,440 SOL through its platform. The acquisition of 2,440 SOL, worth approximately $370,000, was completed using OSL’s institutional platform, which provided execution, settlement, and custody services. $1.9B Inflows Cement Crypto as 2025’s Risk-On Favorite: CoinShares Digital asset investment products pulled in $1.9 billion last week, marking the ninth straight week of inflows, according to a recent report from CoinShares. That brings 2025’s year-to-date total to a record $13.2 billion, suggesting institutional appetite for crypto remains strong despite geopolitical volatility. While broader markets showed caution, capital rotated into both digital assets and gold, traditionally seen as uncorrelated safe havens, hinting at crypto’s evolving role as part of a macro hedge strategy. Bitcoin led the charge with $1.3 billion in inflows, snapping a two-week stretch of minor outflows. Ethereum followed with $583 million, the highest weekly total since February, and including its strongest single-day inflow this year. Together, the top two crypto assets accounted for over 95% of weekly inflows. But activity wasn’t limited to the majors: XRP reversed three weeks of outflows with $11.8 million in new capital, and Sui continued its hot streak with $3.5 million in inflows, a sign that select altcoins are gaining traction among professional allocators. Regionally, the United States was responsible for virtually all inflows, while Hong Kong and Brazil posted net outflows of $56.8 million and $8.5 million, respectively. These regional divergences underscore the uneven pace of crypto adoption globally, despite total flows reaching historic highs. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin surged past $108,000 with a 3.6% daily gain, showing strong resilience amid Middle East tensions as low exchange reserves and high volume pushed prices toward a key resistance level. ETH: Ethereum jumped nearly 7% to $2,671 as whales accumulated $3.8 billion worth of ETH and spot ETFs recorded 16 consecutive days of inflows, driving strong breakout momentum above key resistance levels. Gold: Gold fell below $3,400 to $3,383 despite ongoing Middle East tensions, as analysts point to a looming U.S. debt ceiling crisis, not geopolitics, as the key driver for precious metals. Nikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.21% in early trade Tuesday as Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed, with investors watching for the Bank of Japan’s policy decision and hopeful signs of de-escalation from Iran. S&P 500: The S&P 500 closed at 6,033.11, up 0.94%, as easing oil prices and hopes that the Israel-Iran conflict will remain contained boosted investor sentiment.

Ethereum is showing fresh signs of strength, pushing for a move past $4,000 as DeFi activity returns. At the same time, Pi Network’s market buzz is cooling after Binance decided not to list the token, despite strong support from users. In the middle of this shift, Web3 ai is drawing serious interest at $0.000422, helped by upcoming tools like its Crypto Lending & Borrowing Advisor. As hype-based coins start to lose ground and more focus shifts to utility-driven platforms, Ethereum’s role in DeFi keeps it high on many watchlists. Still, for those looking for bigger gains from a low entry, Web3 ai stands out. With a growing AI toolset and a forecasted 1,747% return, it is being looked at as a possible best long term crypto choice. Pi Network Stumbles After Missed Listing Chance The Pi Network is losing its recent momentum after the long-expected Binance listing failed to happen. Even with strong backing in community votes, Binance did not move forward, disappointing many PI holders. This result has slowed the PI market reaction, with trading volume falling and less interest showing up across exchanges. Missing a spot on one of the top global exchanges has created doubt about Pi’s progress and future plans. Experts point out that most of Pi’s buzz has come from community excitement, not actual product results. With energy fading, many traders are taking a second look at their positions. Though Pi is still a known name, the lack of real tools or DeFi use makes it harder to hold in a market now focused more on real-world use. As Pi continues to cool down, attention is shifting to projects with clear goals and working products. Ethereum Pushes Higher as $4,000 Level Comes Into Focus Ethereum is showing more signs of growth as it becomes stronger again in the DeFi space. Reports say Ethereum handled over $480 billion in stablecoin volume last month, much of it powered by trading bots. This spike proves Ethereum is still a key platform for DeFi, pulling in users and builders alike. Its supply setup also looks solid. Since the merge, Ethereum burns more than it creates, and this has helped make it one of the most balanced tokens in terms of supply. These signs help support the view that Ethereum could move past $4,000 soon. Chart watchers point to higher lows and strong moving average recovery as signs that Ethereum is building power. For those holding long-term, Ethereum remains one of the most trusted names in crypto. Its strong user base and high developer interest make it a steady option in a wider plan. Web3 ai Attracts Attention with $0.000422 Price and Practical Tools As Pi loses momentum and Ethereum holds firm, Web3 ai is standing out to those searching for the best long term crypto entry point in 2025. Now in Stage 08 of its presale, Web3 ai has collected over $7.8 million and sold 22 billion tokens at a base price of $0.000422. Its appeal isn’t based on hype, but on working tools like the soon-to-launch Crypto Lending & Borrowing Advisor. This AI-based tool is designed to boost returns on platforms such as Aave, Compound, and Venus. It will review live lending rates, compare lock-up times, study platform fees, and send alerts when user collateral is at risk of being liquidated. With its automation layer, it can also reinvest returns into top-performing pools, allowing earnings to grow without constant action. What makes Web3 ai different is how it builds safety into its system. Before recommending any lending platform, it checks for past audits, scans for contract bugs, and looks at failure points. These checks are key in 2025 as many DeFi users still worry about hacks and disappearing liquidity. The Crypto Lending & Borrowing Advisor will support Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon at launch, which are three of the busiest DeFi platforms. Users will get regular suggestions based on their goals, whether they want quick APY gains or slow and steady lending. In a market where making passive income matters more than chasing price spikes, Web3 ai is stepping into a real-world role. Where the Crypto Market Is Moving Next Crypto in 2025 is moving away from hype and toward projects that deliver working features. Ethereum continues to show bullish strength as DeFi use rises and its supply model improves. At the same time, Pi is losing steam as its expected progress falls short and its network lacks real tools. On the other hand, Web3 ai is showing signs of real growth. With a low entry price, working AI tools, and a clear goal for the future, it is gaining attention. With $7.8 million already raised, a 1,747% ROI forecast at listing, and the Crypto Lending & Borrowing Advisor set to launch, Web3 ai is shaping up as one of the best long term crypto choices in this cycle.

Ethereum (ETH) is approaching a breakout that could carry it to $4,000, while Avalanche (AVAX) has dropped under $21, aiming at its previous $15.28 low from March. These movements reflect the ongoing shifts in popular crypto coins. Yet away from the spotlight, a different project is steadily capturing attention. Unstaked, a crypto project powered by AI, has collected over $10 million in its presale so far. With no private allocation, intelligent governance, and a price target of $0.1819 at launch, which is significantly higher than the current $0.011397, Unstaked is becoming a top contender for those tracking emerging high-upside crypto coins. ETH Price Outlook: Is $4,000 in Reach? ETH is currently hovering just below $2,850, a key resistance level at the top of a long-term ascending triangle. Traders are watching this formation closely, as history suggests a breakout could lift prices toward $3,800–$4,000. Looking at wider trends, Ethereum has cleared a major bull flag, which strengthens its upside case. While Bitcoin moves sideways, ETH is gaining on the ETH/BTC chart, often a sign of a broader shift toward altcoins. Chart analyst Titan of Crypto points out that as long as ETH remains above the breakout zone, a rally toward new highs is on the table. In the past day, ETH trading volume jumped by nearly 47%, and RSI readings suggest the rally has room left. A strong close above $2,850 this week could turn the $4K price from a hopeful scenario into a realistic target. AVAX Slides Toward $15 as ETF Decision Gets Delayed Unlike ETH, Avalanche (AVAX) is under strong selling pressure. Its price has dropped 13.49% this week, slipping below the February low of $20.20 and now sitting at $20.07, its lowest in more than three months. This sharp fall is linked to the SEC’s delay in ruling on Grayscale’s AVAX ETF, which is now postponed until July 15. What was supposed to fuel optimism instead created uncertainty. The impact shows in Avalanche’s DeFi data, with total value locked dropping by $108 million in three days, from $1.581 billion to $1.473 billion. Technically, AVAX has exited a descending triangle, consistently posting lower highs since April and failing to hold the $21 level. A fall below $19.50 could pull the price further down to $15.28, nearly wiping out its yearly gains. Currently, over 90% of AVAX holders are in the red, and net outflows from exchanges have surpassed $4.34 million, highlighting weak sentiment. Unstaked’s $0.011397 Presale and 27x Launch Forecast Draw Attention While the top coins ride their respective waves, Unstaked is rapidly gaining traction as one of the most-watched upcoming crypto launches. Its crypto presale has reached stage 20, raising over $10 million and selling 1 billion coins at $0.011397 each. What stands out is the planned listing price of $0.1819, offering a potential 27x upside. Unstaked’s design centers on an AI-based model called Proof of Intelligence, where algorithms adjust network actions in real time. Instead of fixed coding structures or privileged leadership teams, the system evolves through user data, decentralized learning, and feedback-driven loops. The community plays a major role in this process. Decision-making happens through AI-assisted proposals and weighted on-chain voting. Every participant’s input is optimized for better outcomes, showing how the project values true engagement. There is also complete public distribution, no coins are set aside for private buyers or insiders. This approach removes backdoor manipulation and ensures alignment between the builders and the wider community from the start. Unstaked is also running a $1M giveaway, where 20 winners will receive $50,000 each in $UNSD. To qualify, participants must complete various tasks, share socially, and purchase a minimum of $100 in tokens. The campaign spans five months, offering a combination of activity-based rewards and community-driven excitement. With the listing approaching and only a few stages remaining, the pace is picking up. Those seeking strong upside and early access are eyeing Unstaked not only for its pricing potential but for its tech-driven approach. It’s important to note that while the platform’s AI agents are part of the plan, they will only become active post-launch, once the presale ends. In a Nutshell! All in all, Ethereum is gearing up for a potential rally while Avalanche battles continued losses. However, Unstaked is steadily building its story with major presale success. With AI tools, community-powered decisions, and a fully public distribution model, Unstaked brings something different to the crypto market: a clear use case, pricing clarity, and forward progress. As major projects face external headwinds, Unstaked could emerge as the quiet frontrunner in this new cycle.

46176002,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=772327,1750125649,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/46176002.jpeg,"Bitcoin To $140,00 In 50 Days? Bitwise Bets On War Rally",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-to-14000-in-50-days-bitwise/,"Bitwise Asset Management’s European research arm argues that the sharp sell-off that followed last week’s military escalation between Iran and Israel is likely to give way to a powerful relief rally in Bitcoin, echoing the cryptocurrency’s behaviour after earlier geopolitical shocks. In its 16 June weekly newsletter Bitwise Europe points to a “Chart of the Week” that lines up the twenty most significant geopolitical risk events since July 2010 and finds that, on average, Bitcoin was “up 31.2 percent fifty days after the event, with a median gain of 10.2 percent.” According to the authors, “major geopolitical risk events tend to be good buying opportunities for bitcoin and other crypto assets.” The firm’s in-house Crypto Asset Sentiment Index briefly turned negative on Friday—its first dip below zero since May—but had already swung back into slightly bullish territory by Monday morning, a shift Bitwise attributes to renewed inflows into spot exchange-traded products and continued US-dollar weakness. At Bitcoin’s current price of around $107,000, a 31% rally would bring it to approximately $140,000. Missiles Fly, Bitcoin To $140,000? The historical analogue is being tested in real time as markets digest the first open exchange of missiles between Tehran and Jerusalem. The Associated Press reports that Iran has fired more than 370 projectiles at Israel since 13 June, killing at least twenty-four people, while Israel claims to have destroyed over 120 Iranian launchers and says it now enjoys “full aerial superiority over Tehran.” Related Reading: Bitcoin 656% Cyclical Gain Highlights Deep Market Demand – Glassnode The confrontation triggered a textbook flight to safety: gold blasted through $3,430 an ounce on Friday, establishing a fresh record high, while Brent crude spiked and global equities lurched lower. Bitcoin, which had been flirting with its all-time peak near $111,000 early last week, sank as low as $102,600 during the first wave of air-strike headlines before rebounding to the $106,000–107,000 zone. Even after that drawdown, Bitwise notes, the flagship cryptocurrency still out-performed the S&P 500 on a weekly basis thanks to a late-week equity swoon. Bitwise’s thesis rests on three pillars. First is behavioural: previous geopolitical shocks—from Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea to the US–Iran standoff of January 2020—produced knee-jerk liquidations in risk assets, yet Bitcoin’s selling pressure tended to exhaust quickly, setting the stage for a mean-reversion pop. Second is macroeconomic. Related Reading: Bitcoin Future Post Israel-Iran Event: On-Chain Analysis Disputes BTC’s $50K Crash The firm highlights a “pronounced depreciation of the US Dollar,” as the DXY index slid to its weakest level since March 2022 following softer-than-expected inflation prints and another uptick in continuing unemployment claims. Fed-funds futures now imply 1.9 rate cuts by December 2025, loosening global financial conditions and historically favourable for non-yielding, dollar-denominated assets such as Bitcoin. Third is structural demand: US spot Bitcoin ETFs took in a net $1.37 billion last week, while corporate treasuries kept accumulating—Strategy’s Michael Saylor announced the acquisition of 10,100 BTC for $1.05 billion today , and Tokyo-listed Metaplanet disclosed an additional 1,112 BTC purchase that brings its war chest to 10,000 coins. In derivatives, Bitwise flags that the put-call open-interest ratio on Bitcoin options ended the week at 0.61 after dipping to 0.55, while the one-month 25-delta skew flipped decisively into positive territory at +4.87 percent, indicating a premium for upside exposure despite realised volatility languishing around 30 percent. Funding rates on perpetual swaps also remained net long even during Thursday’s risk-off purge, a pattern the firm interprets as “bullish positioning or demand for topside hedging.” Behind the scenes, whales withdrew a net 169,527 BTC from exchanges, and exchange-held reserves fell to 2.92 million coins—about 14.6 percent of supply—further tightening spot liquidity. Sceptics may note that past performance is not predictive and that the explosive rally following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine was fuelled in part by unprecedented monetary stimulus that may not be replicated. Bitwise itself concedes that realised losses spiked to $55.5 million on-chain last week and that momentum in “apparent demand” has softened. Yet the firm argues that the confluence of structural inflows, dollar weakness and depressed sentiment mirrors the set-ups that preceded its historical sample of 31-percent rallies. As the newsletter concludes, “structural demand by both ETPs and corporate treasuries as well as continued macro tailwinds via Dollar weakness and global money supply expansion still support a positive market development for bitcoin and crypto assets.” At press time, BTC traded at $107,239.

Two projects broadcasting both value and vision are Kaspa and Qubetics. While Kaspa’s steady climb is drawing attention from data-driven analysts, Qubetics is charting a different course, aiming to solve blockchain’s biggest bottleneck: interoperability. As projections for 2030 circulate and crypto presales gather steam, these two networks stand out for distinct reasons. Kaspa’s high-throughput consensus and data availability innovations offer tangible performance metrics for price speculation. Meanwhile, Qubetics is advancing as a Web3-aggregated chain, aiming at seamless connections across decentralized systems. This article dives deep into Kaspa price prediction 2030, followed by a comprehensive look at Qubetics’ interoperability feature, token supply update, and real-world forecasts for $TICS post-launch. Kaspa Price Prediction 2030: A Year-by-Year Surge to the $0.70 Mark Kaspa’s evolution has positioned it as a high-performance Layer 1 network focused on scalability without compromising decentralization. Analysts tracking long-term performance suggest the Kaspa price prediction for 2030 may offer surprising strength across all quarters. In January 2030, the minimum projected price for KAS stands at $0.425. Its average price is expected to hover around $0.437, with a potential ceiling at $0.504. These estimates reflect conservative market confidence, boosted by Kaspa’s ability to handle fast confirmation times. February follows with a minor uptick—minimum price predicted at $0.441, an average of $0.453, and a possible high of $0.522. March continues the trend with a base of $0.457 and an average monthly figure of $0.469. If upward momentum holds, KAS may top $0.540. April is forecasted at $0.472 to $0.558, while May climbs slightly higher, averaging $0.502 with a possible peak at $0.576. Mid-year gains seem consistent. June sees projected ranges between $0.504 and $0.594. By July, predictions hit $0.520 at the minimum, $0.535 on average, and up to $0.611 at the high end. August builds on the trend with an average forecast of $0.551. Entering the fall, Kaspa’s value may cross into mainstream speculation territory. September and October are forecasted at maximum highs of $0.647 and $0.665, respectively. November’s forecast jumps to $0.683, while December potentially finishes the year at a high of $0.701. Kaspa’s year-round average price for 2030 is projected to be $0.6167, with a minimum around $0.5999 and a potential annual ROI as high as 830.9%—a figure drawing strong attention across blockchain trading desks and modeling analysts. Qubetics: High Interoperability to Connect Blockchains While Kaspa’s strength lies in speed and scalability, Qubetics is setting its foundation on a more ambitious layer: interoperability. In an area where most blockchains operate in silos, Qubetics is positioning itself as the connective tissue of the decentralized internet. Its architecture supports seamless interactions between blockchains, tokens, and DApps—including legacy giants like Bitcoin. Current chains often struggle to share data or transfer assets without cumbersome bridges or centralized workarounds. Qubetics aims to remove these issues by offering native-level compatibility and frictionless cross-chain execution. By enabling different protocols to speak the same language, Qubetics creates a composable ecosystem where apps can scale and interoperate, regardless of their origin chain. Such a setup doesn’t just aid developers. It creates smoother user experiences across wallets, DeFi protocols, and decentralized identity layers. Qubetics Crypto Presale: Scarcity Meets Acceleration The Qubetics presale is in its final public stage—Stage 37—and momentum is accelerating. With the token priced at $0.3370, over $18 million has already been raised. More than 515 million $TICS tokens have been sold, and the total number of token holders now exceeds 28,000. A major tokenomics update has drastically reduced the total supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion. This redesign enhances scarcity while increasing the public allocation to 38.55%. That shift empowers the wider community, putting more governance and rewards directly in the hands of $TICS holders. With less than 10 million tokens remaining in the final tranche, analysts are forecasting a 20% jump at listing. Qubetics Price Predictions: A $15,000 Allocation in Perspective Allocating $15,000 to $TICS at today’s crypto presale rate of $0.3370 would secure approximately 44,504 tokens. If the listing price rises to $0.40, that portfolio would be worth $17,801—an instant gain of nearly 18.7%. Should the price surge to $1, the same tokens would be valued at $44,504. At $5 per token, the value would spike to $222,520. In more aggressive growth scenarios, where $TICS hits $10 after mainnet and ecosystem integrations mature, the value becomes $445,040. At a post-mainnet valuation of $15, the original $15,000 would translate to $667,560. That’s a 4,349% ROI based on a forecasted mainnet price point, powered by both the scarcity mechanics and the projected utility of its interoperable framework. These forecasts are speculative and depend on market adoption, liquidity conditions, and continued project execution. However, analysts are increasingly confident due to strong presale performance and a transparent development roadmap. Conclusion: A Future Fueled by Cross-Chain Collaboration and Scalable Infrastructure Kaspa and Qubetics are prime examples of the dual trajectory of the blockchain space: one rooted in optimizing internal performance and another focused on external connectivity. Kaspa’s consistent growth and efficient architecture position it as a key contender for gradual, high-confidence value appreciation by 2030. Qubetics, meanwhile, offers a different kind of value—one rooted in network unification. By providing native interoperability across decentralized systems, it lays the groundwork for a truly aggregated Web3 experience. For those tracking both scalability and connectivity, Kaspa and Qubetics represent complementary avenues in a decentralized future.

The deal dramatically reduces tariffs on British exports and expands the US access to key UK markets. The executive order, signed just hours after a brief meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Canada, is expected to “operationalize” the agreement. Central to the deal is reducing the US automotive tariff from 27.5% to 10% for the first 100,000 UK-manufactured vehicles shipped to the American market annually. “This is a very good day for both of our countries, a real sign of strength,” Starmer said, confirming the new terms will immediately take effect. The agreement also shields British exports of jet engines and other aerospace components from US tariffs linked to a national security investigation Trump had launched into the aerospace sector. That exemption hinges on UK commitments to exclude China from sensitive defense and technology supply chains. Tariff relief spurs industry divides as UK bioethanol, steel sectors raise alarm While industries such as automotive and aerospace are celebrating the deal, the agreement has provoked controversy in other sectors. The UK has granted the US a tariff-free quota of 1.4 billion liters of ethanol, equivalent to the country’s entire annual demand. UK bioethanol producers have warned the decision threatens the viability of domestic production. Britain also agreed to enhance market access for American beef and industrial goods in exchange for the US tariff cuts. Negotiations regarding the treatment of UK steel and aluminum are still ongoing. The trade deal promises to eliminate US tariffs on these exports, but technical and legal hurdles have delayed implementation. British officials say they are still working with the US to finalize a quota system that would allow UK steelmakers to sidestep the 25% global steel tariff imposed by Trump under national security provisions. The situation is further complicated by US rules that require steel to be “melted and poured” in the country of origin to qualify for tariff relief—criteria that much of Britain’s steel, which is reprocessed from imported material, does not meet. As negotiations continue, Trump has offered the UK a temporary exemption from his newly doubled global steel tariff of 50%, giving time to resolve the issues. Starmer pushes rapid rollout as UK industries react to landmark US trade deal Under mounting pressure at home to secure relief for industries battered by tariffs, Starmer emphasized the importance of swift implementation. The UK automobile sector, in particular, has applauded the car tariff reduction, calling it a much-needed boost for exports amid economic uncertainty. Despite objections from the UK’s bioethanol industry, the trade pact marks one of the most comprehensive bilateral deals between the two nations in recent years and a shift in transatlantic economic relations. “We just signed it, and it’s done,” Trump told reporters, adding that the agreement reflects a new chapter in US-UK cooperation.

According to a filing dated June 16, 2025, the SEC submitted a status report to the court, requesting that the appeals stay on hold until at least August 15, 2025, when they’ll provide another update. This move comes as Ripple and the SEC continue working through a possible settlement that could reshape the outcome of the long-running case. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP In light of the pending motion for an indicative ruling, the parties have requested that the Second Circuit continue to hold the appeals in abeyance, with the @SECGov to file a status report by August 15, 2025. https://t.co/7oQvL5Rx7U — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) June 17, 2025 Earlier this year, both sides reached an agreement in principle to settle the case, but it requires the district court’s approval to modify the final judgment. Under the proposed deal, Ripple would pay a reduced penalty of $50 million, down from $125 million, with the remaining funds returned to Ripple. The SEC would also agree to lift the injunction against the company. However, a previous motion for this change was denied by the district court in May because it didn’t explain why “exceptional circumstances” justified the modification. Ripple and the SEC have since filed a new joint motion on June 12, providing additional reasons and requesting an indicative ruling from the court. Until that decision is made, both Ripple and the SEC agree it’s best to keep the appeals paused. If the district court grants their request, both sides would then ask the Second Circuit for a limited remand to finalize the settlement. On the flip side, XRP price gained 7% and hit a high of $2.34 before hitting a reverse.

That number marks the highest level since last year. It shows that many traders are using borrowed funds to bet on where Ethereum will go next. Price Tests Multi‑Year Resistance ETH rose about 4.5% in a single session. Based on technical charts, that rally pushed ETH right up to a long‑standing descending trendline. Investors have watched that line for over a year. It sits just above the 50‑week moving average, while the 200‑week average lies just below. If ETH can clear and hold above these levels, it may signal room to run. But weak trading volume could mean bulls need more firepower before taking charge. ETF Flows Show Steady Support US spot funds tied to Ethereum saw a small outflow of $2.18 million on the same day, marking the first net withdrawal in 19 days. Yet weekly inflows still totaled $528.12 million, pushing total assets under management in these ETFs beyond $10 billion. Institutional Backing Expands ETH Reach Major asset managers are also getting more creative with Ethereum. Companies such as BlackRock and Fidelity have begun rolling out tokenized treasury products and stablecoin‑backed funds that link directly to ETH.

They support the notion that Ethereum is not only capable of fueling DeFi tests, but also applications in the real world. Ethereum Drift Remains Steady Before Potential Ripples Meanwhile, market statistics shows Ethereum traded calmly at $2,630 on June 16, showing a 4% increase in the last 24 hours. Futures markets are warming up, with volumes rising steeply as large players pour into ETH-based contracts. Speculative positions usually foretell choppy action. As increasing amounts of money move into leveraged positions, even modest moves in price can cause forced liquidations—sometimes on both the long and short sides. When that occurs, volatility increases. That is to say, today’s tranquil chart can become jagged quickly once those mammoth bets begin to be unravel.

This comes as the network’s on-chain metrics show strength, with staking addresses topping 1.3M. Analysts are watching to see if the internal friction will impact the ADA token’s price. Cardano (ADA) is facing a moment of truth. Once propelled by strong narratives like the promise of $ADA ETFs, the launch of Bitcoin DeFi, and advancements like Midnight, recent discussions have taken a sharp turn. According to analyst Dan Gambardello, the blockchain needs an urgent narrative reset to avoid derailment. Headlines suggest ADA may be sold for underused stablecoins or converted to Bitcoin. These emerging perspectives are gaining traction, yet many in the community, including Gambardello himself, strongly disagree. The concern is that these new directions are not only unconvincing but risk undermining the network’s hard-won progress at a crucial time in the market cycle. Cardano needs a narrative reset, fast!

Weekly inflows into digital asset products reached $1.9 billion, extending a nine-week positive trend. Altogether, inflows during this streak hit $12.9 billion, with year-to-date figures now at a record $13.2 billion. According to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report , Bitcoin bounced back strongly last week after two weeks of minor outflows as it attracted $1.3 billion in fresh inflows. Short-bitcoin funds also registered slight inflows of $3.7 million, although their total assets under management stayed low at $96 million. Ethereum continued its upward trajectory, with inflows of $583 million – the highest since February – including its strongest daily inflow during that time. The latest surge brings Ethereum’s cumulative inflows to $2 billion, which now represents 14% of its total AuM. XRP also saw renewed interest, reversing a three-week outflow trend with $11.8 million in inflows. Sui attracted another $3.5 million. Solana, Cardano, and Chainlink also noted modest inflows of $1.3 million, $0.4 million, and $0.3 million, respectively. On the other hand, multi-asset investment products recorded $14 million in outflows for the fourth consecutive week. Litecoin, too, saw a minor outflow of $0.1 million.

We’re tracking developments regarding the ongoing Iran Israel conflict , a situation with the potential to send ripples through global markets, including the cryptocurrency space. Understanding these geopolitical tensions is crucial for anyone navigating today’s volatile economic landscape. What’s the Latest in the Iran Israel Conflict? According to reports citing Saudi Arabian news channel Al Hadath, relayed via the Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has issued a stark warning. They stated that their attacks will persist unless Israel ceases its own actions against Iran. This declaration underscores a critical point in the current escalation, indicating a potential continuation of hostilities rather than de-escalation. This isn’t just a localized issue; the Middle East conflict has far-reaching implications. Any increase in military activity or rhetoric between these two nations immediately captures the attention of international observers and market participants alike. The history between Iran and Israel is complex and marked by periods of heightened tension, often involving proxy conflicts and regional power struggles. This latest exchange follows a series of events that have brought direct confrontation into sharper focus. The statement from the IRGC is particularly significant because it ties the cessation of their attacks directly to Israel’s actions. This suggests a tit-for-tat dynamic that could be difficult to break, potentially leading to a prolonged period of instability. For investors and analysts, this means factoring in a higher degree of political risk when evaluating market conditions. How Do Geopolitical Tensions Typically Affect Global Markets? When geopolitical tensions rise, financial markets tend to react with uncertainty. This isn’t a new phenomenon; historical events have repeatedly shown that political instability can have a tangible impact on asset prices. Here’s a quick look at common reactions: Safe-Haven Assets: Assets traditionally considered ‘safe havens’ like gold, certain government bonds (like US Treasuries), and sometimes the US dollar, often see increased demand as investors seek refuge from risk. Oil Prices: The Middle East is a major oil-producing region. Any conflict there can disrupt supply or create fears of disruption, leading to spikes in oil prices. This, in turn, can fuel inflation concerns globally. Stock Markets: Equity markets typically react negatively to uncertainty. Sectors perceived as vulnerable to geopolitical risk (e.g., airlines, tourism) might see sharper declines, while defense stocks could see gains. Overall market indices often experience increased volatility. Currency Markets: Currencies of countries perceived as being directly or indirectly involved, or those heavily reliant on affected regions for trade or energy, can experience fluctuations. The current Iran Israel conflict fits squarely into this pattern of risk factors that traders and investors monitor closely. The potential for escalation means these market reactions could be sustained or even amplified depending on how the situation develops. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market Impact? The question on many minds, especially for our readers, is: what is the potential crypto market impact ? The relationship between geopolitical events and cryptocurrency prices is a subject of ongoing debate. Some argue that Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies act as digital safe havens, uncorrelated with traditional financial systems and immune to the direct effects of regional conflicts. The theory is that in times of political or economic turmoil, investors might turn to decentralized assets like Bitcoin as a store of value, especially in regions experiencing capital controls or currency devaluation. We’ve seen instances where local conflicts or economic crises seemed to correlate with increased crypto adoption or price movements in those specific areas. However, the reality is more complex. The crypto market is still heavily influenced by global liquidity, macroeconomic factors, and overall market sentiment. While a major geopolitical shock *could* theoretically drive some investors towards crypto as an alternative, it could also trigger a broader risk-off sentiment where investors sell all ‘risky’ assets, including cryptocurrencies, to move into cash or traditional safe havens. Recent history shows mixed reactions. Sometimes, Bitcoin has rallied during periods of global uncertainty; other times, it has fallen along with stock markets. The narrative of crypto as a safe haven is still being tested and proven over time. With the Middle East conflict involving major regional players like Iran and Israel, the potential for broader economic disruption is significant. This disruption could manifest in various ways, from impacting energy prices to altering trade routes, all of which can indirectly affect investor confidence and market flows, including those into and out of crypto assets. How Can Investors Navigate Rising Geopolitical Tensions? Navigating markets during times of heightened geopolitical tensions requires careful consideration and a focus on long-term strategy rather than panic-driven decisions. Here are a few actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources from various perspectives to get a balanced view of the situation. Avoid relying solely on social media or unverified reports. Understanding the facts is the first step. Review Your Portfolio: Assess your exposure to assets that might be particularly vulnerable to this type of conflict. This applies to both traditional investments and your crypto holdings. Consider Diversification: Ensure your portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes and geographies. This can help mitigate risk if one particular sector or region is heavily impacted. Risk Management: Have a clear risk management strategy. This might involve setting stop-loss orders or reducing leverage if you are trading. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Long-Term Perspective: Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term news cycles. Geopolitical events can cause temporary volatility, but the long-term fundamentals of an investment should be the primary driver of your strategy. Understand Crypto’s Role: While the potential crypto market impact is debated, understand that crypto is still a volatile asset class. It might not behave as a guaranteed safe haven in all scenarios. The statement from the IRGC about the Iran Israel conflict is a reminder that external factors can significantly influence market dynamics. While we focus on the crypto world, it exists within a larger global economic and political context. Looking Ahead: Uncertainty in Global Markets The immediate future remains uncertain as long as the tit-for-tat dynamic between Iran and Israel continues. The statement from the IRGC, as reported, suggests that de-escalation is contingent on Israel’s actions. This puts the ball back in Israel’s court, potentially setting the stage for further responses and counter-responses. The impact on global markets will depend on the severity and duration of any further conflict. A limited exchange might cause temporary jitters, while a more significant escalation could lead to sustained volatility and potentially impact economic growth forecasts. For the crypto market impact , the coming days and weeks will be telling. Will Bitcoin react as a safe haven, or will it follow traditional risk assets? The answer likely depends on the broader macroeconomic environment and the specific nature of the geopolitical events unfolding. In conclusion, the latest development in the Iran Israel conflict , with Iran vowing to continue attacks unless provoked, is a critical piece of news for anyone monitoring global stability and market reactions. The interconnectedness of the world means that geopolitical tensions in one region can have ripple effects far and wide, influencing everything from oil prices to the performance of digital assets. Staying informed and maintaining a disciplined investment approach are key during these turbulent times.

Miners Strengthen U.S. Market Control; BTC Supported According to JPMorgan, U.S.-listed miners now control 31.5% of the global Bitcoin hashrate—the highest share on record. Riot Platforms, Hive Technologies, and CleanSpark lead the charge, with a combined 99% year-on-year increase in hashrate capacity. Meanwhile, network growth stood at 55%.

This shift consolidates institutional infrastructure in North America, supporting the argument that Bitcoin is maturing into a fully fledged asset class. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Bulls Lose Grip at $108,950 Bitcoin is currently trading at $106,647, down 0.52% on the day. The 1-hour chart shows BTC retreating from symmetrical triangle resistance near $108,951.

As the market increases, funding rounds and mergers or acquisitions play a strong role in supporting new ideas, uniting companies and making the industry bigger. The current state of crypto funding Money from venture capital in cryptocurrencies has gone through significant changes, both showing its promise and how much it can fluctuate. Crypto funding rose to record levels in 2021 and 2022, and then experienced a decline in 2023 before signs of rebound appeared. Blockchain companies go through various funding phases, such as seed funding when they start out, and much larger Series C and D rounds when they are more developed. Investors are focusing on DeFi (decentralized finance) projects, marketplaces for NFTs (non-fungible tokens), digital asset exchanges, blockchain infrastructure providers and Web 3.0 gaming platforms. Those who manage significant institutional funds are getting more experienced in understanding crypto investments. Firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and Paradigm have launched crypto funds, and investors like Polychain Capital and Pantera Capital are now noted in the industry. Key trends in crypto funding Infrastructure Support for blockchain infrastructure, scaling options, tools that help blockchains connect and methods for developers to use the technology have received significant investment these days. This evidence indicates that industries recognize that good infrastructure plays a major part in encouraging many individuals to use cryptocurrency. Investment Businesses centered on following the proper rules and serving institutions have seen much investment. Among these are keeping records clean, software for following the rules and technology built for large investors. Real-world application People who invest money now often look for projects that offer more than just a chance to profit from increased prices. This category covers supply chain management, digital identity options and data storage networks that don’t depend on a central system. Geographic diversification There is currently more cryptocurrency involvement around the globe since New York and Silicon Valley are joined by Europe, Asia and places like India, which are receiving significant funding. Mergers and acquisitions – Consolidation in a maturing market Competition has increased, and as the crypto market matures, more M&A (mergers and acquisitions) activities are becoming common. Regulatory pressure, the need to grow bigger, technological advances and the uncertain market are reasons for consolidation in the industry. Strategic acquisitions Many cryptocurrencies and blockchain companies have bought smaller firms to add new features, target other regions or acquire vital technology. Deals are usually based on compliance, advanced trading technology or large user numbers. Talent acquisitions Crypto companies seek to purchase developers and experienced blockchain experts. Since the pool of skilled people in blockchain is small, buying talent and employing people with these skills is popular. Cross-industry integrations Many banks and technology companies are acquiring cryptocurrency firms to integrate blockchain technology into their standard services. This trend shows that businesses outside finance are starting to use cryptocurrency technologies. Notable merger and acquisition transactions Certain deals that have taken place in the crypto mergers and acquisitions market have been very influential in the industry. Such deals point to the fact that transactions in the sector are on the rise and fuel speculation about bona fide business deals. Over the recent past, several large trading platforms have purchased small rivals to assist them in entering new markets or broadening their offerings. Blockchain infrastructure providers have also been consolidated to build more end-to-end solution systems. The overlap between TradFi (traditional finance) and crypto has been handy in that it acts as the point of entry into the digital asset ecosystem by big institutions – without which they would need to build their crypto-related business from scratch. Crypto mergers and acquisitions problems Regulatory uncertainty The dynamics of regulations also create a scenario whereby crypto companies struggle to plan and conduct mergers and acquisitions. Firms must deal with varying legislation across different jurisdictions, which could hinder transaction acceptance. Valuation challenges The vast changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies mean that it is difficult to value them appropriately. Conventional methods of valuing assets do not stand a chance of developing specific aspects of crypto assets, tokenized systems and decentralized protocols. Due diligence complexity To review crypto companies, one must be knowledgeable about blockchain technology, token regulation, smart contract safety and law compliance. Owing to this complexity, transaction time and transaction costs may increase. Cultural difference Crypto companies also tend to believe in a culture of decentralization and community-driven, which is challenging to combine in a typical corporation. The role of tokenomics in funding and mergers and acquisitions A special feature of crypto funding is the use of tokens, which serve purposes such as fundraising, network management and transactions within cryptocurrency systems. Therefore, new ways of raising money have appeared, such as ICOs (initial coin offerings), STOs (security token offerings) and lately, IDOs (initial DEX offerings). Using tokens for funding raises both positive points and challenges. Its cost-effective fundraising and building of user-based communities might be outweighed by the extra regulations and possible disputes between those with crypto assets and those with shares in a business. Adding tokens complicates mergers and acquisition transactions. Acquirers have to look into the economics of the company’s tokens, any possible regulatory outcomes and the responses of the blockchain community to the change in ownership. Examining the possible trends and outcomes Increase institutional participation – As regulations become clearer, more institutional investors may join the crypto funding space, which can lead to larger project funding and better-organized management. Regulatory-driven consolidation – Regulation changes could make it more attractive for large and well-financed companies, leading to more industry concentrations. Cross-chain integration – When it becomes easier for platforms to communicate across blockchain networks, more mergers and acquisition will aim to merge different blockchain systems. Traditional finance integration – Traditional finance and crypto are becoming more mixed as more companies from both areas work and team up. Conclusion The way cryptocurrency companies get funding and merge shows that the industry is changing from its early days to becoming a mature financial field. Even with obstacles such as unsure regulations and markets, investors are becoming more knowledgeable. Infrastructure improvement and involvement with traditional finance ridgelines are likely to continue driving the industry’s growth. You must manage regulations, study each opportunity closely and understand how blockchain and tokens work in this market. As the industry matures, activity related to funding and various mergers may determine the future of cryptocurrencies. Businesses and investors that organize their activities to fit the rules while staying innovative are most likely to win in this shifting market. As more institutions become involved in these processes, deals will become more complex, and financial integration will grow.

Social media platforms, particularly X (formerly Twitter), became the breeding ground for unverified claims suggesting a potential collaboration involving Eric Trump and a public company with ties to the Tron ecosystem. What Were the Eric Trump & Tron Rumors About? Whispers began circulating online, gaining traction rapidly as unconfirmed reports often do in the fast-paced digital age. The core of these rumors centered on the idea that Eric Trump was planning to join or become publicly involved with a company linked to the Tron blockchain project. The speculation didn’t stop there; it specifically suggested this entity would be structured or operate in a manner similar to MicroStrategy MSTR , the well-known business intelligence firm that has made significant headlines for its substantial Bitcoin holdings and strategy. The comparison to MicroStrategy MSTR is noteworthy because it implies a potential strategy focused on accumulating a specific cryptocurrency (presumably TRX or a related asset) on a corporate balance sheet, similar to how MicroStrategy has adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. Such a move by a public company, especially one potentially associated with a high-profile name like Eric Trump, would undoubtedly garner significant attention from both traditional finance and the crypto community. Did Eric Trump Address the Crypto Rumors? Yes, Eric Trump took to the social media platform X to directly address and deny the swirling speculation. In a post that quickly gained attention, he sought to clarify his position regarding the alleged involvement with any Tron -backed public company. This direct denial aimed to quash the rumors before they could spread further and potentially create confusion or misguided expectations within the market or among followers of either Trump or Tron. Understanding Eric Trump’s Stance on Tron and Justin Sun While denying any formal or public involvement with the rumored company, Eric Trump did not dismiss the Tron project or its founder, Justin Sun , outright. On the contrary, his denial post reportedly included words of admiration for both the Tron ecosystem and Justin Sun himself. This nuance is important, as it suggests a general positive view of the technology or the figure behind it, even if there are no current plans for a direct business collaboration of the type being rumored. It’s not uncommon for public figures to express interest in or admiration for various technologies and projects without necessarily being involved in specific ventures. Trump’s comments highlight this distinction, separating personal appreciation from concrete business commitments. The MicroStrategy MSTR Model: Why the Comparison? The comparison to MicroStrategy MSTR is significant in the context of these crypto rumors . MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, pioneered the strategy of making Bitcoin a primary treasury asset for a publicly traded corporation. This approach has been both praised and criticized, but it undeniably set a precedent and provided a template for how a company might gain exposure to cryptocurrency markets through its balance sheet rather than just offering crypto-related services. A hypothetical ‘Tron-backed’ company following the MicroStrategy MSTR model would likely involve: Accumulating a large amount of TRX or a related Tron ecosystem token. Potentially raising capital specifically for this purpose. Operating as a public company, subject to regulatory filings and public scrutiny. The rumor suggested a venture aiming for similar institutional-level adoption or investment focus, but centered around Tron’s ecosystem instead of Bitcoin. The Impact of Crypto Rumors on the Market and Community Unverified rumors, especially those involving well-known personalities or established crypto projects like Tron , can have various effects: Price Volatility: Speculation can sometimes lead to short-term price movements in the associated cryptocurrency (TRX in this case) as traders react to the unconfirmed news. Misinformation Spread: Rumors contribute to a noisy information environment, making it harder for individuals to discern factual news from speculation. Community Sentiment: They can create excitement, confusion, or skepticism within the respective communities (Tron community, crypto enthusiasts). Reputational Risk: For individuals like Eric Trump or figures like Justin Sun , and for projects like Tron , dealing with false rumors requires clear communication to maintain credibility. Eric Trump’s swift denial is an example of how individuals can address such situations to prevent prolonged speculation. Actionable Insights in a Rumor-Filled Landscape For anyone navigating the crypto space, the prevalence of crypto rumors highlights the importance of critical thinking and verification: Verify Sources: Always question information that doesn’t come from official channels (e.g., official company announcements, verified social media accounts of the individuals involved, reputable news outlets reporting on confirmed statements). Be Wary of Social Media Hype: Platforms like X are breeding grounds for speculation. While they can break news, they also amplify unverified claims rapidly. Understand the Players: Familiarize yourself with key figures like Justin Sun and projects like Tron to better assess the plausibility of rumors. Look for Official Denials or Confirmations: Pay attention when individuals or entities directly address rumors, as Eric Trump did. This incident serves as a reminder that not every exciting piece of information shared online, even if it involves prominent names and intriguing comparisons like MicroStrategy MSTR , holds truth. Conclusion: Setting the Record Straight In summary, recent crypto rumors linking Eric Trump to a Tron -backed public company following the MicroStrategy MSTR model were directly addressed and denied by Trump himself. While expressing admiration for Tron and Justin Sun , he clarified that he has no public involvement in such a project. This incident underscores the dynamic nature of information dissemination in the crypto space and the critical need for individuals to rely on verified sources when evaluating news and speculation.

A significant piece of proposed legislation aimed at defining the rules for digital assets, known as the CLARITY Act (officially the U.S. Crypto Market Structure Bill), has reportedly hit a major roadblock in Congress. This development highlights the ongoing struggle to establish a predictable legal framework for the rapidly evolving crypto industry in the United States. What is the CLARITY Act and Why Does it Matter for US Crypto Regulation? The CLARITY Act is designed to provide much-needed regulatory certainty for the crypto space. At its core, the bill aims to clarify which digital assets fall under the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and which belong to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This distinction is critical for businesses operating in the crypto market, as it determines the rules they must follow regarding registration, trading, custody, and more. For years, crypto companies have operated in a gray area, facing enforcement actions and uncertainty due to overlapping or unclear regulatory boundaries. Passing a comprehensive Crypto Bill like the CLARITY Act is seen by many industry participants as essential for fostering innovation, protecting consumers, and preventing businesses from leaving the U.S. market. Why Has the CLARITY Act Reached a Political Deadlock? According to a report by crypto journalist Laura Shin on X (formerly Twitter), the progress of the CLARITY Act has stalled due to disagreements between Democratic and Republican negotiators. The central point of contention revolves around a specific provision related to conflict of interest prevention. Here’s a breakdown of the issue: The Provision: The disputed language aims to prevent conflicts of interest for high-ranking officials and their families, specifically targeting the President, Vice President, members of Congress, and their immediate family members, concerning their involvement with or holdings in the crypto industry. The Sticking Point: Some Republicans are reportedly opposing the inclusion of this specific language. Their concern is that such a provision could be weaponized and used as a political tool to unfairly target or attack certain individuals based on their financial interests or associations. The Result: This fundamental disagreement has led to a Political Deadlock , halting the bill’s movement through Congress despite apparent consensus on other aspects of the Crypto Market Structure framework the bill proposes. This situation underscores the complex political dynamics at play when regulating a novel and often controversial industry like cryptocurrency. While both sides may agree on the need for regulation, the specifics, especially those touching upon political ethics and potential for partisan conflict, can quickly derail progress. The Stakes: What Does This Political Deadlock Mean for the Crypto Market Structure? The inability of Congress to pass a comprehensive Crypto Bill like the CLARITY Act has significant implications for the entire Crypto Market Structure in the United States. Consider these points: Impact Area Consequence of Deadlock Regulatory Certainty Continued ambiguity for crypto businesses, making compliance difficult and costly. Innovation Potential stifling of growth as companies hesitate to build or expand in the U.S. without clear rules. Investor Protection Lack of a clear framework could leave investors vulnerable to scams and fraud without adequate safeguards. Market Competitiveness The U.S. risks falling behind other jurisdictions that are developing clearer crypto regulatory frameworks. Institutional Adoption Large financial institutions may remain hesitant to fully engage with crypto assets due to regulatory uncertainty. This Political Deadlock doesn’t just affect large corporations; it impacts developers building new applications, entrepreneurs starting crypto businesses, and everyday Americans interested in investing in digital assets. The lack of a clear US Crypto Regulation strategy creates an environment of unpredictability that hinders healthy market development. Conflict of Interest: A Common Hurdle in Policy Making The dispute over conflict of interest language isn’t unique to the CLARITY Act or crypto legislation. Provisions designed to prevent officials from personally benefiting from policies they enact are common in many areas of law. However, applying them to a new and rapidly changing asset class like crypto presents unique challenges. Arguments for including such language typically center on maintaining public trust and ensuring that laws are made in the public’s best interest, not for personal gain. Arguments against might focus on the potential for overreach, difficulty in defining what constitutes a conflict in a complex market, or the risk of politically motivated accusations. In the context of the Crypto Bill , the debate likely involves questions about how broadly to define ‘family members,’ what level of crypto holdings or involvement constitutes a conflict, and the enforcement mechanisms for such rules. These are complex ethical and legal questions that can easily lead to a Political Deadlock when partisan lines are drawn. What Happens Next for the CLARITY Act and US Crypto Regulation? With the bill currently stalled, the path forward is uncertain. Potential scenarios include: Negotiation and Compromise: Lawmakers could continue negotiations to find a compromise on the conflict of interest language that satisfies both sides. This might involve refining the scope of the provision or agreeing on specific disclosure requirements instead of outright restrictions. Bill Revision: The bill might need to be revised, potentially removing the contentious provision altogether, though this could face opposition from those who believe the conflict of interest issue is critical. Continued Deadlock: The disagreement could persist, leading to the bill failing to pass in its current form during the current legislative session. This would mean further delays in establishing clear US Crypto Regulation . Alternative Approaches: Congress might pivot to passing smaller, more targeted pieces of legislation, or regulators (like the SEC and CFTC) might continue to rely on enforcement actions and existing laws to govern the space, which is the status quo many in the industry find problematic. The outcome will heavily depend on the willingness of both parties to find common ground. The crypto industry and investors are watching closely, hoping for a resolution that brings much-needed clarity to the Crypto Market Structure . Key Takeaways from the CLARITY Act Deadlock The current Political Deadlock over the CLARITY Act offers several important insights: Establishing comprehensive US Crypto Regulation is a complex, multi-faceted challenge involving not just technical market structure issues but also political and ethical considerations. Disagreements over specific provisions, even seemingly minor ones related to ethics or conflicts of interest, can significantly impede the progress of major legislation like a foundational Crypto Bill . The delay in passing clear laws creates ongoing uncertainty for businesses and investors within the Crypto Market Structure in the U.S. The path to regulation requires bipartisan cooperation, which remains difficult in the current political climate, especially when sensitive issues like political ethics are on the table. Summary: The CLARITY Act’s Uncertain Future The reported Political Deadlock over the CLARITY Act is a disappointing setback for those hoping for swift and clear US Crypto Regulation . The dispute over conflict of interest language highlights the deep divisions and complexities involved in legislating the crypto space. Until lawmakers can bridge this gap, the uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Crypto Market Structure will likely persist, impacting innovation, investment, and the overall growth of the digital asset industry in the country. The fate of this crucial Crypto Bill remains in the hands of negotiators striving to find a path forward amidst significant political disagreement.

Constructing a Parallel Dollar Network: Reframing Payment Architecture While the U.S. dollar has long dominated cross-border payments, the existing system suffers from structural inefficiencies: high transaction costs, slow settlement times, strict regulatory oversight, and widespread financial exclusion. Against this backdrop, stablecoins offer a permissionless, highly liquid, near-instant payment alternative underpinned by blockchain technology and pegged to the dollar. Key advantages include: Instant settlement and real-time clearance enabled by blockchain’s unified transaction structure; Borderless circulation that only requires wallet access and internet connectivity; Integration with multi-chain ecosystems and payment APIs , with tokens like USDT and USDC now deployed across Ethereum, Tron, and Solana; Functioning simultaneously as settlement assets and stores of value , particularly useful in high-inflation economies where they increasingly substitute for local fiat. In effect, stablecoins are forming a more efficient, inclusive, and censorship-resistant on-chain dollar network. Use cases are rapidly expanding—from individual remittances in Latin America, where residents rely on USDT amid currency devaluation, to SME trade settlements in FX-restricted countries. These networks dramatically enhance the efficiency of cross-border payments, digital commerce, and Web3 transactions, while also offering dollar-based financial access to the world’s 1.3 billion unbanked. More Than Payment Tools: Stablecoins’ Role as “On-Chain Shadow Banks” Despite their technical and economic advantages, stablecoins face regulatory, liquidity, and privacy challenges. Their disintermediating nature also raises strategic concerns among central banks and legacy payment networks. Meanwhile, stablecoins are increasingly performing the role of “shadow banks”—effectively acting as on-chain money market funds by transforming fiat deposits into short-term Treasuries while minting on-chain tokens. This architecture enables stablecoins to scale U.S. dollar liquidity across decentralized ecosystems, but it also challenges the traditional monopoly central banks hold over credit creation and monetary issuance. The lack of globally harmonized regulation raises risks related to transparency, systemic liquidity, and user trust. Regulatory Convergence Driving Institutionalization of Stablecoins The growing role of stablecoins in cross-border payments has prompted heightened regulatory attention worldwide. While mature markets such as the U.S. and EU are developing frameworks emphasizing compliance, capital adequacy, and reserve transparency, Asian jurisdictions are exploring hybrid approaches that balance innovation with oversight. HTX Ventures emphasizes that the regulatory certainty and technological neutrality of stablecoins will be decisive in determining whether they can serve as the “dollar infrastructure of the digital age.” Clear policy coordination and cross-border regulatory harmonization will be essential to unlocking their full potential in global finance. HTX Expands Stablecoin Ecosystem, Accelerates Global Payment Strategy As an exchange advocate for stablecoin adoption, HTX is actively expanding its stablecoin offering to fortify its position within the global crypto ecosystem. Since May, HTX has listed six new stablecoins: USD1, EURR, USDR, EURQ, USDQ, and AETHUSDT . Among them, USD1 , issued by World Liberty Financial—an initiative linked to the Trump family—has garnered particular attention amid the evolving U.S. regulatory landscape. HTX was the first platform globally to list USD1 and has expanded its support for BTC/USD1 and ETH/USD1 trading pairs to further enrich its ecosystem. These new listings enhance users’ flexibility in managing assets across multiple chains and currencies, while unlocking new use cases in high-frequency trading, on-chain hedging, and programmable payments. The initiative reflects HTX’s strategic vision to support a robust, multi-rail global stablecoin infrastructure.

Have you been keeping an eye on the Bitcoin network lately? There’s some big news making waves: the Bitcoin Hashrate has just reached an all-time high! This isn’t just a technical blip; it’s a significant development with real implications for the entire ecosystem, especially for those involved in Bitcoin Mining . Understanding the Surge: What is Bitcoin Hashrate? Before we dive into the impact, let’s quickly touch on what the Bitcoin Hashrate actually is. Think of it as the total computational power being used to process transactions and secure the Bitcoin network. It’s measured in hashes per second (H/s), often in massive units like Exahashes per second (EH/s). A higher hashrate means more computing power is competing to solve the complex mathematical problems required to add a new block to the blockchain. This competition directly relates to the Mining Difficulty . The Mining Difficulty is an adjustment made by the Bitcoin network roughly every two weeks (specifically, every 2016 blocks). Its purpose is to keep the average time it takes to find a new block close to 10 minutes. When the hashrate increases, blocks are found faster than 10 minutes, so the difficulty goes up. When the hashrate decreases, blocks are found slower, and the difficulty goes down. So, when the Bitcoin Hashrate hits an all-time high, it inevitably pushes the Mining Difficulty to new records as well. According to recent reports, the network’s 14-day average hashrate has soared to an incredible 913.5 EH/s! This surge is a testament to the continued growth and investment in the Crypto Mining industry. The Double-Edged Sword: High Hashrate and Miner Profitability While a high hashrate is fantastic for the security and robustness of the Bitcoin network – making it exponentially harder for anyone to attempt a 51% attack – it presents significant challenges for individual miners and mining operations. Why? Because the pie (the block reward plus transaction fees) is being split among an ever-increasing number of powerful participants. This intense competition, coupled with the soaring Mining Difficulty , directly impacts Miner Profitability . Miners have to expend more energy and computational power to earn the same amount of Bitcoin. The cost to mine each Bitcoin unit goes up significantly. Reports from sources like The Miner Mag indicate that the expected unit cost of mining 1 BTC is now projected to exceed $70,000! That’s a jump of over $6,000 compared to the first quarter of the year. Let’s break down some of the factors contributing to this pressure on Miner Profitability : Increased Competition: More miners means each miner gets a smaller share of the total block rewards over time, assuming their hashrate remains constant. Higher Difficulty: As difficulty rises, older or less efficient mining hardware becomes obsolete faster, requiring constant investment in newer, more powerful (and expensive) ASICs. Rising Energy Costs: Electricity is a miner’s biggest expense. While some miners secure favorable energy deals, global energy prices can fluctuate, adding another layer of cost pressure. Decreasing Revenue Streams: The primary revenue for miners comes from the block subsidy (currently 3.125 BTC per block after the recent halving) and transaction fees. Recently, fee revenue has dropped significantly, representing less than 1% of the total block reward. This means miners are relying almost entirely on the block subsidy, which just got cut in half. Falling Hash Price: The ‘hash price’ is a metric that estimates the expected value of 1 PH/s (Petahash per second) of computing power per day. This metric fell significantly, hitting around $52 per PH/s before a slight rebound, further highlighting the reduced earnings potential for miners. Why the Unprecedented Surge in Bitcoin Hashrate? You might wonder, if profitability is getting squeezed, why is the hashrate still going up? Several factors are likely at play: Deployment of Newer, More Efficient Hardware: Mining hardware manufacturers are constantly innovating. Newer generations of ASIC miners are significantly more powerful and energy-efficient than older models. Mining operations that invested in these machines are deploying them, adding substantial hashrate to the network. Long-Term Outlook: Many large mining operations take a long-term view. They might accept lower profitability in the short term, betting on future increases in Bitcoin’s price to make their operations profitable over time. Infrastructure Investment: Significant capital has been invested in building large-scale mining facilities in regions with access to relatively cheap or renewable energy. These facilities continue to come online, adding capacity. Geopolitical Factors: As mining decentralizes globally, new regions emerge as mining hubs, contributing to the overall network hashrate. What Does This Mean for the Bitcoin Network? While challenging for miners, an all-time high Bitcoin Hashrate is fundamentally a positive sign for the network itself. It indicates immense security and resilience. The sheer amount of computing power securing Bitcoin makes it the most secure blockchain network in the world. It demonstrates continued confidence and investment in the Bitcoin ecosystem despite price volatility and profitability challenges for miners. Challenges and the Road Ahead for Crypto Mining The current environment presents a clear challenge for Crypto Mining businesses. Those with higher operating costs, less efficient hardware, or unfavorable energy contracts will struggle the most. We could potentially see some less efficient miners shutting down operations if Bitcoin’s price doesn’t increase significantly or if energy costs rise further. This consolidation is a natural part of the mining cycle. However, it also presents opportunities for well-capitalized and efficient mining operations. They can acquire assets from struggling competitors, upgrade their fleets with the latest technology, and position themselves for higher profitability when market conditions improve. Conclusion: Navigating the High Hashrate Landscape The record-breaking Bitcoin Hashrate and corresponding high Mining Difficulty are complex indicators. They signal a robust and secure network but simultaneously highlight significant profitability pressures for miners. As the cost to mine 1 BTC climbs and revenue streams tighten, the efficiency and strategic positioning of mining operations become more critical than ever. The industry is navigating a challenging phase, where only the most adaptable and well-resourced players are likely to thrive in the short term, all while reinforcing the incredible security of the world’s premier cryptocurrency.

According to the latest report from CoinShares, a total of $584 million exited crypto-focused investment vehicles, pushing the two-week cumulative outflows to $1.2 billion. This movement coincides with investor uncertainty surrounding the likelihood of interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve this year, which James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, believes is contributing to waning sentiment in the market. Butterfill attributed the investor pullback to growing skepticism about macroeconomic policy shifts, particularly rate reductions. At the same time, exchange-traded product (ETP) activity hit a new low, with global ETP volumes falling to just $6.9 billion, marking the weakest weekly trading volume since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States earlier this year.

Despite the significant movement of funds out of long Bitcoin positions, short Bitcoin products also recorded outflows totaling $1.2 million. This suggests that investors are not currently betting heavily on downside exposure, opting instead to stay on the sidelines amid uncertain market conditions. Ethereum similarly saw negative flow activity, with $58 million in outflows, continuing the trend of cautious investor behavior across major assets. The report also highlighted geographical breakdowns, noting that the United States led all regions with $475 million in outflows, followed by Canada at $109 million. Germany and Hong Kong recorded smaller outflows at $24 million and $19 million, respectively. In contrast, Switzerland and Brazil stood out as exceptions to the broader trend, bringing in net inflows of $39 million and $48.5 million, respectively. This divergence suggests that local factors or institutional strategies in those regions may be driving different investment behaviors. Altcoins Draw Selective Support While sentiment remained bearish for large-cap assets, some altcoins managed to attract capital inflows. Solana, Litecoin, and Polygon saw modest but notable gains of $2.7 million, $1.3 million, and $1 million, respectively. These inflows may reflect opportunistic positioning by investors seeking exposure to assets that have underperformed recently. Additionally, multi-asset investment products, which spread exposure across various cryptocurrencies, recorded $98 million in inflows. This signals that some investors are using recent price weaknesses to gain diversified access to the market rather than concentrating bets on single tokens. Related Reading: Still Sleeping On XRP?

XRP is finally showing signs of a comeback after breaking key resistance levels. It is also holding above key moving averages. Can XRP Price Go Parabolic? Analyst Egrag Crypto has pushed back against claims that XRP’s cycle top was $3.40. He believes the real peak is much higher and XRP could still surge to between $10 and $27. Any big correction would likely come after XRP hits higher levels. XRP looks set for a solid recovery , but the breakout is not confirmed yet. If it breaks above both the descending trendline and key horizontal resistance, it could rally toward the $3.40 all-time high. XRP has been moving between $2 and $2.65 for several days, showing clear buying near $2 and selling pressure around $2.65. If the buyers can keep XRP above the moving averages, a move toward $2.65 is likely.

VanEck, the first to propose a Solana ETF earlier this year, also submitted an updated filing. In total, eight firms have now entered the race, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. While interest in Solana ETFs has surged, regulatory approval remains uncertain. The SEC recently requested issuers to clarify how they will handle in-kind redemptions , a key operational component for crypto ETFs. The agency is reportedly open to allowing staking features in these products but has yet to signal any timeline for a decision. Analyst Pegs Solana ETF Odds at 70%, With Approval Expected Later This Year Bloomberg analysts have offered cautious projections. In February, ETF analyst Balchunas estimated a 70% chance of approval , though delays are expected. James Seyffart, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, suggested any early approvals would likely not arrive before late June or early July, with a more probable window falling in early Q4 of 2025. Solana, often described as a faster and cheaper alternative to Ethereum, has gained significant traction among both developers and institutional investors. However, its volatility, regulatory uncertainty and security challenges continue to weigh on its path to mainstream adoption. CoinShares’ bid, while not guaranteed to succeed, mirrors the growing appetite for diversified crypto investment products in regulated markets. As the SEC reviews this latest round of filings, issuers and investors alike are watching closely for signals on how the regulator plans to handle the next generation of digital asset ETFs.

The initiative will explore how AI can enhance national security and streamline administrative tasks across military and civilian government operations. Disclosed by the Pentagon on Monday, the one-year contract marks a significant step in OpenAI’s expanding efforts to partner with the federal government . The project is the first under a newly formed division called OpenAI for Government, which consolidates the company’s public sector projects, including a secure version of ChatGPT—ChatGPT Gov—tailored for government employees. In a blog post announcing the contract, OpenAI said the collaboration will focus on identifying ways AI can support tasks such as improving access to healthcare for military personnel and bolstering cybersecurity measures. OpenAI deepens government integration In its statement, The San Francisco-based company said that OpenAI for Government will be the home for their work with federal agencies . The company noted that this pilot with the Defense Department was a foundational part of that mission. The new office will also oversee continuing partnerships with federal agencies such as NASA, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Air Force Research Laboratory, and the Treasury Department. The contract adds to a series of government-facing projects the tech firm is working on. The move follows its 2024 decision to build AI-powered anti-drone systems with defense contractor Anduril Industries. OpenAI positions itself as a trusted AI ally in Washington’s security and ethics push OpenAI emphasized that it remains committed to developing AI technologies that “uphold democratic values.” To that end, the company has recently appointed a former senior Pentagon official to lead its national security policy efforts and added the former head of the National Security Agency (NSA) to its board of directors. The $200 million deal also comes at a time of wider discussion in Washington over generative AI and its application in government. The technology holds out the promise of far greater efficiency and security but has led to questions over transparency, oversight, and civil liberties. The latest development further cements OpenAI’s position as central to the federal government’s AI strategy. As US agencies race to update their systems and keep a technological advantage over everywhere from China to Russia, partnerships with private sector innovators such as OpenAI are ever-critical. For the tech firm, the Pentagon pilot represents both a financial milestone and a strategic leap into sensitive, high-stakes applications of its technology. “We see this as an opportunity to demonstrate the safe, responsible deployment of AI in the service of national interest,” the company said. The pilot program is set to begin immediately, with results from the one-year engagement expected to inform future deployments of AI across defense and civilian agencies. Top tech executives sworn into army reserve as military deepens AI ties Just last week, about four members of the new nerd brigade, officially called Detachment 201, joined the Army Reserve at the rank of lieutenant colonel. This has come as the US military has lately been pushing for closer cooperation with Silicon Valley. With artificial intelligence becoming a key national security priority, the armed forces increasingly turn to tech leaders for their expertise. On Friday, the service swore in Meta’s chief technology officer (CTO), Andrew Bosworth; OpenAI’s chief product officer, Kevin Weil; Palantir’s CTO, Shyam Sankar; and Bob McGrew, an advisor at Thinking Machines Lab who was previously OpenAI’s chief research officer. The press release said these senior tech executives will serve part-time in the Army Reserve as senior advisors, working on targeted projects to help guide rapid and scalable tech solutions to complex problems.

While seemingly distant from digital assets, high-level international discussions like those at the upcoming G7 summit can have significant ripple effects. Reports suggest a potentially pivotal development is on the horizon: a Trump Starmer meeting aimed at finalizing a key agreement. According to recent intelligence, U.S. President Donald Trump and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer are anticipated to use the stage of the G7 summit in Canada to cement a significant Tariff reduction agreement. This move, if finalized, could signal a renewed focus on strengthening trade ties between the two nations and potentially ease some economic pressures. Understanding the Proposed US UK Trade Deal The concept of a comprehensive US UK trade deal has been a topic of discussion since the UK’s departure from the European Union. While various sector-specific agreements and dialogues have occurred, a broad, tariff-cutting deal has remained a significant goal for both sides, albeit one facing numerous complexities and political considerations. Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods. They are often used to protect domestic industries from foreign competition or as a negotiating tool in international relations. Reducing or eliminating tariffs between two countries can lead to: Lower costs for businesses importing goods. Potentially lower prices for consumers on imported products. Increased trade volume as goods become cheaper. Greater economic efficiency by allowing countries to specialize in producing goods where they have a comparative advantage. A finalized agreement between the US and the UK could cover a wide range of goods and services, impacting various sectors from agriculture to manufacturing and technology. The specific details of which tariffs would be cut and by how much are crucial and would determine the true economic impact of the deal. Why Tariff Reduction Matters for the Global Economy The reduction of tariffs, especially between major economies like the United States and the United Kingdom, is not just a bilateral issue; it has broader implications for the global economy . Protectionist measures like high tariffs can slow down international trade, disrupt supply chains, and contribute to inflationary pressures. Conversely, moves towards liberalization and Tariff reduction can: Stimulate economic growth by fostering trade and investment. Enhance competition, potentially leading to innovation and better quality goods. Improve diplomatic relations and cooperation between trading partners. Provide a positive signal to other nations about the potential for trade liberalization. However, tariff reductions also present challenges. Domestic industries that previously benefited from protection might face increased competition, potentially leading to job losses or the need for significant restructuring. Negotiating which tariffs to cut requires careful balancing of national interests and potential economic disruptions. The G7 Summit Stage: Why Here, Why Now? The G7 summit brings together the leaders of the world’s seven largest so-called advanced economies: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The European Union also attends. It serves as a crucial forum for discussing pressing global issues, including economic policy, security, and climate change. Holding the finalization of a significant trade deal at the G7 offers several advantages: High Profile: It provides a global stage to announce a major diplomatic and economic achievement. Political Momentum: Summits often create deadlines and political pressure to finalize agreements that might otherwise languish. Peer Influence: Discussions with other G7 leaders might provide context or even indirect support for the bilateral agreement. Symbolism: Announcing a deal between two key G7 members reinforces the group’s role in shaping global economic norms. For both President Trump and Prime Minister Starmer, securing a tangible agreement like a tariff-cutting deal could be seen as a significant political win, demonstrating progress on international trade objectives. The timing, ahead of potential elections or during periods of economic uncertainty, can also play a role in prioritizing such announcements. Potential Crypto Market Impact: How Trade Deals Influence Digital Assets Now, how does a Trump Starmer meeting about tariffs connect to the volatile world of cryptocurrency? The link is primarily indirect, flowing through the broader financial markets and global economic sentiment. While there’s no direct mechanism linking a US-UK tariff rate to the price of Bitcoin or Ethereum, major geopolitical and economic events influence investor behavior across all asset classes. Here’s how a development like a significant US UK trade deal could potentially influence the Crypto market impact : Investor Confidence and Risk Appetite: Positive economic news, such as a successful trade agreement between major nations, can boost overall investor confidence. When investors feel more optimistic about the global economy, they may become more willing to invest in riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, trade disputes and economic uncertainty often lead investors to seek safer havens. Macroeconomic Stability: Predictable and stable trade relations between major economies contribute to overall macroeconomic stability. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are sometimes viewed as hedges against instability or inflation. However, a stable economic environment can also be conducive to broader market rallies that include digital assets. Currency Strength: Tariff changes can impact the relative strength of currencies like the US Dollar (USD) and the British Pound (GBP). Since many crypto trading pairs involve fiat currencies (e.g., BTC/USD), shifts in currency values can indirectly affect crypto prices and trading dynamics. Inflation Expectations: Tariffs can act as an inflationary force by increasing the cost of imported goods. A reduction in tariffs could potentially alleviate some inflationary pressure. Central banks monitor inflation closely, and their monetary policy decisions (like interest rates) have a significant impact on financial markets, including crypto. News that influences the inflation outlook can therefore indirectly affect the crypto market. Global Market Sentiment: High-profile events at the G7 summit and major bilateral agreements generate headlines and contribute to the prevailing global market sentiment. A positive outcome could contribute to a risk-on environment, while a failure could add to uncertainty. Crypto markets, known for their sensitivity to sentiment, can react to these broader shifts. It is crucial for crypto investors to understand that the impact of a trade deal is typically not a direct, isolated price driver. Instead, it’s one piece of a much larger puzzle, influencing the global economic backdrop against which digital assets trade. Monitoring such developments provides valuable context for understanding broader market movements. What Challenges Remain and What Happens Next? While reports suggest finalization is expected, the path to a completed US UK trade deal is not without potential hurdles. Negotiating the specifics of tariff cuts across numerous sectors can be complex, with lobbying from various industries on both sides. Domestic political considerations in both the US and the UK could also play a role. Even if an agreement is reached at the G7 summit , the process typically involves legal drafting and ratification procedures in both countries, which can take time and face political debate. The true impact will only be felt once the agreed-upon tariff reductions are implemented. For those monitoring the markets, including the crypto space, the key takeaway is to watch not just the announcement itself, but also the market’s reaction and the subsequent economic data that emerges as a result of the deal’s implementation. The focus should remain on how such agreements contribute to or detract from global economic stability and investor confidence. In Conclusion: A Glimpse of Economic Optimism? The potential finalization of a significant Tariff reduction deal between the US and the UK by President Trump and Prime Minister Starmer at the upcoming G7 summit is a notable development in international trade relations. While the direct connection to cryptocurrency prices is tenuous, the agreement’s potential to foster stronger economic ties and contribute to global economic stability is relevant for all market participants. As the leaders meet, the world will be watching for concrete steps towards easing trade barriers. Such positive movements in the traditional economic sphere, while not guaranteeing specific outcomes for digital assets, can contribute to an environment where risk appetite is higher and overall market sentiment is more positive – factors that historically have been supportive of the broader financial landscape, including the dynamic Crypto market impact .

US President Donald Trump has announced a last-ditch effort to prevent an all-out war between Israel and Iran, which could impact global markets, including crypto. According to reports, Trump is pushing for an emergency meeting with Iranian officials this week. He believes the decision to use powerful “bunker buster” bombs on Iran’s nuclear sites would be a turning point. Trump also cut his trip to the G7 Summit short to head back to Washington and focus on the crisis. In a bold statement, he even called for “everyone” to evacuate Tehran, Iran’s capital, though it’s unclear whether he meant US citizens or the city’s 14 million residents. The crypto market, which saw a brief rally a few hours ago, has already started reacting. XRP led the jump with a 7% gain, while Bitcoin soared to $108,950 before pulling back. Bitcoin is now hovering slightly above the $107,000 mark. With the latest developments, it’s uncertain which way the market will move next. Experts are closely watching the news, as any escalation could trigger another major sell-off. Adding to the pressure, liquidations have begun across the market. In the past 24 hours alone, total liquidations reached a staggering $394.16 million, wiping out leveraged positions.

Artprice’s comprehensive database coverage demonstrates its position as the world leader in art market information. See the Perplexity Labs illustration: https://www.perplexity.ai/search/hello-perplexity-can-you-prepa-ecPX.gL.RFiE9Xsl571xdg Thierry Ehrmann: The Visionary Founder Thierry Marie Nicolas Pierre Joseph Ehrmann, born March 13, 1962, in Avignon, embodies a unique combination of entrepreneurial genius and artistic vision that has shaped Artprice’s distinctive identity. According to his certified biography in Who’s Who in France, Ehrmann has been recognized as a visual artist since 1980, alongside his role as company president and sculptor-artist. His educational background encompasses theological studies at the Faculty of Theology of Lyon and classical education at prestigious institutions including Lycées Fénelon, des Maristes, and Pascal. See thierry Erhmann’s biography here: https://www.perplexity.ai/search/hello-perplexity-can-you-prepa-ecPX.gL.RFiE9Xsl571xdg Ehrmann’s entrepreneurial journey began in 1983 with the creation of an audiphone device, followed by the development of an electronic freight exchange in 1985. His founding of Groupe Serveur in 1987 established the technological foundation that would later support Artprice’s revolutionary approach to art market data management. The creation of the Judicial Server in 1993 demonstrated his early understanding of digital database applications, preparing him for the art market revolution that would follow. His artistic identity is deeply intertwined with his business vision, as evidenced by his creation of La Demeure du Chaos in 1999, a contemporary art museum that serves simultaneously as Artprice’s global headquarters. This dual identity as both artist and entrepreneur has enabled Ehrmann to understand the art world from multiple perspectives, contributing to Artprice’s unique positioning in the market. Artprice’s Strategic Advantages and Global Leadership See the timeline of Artprice’s key milestones from its founding to becoming a leader in AI-driven art market analysis: https://www.perplexity.ai/search/hello-perplexity-can-you-prepa-ecPX.gL.RFiE9Xsl571xdg Artprice’s strategic dominance in the art market stems from several key competitive advantages that have been developed over 28 years of continuous innovation. The company maintains the world’s largest art market database, encompassing 181 million images and historical data spanning from 1700 to the present day. This comprehensive coverage includes partnerships with 7,200 auction houses globally, creating an unmatched network for real-time market intelligence. The company’s proprietary approach to data collection and analysis represents a fundamental strategic advantage over competitors. Unlike other art market platforms that rely on limited datasets or external sources, Artprice has systematically acquired legendary editorial funds and databases across Europe, the United States, and Asia, representing assets worth over €30 million. These acquisitions include the prestigious Enrique Mayer Guide (1962-1987), the Dictionary of Art Sales 1700-1900 by Doctor H. Mireur, Sound View Press with nearly 50 databases in the USA, and Franck Van Wilder editions. Artprice’s technological infrastructure, built upon the foundation of Groupe Serveur’s expertise in judicial and scientific databases, provides unparalleled processing capabilities. The company processes 35MB of data per second per employee, outperforming European averages by over 20 times. This technological superiority enables real-time analysis of complex art market trends and provides users with instantaneous access to comprehensive market intelligence. The company’s global reach extends to 119 countries with support for 11 languages, positioning it as the definitive international authority on art market information. Its press agency distributes content to 6,300 newspapers worldwide, while annual reports reach 122 countries, establishing Artprice as the primary source for art market analysis globally. Unique Documentary Background and World’s Largest Art Archive Artprice’s documentary collection represents one of the most significant and unique archives in the art world, comprising hundreds of thousands of manuscripts and sales catalogs spanning from 1700 to the present day. This extraordinary collection has been methodically assembled through strategic acquisitions of legendary art publishing houses and editorial funds worldwide. The scope and depth of this documentary heritage make it unparalleled in the global art market, providing researchers and professionals with access to historical documentation that exists nowhere else. The collection includes original manuscripts, annotated auction catalogs, and historical documents that have been carefully preserved and digitized by Artprice’s team of art historians. Each document in the collection has been reviewed and annotated by specialists, creating a scholarly resource that combines historical accuracy with contemporary accessibility. The archive serves not only as a commercial database but as a vital repository for art historical research, supporting academic institutions and museums worldwide. The uniqueness of Artprice’s documentary background lies in its comprehensive coverage of auction results and market transactions across multiple centuries. While other databases focus on contemporary markets or specific periods, Artprice’s collection provides an unbroken chain of market documentation that allows for unprecedented historical analysis and trend identification. This temporal depth enables the company to identify long-term patterns and provide insights that would be impossible with more limited datasets. The physical archive is housed at La Demeure du Chaos, where it forms part of the museum’s extensive collections. This integration of commercial database management with artistic and cultural preservation reflects Ehrmann’s vision of art market transparency as both a business imperative and a cultural responsibility. The collection continues to grow through ongoing acquisitions and partnerships with auction houses worldwide, ensuring that future generations will have access to comprehensive art market documentation. Artificial Intelligence Innovation: Intuitive Artmarket® and Blind Spot AI® Artprice’s technological leadership reached a new pinnacle with the official launch of its Intuitive Artmarket® AI on January 9, 2025, marking the company’s emergence as the global leader in AI-driven art market intelligence. This revolutionary artificial intelligence system represents the culmination of nearly two decades of algorithmic learning and data accumulation, processing hundreds of millions of anonymized proprietary logs and tens of millions of artworks to identify previously hidden patterns and connections. The cornerstone of Artprice’s AI innovation is its proprietary Blind Spot AI® technology, inspired by Marcel Duchamp’s concept of “infrathin” and Henri Poincaré’s work on mathematical models. This unique approach avoids traditional fuzzy logic systems, instead using degrees of truth to explore connections between structured data elements that conventional Boolean logic cannot detect. The methodology seeks to capture subtle relationships and patterns that exist in the liminal spaces between clearly defined data points, revealing insights that escape traditional analysis methods. The Intuitive Artmarket® AI encompasses several specialized tools designed for different aspects of art market analysis. The AIDB Search Artist® function enables image recognition for artwork identification, allowing users to identify pieces through visual analysis similar to Google Lens technology. The AIDB Signatures & Monograms® database provides expertise in recognizing and validating artist signatures and monograms from the 4th century to the present day, trained using three of the world’s largest databases in this field. Perhaps most significantly, the AI system can anticipate future value fluctuations for artworks, including totally unique pieces, by analyzing traceability and historical auction results over time. This predictive capability extends beyond simple price estimation to identify complex transversal artistic trends that largely escape academic, institutional, and commercial analysis. The system’s ability to calculate reliable price information while exploring artwork provenance represents a breakthrough in art market valuation methodology. The AI’s proprietary nature provides Artprice with significant competitive advantages, as it draws exclusively from the company’s vast collection of intellectual property-protected content. This approach eliminates dependencies on external data sources and potential legal complications while ensuring the system’s responses remain within Artprice’s ethical and quality standards. The gradual integration of AI-enhanced data into Artprice’s existing databases has already demonstrated significant impact, with premium subscriptions showing substantial growth as users recognize the enhanced value of AI-enriched content.

On March 20, 2025, French Minister of Culture Rachida Dati granted official recognition to this extraordinary complex as a “total work of art,” placing it alongside legendary installations such as Jean Tinguely & Niki De Saint Phalle’s Cyclop and the Palais Idéal of Facteur Cheval. The museum complex spans 7,555 square meters and features a unique museum trail set in the heart of nature, conceived as a total work of art that ensures accessibility and inclusion for all audiences. Since its creation in 1999 by Thierry Ehrmann as “a mirror of our world,” the site has evolved into a comprehensive artistic statement comprising nearly 7,200 distinct works of art. The collection includes 4,500 laser-sculpted steel artworks, some weighing several hundred tons, alongside 1,800 portraits representing geopolitical, philosophical, and scientific themes. The recognition by the Minister of Culture represents a significant milestone for both Artprice and the contemporary art world, validating the complex’s artistic and cultural importance on a national level. This official designation provides Artprice with a prestigious global headquarters that reflects the company’s innovative approach to business and culture. The museum operates as an ERP (Établissement Recevant du Public) open-air museum, classified by the Prefecture and open to the public free of charge. Since its opening in 2006, the Contemporary Art Museum has received 2.5 million visitors free of charge, with 25% coming from outside France. The international impact of La Demeure du Chaos is evidenced by nearly 3,600 written and audiovisual press reports from 72 countries over 25 years. The complex maintains a global following of more than 10.9 million subscribers on its social media accounts and has garnered 720,000 signatories to a petition for its preservation and recognition by France’s public authorities. The integration of Artprice’s documentary archives within this artistic environment creates a unique synthesis of commercial database management and cultural preservation. This physical manifestation of Ehrmann’s vision demonstrates how business innovation and artistic expression can coexist and mutually reinforce each other, providing Artprice with a headquarters that embodies its mission of art market transparency and accessibility. Reputation and Recognition in the Art World Artprice’s reputation in the international art world has been solidified through nearly three decades of consistent innovation and reliable service to art market professionals. A comprehensive study conducted during the CIHA Lyon 2024 congress, the 36th world congress devoted to research in Art History with participants from more than 70 countries, revealed Artprice’s dominant position in academic and professional circles. When 378 congress attendees were asked “Which databases on the Art Market do you know?”, 325 cited Artprice first, representing 86% recognition and clearly establishing Artprice as the “top-of-mind” art market databank. The company’s reputation extends across multiple sectors of the art world, serving auction houses, experts, insurers, private bankers, galleries, dealers, art professionals, and collectors. Artprice’s twice-awarded “Innovative Company” label from the French Public Investment Bank (BPI) recognizes its technological leadership and strategic importance to the French economy. The company’s annual art market reports, now in their 30th edition, are distributed in 122 countries and 11 languages, serving as authoritative references for art market analysis worldwide. Professional recognition of Artprice’s expertise is demonstrated through its collaboration with major institutions and its role as a primary source for art market intelligence. The company continuously publishes art market trends for major agencies and press titles worldwide, establishing itself as the definitive voice on market developments. Its partnership with the Chinese State group Artron for the past 15 consecutive years has enabled comprehensive global coverage of art auctions and structural analysis of market evolution. The integration of advanced artificial intelligence capabilities has further enhanced Artprice’s reputation as a technological innovator in the art world. The successful launch of Intuitive Artmarket® AI has positioned the company as the global leader in AI-driven art market intelligence, attracting increased attention from both traditional art market participants and technology-focused investors. The company’s ability to maintain accuracy and reliability while incorporating cutting-edge technology has strengthened its position as the trusted authority in art market information. Scientific Innovation and Future Vision Artprice’s commitment to scientific methodology and technological innovation represents a fundamental aspect of its global leadership position. The company’s approach to artificial intelligence development reflects a deep understanding of both technological capabilities and art historical methodology, resulting in tools that enhance rather than replace human expertise. The Blind Spot AI® concept, inspired by Marcel Duchamp’s aesthetic theories and Henri Poincaré’s mathematical work, demonstrates the sophisticated theoretical foundation underlying Artprice’s technological development. The company’s 2025-2029 strategic roadmap, unveiled at the Global AI Action Summit in Paris, positions Artprice at the forefront of France’s ambition to become the world’s third-largest AI hub after the United States and China. This alignment with national AI development priorities reflects the recognition of Artprice’s technological capabilities and its potential contribution to France’s digital economy. The company’s processing capacity of 35MB of data per second per employee demonstrates the practical implementation of this technological vision. Ehrmann’s vision for Artprice extends beyond traditional database management to encompass a comprehensive transformation of how the art world accesses and utilizes market information. The integration of AI technology with the company’s extensive documentary archives creates unprecedented opportunities for art historical research and market analysis. This synthesis of historical documentation and cutting-edge technology reflects Ehrmann’s unique perspective as both entrepreneur and artist, enabling Artprice to serve both commercial and academic constituencies. Conclusion Artprice’s position as the world leader in art market information results from a unique combination of comprehensive data collection, technological innovation, and visionary leadership that has been sustained over nearly three decades. The company’s unparalleled documentary collection, spanning from 1700 to the present day, provides the historical foundation for its AI-driven analysis tools. The recent recognition of La Demeure du Chaos by France’s Minister of Culture validates the integration of artistic vision and commercial excellence that characterizes Thierry Ehrmann’s approach to business.

While cryptocurrency markets have their own unique drivers, the performance of traditional assets, particularly stocks, often provides valuable context about overall investor sentiment and macroeconomic conditions. And today? The sentiment leaned positive. What Happened in the US Stock Market Today? The latest stock market performance saw all three major US indexes finish the day in positive territory, reflecting a generally optimistic mood among investors. This broad-based gain signals a potential ‘risk-on’ environment, where investors feel more comfortable allocating capital to assets perceived as having higher growth potential. Here’s a quick look at the numbers: S&P 500: Closed up +0.9% Nasdaq: Closed up +1.5% Dow Jones Industrial Average: Closed up +0.77% These figures represent a solid day of gains across the board, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq leading the charge. Why Does Stock Market Performance Matter for Crypto Investors? It might seem counterintuitive to focus on the stock market on a crypto news site, but the reality is that global financial markets are increasingly interconnected. Here’s why observing the US stock market is relevant to your crypto portfolio: Sentiment Indicator: Positive movement in stocks often reflects broader investor confidence in the economy. This ‘risk-on’ sentiment can sometimes spill over into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Macro Factors: The same economic news (inflation data, interest rate decisions, jobs reports) that moves stocks also influences crypto. Both asset classes react to changes in liquidity and economic outlook. Institutional Flow: Large institutional investors often have allocations in both traditional markets and digital assets. Their shifts in strategy based on macro conditions can impact both spaces. Correlation, Not Causation: While not always perfectly aligned, there has been a notable crypto market correlation with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 , particularly since the increased institutional adoption of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. Understanding the pulse of the stock market helps provide a fuller picture of the financial environment in which crypto operates. A Closer Look: The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Lead The strong showing from the S&P 500 , which tracks the performance of 500 of the largest U.S. publicly traded companies, indicates broad market strength. Its positive close suggests that gains weren’t confined to just a few sectors but were relatively widespread. The even more significant jump in the Nasdaq , home to many technology and growth stocks, is particularly interesting for crypto enthusiasts. Tech stocks are often seen as more sensitive to interest rate changes and future growth expectations, similar to how many view cryptocurrency valuations. The strong performance here could suggest renewed optimism about growth prospects and a greater appetite for assets positioned for future innovation. While the Dow Jones also saw a healthy gain, the leadership shown by the S&P 500 and Nasdaq often provides a clearer signal about the market’s appetite for growth and risk. Translating Crypto Market Correlation : What Does This Mean for You? It’s crucial to remember that while a crypto market correlation with stocks exists, it’s not a perfect one-to-one relationship. Cryptocurrencies have their own unique catalysts, such as regulatory news, technological developments (like network upgrades), and specific adoption trends. However, a positive day in the US stock market , especially one led by the Nasdaq , can be interpreted as a tailwind. It suggests that the broader financial mood is conducive to risk-taking, which can be supportive of crypto prices. It doesn’t guarantee a pump, but it removes a potential headwind that a negative stock market day might represent. Actionable Insight: Don’t make investment decisions based solely on stock market movements. Use this information as one data point among many when evaluating the overall market environment. Pay attention to major economic announcements that could impact both markets. In Summary Today’s positive stock market performance , with strong closes for the S&P 500 , Nasdaq , and Dow Jones, reflects a positive shift in investor sentiment. While the US stock market and crypto market are distinct, their increasing crypto market correlation means that traditional market health can provide valuable insights for crypto investors. A ‘risk-on’ day in stocks suggests a potentially favorable environment for riskier assets, but always remember the unique factors driving the crypto space.

The second largest crypto by market cap has been trending sideways displaying an increasing selling pressure on higher timeframes, but today ETH holders seem hopeful of further gains. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: Bitcoin Price Primed For Deep Correction Below $90,000 At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $2,600 with a 3.5% gain on the past 24 hours.

Ethereum price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview Ethereum Price On Brink Of Massive Recovery According to Daan Crypto, the current price action for Ethereum shows classical signs of compression. This action is usually recorded when an asset is about to experience a massive spike in volatility, either to the upside or the downside. The analyst pointed out that Ethereum has been trading in a tight range, trapped between two critical levels. If buyers manage to push the price above the first of these levels, sitting at $2,851, then the second crypto by market cap is likely to trend to the upside. ETH price trading on a tight range on the 2 day chart. Source: Daan Crypto via X On the contrary, if sellers regain control over the ETH market, and price dips below its current levels, then the price is more likely to return to the bottom of its current range, sitting at $2,168. Daan Crypto stated the following, warning his followers on taking positions as the Ethereum price consolidates: ETH Price action is compressing right below this big $2.8K level. If we’d see a convincing break above $2.8K and hold there, that would be a good setup for a move to the cycle highs around ~$4K. If we do lose this current range then $2.1K is the big high timeframe level to watch. No reason to get over excited in either direction until this current consolidation/compression resolves. ETH Price Rally to Ignite Massive Alt Season On a separate note, analyst Cantonese Cat showed the Ethereum price dominance chart, used to gauge the percentage of the total crypto market cap represented by ETH. As seen in the chart below, this chart is tightly compressed according to the Bollinger Band indicator. Related Reading: $8 Dogecoin?

ADA is now consolidating and might struggle to stay above the $0.620 support. ADA price started a fresh decline below $0.70 and $0.680. The price is trading below $0.680 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.630 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it dips below the $0.620 support zone. Cardano Price Dips Further In the past few days, Cardano saw a fresh decline below the $0.720, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA even declined below the $0.70 level to enter a bearish zone. The bears even pushed the price below the $0.680 level. A low was formed at $0.6134 and the price recently corrected some losses. There was a move above the $0.620 and $0.6350 levels. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.7311 swing high to the $0.6134 low. However, the bears remained active near $0.6560.

On June 16, 2025, the SEC submitted a new status report to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, requesting that the court continue to hold both parties’ appeals in abeyance. The Commission confirmed it will file a follow-up report by August 15, 2025, pending Judge Analisa Torres’s decision on the parties’ revised joint settlement motion in the district court. The filing comes amid growing anticipation within the XRP community. Attorney James K. Filan shared the update publicly, highlighting that the current pause in appeals hinges on the court’s response to the pending motion for an indicative ruling. This procedural step allows a district court to signal its intention to reconsider or modify a judgment, even when an appeal is already underway. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP In light of the pending motion for an indicative ruling, the parties have requested that the Second Circuit continue to hold the appeals in abeyance, with the @SECGov to file a status report by August 15, 2025. https://t.co/7oQvL5Rx7U — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) June 17, 2025 Background of the Current Situation Ripple and the SEC previously submitted a joint motion in May to resolve key issues relating to institutional XRP sales. That proposal was rejected shortly thereafter by Judge Torres, who stated that the request lacked sufficient justification. In response, the parties submitted a more detailed second motion on June 12, which included additional arguments intended to meet the court’s standards for reconsideration. The filing currently under review is based on that revised motion. Appeals Held as Judge Reviews Revised Proposal The June 16 deadline for filing the status report has loomed over the lawsuit for weeks now, and the SEC’s latest status report references this ongoing district court development, stating that “in light of the developments described below,” it would be appropriate for the appeals court to continue holding the case. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Both the Commission and Ripple maintain that awaiting Judge Torres’s response could avoid unnecessary appellate litigation, streamline proceedings, and potentially result in a full resolution of the case. Awaiting a Key Decision Should Judge Torres indicate she is inclined to grant the revised motion, the appeals court may then formally remand the case to the lower court, allowing for final approval. If the motion is denied, litigation will likely resume in the Second Circuit, as many expected this outcome on June 16 until both parties refiled their joint motion addressing the judge’s concerns. John Deaton, another well-respected attorney, has predicted a 70% chance that the judge will approve the motion. Until then, the SEC’s request to maintain the pause until August 15 ensures that no new appellate steps will occur while the district court weighs its next move.

The proposal, presented by Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson on June 13, involves converting $100 million worth of ADA coins in the Cardano treasury into Bitcoin and stablecoins. However, Yakovenko said the idea was “very stupid,” indicating mismanagement of the treasury and sending the wrong message to the Cardano community. According to Yakovenko, projects only need to hold enough funds in short-term US Treasury bonds to cover their operational expenses for 18 to 36 months. Yakovenko said that turning to different assets such as Bitcoin is unnecessary and wrong, and said, “If users want to buy Bitcoin, they can already buy it themselves. There is no need for the project to hold Bitcoin on behalf of users.” Related News: XRP Experiences a First-Time Event in Its History - Unusual Data Coming In Hoskinson argued that the proposal was made to strengthen Cardano’s decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure and solve some problems in the stablecoin ecosystem. However, some critics believe that the move shows a lack of trust in the ADA coin. Crypto investor Aaron Dishner said that this plan implicitly implies that Cardano admits that Bitcoin is more valuable than ADA. Opinions on the proposal have been mixed in the Cardano community, with some users concerned that the $100 million ADA sale could negatively impact the token’s price. However, Hoskinson dismissed these concerns, stating that the ADA market is deep enough to absorb the transfer without any crashes. As discussions continue within the Cardano community, it is eagerly awaited whether the proposal will be implemented and how the project's governance process will be followed. *This is not investment advice.

However, its slow growth has left many investors seeking opportunities with higher potential for returns. Enter Ruvi AI (RUVI) , an audited blockchain project primed to become the next big $1 breakout. With its focus on real-world utility, structured growth, and impressive return potential, Ruvi AI might just be the smarter investment choice for today’s forward-thinking investors. Why Ruvi AI Could Outperform Dogecoin Dogecoin’s primary appeal lies in its meme-driven popularity and speculative value, but it lacks the utility and practical applications needed for long-term demand. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, is built on a foundation of blockchain-integrated artificial intelligence (AI) , delivering solutions for marketing , entertainment , and finance . This integration ensures Ruvi AI isn’t just another crypto token but a project with meaningful, scalable applications. At its current Phase 2 presale price of $0.015 per token , Ruvi AI offers investors a chance to secure early-stage gains. Upon the presale’s conclusion, the token price will rise to $0.07 , delivering an automatic 50% return to presale participants. Analysts are also forecasting a $1 valuation post-listing , translating to a 66x return from its initial price entry. Compared to Dogecoin’s relatively stable but slow-moving price history, Ruvi AI’s trajectory sets it apart as a high-growth contender in the crypto world. Milestone Achievement During the Presale One of the clearest indicators of Ruvi AI’s strength is its recent presale success. The project has already raised $1.8 million and sold more than 150 million tokens , making it a standout in the competitive cryptocurrency landscape. Ruvi AI’s structured price roadmap ensures steady value growth, avoiding the wild volatility that speculative projects like Dogecoin often experience. By guaranteeing a price increase to $0.07 after the presale , Ruvi AI assures early backers of consistent returns while setting the stage for future growth. VIP Investment Tiers Offer Incredible Returns Ruvi AI’s VIP investment tiers make the presale even more enticing by rewarding participants with bonus token allocations. Here’s a detailed look at these lucrative tiers: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These VIP tiers highlight Ruvi AI’s commitment to rewarding early investors with exceptional opportunities to maximize their returns. Transparency and Security Set Ruvi AI Apart Dogecoin, despite its popularity, lacks the robust infrastructure and transparency that serious investors often prioritize. This is where Ruvi AI excels. The platform is undergoing a third-party audit by CyberScope , a leading name in blockchain security, ensuring the project’s technical reliability. Ruvi AI has also partnered with WEEX Exchange , a globally recognized trading platform, to guarantee liquidity after the token launches. Such measures demonstrate Ruvi AI’s commitment to trust and long-term viability, providing investors with peace of mind as they commit to the project. Real-World Applications Drive Sustained Growth Unlike speculative meme coins, Ruvi AI’s utility-driven approach ensures enduring relevance. Here’s how it’s changing the game across major industries: Marketing Ruvi AI enhances advertising efficiency through AI-powered targeting tools, enabling businesses to optimize ad spend and improve engagement metrics. Entertainment By offering personalized content recommendations and secure blockchain-backed payments, Ruvi AI creates a better experience for both creators and consumers. Finance The platform boosts efficiency and transparency in financial operations while strengthening fraud detection capabilities, making it a game-changer for financial institutions. These practical applications ensure ongoing demand for Ruvi AI’s token, making it more than just an investment opportunity but a valuable solution in the blockchain space. Why Ruvi AI Could Be the Next $1 Breakout While Dogecoin’s slow growth suggests limited short-term upside, Ruvi AI presents a promising alternative for investors eager to multiply their portfolios. Its $0.015 presale price , guaranteed rise to $0.07 post-presale , and $1 valuation potential offer an achievable path to significant six-figure returns. Supported by a CyberScope audit , WEEX Exchange partnership , and its innovative integration of AI and blockchain, Ruvi AI stands out as a transparent and lucrative investment option.

SEC Stalls Again as Appeal Put on Hold — Here’s What’s Holding It Up,https://cryptonews.com/news/ripple-v-sec-stalls-again-as-appeal-put-on-hold/,"The long-running courtroom saga between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission has hit another pause, as both parties asked the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to keep the case on hold. In a joint status report filed on June 16, the SEC confirmed that a settlement has been signed but still hinges on the district court’s approval to move forward. This is the latest twist in a case that has shaped the way digital assets are viewed under US law. Since 2020, when the SEC sued Ripple for allegedly raising $1.3b through unregistered sales of XRP, the dispute has pulled in investors, crypto platforms and policy watchers from around the world. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP In light of the pending motion for an indicative ruling, the parties have requested that the Second Circuit continue to hold the appeals in abeyance, with the @SECGov to file a status report by August 15, 2025. https://t.co/7oQvL5Rx7U — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) June 17, 2025 What Began As A Billion-Dollar Dispute Edged Toward Resolution With A Scaled-Down Penalty A partial ruling in 2023 gave Ripple a win on XRP’s classification in retail sales , but the company was found liable for securities violations in its institutional sales. Both sides appealed. Then in May, a breakthrough seemed close. The SEC and Ripple reached an agreement in principle to resolve the litigation entirely. According to the June filing, they signed a formal settlement on May 8. Under the deal, Ripple would pay $50m to the SEC , while the remaining $75m from a previously imposed civil penalty would be returned to the company. The agreement also called for dissolving the injunction placed on Ripple. Legal Gridlock Deepens As District Court Holds Back Settlement Approval Still, the path to closure has been far from smooth. The settlement depends on the district court agreeing to revise its earlier judgment. To move forward, both sides filed a motion seeking what is known as an indicative ruling. In essence, they asked the court to signal whether it would consider approving the proposed changes. However, the court rejected that request on May 15. It ruled that the motion failed to show the “exceptional circumstances” needed for such a modification. On June 12, Ripple and the SEC returned to court with a renewed motion. This time, they aimed to meet the “exceptional circumstances” standard set by the judge. So far, the court has not ruled on the new request. As a result, both the settlement and the appeals remain in limbo. In the meantime, the SEC has asked for more time. It requested that the appeals court continue to pause the case and committed to providing another update by Aug. 15. The delay adds to growing uncertainty, as crypto firms and regulators watch closely for guidance on how securities laws will apply to digital assets. With billions in crypto still operating in a regulatory grey zone, the Ripple case has become a bellwether. What happens next could set the tone for how token sales, crypto company operations and regulatory oversight unfold in the US. For now, the waiting game continues. The post Ripple v.

Most indicators and moving averages are showing weakness, signaling a bearish trend for now. On the daily chart, SUI is well below all the short and mid-term EMAs (10, 20, 30, 50, and 100), which are between $3.12 and $3.51. The only short-term support comes from the 100-day Simple moving average at $2.95, which makes it a key level to watch. SUI Shows Weak Momentum Momentum indicators like the MACD and momentum are also currently in sell territory. RSI is at 41, which shows that there is still room for further downside before it becomes oversold. Overall, the trend remains weak unless bulls step in with strong volume to reclaim the lost EMAs. A trader warns that SUI is showing weakness after failing to hold its support range. The recent bounce was shallow, and with the price breaking below key levels, they expect a drop toward $2.10 if altcoins continue to show weakness. Additionally, the SUI network will unlock over 58 million tokens on July 1, which could impact the price action in the short term. Long-term Outlook is Bullish One analyst has tracked two possible scenarios for SUI. On the larger time frame, the outlook remains bullish as long as SUI holds above the $2.90 support zone (the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement from the April rally). This area has held up multiple times, and if the correction is complete, a strong third wave up could follow, with a possible target around $10.90. However, there is no confirmation yet that the next major rally has started. Can SUI Hold $2.95? In the short term, the price is still in a correction phase. It may move higher to $3.50–$3.60, but first, it needs to break above $3.14–$3.15 to confirm that upside. For now, there is a small uptrend from June 14, and it is still holding. But if SUI drops below $2.95, it may confirm a bearish trend.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|TRADING|SUI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-17 05:29:04

The move positions the exchange to serve users across the EU with a single license, reflecting broader institutional interest in the region’s clearer regulatory environment. However, at the same time, Coinbase is facing criticism from parts of the crypto community for sponsoring a US Army anniversary parade, with some users arguing the move contradicts the company’s stated commitment to political neutrality and the core values of the crypto space. Gemini and Coinbase Set to Expand in Europe as MiCA Reshapes the Crypto Landscape Gemini and Coinbase, two of the most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, are reportedly on the brink of securing regulatory licenses to operate across the European Union under the newly implemented Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. The move signals a significant escalation in the global expansion efforts of these digital asset firms and shows Europe’s emerging leadership in crypto regulation. According to a report published by Reuters on Monday, Gemini is poised to obtain regulatory approval from Malta, while Coinbase is expected to receive its license through Luxembourg, a jurisdiction often favored by fintech and digital asset companies for its strong regulatory reputation. A Coinbase spokesperson, while declining to confirm details of the licensing process, acknowledged Luxembourg as a “well-respected global financial center.” If approved, Gemini and Coinbase would join a growing cohort of global exchanges pushing into the EU under the MiCA framework. Other major platforms, such as Bybit, have already gained a regulatory foothold—Bybit recently secured approval to operate in Austria. Binance, meanwhile, has adjusted its operations in Poland to align with the new requirements, signaling the widespread impact of the regulation. The Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation officially came into effect in June 2024, with full implementation expected by the end of the year following guidance from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). MiCA was introduced to harmonize crypto regulations across all 27 EU member states, offering a single licensing regime for crypto firms and eliminating the need for country-by-country compliance. The framework is designed to ensure regulatory clarity, enhance investor protection, and foster financial stability in the crypto markets. It introduces comprehensive oversight for crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), encompassing areas like custody, trading, and issuance of digital tokens, including stablecoins. While MiCA is widely seen as a pioneering step toward crypto regulation on a global scale, industry reactions have been mixed—particularly around the treatment of stablecoins. Stablecoin Regulation Sparks Controversy One of MiCA’s most debated provisions concerns stablecoins. The law requires stablecoin issuers to hold a “significant” portion of their reserves in European banks. This requirement has been sharply criticized by some players in the industry for limiting the global scope of stablecoin operations. Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin USDt, has notably opted out of the MiCA regime, citing the stringent reserve requirements as a key concern. On the other hand, at least ten other stablecoins have received approval under MiCA, including those issued by Circle (USD Coin), Crypto.com, Fiat Republic, and even French banking giant Société Générale. Patrick Hansen, EU policy expert and Circle’s EU strategy lead, revealed in February that ten entities were already approved to operate stablecoins under the new regime. However, early indications suggest that uptake has been relatively cautious. Despite the promise of a unified regulatory framework, stablecoin adoption in the region remains tepid. Fabio Panetta, former executive board member of the European Central Bank and current Governor of the Bank of Italy, noted that MiCA has not spurred significant stablecoin growth in Italy, one of Europe’s largest economies. Instead, market demand appears to be gravitating more toward custodial and trading services—areas that exchanges like Gemini and Coinbase are well-positioned to serve. Their entry into the European market could capitalize on this shifting demand, offering secure infrastructure and institutional-grade trading capabilities amid a more regulated environment. A Global Chessboard for Crypto The expansion of Gemini and Coinbase into Europe comes at a time when the regulatory climate in the United States remains uncertain. US crypto firms continue to face enforcement actions and legal ambiguity from regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has been criticized for regulating by enforcement rather than through clear legislation. In contrast, the EU’s MiCA regime is being praised as a model of proactive regulation. By providing a passporting mechanism for firms licensed in one EU country to operate across all member states, MiCA has created an attractive and streamlined path for crypto firms aiming to serve European customers. As the crypto industry matures, regulatory clarity is increasingly seen as a competitive advantage. With Gemini and Coinbase soon to be licensed under MiCA, the European Union may become a pivotal arena for digital asset innovation, regulation, and adoption. Coinbase Faces Backlash for Sponsoring US Army Parade Amid Political Tensions Meanwhile, Coinbase is under fire from the crypto community following its sponsorship of the US Army’s 250th anniversary parade in Washington, D.C. The June 15 event, billed as a semiquincentennial celebration, drew support from President Donald Trump and sparked a wave of criticism among crypto advocates who see the move as politically charged and out of step with the ethos of decentralization. The backlash erupted shortly after Adam Cochran, a partner at venture capital firm Cinneamhain Ventures, took to social media platform X on June 16 to announce that he would be exiting all of his positions in Coinbase — including stocks, bonds, and crypto holdings — in protest of the sponsorship. Cochran said the decision wasn’t just personal, but also a reflection of broader concerns about Coinbase’s evolving alignment with government and military interests. The military parade, which coincided with Donald Trump’s 79th birthday, unfolded against a backdrop of intensifying political division in the US and a growing debate over the role of tech companies in partisan affairs. Critics point out that while the event was marketed as a patriotic celebration, it bore distinctly political overtones given the president’s involvement and the timing of the event. Adding to the national unrest, a tragic and possibly politically motivated attack occurred the same day, claiming the lives of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband. The attacker reportedly attempted to target a state senator and his wife as well. Meanwhile, protests erupted across major US cities, with nearly five million people demonstrating against the Trump administration’s policies — including the militarization of urban areas and deportations without due process. In this volatile climate, Coinbase’s decision to sponsor a military event has been perceived by many as a tacit endorsement of political and institutional power, at odds with the crypto community’s founding ideals. Crypto's Cultural Identity at a Crossroads Online reaction has been swift and impassioned. X user Captain Nemo encapsulated the sentiment of many disillusioned users by arguing that the sponsorship betrayed the very principles that birthed the crypto movement. The discontent taps into a longstanding tension within the crypto industry — between those who view blockchain as a tool for individual empowerment and resistance to centralized authority, and those seeking mainstream legitimacy and institutional partnerships. Coinbase, which has long maintained a policy of staying out of “political causes,” now finds itself increasingly entangled in the very issues it once claimed to sidestep. This isn’t the first time Coinbase has courted controversy over its political affiliations. The company contributed $1 million to Trump’s 2017 inauguration fund and has been actively lobbying for regulatory clarity in Washington, D.C. CEO Brian Armstrong attended a March 2025 crypto summit hosted by the president and pushed for the passage of a stablecoin regulation bill in May. Coinbase’s chief policy officer, Faryar Shirzad, also announced during the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas that the company would sponsor the 2026 semiquincentennial celebration. A source familiar with the matter said that the company’s recent parade sponsorship was a one-time financial contribution to America250 — a nonprofit, nonpartisan initiative tasked with organizing events to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the United States. However, critics argue that even indirect participation in politically loaded events carries consequences, particularly for a company representing an industry built on the promise of neutrality and financial freedom. A Battle for Crypto’s Narrative As Coinbase continues to grow its political and regulatory footprint, the crypto industry is being forced to confront uncomfortable questions: Can companies truly remain nonpartisan while engaging in government-led celebrations? Does participation in national events necessarily imply endorsement of a political regime? For some, Coinbase’s latest sponsorship represents a natural progression of crypto’s maturation — a sign that digital assets are becoming part of the mainstream financial and political fabric. For others, it marks a betrayal of crypto’s roots and a warning that the original vision of a decentralized, apolitical internet economy is at risk of being co-opted. With another controversial sponsorship lined up for 2026, Coinbase may need to do more than just explain its intentions — it may need to redefine what it stands for in the eyes of the community it helped bring into the mainstream.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-17 05:30:00

The long term price action of KSM token will heavily depend on the mainstream adoption of its Parachains, the Polkadot ecosystem. The Kusama (KSM) network remains a vital component of the Polkadot (DOT) chain, a layer-0 blockchain. The relatively low circulating supply of KSM tokens has helped it attract investors in the past, but has been criticized for its 10 percent annual inflation. The future growth prospects of KSM tokens will remain dependent on the mainstream adoption of Parachains and the ability of the project to navigate the changing regulatory landscape. Most importantly, the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystem must offer competitive services to developers in order to remain relevant amid rival chains such as Cosmos . .shortcode_title h6 { font-size: 14px; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left: 5px; } .top-gainer { background: transparent; border-radius: 10px; padding: 0; margin-bottom: 15px; } .top-markets { background: #fff; padding: 10px 10px 3px; border: 1px solid #eee; text-align: center; border-radius: 8px; position: absolute; z-index: 99; } .top-gainers-loosers ul { padding-left: 0 !important; margin-left: 0; overflow: auto; white-space: nowrap; } .top-gainer h2 { font-size: 16px; } .top-gainers-loosers ul li .top-gainer-desc { background: #fff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; } .top-gainer-desc h4 { font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 22px;}.top-gainer-desc .color-green { color: #0DA71D; font-size: 12px; font-weight: 300; line-height: 20px; float: right;}.color-green img, .color-red img { width: 12px; display: initial;} .top-gainers-loosers ul li { padding: 5px; width: 200px; margin: 0 !important; vertical-align: top;}.top-gainer h3 { font-size: 13px; margin-top: 0px; font-weight: 500; max-width: 150px; white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; }.top-gainer-desc h3 span{ color: #171717B2; font-weight: 400;}.top-gainer-desc .color-red { color: #ff3e55; font-size: 12px; font-weight: 500; line-height: 20px; float: right;}.top-gainers-loosers .curve-image{border-radius: 50%;}/* .top-gainers-loosers ul::-webkit-scrollbar { height: 5px; border-radius: 50px;} *//* .top-gainers-loosers ul::-webkit-scrollbar-track { background-color: #f1f1f1; } */.top-gainers-loosers ul::-webkit-scrollbar { display: none; /* Hides the scrollbar in WebKit browsers */}/* For Firefox */.top-gainers-loosers ul { scrollbar-width: none; user-select: none;}.circle-image{ border-radius:50px;} Market Top Gainer Turbo Trump/ TURBO $ 0.000258 126.260% Wall Street Pepe/ WEPE $ 0.000079 67.794% OpenZK Network/ OZK $ 0.000447 45.494% Treasure/ MAGIC $ 0.169523 42.799% Altlayer/ ALT $ 0.034460 33.815% document.addEventListener(""DOMContentLoaded"", function () { const gainersContainer = document.querySelectorAll('.top-gainers-loosers'); gainersContainer.forEach(container => { const list = container.querySelector('ul'); // Select the first ul within this container // Attach event listeners for drag scrolling list.addEventListener('mousedown', handleMouseDown); list.addEventListener('mouseleave', handleMouseLeave); list.addEventListener('mouseup', handleMouseUp); list.addEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove); });});// Named functions for handling eventslet isDown = false;let startX;let scrollLeft;function handleMouseDown(e) { isDown = true; this.classList.add('active'); // Optional: for styling active state startX = e.pageX - this.offsetLeft; scrollLeft = this.scrollLeft;}function handleMouseLeave() { isDown = false; this.classList.remove('active'); // Optional: remove active state}function handleMouseUp() { isDown = false; this.classList.remove('active'); // Optional: remove active state}function handleMouseMove(e) { if (!isDown) return; // Stop the function from running if mouse is not down e.preventDefault(); // Prevent text selection const x = e.pageX - this.offsetLeft; const walk = (x - startX) * 2; // Scroll-fast this.scrollLeft = scrollLeft - walk;} Overview Cryptocurrency Kusama Token KSM Price $ 14.76290276 -2.13% Market cap $ 245,717,854.2635 Circulating Supply 16,644,277.7728 Trading Volume $ 13,885,653.9173 All-time high $ N/A All-time low $ N/A 24 High Coming soon 24 Low Coming Soon Kusama Price Prediction for 2025 Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $496 $621 $745 Kusama (KSM) price in the weekly price has been forming a macro reversal pattern after being trapped in a macro bearish consolidation since 2022.

His message was clear to the crypto investors that the UK has a chance to move ahead of other countries, especially as the US continues to struggle with unclear crypto regulations . A Call for Clarity and Competitiveness The visit signals Coinbase’s strong interest in the UK. Armstrong’s call for regulatory clarity aligns with the company’s broader push to expand internationally. He believes that if the UK can create a solid legal framework, it could attract more institutional investment and crypto talent. This would also send a clear message to the wider European market that the UK is open to crypto innovation. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Companies Buying Bitcoin in 2025 – MicroStrategy No Longer Alone , Backing Innovation, One Product at a Time Armstrong’s visit follows recent product developments from Coinbase, including the launch of its Bitcoin Card with improved cashback features.

The court found that these companies misled users, broke important rules, and hid the real control of the business. This comes after WazirX faced a $235 million hack last year, making things even harder for its users. Fake Votes and Withheld Truths The case took a major turn when the court declared a recent user vote conducted by WazirX as invalid. Judge Tan stated that users were misled, as key information was intentionally kept from them. The vote, which appeared democratic on the surface, turned out to be a carefully planned act that denied users the opportunity to make a truly informed decision. Judge Tan noted that, without the court’s intervention, thousands of users would have been misled, with WazirX escaping accountability. 2/ 1. The Lie at the Heart of the Vote Singapore Court found that #WazirX orchestrated a misleading user vote. Judge Kristy Tan ruled users were not given full disclosure & couldn’t make an informed choice. The vote = invalid. A crushing blow to WazirX’s credibility. pic.twitter.com/w9ikXjZ4Pl — TOOFAAN (@TOOFAANARMY) June 16, 2025 Zettai Operating Illegally in Singapore The court went further, declaring Zettai’s operations illegal in Singapore, as the company lacked a Digital Token Service Provider (DTSP) license and had no plans to apply for one. Shockingly, Zettai’s legal team admitted in court that they never intended to apply for the required DTSP license. This isn’t a case of ignorance—it’s an intended violation of local laws. Hidden Control by Zensui Panama Adding to the controversy, it was revealed that the real control behind the scenes wasn’t Zettai, but Zensui, a Panama-based entity . This fact was deliberately hidden from users and regulators alike. The court criticized the year-long delay and legal drama as a waste of public resources, all to maintain a false narrative. India Compliance Also Ignored The court also highlighted WazirX’s refusal to register with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), further exposing a pattern of avoiding regulations in multiple countries. With the restructuring plan rejected, WazirX’s future is uncertain. The company has announced plans to appeal but has also begun shifting operations to Panama under the Zensui brand. For millions of users, the hope of recovering lost funds is now even more distant.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-17 05:42:22

According to a June 16 report shared on X, Polyhedra ( ZKJ ) says the crash began when several wallets pulled large amounts of liquidity from the ZKJ/KOGE pool on PancakeSwap ( CAKE ) and quickly sold off millions of tokens. One address withdrew over $4.3 million in liquidity and dumped around 1.57 million ZKJ. At least five other wallets followed similar patterns, all within minutes. These actions severely weakened market depth and triggered sharp price drops in an already fragile liquidity structure. Because the KOGE/USDT pool had little liquidity, the selling pressure spilled into the more liquid ZKJ/USDT pool, deepening the crash. During the same period, crypto trading firm Wintermute sent over 3.39 million ZKJ to centralized exchanges like Bybit. Between 12:45 and 14:14 UTC, the price dropped from $1.92 to $0.29.

Over $94 million in long positions were closed in just two hours, with multiple trades over $1 million liquidated around 12:57 UTC. These forced sales made the price fall faster. Adding to the pressure, recent changes to Binance’s Alpha Points program increased the fragility of the liquidity pool. Before the crash , traders were using the ZKJ/KOGE pair to farm Binance Alpha points. However, Binance decreased rewards for these trades earlier in June, which caused the pool to become less stable. Polyhedra said it added $30 million in liquidity during the crash to help support the price. But most of this was converted into ZKJ as the price fell. The crash also came just days before 15.53 million ZKJ tokens are set to unlock on June 19. This added to fears about more selling. The top 10 wallets hold nearly 69% of the supply, raising speculation about more coordinated exits. ZKJ has recovered slightly and is trading at $0.42, up 23% in the past 24 hours. Polyhedra’s team is conducting further investigations and has pledged token buybacks. Still, analysts warn that the bounce may be short-lived, with risks of further volatility as the token unlock approaches.

Alta, an innovative AI Fashion Tech startup, has successfully closed an $11 million seed funding round, signaling strong investor confidence in its vision. This development is particularly interesting for those following advancements in artificial intelligence and its practical applications, even extending into areas like personal digital assets and future consumer experiences. What is Alta AI and How Does it Work? At its core, Alta AI is designed to be your personal styling agent and shopper, bringing a concept previously seen in films like ‘Clueless’ into reality. Founded by Jenny Wang, the platform leverages advanced artificial intelligence to help users curate outfits and make purchasing decisions based on a variety of factors including their existing wardrobe, budget, lifestyle needs, current weather, and even their calendar appointments. Key features of the Alta platform include: Virtual Wardrobe Digitization: Users can upload their existing clothes by taking photos, forwarding digital receipts, or searching the Alta database. AI-Powered Outfit Recommendations: Based on user input and wardrobe data, Alta suggests suitable outfits for specific occasions or conditions. Personalized Virtual Avatar: Users can visualize how recommended outfits look on a personalized digital avatar. Mix-and-Match Functionality: The platform allows users to combine items they already own with potential purchases to see how they work together. This innovative approach to AI Styling aims to make getting dressed easier, more efficient, and more personalized than ever before. Significant Venture Capital Funding Fuels Growth The announcement of an $11 million seed round marks a significant milestone for the Fashion Tech Startup . The funding was led by prominent venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, known for backing impactful technology companies. This substantial investment at the seed stage highlights the perceived potential of Alta’s technology and business model in capturing a significant share of the burgeoning personal styling market. Jenny Wang described the fundraising process as ‘aligned,’ emphasizing the strategic nature of the investors brought on board. The capital infusion will be primarily directed towards expanding the team and accelerating research and development efforts. Wang noted, “Our team is continuously updating our in-house models and improving the experience based on community feedback,” indicating a commitment to ongoing technological advancement and user-centric development. An All-Star Investor Lineup Beyond Menlo Ventures, Alta’s seed round attracted a remarkable group of investors, blending traditional venture capital with strategic figures from the fashion, technology, and media worlds. This diverse backing underscores the broad appeal and potential market reach of the Alta AI platform. Notable investors include: Benchstrength Algaé Ventures (the investment firm linked to fashion’s prestigious Arnault family of LVMH) Phenomenal Ventures (founded by Meena Harris) Anthroptic’s VC arm, Anthrology fund The angel investor list is equally impressive, featuring: Meredith Koop (Michelle Obama’s stylist, who helped train Alta’s AI) Tony Xu (DoorDash CEO and co-founder) Supermodels Jasmine Tookes and Karlie Kloss Jenny Fleiss (Rent the Runway co-founder) Manish Chandra (Poshmark CEO and co-founder) Tech influencer Zita d’Hautville This combination of venture capital and strategic industry experts provides Alta not only with necessary capital but also invaluable expertise and network connections crucial for scaling a Fashion Tech Startup . Jenny Wang’s Vision for AI Styling For Jenny Wang, the launch of Alta is the culmination of years of contemplating the potential for a personal styling agent. A Harvard engineer by training with a background in various tech roles, including investment and technical advising, Wang recognized that while the idea existed, the artificial intelligence technology was not mature enough to build the sophisticated, intuitive product she envisioned. Now, she believes the technology has caught up, making platforms like Alta AI feasible and impactful. Wang remains deeply involved in the technical side, stating, “I am still actively coding every day and learning from our team and technical advisors.” This hands-on approach from the founder, combined with a team described as both highly technical and fashion-obsessed, positions Alta to innovate rapidly in the competitive AI Fashion Tech space. Expanding Reach and Partnerships With the fresh Venture Capital Funding , Alta is already moving quickly on strategic partnerships and geographic expansion. The company has partnered with the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) to offer its services to their membership base, providing direct access to fashion professionals and brands. Geographically, Alta is expanding its presence. Wang relocated from San Francisco to New York City, recognizing NYC as a growing hub for consumer AI companies and its proximity to European fashion centers like Paris. Collaborations with LVMH-connected investors and influencers like Zita d’Hautville are aiding expansion into Europe. Furthermore, a partnership with Marie Kondo is facilitating expansion throughout parts of Oceania and the Pacific, adding a unique angle focused on wardrobe organization and mindfulness alongside styling. The long-term plan includes partnering with retailers worldwide, creating a seamless ecosystem where users can get styling advice and directly discover or purchase items. The Future of AI Styling Alta is part of a new wave of consumer technology companies leveraging advanced AI to solve everyday problems and enhance user experiences. While other players like Whering and Cladwell, and even tech giants like Google and Pinterest, are exploring similar areas, Alta believes its approach, built on new technical architectures and user interfaces, will create a more compelling and effective styling and shopping experience. This successful Venture Capital Funding round provides Alta with the resources to pursue this vision aggressively. The blend of cutting-edge AI, strategic fashion industry connections, and strong technical leadership positions Alta as a significant player to watch in the future of fashion and technology. As AI Fashion Tech continues to evolve, platforms like Alta could fundamentally change how we interact with our wardrobes and the brands we love.

While Eric Trump dismissed claims of participation, he and Sun have a documented business history. This includes Sun’s $30 million investment in World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto platform linked to the Trump family. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s 2025 financial disclosure revealed $57.4 million in income from WLFI, where he holds over 15 billion governance tokens. Additionally, Trump’s Truth Social filed with the SEC to launch a Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, with Crypto.com as the proposed custodian. This move was made despite the intense scrutiny over the Trump family’s deepening ties to crypto. Eric Trump Dismisses Tron Deal Rumors Eric Trump, son of US President Donald Trump, denied claims that he will be involved in the Tron blockchain’s upcoming public offering in the United States, despite expressing admiration for Tron founder Justin Sun. “I’m the biggest fan of Tron,” Trump shared on social media, and praised Sun as a “great friend and icon in the crypto space,” but dismissed a report by the Financial Times that suggested he would participate in the venture. Tron’s plans to go public involve a reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed SRM Entertainment, which will be renamed Tron Inc. as part of the transition. The deal also includes a $100 million private equity investment to establish a large TRX treasury. Tron currently ranks as the ninth-largest blockchain network globally, with a market cap of $26.16 billion. Tron’s all-time market cap (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Trump and Sun’s business ties date back to November when Sun became the largest investor in World Liberty Financial by acquiring $30 million worth of WLFI tokens. Eric Trump played a pivotal role in shaping World Liberty Financial, which is a crypto platform closely associated with his family. The Trump family’s involvement in the crypto sector deepened earlier this year with the launch of American Bitcoin, a mining company preparing for a public debut via merger with Dryphon Digital Mining. Since April , the company accumulated 215 BTC, worth approximately $23.3 million. Eric Trump believes Bitcoin is a critical global asset, and called its accumulation an international “arms race” due to interest from sovereign wealth funds, ultra-wealthy families, and major corporations. Despite the financial success, the Trump family’s growing involvement in cryptocurrency attracted a lot of scrutiny from members of Congress, who raised questions about the overlap between political influence and business interests. Trump Discloses Major WLFI Income US President Donald Trump himself recently disclosed earning $57.4 million from his involvement with World Liberty Financial. The income was revealed in his 2025 financial disclosure , which was filed with the US Office of Government Ethics on June 13. According to the filing, Trump holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in World Liberty Financial, which also grant him voting rights. While the document does not provide a specific valuation or structure for the tokens, the substantial income figure implies that Trump either sold part of his holdings or that the tokens were valued highly for disclosure purposes. The reported gain is listed as “$57,437,927” and attributed to token sales. Trump’s WLFI earings World Liberty Financial launched in September of 2024 with a focus on decentralized finance and stablecoins, and it raised approximately $550 million through two token sales. The first round brought in $200 million, and a second round in early 2025 raised an additional $250 million. The project positions itself as a challenger to traditional finance and attracted a lot of backing from the crypto industry. In addition to Justin Sun, Web3Port contributed $10 million in January, while Oddiyana Ventures joined as a strategic investor, although the size of its investment was not disclosed. Trump’s digital asset involvement extends beyond World Liberty Financial. While his latest filing does not show new revenue from previous ventures like Trump Digital Trading Cards, it does reflect the still ongoing connections to entities like CIC Digital and CIC Ventures. These companies are tied to his past Web3 and NFT efforts, though they appear to be inactive or generating minimal income at present. The President’s certification on the ethics filing confirms that the information provided is accurate to the best of his knowledge and is now subject to review by the Office of Government Ethics. Truth Social Files for Bitcoin and Ether ETF The Trump-crypto ties deepened after US President Donald Trump’s social media platform, Truth Social, recently filed an S-1 registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a dual exchange-traded fund (ETF) focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum. The proposed fund is named the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, and will be sponsored by asset manager Yorkville America Digital. A crypto ETF is a fund that allows investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum without directly owning them. It tracks crypto prices and is traded on traditional stock exchanges, which simplifies access and reduces custody risks. Party of Truth Social’s S-1 filing The main goal of Truth Social’s fund is to simplify crypto investment by offering shares backed by BTC and ETH. According to the filing, the digital assets will be held by Crypto.com’s trust arm, Foris DAX Trust Company, serving as the crypto custodian for the ETF. The ETF is intended to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange Arca, though the fund’s ticker and cash custodian details haven not been disclosed yet. Truth Social explained that further details, including its prime execution agreement with Crypto.com, will be included in a later amendment to the filing. This ETF filing was made shortly after the SEC approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury registration, which followed the company’s $2.5 billion capital raise in May to acquire Bitcoin, despite initially denying such plans. The firm stated that it has no immediate plans to issue securities under the approved deal. Coinciding with Truth Social’s ETF filing, CoinShares also submitted a separate S-1 application on the same day, proposing a Solana spot ETF for US investors. CoinShares already operates a similar Solana ETP in Europe and is now looking to expand its footprint to the US market. With this addition, there are now at least eight Solana spot ETF applications under SEC review, including proposals from Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, and Canary Capital. Despite this growing interest, analysts suggest that an approval for a Solana ETF is unlikely in the immediate future.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-17 05:54:42

In an X post, Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink , says this regulatory clarity will unlock a wave of new stablecoins, not just in the US but around the world. However, with that growth comes rising expectations for transparency, security, and compliance.

Chainlink is… — Sergey Nazarov (@SergeyNazarov) June 17, 2025 Stablecoins Will Need More Than Just Backing Nazarov points out that future stablecoins won’t survive on branding alone. To become widely adopted across the digital economy and tokenized funds market, they’ll need real-time proof that they’re fully backed. They’ll also need to work across multiple blockchains, as users and institutions demand seamless movement of assets between different networks. This is where Chainlink steps in. Nazarov says it’s currently the only platform offering both proof of reserves and cross-chain connectivity in one system, a key advantage as new stablecoins enter a more competitive and regulated environment. Compliance and Identity Are the Next Frontiers Looking ahead, regulators are expected to push for more identity and compliance requirements on-chain. Nazarov highlights that Chainlink is already preparing for this next phase. In addition to tracking reserves and enabling cross-chain payments, the platform is also building tools for identity verification and low-friction compliance. With these layers in place, Chainlink aims to become the first system that can deliver reserves, connectivity, identity, and compliance under one roof. Managing Complexity with Simplicity As blockchain transactions grow in complexity, Nazarov argues that most platforms will struggle to keep up. Chainlink’s vision is to offer a unified framework where all necessary services can be configured and controlled through one workflow using its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). This approach is meant to give stablecoin issuers, institutions, and developers a simple way to manage complex systems, offering all the required infrastructure through a single piece of code. With stablecoins poised to play a central role in the future of finance, Chainlink is betting big on becoming the backbone that keeps them secure, connected, and compliant from day one. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

One area drawing significant attention is stablecoins – cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar. A crucial piece of legislation aiming to bring clarity and structure to this market is now on the cusp of a major step forward. Get ready, because the US Senate is poised for a pivotal vote. What is the GENIUS Act and Why Does it Matter for Stablecoin Regulation ? The bill in question, officially known as the GENIUS Act (Guaranteeing an Exceptional National Investment Unified System Act), represents a significant legislative effort to establish a comprehensive framework for stablecoin regulation in the United States. It’s not just another proposal; it’s a bill that has navigated the complex waters of Washington D.C. and is now heading towards a decisive moment in the Senate. At its core, the GENIUS Act seeks to address key concerns surrounding stablecoins, aiming to ensure their stability, protect consumers, and prevent illicit use. Here are some of the main pillars of the proposed legislation: Dollar-Backed Reserves: A primary requirement is that stablecoin issuers must hold reserves equivalent to the value of the stablecoins they issue. These reserves are mandated to be held in safe, liquid assets, primarily U.S. dollars or highly liquid dollar-denominated assets. This aims to ensure that stablecoins are truly backed 1:1, providing confidence in their value peg. Audits for Large Issuers: The bill proposes stricter oversight for larger stablecoin issuers, likely defined by market capitalization or transaction volume. These entities would be subject to regular, independent audits to verify their reserve holdings and operational compliance. Transparency through audits is seen as essential for market integrity. Consumer Protections: The legislation includes provisions designed to protect individuals and businesses using stablecoins. This could involve requirements for clear disclosure of risks, mechanisms for complaint resolution, and rules around the handling of customer funds. The goal is to prevent scenarios like the collapse of algorithmic stablecoins that led to significant user losses. Licensing and Supervision: While details are still being debated, the bill likely establishes a framework for stablecoin issuers to be licensed and supervised by relevant financial regulators, potentially the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) or state banking regulators, working in coordination with federal bodies like the Federal Reserve and Treasury. Passing a robust stablecoin bill is seen by many as a critical step for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in the global financial system as digital assets become more integrated. It could provide the necessary regulatory certainty for businesses to build on stablecoin technology and for consumers to use them safely. How Has the GENIUS Act Gained Traction in the US Senate ? Achieving bipartisan support in the current political climate is no small feat, yet the GENIUS Act has managed to build a degree of consensus. Initial versions of stablecoin legislation faced hurdles, particularly regarding how to handle foreign stablecoin issuers operating within the U.S. market and the extent to which non-financial corporations could be involved in stablecoin issuance. According to reports, including insights from The Block, revisions were made to the GENIUS Act to address these concerns. These changes appear to have broadened its appeal, bringing together lawmakers from both sides of the aisle who recognize the need for clear rules in the rapidly expanding digital asset space. The ability to find common ground on key aspects like reserve requirements and consumer protection has been instrumental in propelling the bill to the Senate floor for a vote. The bipartisan nature of the support is significant because it increases the likelihood of the bill passing the Senate and potentially becoming law. It signals a growing understanding among policymakers that ignoring or outright banning stablecoins is not a viable long-term strategy, and that a balanced regulatory approach is needed. What Challenges and Controversies Surround This Stablecoin Bill ? Despite gaining bipartisan support, the path to enactment for the GENIUS Act is not entirely smooth. Like many pieces of legislation touching upon the complex world of crypto, it faces scrutiny and raises specific controversies. One notable point of contention highlighted in initial reports is the connection between U.S. President Trump and World Liberty Financial, a stablecoin issuer reportedly co-founded by his sons. While the GENIUS Act is said to include provisions restricting current government officials from having direct involvement in stablecoin issuance or related businesses, the language reportedly does not explicitly extend these restrictions to immediate family members. This has raised ethical questions and concerns about potential conflicts of interest, adding a layer of political complexity to the bill’s consideration. Other challenges inherent in regulating stablecoins include: Defining ‘Stablecoin’: Ensuring the legal definition is broad enough to cover various types of stablecoins (fiat-backed, commodity-backed, etc.) but specific enough to provide clarity. Balancing Innovation and Regulation: Finding the right balance that protects consumers and financial stability without stifling technological innovation in the crypto space. Enforcement: Determining which agencies will have primary oversight and how enforcement actions will be coordinated, especially for globally operating issuers. Interoperability: Considering how U.S. stablecoin regulation will interact with regulatory efforts in other countries. These challenges underscore the difficulty of crafting effective crypto regulation in a fast-moving sector. How Does the GENIUS Act Compare to Other Efforts in Crypto Regulation ? The GENIUS Act isn’t the only game in town when it comes to digital asset legislation in the U.S. The House of Representatives has also been working on its own versions of stablecoin bills, often with different approaches or priorities. According to The Block, there is speculation that the House might consider adopting the Senate’s GENIUS Act version rather than pushing its own through. This potential move is attributed to the broader bipartisan support the GENIUS Act has garnered in the Senate, which could make it easier to pass through both chambers of Congress. Harmonization between the House and Senate is crucial for any bill to reach the President’s desk. This situation highlights a broader trend in U.S. crypto regulation – a fragmented approach across different committees and chambers of Congress, as well as various regulatory agencies (SEC, CFTC, Treasury, Fed, etc.). The push for a dedicated stablecoin law like the GENIUS Act represents an attempt to create specific, tailored rules for this asset class, rather than trying to fit stablecoins awkwardly into existing securities or banking frameworks. The success of the GENIUS Act could set a precedent for how future crypto-specific legislation is developed and passed, potentially paving the way for more comprehensive digital asset laws down the line. What Actionable Insights Can We Gain from the GENIUS Act’s Progress? The impending vote on the GENIUS Act offers several key takeaways for anyone involved in or observing the cryptocurrency market: Regulatory Clarity is Approaching (for Stablecoins): While not a full crypto bill, the GENIUS Act signals that concrete, asset-specific regulation is becoming a reality in the U.S. Stablecoin issuers, users, and developers should pay close attention to the final requirements. Bipartisan Support is Possible: The fact that a significant stablecoin bill has achieved bipartisan backing demonstrates that common ground on certain aspects of crypto regulation can be found in Washington. This offers a glimmer of hope for future legislative efforts. Political Connections Remain a Factor: The controversy surrounding the Trump family’s ties to a stablecoin issuer underscores the political dimensions of crypto regulation and the potential for conflicts of interest to influence policy debates. House and Senate Coordination is Key: The potential for the House to adopt the Senate’s bill highlights the legislative process’s need for compromise and alignment between the two chambers. Impact on the Stablecoin Market: If passed, the GENIUS Act will fundamentally change how stablecoins operate in the U.S., potentially increasing confidence for institutional adoption while imposing stricter compliance burdens on issuers. For users and investors, a regulated stablecoin market could offer increased safety and predictability. For businesses, it could provide the certainty needed to integrate stablecoins into their operations. However, it will also mean navigating new compliance landscapes. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Stablecoins The upcoming US Senate vote on the GENIUS Act is undoubtedly a defining moment for stablecoins and broader crypto regulation in the United States. This stablecoin bill , with its focus on reserve requirements, audits, and consumer protection, represents the most significant legislative push yet to bring clear rules to this vital segment of the digital asset market. While challenges and controversies, including political connections, persist, the bill’s bipartisan support suggests a genuine momentum towards establishing a foundational framework. The outcome of this vote will not only shape the future of stablecoins in the U.S. but could also influence global regulatory approaches. It underscores the transition of cryptocurrencies from a niche technology to a subject of serious national policy debate. Whether the GENIUS Act passes as is, is amended, or faces further delays, its journey through the Senate highlights the growing urgency among lawmakers to address the complexities and opportunities presented by digital assets.

However, some analysts believe that the cryptocurrency will continue its sideways move for the coming weeks before its next big move. Related Reading: Will The Bitcoin Price Move Above $110,000 Again? Global M2 Money Supply Shows What’s Next Ethereum Eyes Range High Resistance Last week, Ethereum attempted to reclaim the $2,800 barrier, hitting a three-month high of $2,879. However, the market shakeout, fueled by the Iran-Israel conflict, sent the cryptocurrency’s price to retest its local range’s lows before recovering over the weekend. Notably, ETH has been hovering between the $2,400-$2,680 range since the early May market recovery, which saw the King of Altcoins surge from the $1,800 mark toward its current price range for the first time in three months. Nonetheless, it has been rejected from the local range’s resistance four times in the past month. Market watcher Daan Crypto Trades noted that Ethereum’s price action has been consolidating between these two key levels, compressing just below the $2,800 area. This level has been a crucial area throughout the cycle, serving as a key support and resistance level since 2024. The trader considers this area to be “the most important level on this entire chart by far,” detailing that every major retest of this zone has led to either “a nice bounce” or “big dump.” Meanwhile, ETH “went on to really even further” after every reclaim of this level as support. Daan explained that its current price range is “becoming quite a tight range for how long it’s been trading here. You can see how important this is and that there’s likely a big move coming from this point somewhere in the next few weeks.” Based on this, he forecasted that “If we’d see a convincing break above $2.8K and hold there, that would be a good setup for a move to the cycle highs around ~$4K.” However, if it loses this current range, then the $2,100 area “is the big high timeframe level to watch.” Is A 2017 Repeat In The Making? Merlijn The Trader highlighted that Ethereum is now consolidating within its current range after breaking out of a multi-month falling wedge, which suggests that the cryptocurrency could soon experience a massive move. He pointed out that, historically, “this pause often precedes a surge,” adding that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also retesting the recent breakout zone. Additionally, the trader noted that ETH appears to be following its 2016-2017 playbook, with a similar structure to eight years ago. At the time, the cryptocurrency had an “explosive setup” that led ETH to a massive lift-off starting in 2017. After the market shakeout, the cryptocurrency moved sideways within a tight range while reclaiming the 50-day Moving Average (MA).

According to Merlijn, “Same breakout zone. Same 50 MA reclaim. Sideways chop… then liftoff. But this time? Bigger market. Institutional fuel is backing ETH. No ceiling in sight. We’re not repeating history… We’re amplifying it.” As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,640, a 3.7% increase in the daily timeframe.

The OpenAI Microsoft partnership has been a cornerstone in the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, but recent reports suggest significant strain. For those tracking the fast evolution of technology, including in the crypto space where AI tools are increasingly relevant for analysis and trading, understanding these foundational shifts is key. A Wall Street Journal report, citing anonymous sources, indicates the relationship is facing serious challenges. What’s Causing the Strain in the OpenAI Microsoft AI Partnership? The core of the reported tension in the OpenAI Microsoft AI Partnership appears to revolve around control and strategic direction. OpenAI is reportedly seeking greater autonomy, particularly concerning its valuable Intellectual Property and the computing resources it relies on. The recent $3 billion acquisition of the AI coding startup, Windsurf, has reportedly become a major flashpoint in this dynamic. OpenAI reportedly wants to ensure that Windsurf’s intellectual property remains under its sole control and is not automatically accessible to Microsoft, fearing it could directly benefit or enhance Microsoft’s competing offerings, such as GitHub Copilot. This disagreement highlights a fundamental struggle over who ultimately controls and benefits from valuable AI assets developed or acquired within the framework of their collaboration. Is OpenAI Seeking Independence from Microsoft’s Cloud Computing Power? A significant area of reported contention is OpenAI’s desire to reduce its dependence on Microsoft’s extensive Cloud Computing infrastructure, Azure. While Microsoft’s cloud resources were undeniably crucial for OpenAI’s rapid scaling and early development, sources suggest OpenAI is now actively exploring ways to diversify its infrastructure providers. This reported move towards greater independence in Cloud Computing presents a complex challenge for OpenAI. Despite seeking more autonomy, the startup still requires Microsoft’s approval for critical business transformations, including its planned conversion to a for-profit entity. The need for massive, scalable computing power is fundamental to developing and deploying cutting-edge AI Technology , making cloud reliance a strategic vulnerability OpenAI reportedly aims to mitigate. The Fight for Control Over AI Technology and Future Direction The tension reportedly extends to the broader direction and control of cutting-edge AI Technology itself. The report mentions that OpenAI executives considered taking drastic steps, including the possibility of publicly accusing Microsoft of anticompetitive behavior related to the terms and execution of their partnership agreement. They also reportedly mulled seeking a formal federal regulatory review of their contract with Microsoft. These reported considerations point to deep-seated concerns within OpenAI about the power dynamics at play and potential limitations imposed by the partnership on its ability to innovate and deploy AI Technology freely. The struggle over access to and control of Intellectual Property is central to this reported fight for technological autonomy and future strategic direction. Challenges and Implications for the AI Ecosystem If the relationship between OpenAI Microsoft continues to deteriorate significantly, it poses considerable challenges for both companies and carries broader implications for the wider AI Partnership ecosystem. For OpenAI, a strained relationship could impact crucial funding streams and access to necessary computational resources required for continued innovation in AI Technology . For Microsoft, tensions could affect its strategic position in the competitive AI market, potentially limiting its access to OpenAI’s latest models and advancements. The uncertainty surrounding this critical AI Partnership could potentially slow down collaborative innovation and influence how AI Technology is developed, governed, and commercialized globally. Understanding these high-level corporate dynamics is important for anyone tracking major shifts in the tech landscape that often ripple out into adjacent sectors like cryptocurrency and decentralized technology. Summary The reported widening cracks in the OpenAI Microsoft AI Partnership reportedly stem from fundamental disagreements over the control of valuable Intellectual Property , strategic reliance on Cloud Computing resources, and the overall direction of AI Technology development. The standoff concerning the Windsurf acquisition is highlighted as a key example of this growing tension. While the partnership initially fueled significant growth for OpenAI, the startup is reportedly seeking greater independence, even considering potentially drastic actions like regulatory review or public accusations. The future trajectory of this crucial AI Partnership remains uncertain, with potential consequences for both involved parties and the broader landscape of AI Technology development and deployment.

The application , submitted on June 15, seeks protection for the name “JPMD” and outlines a wide scope of blockchain and digital currency functions, suggesting a broader strategy to expand the bank’s role in crypto payments and asset settlement. The US Patent and Trademark Office filing lists dozens of services tied to digital currency. These include payment processing, token issuance, currency trading, digital custody, and electronic fund transfers, all powered by blockchain and distributed ledger technology. While the word “stablecoin” is not explicitly mentioned, the filing’s language hints at a platform that could support one. The world’s largest bank, JPMorgan, has filed a trademark for what appears to be a stablecoin called ‘JPMD’ pic.twitter.com/LQg09Ga2LG — db (@tier10k) June 16, 2025 Filing Echoes Key Features Needed for a Scalable Stablecoin The timing of the move has drawn attention. Just weeks earlier, Wall Street Journal reported that JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo were exploring the launch of a joint stablecoin venture . Sources told the outlet that the goal was to compete with crypto-native stablecoins and streamline both domestic and cross-border payments. This latest trademark filing adds weight to those reports. In particular, JPMorgan’s description of providing real-time digital token trading, electronic transfers, and clearing via distributed ledger technology mirrors many of the technical functions required to operate a stablecoin at scale. Analysts believe the bank could be laying the legal and operational groundwork for such a product. JPMorgan Moves Ahead As Congress Debates Stablecoin Rules JPMorgan is no stranger to blockchain. Its Kinexys platform, previously known as Onyx, has already processed more than $1.5 trillion in interbank payments using JPM Coin, a private stablecoin backed 1:1 by fiat currency. JPM Coin is currently limited to institutional clients, but the new filing suggests the bank may be preparing for a broader, possibly retail-facing, rollout. The move also comes just as lawmakers in Washington begin debating new rules around stablecoins. The US Senate recently voted to advance the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan bill that could establish a regulatory framework for dollar-backed digital tokens. If passed by both chambers of Congress, the legislation would head to President Trump’s desk later this year. Whether “JPMD” will emerge as a publicly available token or simply expand JPMorgan’s institutional capabilities remains unclear. But with the financial sector rapidly converging on blockchain infrastructure, the trademark marks yet another step by a Wall Street heavyweight toward a more digital future.

Ferguson stated that in the current economic conditions, the central bank is operating in a “wait-and-see” mode and must be patient. Ferguson said, “The Fed will not cut interest rates at this meeting or even the next one. They hope inflation will decline further, but they will continue to be cautious.” He said the Fed will send “vigilant and patient” messages to the market in its statements this week, and that this situation may disappoint some segments. Ferguson said that what is described as a “good rate cut”, that is, a rate cut made only when inflation falls without a slowdown in the economy or a disruption in the labor market, does not seem likely this year. “The Fed came very close to a soft landing this year, but there are still many risks. Perhaps a more clear picture emerges next year and if inflation continues to decline, a limited rate cut may be on the agenda,” he said. Related News: BREAKING: Donald Trump's Son Eric Trump Denies Connection to Surprise Altcoin - Price Reacted The program also brought up geopolitical risks in the Gulf and the possible effects of oil prices. Ferguson argued that the increases in oil prices have not been reflected in core inflation so far, but that this could change and that the FED should be careful. When the presenters reminded him of President Trump’s approach of “cutting interest rates now while inflation is low, and raising them later if necessary,” Ferguson approached this suggestion cautiously. “In the past, inflation has been short-lived in the downward trend. There is also the risk that inflation expectations will deteriorate. The FED was late to address inflation in the previous cycle. They don’t want to make the same mistake again,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

Is it buzzing with excitement, or is everyone hiding under their digital beds? That’s where the Crypto Fear & Greed Index comes in. It’s a fascinating tool designed to capture the prevailing crypto market sentiment , giving us a snapshot of whether investors are feeling bullish or bearish. As of June 17, this widely watched index, provided by Alternative, registered a significant jump, climbing seven points to hit 68. This places it firmly within the ‘Greed’ territory, a notable shift that suggests optimism is currently running high in the market. But what exactly does this number tell us, and how should we interpret it in the context of broader crypto market trends ? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: More Than Just a Number The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t pulled out of thin air. It’s a composite index ranging from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). Its goal is to help traders and investors understand if the market is overly fearful (potentially a buying opportunity) or overly greedy (potentially due for a correction). The philosophy is rooted in investor psychology – extreme fear can lead to panic selling, while extreme greed can fuel FOMO-driven buying, neither of which is sustainable long-term. The index aggregates data from six key factors, each weighted differently: Volatility (25%): Measures how much the Bitcoin price and other major cryptocurrencies are fluctuating. Higher volatility in a positive direction often indicates a greedy market, while high volatility downwards points to fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares current volume and market momentum with average values. High buying volume in a rising market suggests greed. Social Media (15%): Analyzes posts and hashtags related to crypto on platforms like Twitter. High levels of positive, hype-driven posts can signal greed. Surveys (15%): Gathers sentiment from weekly polls. (Note: As of the original data, surveys were paused, meaning this component’s weight might be temporarily redistributed or the overall calculation adjusted). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear as investors move away from altcoins into the perceived safety of BTC, or greed if Bitcoin is leading a strong rally. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Rising search interest can reflect increasing public curiosity and potential FOMO (greed). By combining these factors, the index aims to provide a holistic view of the market’s emotional state, offering insights into prevailing crypto market trends . What Does a Reading of 68 (Greed) Imply for the Crypto Market? A reading of 68 places the index squarely in the ‘Greed’ zone (typically defined as 55-74). This suggests that investors are feeling confident and optimistic about the market’s direction. Historically, readings in the upper ‘Greed’ or ‘Extreme Greed’ zones have sometimes preceded market pullbacks, as high optimism can lead to overextension and increased risk-taking. Conversely, periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ (0-24) have often coincided with market bottoms, presenting potential buying opportunities for those brave enough to enter against the prevailing mood. While a high ‘Greed’ reading isn’t a guaranteed sell signal, it serves as a yellow flag, reminding investors to exercise caution. It highlights that the market is running on high octane optimism, which can make it more susceptible to sharp reversals if sentiment shifts. Connecting Investor Psychology to Bitcoin Price Movements There’s a strong correlation between investor psychology , as reflected by the Fear & Greed Index, and Bitcoin price movements. When the index is low (fear), it often means people are selling due to panic or uncertainty, pushing prices down. When the index is high (greed), it indicates strong buying pressure, often driven by excitement and the fear of missing out (FOMO), which helps propel prices upward. Observing how the index interacts with the Bitcoin price can be a valuable exercise. Does a sustained period of high greed align with a parabolic price increase? Does a sudden drop into fear coincide with a sharp price correction? While correlation doesn’t equal causation, the index provides a useful lens through which to view price action, understanding the emotional backdrop driving it. Using the Index to Navigate Crypto Market Trends So, how can you actually use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index in your own strategy? Here are a few actionable insights: As a Contrarian Indicator: Some investors use the index as a contrarian tool. The saying goes, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” A high greed reading might prompt a contrarian investor to consider taking profits or reducing exposure, while a low fear reading might encourage them to look for buying opportunities. Gauge Market Fatigue: A prolonged period in the ‘Greed’ or ‘Extreme Greed’ zone, especially when combined with other technical indicators showing potential overbought conditions, can suggest market fatigue and the potential for a correction. Confirming Trends: If you believe the market is in an uptrend, seeing the index rise into ‘Greed’ can confirm that positive sentiment is supporting the move. Conversely, a drop into ‘Fear’ during a downturn confirms negative sentiment is dominant. Not a Standalone Tool: It’s crucial to remember the index is just *one* indicator. Never rely solely on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for investment decisions. Always combine its insights with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and a thorough understanding of overall crypto market trends . Understanding the interplay between the index and investor psychology is key to using it effectively. Challenges and Limitations While insightful, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t without its limitations: Data Sources: The index relies on specific data sources. Changes in these sources or temporary pauses (like the surveys) can affect its accuracy. Interpretation: What constitutes ‘Extreme Greed’ or ‘Extreme Fear’ can be subjective and might evolve with market maturity. Lagging vs. Leading: The index is often seen as a reflection of *current* sentiment rather than a predictor of *future* price movements. While extreme readings *can* precede reversals, they don’t guarantee them. Focus on Bitcoin: Although it considers the broader market through momentum/volume, factors like Bitcoin dominance and Google Trends specifically focus on BTC, potentially making it less sensitive to sentiment shifts in the altcoin market specifically. Using the index requires nuance and an awareness that it’s a sentiment gauge, not a predictive model. Conclusion: Navigating Greed in the Crypto Market The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 68, keeping it in the ‘Greed’ zone, signals a period of heightened optimism and confidence among crypto investors. This level of ‘Greed’ is a direct reflection of prevailing crypto market sentiment , influenced by factors ranging from Bitcoin price action and market momentum to social media buzz and search interest. While positive sentiment can fuel further gains, a high ‘Greed’ reading also serves as a timely reminder that markets driven by excessive optimism can be prone to sharp corrections. Understanding the index, its components, and its limitations allows investors to better gauge the emotional climate of the market and integrate this insight into a more comprehensive strategy for navigating the ever-evolving crypto market trends . It’s a valuable tool for understanding collective investor psychology , but it should always be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis.

Although DOGE hasn’t seen its $4 milestone in sight, its entrenched meme-energy and retail momentum make it a staple in 2025.

Priced at just $0.03, MUTM is rapidly gaining momentum across social media and crypto circles, with growing whispers of reaching $4 before summer ends.

Although it is yet to regain the retail-driven peaks of the previous bull run, DOGE is still traded actively with high liquidity and a firmly established community base. According to analysts, the future performance of Dogecoin will be reliant on the overall sentiment changes and possible triggers related to the social momentum or platform integrations like X (formerly Twitter). In the meantime, new projects, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) begin to gather some interests also priced under $0.40. Certik Audited and Ready to Soar Security is a top priority for Mutuum Finance.

This transaction occurred as Circle’s stock reached new heights, prompting questions and discussions among investors about ARK’s strategy. What’s Behind the Strategic ARK Invest Sale of Circle Stock? On June 16, ARK Invest divested a substantial portion of its position in Circle (CRCL), selling a total of 342,658 shares. This sale was particularly noteworthy because it took place on a day when Circle’s stock experienced a significant surge, hitting a new intraday high of $165.60. The shares ultimately closed the day at $151.06, marking a 13.1% increase for the day and an impressive nearly five-fold return compared to its initial public offering (IPO) price of $31. The total value of the shares sold amounted to approximately $57.1 million based on the closing price. This strategic move was spread across three of ARK Invest’s flagship exchange-traded funds (ETFs): the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), and the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF). These ETFs are known for their focus on disruptive innovation and technology companies, including those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. Details of the Circle Share Sale: Date: June 16 Shares Sold: 342,658 Approximate Value: $57.1 million ETFs Involved: ARKK, ARKW, ARKF Context: Occurred on a day Circle stock hit a new intraday high ($165.60) and closed significantly above its IPO price ($31). Who is ARK Invest and Why Does Circle Stock Matter for Crypto Investment? ARK Invest, founded by Cathie Wood, has become a prominent name in the investment world, particularly for its high-conviction approach to investing in disruptive technologies. The firm’s research-driven strategy often leads it to take significant positions in companies poised to reshape industries through innovation, including areas like artificial intelligence, genomics, robotics, and fintech, which encompasses significant crypto investment exposure. Circle, on the other hand, is a key player in the digital asset ecosystem. While perhaps best known as the co-creator and principal operator of the USDC stablecoin, one of the largest dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, Circle also offers various fintech services for businesses building on digital currencies and blockchain technology. Its potential or realized public listing has been closely watched as a bellwether for the broader adoption and financial market integration of crypto-native businesses. For ARK Invest, an investment in Circle represents a direct play on the growth of regulated stablecoins and the infrastructure supporting the digital economy. Circle’s performance is tied to the expansion of the stablecoin market, regulatory clarity, and the overall health of the crypto landscape, making its stock a relevant holding for funds focused on the future of finance. Analyzing the Implications for ARKK ETF Holders and the Market The decision by ARK Invest to sell Circle stock, especially at a time of price strength, raises several potential interpretations. For holders of ARKK ETF, ARKW, and ARKF, understanding the rationale behind such a move is crucial. Potential Reasons for the Sale: Profit Taking: Given Circle’s significant appreciation from its IPO price and the recent surge, selling shares could be a simple case of taking profits off the table after a successful run. This is a standard portfolio management practice to lock in gains. Portfolio Rebalancing: As a stock’s value increases significantly within a portfolio, its weighting can become larger than desired. ARK may have sold shares to bring Circle’s position back in line with their target allocation across the ARKK ETF and others. Risk Management: Selling into strength can also be a form of risk management, reducing exposure to a single position, especially in a volatile market or ahead of potential future market shifts. Capital Allocation: ARK may see more compelling opportunities elsewhere in the market and is reallocating capital from a position that has performed well to fund new or existing positions with potentially higher future growth prospects. While some might interpret a sale as a lack of conviction, ARK’s strategy often involves actively managing positions based on their evolving research and market conditions. Selling a portion of a holding does not necessarily mean they are exiting the position entirely or have lost faith in the company’s long-term potential. It’s a dynamic process of capital allocation. Cathie Wood’s Vision: Navigating the Future of Fintech and Stablecoins Cathie Wood has consistently expressed a bullish long-term outlook on disruptive technologies, including the role of digital currencies and blockchain in the future of finance. ARK Invest’s holdings often reflect this vision, including companies involved in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader crypto ecosystem. Circle’s position as a leader in the stablecoin market aligns with this vision, as stablecoins are seen by many as a critical bridge between traditional finance and the decentralized digital economy. The regulatory environment for stablecoins is still evolving globally, presenting both opportunities and challenges for companies like Circle. ARK’s trading activity in Circle stock likely considers these complex factors, aiming to balance conviction in the long-term trend with tactical adjustments based on market dynamics and regulatory developments. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors following ARK Invest or holding positions in their ETFs, this sale highlights the active management style employed by the firm. It’s a reminder that portfolio composition is fluid and subject to change based on market performance, valuation, and evolving research. Instead of solely reacting to individual trades, investors might consider: Understanding ARK’s Rationale: While specific reasons for every trade aren’t always disclosed immediately, ARK often communicates its broader themes and research. Following their research updates can provide context. Looking at the Bigger Picture: Evaluate Circle’s fundamentals, the growth of the stablecoin market, and the regulatory landscape independently, rather than just focusing on ARK’s buy/sell decisions. Considering Diversification: Relying solely on one fund or manager’s decisions carries risks. Diversifying across different investment strategies and asset classes remains a core principle of sound investing. The $57 million sale of Circle shares by ARK Invest is a significant event, reflecting active portfolio management in response to market conditions and the performance of a key holding. It underscores the dynamic nature of investing in rapidly evolving sectors like fintech and crypto investment, where strategic decisions are constantly being made to navigate growth opportunities and manage risks.

Key Takeaways: Daily active XRP addresses have surged 7x to 295,000, signaling renewed network engagement. Whale wallets holding over 1 million XRP have hit a record high, suggesting rising institutional interest. Derivatives volume has spiked nearly 300%, pointing to heightened short-term speculation rather than long-term accumulation. The spike in interaction marks a 7x increase, pointing to renewed interest in the network, according to data from Santiment . Alongside growing usage, the number of whale wallets holding over 1 million XRP has reached an all-time high of 2,700 — a milestone not seen in the 12-year history of the protocol. Whale Surge Signals Rising Confidence in XRP Ledger The rise in large holders may reflect growing institutional or high-net-worth conviction in XRP’s long-term value. XRP is trading at $2.2373 at press time, up 2.7% on the day, with prices ranging between $2.10 and $2.32 over the past week. Trading volumes have surged, jumping 248% in the past 24 hours, indicating heightened market attention. The XRP ledger is showing serious signs of growth, from both a usage and key stakeholder perspective. The amount of interacting $XRP addresses has averaged over 295K per day over the past week. Its normal daily average over the past 3 months was approximately 35-40K. … pic.twitter.com/RvxE8BSFAg — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 16, 2025 According to Coinglass, open interest has risen 3% to $4.02 billion, while derivatives volume has soared by nearly 300% to $9.57 billion. The data points to a burst of short-term speculative trading rather than steady accumulation — a pattern that may precede sharp price movements in either direction. The XRP shift may also reflect broader developments. On June 11, VivoPower, a publicly listed firm, announced a partnership with the Flare blockchain to generate yield from its XRP holdings. The move could indicate that institutional players are looking for ways to leverage their crypto assets without liquidating them. In May, VivoPower also invested $121 million in XRP as a strategic reserve, making it the first company in the world with an XRP-focused treasury. XRP Continues to Consolidate XRP is currently trading near $2.236, following a period of volatile price action across different timeframes. On the daily chart, the RSI is holding around 53, suggesting neutral momentum with no clear overbought or oversold conditions. Meanwhile, the MACD line has just crossed above the signal line, a potential early signal of short-term bullish momentum. The 4-hour chart reflects a recent pullback after touching a local high of $2.35. RSI has cooled to 42, and MACD shows bearish crossover with widening divergence, indicating that bulls are losing control in the short term. This aligns with a dip back into the lower Bollinger Band region, hinting at possible support around $2.21. On the 1-minute chart, price action is consolidating tightly between $2.23 and $2.24. RSI and MACD are both flattening, confirming indecision among traders. With volume remaining modest, no breakout appears imminent at the moment. If XRP holds above the 20-period SMA on the 4H, a rebound toward $2.30 remains in play. However, failure to defend $2.21 support could open the way for further downside toward $2.10.

If this week does not close in green, then it is likely that sellers will break this support and take the asset to $0.55, where the next key support is found. Chart by TradingView 2. Low Momentum Interest in Cardano appears to be at a low point following a disappointing May and a poor start to June. Without any buyers at current levels, the only option left for ADA is to trend lower until interest returns. For this reason, a drop to $0.55 appears likely. Chart by TradingView 3. Falling Volume The daily volume continues to make lower lows. As long as this trend continues, it is unlikely for this cryptocurrency to reverse course.

According to data from Yahoo Finance, SRM Entertainment’s stock, selling under the ticker SRM, recently reached new heights after Sun announced his blockchain company Tron ( TRX ) is set to go public in a reverse merger involving the Florida-based company. The SRM stock hit its highest peak by late June 16, reaching a high of 10.84, making the 10-fold leap from its initial 1.48 price just a day prior. Upon market close, SRM was still riding the high that followed after the Tron announcement made headlines, closing at 9.19. Compared to its previous close, at 1.45 on June 13, the theme park supplier saw a 533% increase. Not only that, but the trading volume multiplied from an initial 2.05 million in shares to 250 million in trading volume. In turn, Tron’s price also jumped to nearly $0.30 following the announcement. At press time, the token has gone up by nearly 2.5%, trading at a price of $0.28. Its current price stands 35% below its previous all-time high of $0.43 from December last year. This meteoric rise in the Nasdaq -listed SRM stock was mostly fueled by its recent $210 million-reverse merger with Justin Sun’s Tron. However, the merger also resulted in the company considering a complete name change and a new treasury strategy.

Additionally, the company elected Tron founder Justin Sun as an advisor for the Florida firm. It also declared that it has received a $100 million equity investment from a “private investor.” As previously reported by crypto.news, the merger was arranged by boutique investment bank Dominari Securities.

The 2025 HYPE price suggests it could enter the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap with continued growth. Forecasts suggest that HYPE could reach a potential average price by 2030 of around $125, with highs up to $185. The crypto market is buzzing with excitement over Hyperliquid and its native token, HYPE. As a decentralized, paperless alternative to platforms like Binance and Coinbase, Hyperliquid is quickly gaining traction, prompting investors to look closely at the HYPE price prediction for 2025 and beyond . With its unique “HyperBFT” consensus mechanism, lightning-fast transactions, and zero KYC hurdles, Hyperliquid is rewriting the rules of perpetual trading. But does its innovative model signal long-term growth for HYPE Token Price? In this article, we dive deep into market sentiment and Hyperliquid price projections from 2025 to 2030.

As per DUNE charts, it is seen that in trading volume, it sat just behind DyDx in trading volume, but in July and August 2024, the tide started to turn in HYPE’s favor. The derivatives volume crossed $197 billion in January 2025, and like dYdX and others, lost its spot, and even by April, the volume hovered near the same benchmark it set in January. However, the performance in May exceeded that of January as derivatives volume shot up by over $248 billion derivative volume. This shows that people are using the Hyperliquid a lot, and its adoption is increasing strongly. Moreover, compared to Binance, Hyperliquid highlights’s steady growth. The chart clearly shows that in 2025, in comparison to Binance losing spot trading volume, the Hyperliquid’s perpetual trading volume is continuously rising, as if people are exiting Binance and taking a ride on Hyperliquid’s platform. Apart from on-chain, the HYPE price on the daily chart is super optimistic. As it recently pumped a symmetrical triangle breakout, which cleared its $39 hurdle in May. Now, the successful breach has raised its price potential for a higher move ahead. Presently, its price is sustaining near the newly developed all-time high, but it appears that it will soon be testing the $50 psychological mark in June. Meanwhile, for the year-end 2025, the target is much higher and goes beyond $80. If the momentum continues, the price of HYPE will give maximum return, unlike any other altcoin. If it clears $50 in Q2 2025 with a significant move, then its price clearing $80 in upcoming Q3 and Q4 wouldn’t be much of a surprise, and it could become the top 10 crypto by market cap.

While sellers managed to hold back a breakout, this appears imminent if buyers continue the pressure. Once $2.3 turns into a support, then XRP has a good shot to revisit $2.6. Chart by TradingView 2. Momentum Turning Bullish Another sign that bulls are having the upper hand right now can be seen on the momentum indicators. The daily MACD and RSI are curving up with clear higher lows. If XRP moves beyond $2.3, then higher highs are likely. While this is promising, buyers need to break $2.3 to confirm this bias. Chart by TradingView 3. MACD Bullish Cross The daily MACD did a bullish cross today. This is a clear indication that this cryptocurrency wants to go higher.

Lehmann added that deployment of the zkEVM has never been upgraded to use blobs, and the chain is currently running at a loss of more than $1 million per year. The organization has revealed its plans to phase out Polygon zkEVM by 2026, marking the end of its zero-knowledge scaling efforts. The Ethereum side-chain also plans to pivot, focusing on the PoS and AggLayer with leadership from CEO Nailwal. Nailwal becomes CEO of Polygon Foundation Agglayer will usher in the next phase of the Internet : The Trustless Internet https://t.co/zFjR3LGzAF — Sandeep | CEO, Polygon Foundation (※,※) (@sandeepnailwal) June 16, 2025 Sandeep Nailwal, CEO and co-founder of Polygon Foundation, believe that with a healthy treasury and several hundred million in cash, Polygon is in a great position to keep building for the long term. Nailwal disclosed that Polygon PoS will focus on stablecoin payments and real-world assets (RWA) while AggLayer will continue in its efforts to build a trustless Internet of Blockchains. The foundation’s co-founder said the first milestone of the Polygon PoS’s Gigagas roadmap is live in testnet and will push network capacity beyond 1,000 transactions per second in early July, which is only the start. Nailwal disclosed that blockchain already plans to move to zero reorgs and 1-second finality with >5000 TPS achieved in a devnet environment. “I’ve always stayed away from moving into the CEO role because I’ve been focused on building PF as an institutionally governed foundation. But right now, Polygon needs clear direction and focused execution and that means stepping up.” – Sandeep Nailwal , CEO and Co-founder of Polygon Foundation. The firm believes the new upgrade will put Polygon PoS amongst the most performant blockchains by September to October. The company also said it has a clear path to scale to 100k+ TPS over the next few years. According to Nailwal, the upgrades increase the economic viability of the protocol and, thereby, the value of POL stakes. As part of the company’s plans for AggLayer, the CEO said that AggLayer v0.3, which has been in the pipeline for some time, will launch on June 30 with improved features. Nailwal added that the AggLayer v0.3 is complete except for its fast interop, which the company anticipates will be completed by the end of Q3. According to the organization, the AggLayer Breakout program will continue to spin off projects, resulting in an increased focus on Polygon PoS and Agglayer and massive airdrops to POL stakers. Nailwal also highlighted that the firm was in the business of building blockchain networks, and ZK is an important tool for bringing internet-level scalability to blockchains. Polygon hopes to spin out more zero-knowledge research efforts Polygon noted that it has contributed a lot to ZK and will continue to do so in a more neutral way by spinning out more of ZK’s research efforts. Nailwal unveiled the firm’s next project, Polygon Zisk, which will be led by Jordi Baylina. Polygon said it was excited to see several large market makers returning to the table recently to make markets in POL after the SEC dropped its investigations and lawsuits related to MATIC as a security. Nailwal added that the Foundation will also engage in educational campaigns to ensure everyone is aware of the upgrade of MATIC to POL. Nailwal noted that during 2021-22, the company tried to institutionalize the project by laying the foundation for scaling the blockchain through stages. Ethereum later got into an existential crisis that pulled Polygon and the entire Ethereum ecosystem right back to the initial stages. He revealed that POL has been dragging lower as Ethereum layer-2 solutions like Base and Arbitrum increase in TVL.

Constructing a Parallel Dollar Network: Reframing Payment Architecture While the U.S. dollar has long dominated cross-border payments, the existing system suffers from structural inefficiencies: high transaction costs, slow settlement times, strict regulatory oversight, and widespread financial exclusion. Against this backdrop, stablecoins offer a permissionless, highly liquid, near-instant payment alternative underpinned by blockchain technology and pegged to the dollar. Key advantages include: Instant settlement and real-time clearance enabled by blockchain’s unified transaction structure; Borderless circulation that only requires wallet access and internet connectivity; Integration with multi-chain ecosystems and payment APIs , with tokens like USDT and USDC now deployed across Ethereum, Tron, and Solana; Functioning simultaneously as settlement assets and stores of value , particularly useful in high-inflation economies where they increasingly substitute for local fiat. In effect, stablecoins are forming a more efficient, inclusive, and censorship-resistant on-chain dollar network. Use cases are rapidly expanding — from individual remittances in Latin America, where residents rely on USDT amid currency devaluation, to SME trade settlements in FX-restricted countries. These networks dramatically enhance the efficiency of cross-border payments, digital commerce, and Web3 transactions, while also offering dollar-based financial access to the world’s 1.3 billion unbanked. More Than Payment Tools: Stablecoins’ Role as “On-Chain Shadow Banks” Despite their technical and economic advantages, stablecoins face regulatory, liquidity, and privacy challenges. Their disintermediating nature also raises strategic concerns among central banks and legacy payment networks. Meanwhile, stablecoins are increasingly performing the role of “shadow banks”— effectively acting as on-chain money market funds by transforming fiat deposits into short-term Treasuries while minting on-chain tokens. This architecture enables stablecoins to scale U.S. dollar liquidity across decentralized ecosystems, but it also challenges the traditional monopoly central banks hold over credit creation and monetary issuance. The lack of globally harmonized regulation raises risks related to transparency, systemic liquidity, and user trust. Regulatory Convergence Driving Institutionalization of Stablecoins The growing role of stablecoins in cross-border payments has prompted heightened regulatory attention worldwide. While mature markets such as the U.S. and EU are developing frameworks emphasizing compliance, capital adequacy, and reserve transparency, Asian jurisdictions are exploring hybrid approaches that balance innovation with oversight. HTX Ventures emphasizes that the regulatory certainty and technological neutrality of stablecoins will be decisive in determining whether they can serve as the “dollar infrastructure of the digital age.” Clear policy coordination and cross-border regulatory harmonization will be essential to unlocking their full potential in global finance. HTX Expands Stablecoin Ecosystem, Accelerates Global Payment Strategy As an exchange advocate for stablecoin adoption, HTX is actively expanding its stablecoin offering to fortify its position within the global crypto ecosystem. Since May, HTX has listed six new stablecoins: USD1, EURR, USDR, EURQ, USDQ, and AETHUSDT . Among them, USD1 , issued by World Liberty Financial — an initiative linked to the Trump family — has garnered particular attention amid the evolving U.S. regulatory landscape. HTX was the first platform globally to list USD1 and has expanded its support for BTC/USD1 and ETH/USD1 trading pairs to further enrich its ecosystem. These new listings enhance users’ flexibility in managing assets across multiple chains and currencies, while unlocking new use cases in high-frequency trading, on-chain hedging, and programmable payments. The initiative reflects HTX’s strategic vision to support a robust, multi-rail global stablecoin infrastructure.

The announcement was made in a June 17 press release by the Paris-listed firm (Euronext: ALTBG.PA), which is pursuing a long-term strategy of increasing the amount of Bitcoin ( BTC ) per share it holds. The funding was secured through an “At-The-Market type” capital raise with asset manager TOBAM, where 1.6 million new shares were issued at an average price of €4.49. That price reflected a 20.76% discount from the stock’s June 13 close, due to market volatility during the raise. The capital raise allows The Blockchain Group to continue adding BTC to its balance sheet, as part of a broader treasury strategy that started in late 2024. https://twitter.com/_altbg/status/1934854391451775360?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw You might also like: Michael Saylor’s Strategy strengthens Bitcoin bet with 10,100 BTC purchase This strategy mirrors capital market moves made by firms like Strategy and Japan’s Metaplanet, both of which hold significant amounts of Bitcoin. The Blockchain Group is one of the first in Europe to follow this path, aiming to accumulate up to 260,000 BTC, currently about $24 billion, by 2033. The recent capital raise saw TOBAM, through three of its funds, subscribe to all 1.6 million shares. The largest tranche went to the TOBAM Bitcoin CO2 Offset Fund, which acquired over 834,000 shares. The other two funds, the Bitcoin Treasury Opportunities Fund and the Blockchain Equity Fund, took the remaining portion. As a result, TOBAM now holds 3.3% of The Blockchain Group’s capital on a fully diluted basis. The capital raise follows a shareholder vote on June 11 that increased the company’s fundraising capacity to €500 million in nominal value. That resolution passed with over 95% approval, underlining strong investor support for the Bitcoin pivot. On a fully diluted basis, the company’s share count now exceeds 313 million, factoring in all potential conversions from bonds, free share grants, and warrants. The Blockchain Group’s model draws on the idea that Bitcoin is a long-term hedge against inflation and fiat currency risks. The company, which also develops decentralized tech, AI, and data tools, believes BTC can protect shareholder value and offer stronger returns than traditional treasury reserves.

With no major policy shifts expected, traders are watching closely for signals on rate cuts, inflation trends, and macro risks. The crypto market, already tense from recent volatility, is showing mixed performance with XRP leading gains among major tokens. Bitcoin Wobbles Amid Geopolitical Tensions Bitcoin briefly topped $108,000 in early U.S. hours on Monday before sliding to $106,500 on profit-taking. It later bounced back above $107,000 during Asian trading on Tuesday. The movement follows Friday’s $1.2 billion in futures liquidations, which forced out overleveraged traders and weighed heavily on altcoins through the weekend. Despite the choppy action, Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $1.4 billion in net inflows last week, reinforcing their growing role as stabilizers during volatile periods. Analysts suggest Bitcoin’s slow response to macroeconomic stress could change if investors seek alternative safe-haven assets. “Bitcoin typically lags behind gold and oil during geopolitical events, but if risk sentiment turns, BTC could quickly regain momentum,” said Eugene Cheung of OSL . XRP Takes the Lead as Altcoins Recover While most major altcoins are still recovering from the weekend drawdown, XRP stood out with a strong rebound. XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, is trading at $2.17 with a 0.77% daily gain, backed by a $128.23 billion market cap and $1.74 billion in volume. It continues to hold a strong position, supported by growing interest in institutional banking integration. Ethereum ticked up 1.5% to $2,609 but continued to trail Bitcoin’s ETF-fueled performance. Solana and Tron also posted modest gains, but sentiment across altcoins remains cautious. Meanwhile, Gold and oil surged early Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump unexpectedly urged the evacuation of Tehran during the G7 summit. The geopolitical jolt sent investors rushing into defensive assets, while Bitcoin’s response remained subdued. XRP Outperformed Bitcoin This Cycle, Says Analyst Crypto analyst Nick pointed out that XRP has gained more than 678% since its 2022 low, beating Bitcoin’s 565% rise. He added that XRP’s total gains this cycle have already topped 1,000%, and the rally isn’t over yet. According to him, XRP has outpaced both Bitcoin and Ethereum in this bull run so far. Fed Holds the Spotlight All eyes are now on the Fed. Market watchers expect interest rates to remain unchanged, but the tone of Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks could set the course for crypto and equities alike. With inflation easing and jobs data holding firm, officials may opt for patience, though some, like SignalPlus’ Augustine Fan, believe a dovish tilt could be signaled subtly. The near-term outlook remains tied to the Fed’s message and the unfolding tensions in the Middle East. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Recently, a substantial SOL transfer has put the spotlight back on the remnants of the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange, FTX. Specifically, approximately 252,847 SOL tokens, valued at a staggering $39.72 million based on recent prices, were moved from Coinbase Prime to an FTX cold wallet . This significant transaction, first highlighted by blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain on X, raises questions and provides insights into the ongoing process surrounding the FTX bankruptcy . Unpacking the Specifics of the SOL Transfer Let’s break down the details of this particular SOL transfer that occurred roughly 11 hours before the initial report. Understanding the specifics helps us grasp the potential implications: Asset: Solana (SOL) Amount: 252,847 SOL Approximate Value: $39.72 million (at the time of the transfer) Source: Coinbase Prime Destination: FTX Cold Wallet Timing: Approximately 11 hours prior to the Lookonchain report Source of Information: Lookonchain (via X) This movement isn’t just a simple transfer; it involves significant entities in the crypto space. Coinbase Prime is known for serving institutional clients, suggesting the assets were likely held there on behalf of the FTX estate or related parties. The destination, an FTX cold wallet , points towards a deliberate move for secure storage, likely as part of the asset consolidation efforts managed by those overseeing the bankruptcy. Why an FTX Cold Wallet? Understanding Asset Management in Bankruptcy The fact that the destination was an FTX cold wallet is highly significant, especially in the context of the exchange’s insolvency. But what exactly is a cold wallet, and why is FTX using them now? A cold wallet is a type of cryptocurrency wallet that is not connected to the internet. This offline nature makes them far less susceptible to online hacking attempts, offering a high level of security for storing digital assets. For an entity like FTX, which collapsed spectacularly amidst allegations of mismanagement and fraud, securing remaining assets is paramount. In the midst of the FTX bankruptcy proceedings, the priority is to identify, recover, and secure all available assets to eventually distribute them to creditors. Large holdings of cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) represent a substantial portion of the estate’s value. Moving these assets into secure, offline cold storage is a standard, prudent measure taken by bankruptcy administrators and liquidators to prevent further loss or theft while the complex process of asset valuation and distribution unfolds. Think of it like a company going bankrupt and consolidating all its valuable physical inventory into a highly secure warehouse. The digital equivalent for crypto assets is moving them into cold wallets. Solana (SOL) and its Complex Relationship with FTX The choice of asset in this large transfer – Solana (SOL) – is particularly noteworthy given the historical ties between the Solana ecosystem and FTX/Alameda Research. Sam Bankman-Fried’s entities were significant early investors and proponents of Solana. As a result, FTX and Alameda held substantial amounts of SOL tokens. This close relationship meant that when FTX collapsed, the fate of its large SOL holdings became a major point of discussion and concern within the crypto market. The Solana (SOL) price has shown resilience and significant recovery since the FTX collapse, but the potential for large sales from the FTX estate has always loomed as a supply-side risk. Movements like this SOL transfer are often interpreted by the market as steps taken by the bankruptcy estate to prepare assets for potential future liquidation or distribution. Key points regarding FTX’s SOL holdings: FTX/Alameda were early and large holders of SOL. These holdings are a significant asset for the bankruptcy estate. The release or sale of these tokens is part of the creditor repayment plan. Movements to cold wallets are often precursors to more active management or potential sales. While a transfer to a cold wallet doesn’t automatically mean an immediate sale, it signifies that the assets are being actively managed and secured as part of the ongoing resolution process for the FTX bankruptcy . Navigating the FTX Bankruptcy Process The FTX bankruptcy is one of the most complex in cryptocurrency history. It involves multiple entities, millions of creditors, and a vast, sometimes difficult-to-trace, pool of digital assets spread across various platforms and wallets. The process is overseen by court-appointed administrators (like the new management team led by John J. Ray III) and involves legal proceedings in multiple jurisdictions. The primary goal of the bankruptcy process is to maximize the value of the remaining assets and distribute them equitably among validated creditors. This involves: Asset Identification and Recovery: Finding and taking control of all assets belonging to FTX and Alameda. Asset Consolidation and Security: Moving recovered assets to secure locations, like the FTX cold wallet in this instance. Asset Valuation: Determining the current market value of the recovered assets. Claim Adjudication: Reviewing and validating creditor claims. Asset Liquidation/Distribution: Selling assets (like SOL) or distributing them in kind to creditors according to a court-approved plan. This recent SOL transfer fits squarely into steps 1 and 2 – the recovery and consolidation of assets. It indicates that the administrators are continuing to gather and secure the estate’s holdings, preparing them for later stages of the bankruptcy process. It’s a necessary, albeit often market-moving, step towards resolving the claims against the defunct exchange. Why This is Crucial Cryptocurrency News Movements of this magnitude by the FTX estate are always significant cryptocurrency news . Here’s why: Market Impact: Large transfers from known bankruptcy estates can signal potential future selling pressure, which can influence market sentiment and price predictions for the affected asset (in this case, Solana (SOL) ). Transparency: Blockchain explorers provide transparency into these movements, allowing the public and market participants to track the actions of the FTX estate. This contrasts with the opacity that characterized FTX’s operations before its collapse. Bankruptcy Progress Indicator: These transfers serve as milestones, indicating that the FTX bankruptcy process is actively moving forward, albeit slowly. It shows assets are being managed and secured. Creditor Confidence: For creditors awaiting repayment, seeing assets being consolidated and secured in an FTX cold wallet can offer a degree of reassurance that the recovery process is progressing. Staying informed about such developments is vital for anyone involved in the crypto market, whether as an investor, trader, or simply an observer of the industry’s evolution and challenges. This cryptocurrency news highlights the ongoing efforts to clean up the aftermath of one of the largest failures in crypto history. Potential Implications and What to Watch For While the immediate impact of moving SOL to a cold wallet is increased security, the market often interprets such moves as preparation for potential sales. The FTX estate has received court approval to sell assets over time to repay creditors, with limits and procedures in place to manage market impact. What should you watch for next? Further Transfers: Will more SOL or other assets be consolidated? Transfers to Exchanges: Movements from cold wallets to exchanges would be a stronger signal of impending sales. Official Announcements: The FTX estate may provide updates on its asset management and distribution plans. Market Reaction: Observe how the Solana (SOL) price reacts to future confirmed movements or sales by the estate. The process of liquidating or distributing assets from a bankruptcy estate is complex and often involves strategic timing to minimize negative market impact. However, the sheer volume of assets held by FTX means any significant action will likely be closely scrutinized and discussed as major cryptocurrency news . Conclusion: A Step in the Long Road to Resolution The transfer of $39.72 million worth of Solana (SOL) to an FTX cold wallet from Coinbase Prime is more than just a large transaction; it’s a visible step in the painstaking and prolonged FTX bankruptcy process. It underscores the ongoing efforts by administrators to secure assets and prepare them for eventual distribution to those harmed by the exchange’s collapse. For followers of cryptocurrency news , this movement serves as a reminder that the aftermath of FTX continues to unfold, with significant implications for assets like Solana (SOL) and the broader market landscape. While not necessarily signaling immediate sales, it confirms that the estate is actively managing its substantial holdings as it works towards a resolution for creditors.

33767162,[object Object],1750147243,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Bitcoin Riding Global Liquidity Wave? Analyst Eyes $150,000 Target",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-riding-global-liquidity-wave-analyst-eyes-150000-target/,"Crypto analysts are predicting that Bitcoin (BTC) may be poised for a significant move to the upside as it tracks the expansion of global liquidity. Several experts anticipate that the top cryptocurrency could post new all-time highs (ATHs) in the near to medium term. Is Bitcoin Tracking Expansion In Global Liquidity? According to a recent X post by crypto analyst Jelle, BTC appears to be following the trajectory of rising global liquidity. The analyst shared the following chart suggesting that Bitcoin is on track to reach a new ATH of $150,000 in the coming months. A similar perspective was offered by fellow crypto analyst Master of Crypto. The analyst provided a more detailed explanation of how BTC is aligning with movements in the global M2 money supply. For the uninitiated, global M2 money supply refers to the total amount of money – including cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money – circulating across major economies. It is often used as an indicator of global liquidity, with increases typically supporting asset price growth, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Master of Crypto shared the following chart comparing BTC’s price with movements in global M2 money supply, using a 76-day lag. He noted that this time-offset metric has historically offered more accurate long-term signals, and correlates with Bitcoin’s price at a rate of 76%. In related analysis, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader drew comparisons between gold’s price pattern and that of BTC. He shared the following chart indicating that Bitcoin is mirroring gold’s cup and handle pattern, which often signals continued price appreciation. To explain, the cup and handle pattern is a bullish formation that resembles a rounded “cup” followed by a brief consolidation or “handle” before a breakout. It typically indicates a continuation of the existing uptrend, often leading to new highs. Meanwhile, noted analyst Titan of Crypto pointed out a golden cross formation on the daily BTC chart. The last time this pattern appeared – back in April 2025 – BTC experienced a parabolic rise, ultimately hitting an ATH of $111,682. More Room To Run For BTC Several on-chain and macro indicators suggest that BTC may still have more upside in this cycle, especially when compared to previous rallies. Notably, the current market lacks widespread retail investor participation, implying that the rally has yet to enter a euphoric phase. Similarly, the Puell Multiple continues to signal that the bull run is intact. However, a recent spike in miner-to-exchange transfers has raised concerns about a potential sell-off.

Presale crypto tokens are evolving fast, and 2025 is packed with new opportunities. But not all token presales offer real value. Many come with hype, but few deliver utility. That’s where Angry Pepe Fork stands out. It doesn’t just ride meme coin momentum. It adds layers of utility that early investors demand. In a market flooded with crypto coins on presale, Angry Pepe Fork brings staking, CommunityFi, and GambleFi to the table. It’s already raised $240k in just a few days. That kind of traction signals it may be the best crypto presale to buy right now for long-term rewards and real engagement. Angry Pepe Fork Builds a Utility Meme Ecosystem Angry Pepe Fork ($APORK) is not just about memes. It’s designed as a utility-focused token with a viral edge. The project launched its presale with strong fundamentals and a clear plan. Already, it has raised over $240k with each $APORK token priced at just $0.0269. That early momentum positions it well among the top crypto presales of 2025. The ecosystem combines several income streams for users. One of the biggest attractions is staking during the presale. Ethereum buyers can earn over 10,000% APY just for getting in early. The longer you wait, the lower your returns. $APORK also introduces GambleFi—a suite of play-to-earn mini-games powered by smart contracts. Players use their tokens to enter, and winners receive $APORK payouts. To maintain token value, a portion of each prize pool is burned after payout, supporting long-term price appreciation. With support for Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Solana, Angry Pepe Fork is accessible and ready to scale. Add exclusive contribution-based rewards, and you’ve got a serious player in the pre-sale cryptocurrency market. If you’re looking to buy presale crypto with real mechanics, this project stands out in every crypto presale list. Angry Pepe Fork CommunityFi Turns Action Into Rewards Angry Pepe Fork introduces CommunityFi—an innovation few crypto presale projects offer. This system rewards every action that brings attention to the project. You don’t need deep pockets to earn. Instead, you contribute to the community and get paid in $APORK tokens. It works like this. Spread the word on social media, post memes, or just engage in discussions. Each activity earns you rewards based on your level of involvement. This makes Angry Pepe Fork more inclusive than most new crypto token presales. It’s not just about early investment. CommunityFi ensures that anyone can support the project and grow with it. That feedback loop brings more exposure and strengthens the value of the entire ecosystem. Even if you’re not buying huge amounts of tokens, you can still benefit and earn. Combined with staking and GambleFi, CommunityFi makes Angry Pepe Fork a well-rounded project. Every part feeds into another. The more the community participates, the stronger the ecosystem becomes. That’s what makes this project a standout among crypto coins on presale. With CommunityFi, Angry Pepe Fork is not just a presale token—it’s a platform where action drives value and everyone has a role to play. Final Words: Angry Pepe Fork Tops Token Presales List Angry Pepe Fork is leading the charge in 2025’s presale crypto market. With high APY staking, real rewards through CommunityFi, and a GambleFi play-to-earn model, it’s more than a meme; it’s a movement. This token doesn’t rely on hype. It creates value through activity, rewards, and smart tokenomics. If you’re looking through today’s crypto ICO presale options for true innovation, Angry Pepe Fork is the best crypto presale to buy right now. Add it to your token presales list before the next stage kicks in.

46194173,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=335023,1750147261,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/dailyhodl.png,Avail Goes Full Stack to Capture $300bn Global Blockchain Infra Market,https://dailyhodl.com/2025/06/17/avail-goes-full-stack-to-capture-300bn-global-blockchain-infra-market/,"June 17th, 2025 – Dubai, UAE The only stack that delivers horizontal scalability, crosschain connectivity, and unified liquidity, without compromising on decentralization. Avail , backed by Founders Fund, Dragonfly, and other top VCs, is powering some of Web3’s most forward-looking projects, including Lens, Sophon, Space & Time, Lumia, Skate, and leading institutional tokenization platforms. The rollout of the full Avail Stack enables seamless connections between chains to build a scalable and interoperable blockchain in the future. Avail is focused on building an interconnected Web3 that allows networks to move assets and communicate while abstracting away user complexities to create a unified in-app experience. The Avail Stack, a full-scale blockchain infrastructure solution, comprises Avail Nexus, Avail Fusion and Avail DA as well as a suite of products and functionality upgrades, including Turbo DA, Enigma DA upgrade, Light Clients, catering to a range of audiences; both Web3 native startups and traditional Web2 giants. Blockchain Infrastructure: A $300B Market According to Grand View Research , the global blockchain market is projected to grow from $31.3 billion in 2024 to $1.43 trillion by 2030, with infrastructure alone expected to reach $306 billion , driven by modularity, institutional demand, scalable tech, and tokenization. When Avail launched its purpose-built data availability (DA) layer on mainnet in July 2024, it set out to revamp the concept of blockchain scalability. The founding team was clear in its vision of broadening the scope of functionality so that blockchain could reach mass adoption. As Ethereum doubled down on its rollup-centric roadmap, the limitations of the current blockchain models became clear; bridges were brittle, liquidity fragmented, and developers faced friction rewriting logic across chains. Innovation slowed, and VC investment declined, as noted in S&P Global’s 2024 report . Despite market headwinds, Avail raised $75 million in 2024 from top investors under the leadership of Anurag Arjun (former Polygon co-founder) and Prabal Banerjee (former Polygon research lead), to build their vision of how blockchain experiences should be. The Avail Stack The Avail Stack comprises Avail DA for scalable, verifiable data availability, including Turbo DA , Enigma Upgrade , Avail Light Clients , and Avail’s 10 GB Infinity Blocks . Avail supports any execution environment with native ZK verification on the base layer. However, the most powerful upgrade is Avail Nexus. The Avail Nexus upgrade is a permissionless crosschain layer enabling connectivity between different chains. Avail Nexus unlocks liquidity and user access with a seamless in-app experience across multiple ecosystems, enabling a true crosschain economy. No network switches, no bridges, no leaving the app. Nexus fully abstracts convoluted flows and back-end processes, delivering a simplified, intuitive experience. With Nexus, the typical 12+ click, crosschain process is reduced to just a couple of simple approvals, all behind the scenes, allowing users to stay in the app. If one chain in the Avail Stack has access to key infrastructure, for example, Uniswap or Aave, every other connected chain can use it too, without needing to redeploy it. This borrowed infrastructure model allows new chains to bootstrap with shared liquidity and shared apps, accelerating ecosystem growth. For developers, Nexus unlocks a powerful new era of multichain applications that coordinate state and logic across environments without replicating contracts. Connectors for EVM, ZK, Optimistic, and sovereign chains make integration seamless for any environment. To complement this is the Avail Fusion upgrade that creates a diverse security model. Apps gain access to pooled crypto-economic security while maintaining decentralization. “With Avail, we were clear that developers no longer rebuild core infrastructure per chain. We wanted to give one integration that connects logic, assets, and users across all ecosystems. This is the foundation of Avail’s horizontal scalability vision: modular infrastructure, interoperable chains, and unified UX.” – Prabal Banerjee, co?founder, Avail. Confidence in Avail’s capability is reflected in the top-tier integrations. Lens Protocol, with over 650K user profiles and 28M+ social connections, launched Lens Chain using Avail DA. Sophon, a zk-validium, raised $60M in a node sale supported via Avail Light Clients. Space & Time, which has partnered with Microsoft and Google Cloud BigQuery, will use Avail to anchor ZK query proofs. Leading players in tokenization and RWAs like Lumia and rootVX are on the Avail testnet. Other projects powered by Avail include Rooch, Odysphere, and Eternal, with 50 more partnerships in the pipeline. “We built Avail for a world where new chains can launch fast, can communicate and scale instantly. That’s the promise of horizontal scalability, and it’s how blockchain technology can reach population scale.” – Anurag Arjun, co-founder, Avail. Avail is building the foundation for a crosschain economy, shared liquidity, and composability, all while staying true to the core principles of decentralization and permissionlessness. About Avail Avail is designed to connect and scale blockchains with the Avail Stack. Avail Nexus connects and powers crosschain messaging. Avail DA foundation powers horizontal scalability with its 10GB infinity blocks roadmap and functionality upgrades, while Avail Fusion will enable crypto-economic security for the Avail economy.

The report shows a historic volatility divergence between Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) during May 2025. Key Highlights: In May 2025 , ETH options exhibited historically high volatility premiums over BTC, driven by ETH’s elevated realized volatility during a major price rally. The ETH-to-BTC implied volatility ratio for short-dated options surged past 2x — reaching a nearly five-year high. BTC’s realized volatility fell below a long-standing 35% floor, breaking a 19-month trend. ETH’s volatility term structure showed persistent inversion, with shorter-dated options pricing higher volatility than longer-dated ones. The implied volatility divergence coincided with ETH’s outperformance, which included a 23% intraday rally amid key market events. ETH-to-BTC Implied Volatility Expands to Five-Year High In May 2025 , a notable dislocation in implied volatility emerged between ETH and BTC options. Implied volatility reflects market expectations for future price movement over an option’s lifespan. At the start of the month, the ETH-to-BTC implied volatility ratio for 7-day options hovered around 1.5 — indicating that ETH options were priced with 50% higher expected volatility than BTC options. By May 16 , the ratio climbed above 2x, reaching a peak not seen since 2020, as BTC’s implied volatility declined to its lowest levels since October 2023 . This drop in BTC volatility broke below the 35% floor that had held for over 19 months, while ETH’s short-tenor implied volatility remained elevated, though slightly below its May 10 high. The volatility spread was particularly pronounced in the 30-day tenor, reaching its widest point since mid-2022. Realized Volatility Trends Underscore the Divergence The sharp divergence in implied volatility was reinforced by trends in realized volatility — a measure of actual historical price movement. In May, ETH’s realized volatility significantly outpaced BTC’s across various tenors, fueling expectations for continued dispersion between the two assets. On May 15 , the 7-day realized volatility ratio between ETH and BTC peaked, closely followed by the implied volatility ratio — suggesting market participants expected ETH’s higher volatility to persist. This trend is not new: the ETH-BTC volatility ratio has been climbing steadily since July 2024 , amid both bull runs and periods of market stress. ETH’s standout performance in May was catalyzed by several factors, including positive US-UK trade news. ETH surged more than 23% on May 8 alone and continued to outperform BTC, which gained approximately 10% during the same period. Despite this momentum, ETH remained over 50% below its January 2025 peak and its all-time high. #Bybit / #TheCryptoArk / #BybitReport About Bybit Bybit is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 70 million users.

Avail , backed by Founders Fund, Dragonfly, and other top VCs, is powering some of Web3’s most forward-looking projects, including Lens, Sophon, Space & Time, Lumia, Skate, and leading institutional tokenization platforms. The rollout of the full Avail Stack enables seamless connections between chains to build a scalable and interoperable blockchain in the future. Avail is focused on building an interconnected Web3 that allows networks to move assets and communicate while abstracting away user complexities to create a unified in-app experience. The Avail Stack, a full-scale blockchain infrastructure solution, comprises Avail Nexus, Avail Fusion and Avail DA as well as a suite of products and functionality upgrades, including Turbo DA, Enigma DA upgrade, Light Clients, catering to a range of audiences; both Web3 native startups and traditional Web2 giants. Blockchain Infrastructure: A $300B Market According to Grand View Research , the global blockchain market is projected to grow from $31.3 billion in 2024 to $1.43 trillion by 2030, with infrastructure alone expected to reach $306 billion , driven by modularity, institutional demand, scalable tech, and tokenization. When Avail launched its purpose-built data availability (DA) layer on mainnet in July 2024, it set out to revamp the concept of blockchain scalability. The founding team was clear in its vision of broadening the scope of functionality so that blockchain could reach mass adoption. As Ethereum doubled down on its rollup-centric roadmap, the limitations of the current blockchain models became clear; bridges were brittle, liquidity fragmented, and developers faced friction rewriting logic across chains. Innovation slowed, and VC investment declined, as noted in S&P Global’s 2024 report . Despite market headwinds, Avail raised $75 million in 2024 from top investors under the leadership of Anurag Arjun (former Polygon co-founder) and Prabal Banerjee (former Polygon research lead), to build their vision of how blockchain experiences should be. The Avail Stack The Avail Stack comprises Avail DA for scalable, verifiable data availability, including Turbo DA , Enigma Upgrade , Avail Light Clients , and Avail’s 10 GB Infinity Blocks . Avail supports any execution environment with native ZK verification on the base layer. However, the most powerful upgrade is Avail Nexus. The Avail Nexus upgrade is a permissionless crosschain layer enabling connectivity between different chains. Avail Nexus unlocks liquidity and user access with a seamless in-app experience across multiple ecosystems, enabling a true crosschain economy. No network switches, no bridges, no leaving the app. Nexus fully abstracts convoluted flows and back-end processes, delivering a simplified, intuitive experience. With Nexus, the typical 12+ click, crosschain process is reduced to just a couple of simple approvals, all behind the scenes, allowing users to stay in the app. If one chain in the Avail Stack has access to key infrastructure, for example, Uniswap or Aave, every other connected chain can use it too, without needing to redeploy it. This borrowed infrastructure model allows new chains to bootstrap with shared liquidity and shared apps, accelerating ecosystem growth. For developers, Nexus unlocks a powerful new era of multichain applications that coordinate state and logic across environments without replicating contracts. Connectors for EVM, ZK, Optimistic, and sovereign chains make integration seamless for any environment. To complement this is the Avail Fusion upgrade that creates a diverse security model. Apps gain access to pooled crypto-economic security while maintaining decentralization. “With Avail, we were clear that developers no longer rebuild core infrastructure per chain. We wanted to give one integration that connects logic, assets, and users across all ecosystems. This is the foundation of Avail’s horizontal scalability vision: modular infrastructure, interoperable chains, and unified UX.” - Prabal Banerjee, co‑founder, Avail. Confidence in Avail’s capability is reflected in the top-tier integrations. Lens Protocol, with over 650K user profiles and 28M+ social connections, launched Lens Chain using Avail DA. Sophon, a zk-validium, raised $60M in a node sale supported via Avail Light Clients. Space & Time, which has partnered with Microsoft and Google Cloud BigQuery, will use Avail to anchor ZK query proofs. Leading players in tokenization and RWAs like Lumia and rootVX are on the Avail testnet. Other projects powered by Avail include Rooch, Odysphere, and Eternal, with 50 more partnerships in the pipeline. “We built Avail for a world where new chains can launch fast, can communicate and scale instantly. That’s the promise of horizontal scalability, and it’s how blockchain technology can reach population scale.” - Anurag Arjun, co-founder, Avail. Avail is building the foundation for a crosschain economy, shared liquidity, and composability, all while staying true to the core principles of decentralization and permissionlessness. About Avail Avail is designed to connect and scale blockchains with the Avail Stack. Avail Nexus connects and powers crosschain messaging. Avail DA foundation powers horizontal scalability with its 10GB infinity blocks roadmap and functionality upgrades, while Avail Fusion will enable crypto-economic security for the Avail economy. With Avail Stack, developers get a future-proof foundation where apps and assets move freely across chains.

Brent crude futures climbed 34 cents, or 0.5%, to $73.57 a barrel by 3:40 UTC. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude added 29 cents, or 0.4%, to $72.06. Earlier in the session, both benchmarks had gained more than 2%, according to Reuters . On Monday, oil prices fell by more than 1% after reports said Iran wanted to end the fighting. However, worries returned when U.S. President Donald Trump urged all residents to leave Tehran, accusing Iran’s government of rejecting a deal to curb its nuclear work. “Everyone should evacuate Tehran,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social , tying his warning to what he called Iran’s refusal to agree to nuclear limits. At the Group of Seven summit in Canada, leaders urged both sides to calm down. They branded Iran a source of regional instability, said it must never gain a nuclear weapon, and affirmed Israel’s right to defend itself. French President Emmanuel Macron had suggested the U.S. put forward a ceasefire plan, but Trump denied that in another Truth Social post . “Wrong! … it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that.” As the war entered its fifth day on Tuesday, Iranian outlets reported blasts and intense air-defense activity in Tehran. In Israel, air raid sirens wailed in Tel Aviv in response to Iranian missile launches. Traders stay focused on Iran-Israel tensions Priyanka Sachdeva, a senior market analyst at Phillip Nova, emailed Reuters to say that the conflict is weighing on investor sentiment, with traders mindful of war risks. She also said that “added volatility and caution ahead of the Fed policy decision are further ensuring higher-paced price reactions in oil.” The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which guides interest-rate choices, starts Tuesday. It will wrap up on Wednesday with a rate decision watched by markets. Iran is OPEC’s third-largest oil producer. Traders worry the fighting could cut its output and drive prices up. OPEC has warned that a supply shock could have global effects. Late Monday, U.S. outlets reported that Trump was proposing new talks with Iran over a nuclear pact. At the same time, other reports of a shipping incident in the Gulf of Oman underlined the risks for companies moving oil and fuel through the region.

This scheme was designed to legitimize stolen funds through a seemingly legitimate real-world asset tokenization platform. The investigation reveals direct on-chain connections between WhiteRock’s marketing wallets, ZKasino’s stolen presale funds, and a personal email address that ties key team members from both projects together. 1/ Community Alert: At least one team member from the $30M Zkasino exit scam appears to be involved with the project @WhiteRock_Fi $WHITE due to onchain transactions linking both projects and a personal email address. pic.twitter.com/rZSvLM98fR — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) June 16, 2025 What is ZKasino? The ZKasino scandal originally erupted in April 2024 when the blockchain gambling project abruptly diverted $33 million worth of investor funds to Lido’s staking protocol instead of returning them as promised to presale participants. The scheme led to the arrest of team member Elham Nourzai by Dutch financial crime authorities, while alleged co-conspirators Ildar Ilham and Lior Ben Zakan reportedly fled to the Middle East. Following Nourzai’s release in late 2024, the stolen funds began moving through a sophisticated laundering network that employed chain-hopping across ZkSync, Starknet, EVM, and Solana networks. Proceeds were converted to Monero through instant exchanges, cashed out via OTC brokers, and traded on perpetual platforms like Hyperliquid. ZachXBT’s investigation reveals that WhiteRock emerged in late 2024 with immediate red flags, including an anonymous team without verifiable history, fabricated partnership claims, and funding sources linked to instant exchanges commonly used for money laundering. 4/ WhiteRock (WHITE) appeared late last year and a number of large red flags were immediately observed. -anon team w/o history -team called out for faking partnerships -team has many side wallets all funded via instant exchanges -team exaggerates number of users -USDX backing… https://t.co/e9DhRNzT1T pic.twitter.com/CC8olsxFvi — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) June 16, 2025 The investigator traced funds from ZKasino’s stolen treasury directly to WhiteRock’s marketing wallet, which was subsequently used to pay influencers for promotional content. Most damning, ZachXBT discovered that a personal email address associated with WhiteRock’s deployer wallet belongs to an account named “IldarTheGrandMaster” on Chess.com. This directly links the project to Ildar Ilham, one of ZKasino’s alleged masterminds, who operates under the alias “Prometheus.” From Presale Scam to RWA Revolution: The ZKasino Money Laundering Scheme The ZKasino exit scam represents one of the most brazen betrayals of investor trust in recent crypto history. It began as a promising blockchain gambling platform that raised over $30 million through presales before revealing its true nature. The project initially promised participants that their bridged Ethereum would be returnable, but when launch day arrived on April 20, 2024, ZKasino dramatically altered the terms. Instead of honoring withdrawal requests, the team converted all 10,515 ETH to ZKAS tokens at a heavily discounted rate of $0.055, subject to a punitive 15-month vesting schedule that effectively trapped investor funds. The deception deepened when investigators discovered that ZKasino’s supposed revolutionary blockchain was merely an Arbitrum Nitro chain lacking the zero-knowledge technology that formed the core of its marketing promises. Following the collapse and subsequent arrests, the stolen funds underwent sophisticated laundering through multiple blockchain networks and financial instruments. This multi-vector laundering strategy, explained by ZachXBT, mirrors tactics seen in other major crypto crimes. Australian authorities have charged four individuals over a scheme that allegedly laundered $123 million through businesses and crypto. #Australia #aml https://t.co/uV1errA8TV — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 9, 2025 Recent cases include Australian authorities uncovering a $190 million laundering network that mixed illicit crypto with legitimate business income and European investigations into OKX’s alleged role in laundering $100 million from the Bybit hack. How Stolen Millions Funded WhiteRock’s Success Story WhiteRock, launched on December 24, 2024 , positioned itself as a revolutionary platform that would bring traditional markets onto the blockchain. The platform quickly gained traction by promising to democratize access to traditionally exclusive wealth-building opportunities through its native WHITE token and USDX stablecoin.

In a move that has surprised many in the crypto community, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs have jointly requested that the court pause the ongoing appeal process. This isn’t a full stop, but a significant pause, and it’s happening because of a mutual agreement tied to a pending motion for an indicative ruling. The update was shared by defense attorney and former federal prosecutor James K. Filan on X (formerly Twitter), a reliable source for information regarding the XRP lawsuit . He noted that the SEC is expected to file a status report by August 15, 2025, giving us a potential timeline for when we might hear more concrete developments following this pause. Understanding the SEC Ripple Lawsuit Background Before diving into the significance of this pause, let’s quickly recap the history of the SEC Ripple case. Filed in December 2020, the lawsuit alleged that Ripple, its CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP tokens. Ripple has consistently argued that XRP is not a security. The case has been closely watched because its outcome has major implications not just for Ripple and XRP, but for the broader landscape of US crypto regulation . A key moment came in July 2023, when Judge Analisa Torres delivered a summary judgment that provided partial clarity: Programmatic sales of XRP on exchanges were not deemed investment contracts (securities). Institutional sales of XRP to sophisticated buyers were deemed investment contracts (securities). Sales of XRP by Garlinghouse and Larsen were also deemed investment contracts. This split decision was seen as a partial victory for Ripple and led to a significant positive reaction in the crypto market, particularly for XRP’s price. However, it didn’t end the case. The SEC subsequently pursued an appeal regarding the programmatic sales aspect, while the case proceeded in the district court on other matters, including remedies for the institutional sales deemed securities offerings. Why the Pause? The Indicative Ruling in the XRP Lawsuit Explained So, why would both parties suddenly agree to pause the Ripple appeal that the SEC initiated? The filing explicitly mentions a “pending motion for an indicative ruling.” This is a crucial legal term that provides the key to understanding the current situation. An indicative ruling is something a party asks the district court (in this case, Judge Torres’s court) to consider while the case is already on appeal at a higher court (the Second Circuit Court of Appeals). It essentially asks the district court judge to indicate whether they would be inclined to grant a specific motion if the appellate court were to send the case back down (remand it) for that purpose. In this context, Ripple has likely filed a significant motion in the district court related to the ongoing remedies phase. This phase deals with the penalties, disgorgement, or injunctions the SEC is seeking against Ripple for the institutional sales that Judge Torres ruled were unregistered securities offerings. Ripple’s pending motion could be anything from a motion to dismiss certain claims related to remedies, a motion challenging the SEC’s proposed penalty amount, or something else entirely that, if granted by Judge Torres, could significantly alter the landscape of the case. By requesting an indicative ruling , Ripple is essentially asking Judge Torres to weigh in on this new motion *now*, even though the appeal on the programmatic sales is ongoing. If Judge Torres indicates she would grant the motion, it could potentially resolve or narrow key issues currently being debated in the remedies phase, and perhaps even impact the basis or necessity of the pending appeal. Implications of the Pause for the Ripple Appeal The decision by both the SEC and Ripple to jointly request this pause is quite telling. It suggests that whatever Ripple’s pending motion entails, both parties agree that getting Judge Torres’s perspective on it is a necessary or beneficial step before the Ripple appeal proceeds further. Here are some potential implications: Potential for Efficiency: If Judge Torres indicates she would grant Ripple’s motion, it could streamline the entire process. It might lead to a settlement, narrow the scope of the remedies trial, or even influence the SEC’s stance on the appeal. Ripple’s Confidence: Filing a motion for an indicative ruling suggests Ripple believes they have strong grounds for it and that Judge Torres might rule in their favor. SEC’s Calculation: The SEC agreeing to the pause indicates they also see value in Judge Torres’s input on the pending motion. It could be a strategic move to avoid unnecessary litigation on appeal if the district court’s ruling on the motion resolves key issues. Delayed Appeal Resolution: While potentially leading to a more efficient overall resolution, the immediate effect is a pause in the Ripple appeal itself. The ultimate outcome of the appeal on programmatic sales remains pending until the pause is lifted and the process resumes. It’s important to note that an indicative ruling is just that – an indication. Judge Torres isn’t *actually* ruling on the motion yet. She’s indicating what she *would* do if the case were remanded to her. The appellate court would still need to formally remand the case for her to issue a binding ruling. What This Development Means for US Crypto Regulation The SEC Ripple case has been a cornerstone in the ongoing debate about US crypto regulation . The initial ruling provided some of the first judicial clarity on how existing securities laws might apply to digital assets. This latest development, while procedural, underscores the complexity and evolving nature of this regulatory landscape. The outcome of the remedies phase, which is the focus of Ripple’s pending motion, will determine the final financial penalties and restrictions imposed on Ripple for the institutional sales. This will set a precedent for how the SEC might seek to penalize other crypto companies found to have conducted unregistered securities offerings. Furthermore, the eventual resolution of the appeal regarding programmatic sales will either solidify or challenge the current legal stance on exchange-based crypto trading under securities law. This case is bigger than just Ripple and XRP; it’s shaping the future of digital asset operations within the United States. Businesses, investors, and developers in the crypto space are all watching closely, as the final judgment will significantly influence how they operate, raise funds, and interact with digital assets under US crypto regulation . Looking Ahead: Potential Outcomes for the SEC Ripple Case With the appeal paused pending a decision on the indicative ruling , what are the possible paths forward for the SEC Ripple case? Judge Torres Indicates Granting the Motion: If Judge Torres signals she would grant Ripple’s pending motion (either fully or partially), it could significantly weaken the SEC’s position in the remedies phase and potentially impact the appeal. This could pave the way for a settlement or a more favorable final judgment for Ripple. Judge Torres Indicates Denying the Motion: If she indicates she would deny the motion, the remedies phase would likely continue as planned, and the appeal on programmatic sales would resume with the current summary judgment ruling intact. Settlement Talks Intensify: The joint request for a pause could be a sign that both parties are actively engaged in settlement discussions. Getting clarity from Judge Torres via the indicative ruling process might be a step towards finding common ground. Appeal Resumes: Regardless of the indicative ruling’s outcome, if no settlement is reached, the appeal process at the Second Circuit will eventually resume after the pause, potentially leading to a final ruling on the programmatic sales aspect sometime in the future (keeping in mind the August 15, 2025, status report deadline). The legal maneuvering highlights the high stakes involved. Both sides are using available legal tools to position themselves advantageously. The request for an indicative ruling is a sophisticated tactic that could significantly alter the trajectory of this landmark case. Conclusion: Awaiting the Next Move in the SEC Ripple Saga The joint request by the SEC and Ripple Labs to pause the Ripple appeal marks another fascinating turn in a case that has already seen numerous twists and turns. The focus now shifts to Ripple’s pending motion and the subsequent request for an indicative ruling from Judge Torres. While the pause introduces further delay in the appellate process, it also opens the door to potential efficiencies and perhaps even increases the likelihood of a settlement, depending on Judge Torres’s inclination regarding the pending motion. For anyone following the XRP lawsuit or interested in the future of US crypto regulation , this development is a clear reminder that the legal battles shaping the industry are far from over. The coming months, leading up to the August 2025 status report, will be critical in determining the next steps in this pivotal case.

U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has raised alarms, warning that billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos could abuse the system if critical loopholes aren’t fixed. Her warning has ignited a heated debate in the crypto community and among lawmakers. So, what exactly is the GENIUS Act , and why is it drawing so much attention? What Is the GENIUS Act? The GENIUS Act is a proposed U.S. Senate bill aiming to establish a federal framework for payment stablecoins. It sets out: Rules for issuance and transparency Reserve requirements for stablecoin providers Clear oversight roles for regulators The bill recently cleared a cloture vote and is now headed for a full Senate floor vote, where several amendments are expected to be considered. Warren’s Warning: “Billionaires Could Track Your Spending” Senator Elizabeth Warren took to X (formerly Twitter) to issue a sharp warning: “If Congress doesn’t fix the GENIUS Act, billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos could launch stablecoins that track your purchases, exploit your data, and squeeze out competitors.” Warren’s statement highlights a key concern: if tech giants gain control over both stablecoin issuance and the platforms on which they operate, it could create a dangerous data monopoly. Musk and Bezos Eyeing Stablecoins? Elon Musk Reports suggest Musk’s company X is exploring stablecoin integration through its X Money initiative, with the goal of enabling peer-to-peer payments and reducing transaction fees. Jeff Bezos Speculation is swirling that Amazon is also developing a USD-backed stablecoin , aiming to cut costs and streamline online payments. These potential moves by tech titans are exactly what Warren fears—corporate dominance over digital money and consumer data. The Consumer Risk: Privacy at Stake? Stablecoin transactions are recorded on public blockchains. But if a corporation controls both the stablecoin and the user platform, it could: Connect your wallet to your profile Monitor spending behavior in real-time Use the data for hyper-targeted ads, dynamic pricing, or even sell it to third parties This raises major privacy and surveillance concerns. Trump, Stablecoins, and the Politics of Regulation Senator Warren also warned of another risk: bailouts. If corporate stablecoins crash, taxpayers might be on the hook. Adding fuel to the fire, President Donald Trump is now tied to a controversial stablecoin project. Trump’s Crypto Empire: World Liberty Financial World Liberty Financial (WLF) was launched in 2024 Trump serves as “Chief Crypto Advocate” His sons are listed as “Web3 Ambassadors.” A Trump-affiliated entity owns 60% of WLF and receives 75% of revenue WLF has raised over $550 million and issued a USD1 stablecoin , backed by U.S. Treasuries and cash equivalents. While Trump’s support for crypto aligns with his campaign promises, critics question whether there’s a conflict of interest. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Today: Bitcoin Dips, XRP Pulls Back, Ethereum Lags Ahead of FOMC , Supporters vs Critics: The Stablecoin Divide Not everyone agrees with Warren. Fred Rispoli, a pro-crypto lawyer, argues the GENIUS Act could break big banks’ monopoly on consumer data. Others believe corporate stablecoins could boost innovation and financial inclusion. Critics also accuse Warren of hypocrisy for backing a government-run digital currency with similar data risks.

In a tweet describing the update, CryptoSensei stated, “Massive news! A brand-new Ripple ad just dropped in NYC. Something big is unfolding, #XRP is making moves!” The tweet was accompanied by images showing Ripple’s visual presence at a major transit location, suggesting a renewed effort by the company to gain visibility in one of the world’s most prominent financial cities. Massive news! A brand-new Ripple ad just dropped in NYC. Something big is unfolding, #XRP is making moves! pic.twitter.com/XYcvaYQlfc — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) June 14, 2025 The advertisement was reportedly spotted at the Fulton Center in Manhattan, a major transportation hub. A user identified as cryptofanatic corroborated CryptoSensei’s post, commenting that the ad appears regularly at the location. Specifically, cryptofanatic stated, “I see this ad every day at Fulton center NYC on the way to work.” The visibility of the Ripple campaign in such a high-traffic area appears to underscore the company’s intention to broaden its awareness efforts to the general public. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Feedback Highlights Divided Opinions While the advertisement drew attention from XRP supporters , it also prompted a range of reactions from other users. A comment from a user identified as Bubbles strongly criticized the interpretation that advertising signaled a significant development. The user wrote , “Coca cola advertises, does that mean something big is coming for coca cola……idiot scammers. Get a life. Loser. Find a better job.” The comment reflected skepticism from some quarters of the community, questioning the strategic value or interpretation of commercial advertising as a signal of market movement or technological progress. CryptoSensei did not respond to the critical comment, but engagement with the tweet remained active, indicating that XRP community members continue to closely monitor Ripple’s media strategy. Ripple’s Advertisement Strategy Emphasizes Global Reach In a related report published on June 7 by Times Tabloid, Ripple’s advertising campaign was characterized as a declaration of its international ambitions. Titled “Powering Global Payments for All,” the advertisement highlighted Ripple’s ongoing partnerships with financial institutions such as Santander, TransferGo, and MoneyGram. These companies were featured as examples of Ripple’s current integrations within the cross-border payment ecosystem. Furthermore, the ad directed viewers to Ripple’s official website, where the company details its on-demand liquidity solutions and its intention to modernize traditional financial rails with blockchain-based infrastructure. Ripple’s Focus on Institutional Partnerships and Technology Integration The advertisement’s appearance in a key New York City location appears to be part of a deliberate marketing effort that aligns with Ripple’s ongoing institutional strategy. This development follows a year of intensified visibility for Ripple and XRP amid broader market growth. With new advertisements targeting urban financial centers and recent emphasis on Ripple’s payment infrastructure, the company continues to position itself as a leading entity in the blockchain-driven payments space.

PEPE/USD chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.0000102, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00000774. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe down today? Pepe’s price gained minor selling pressure after sellers gained control and plunged the price toward $0.00001. This was triggered by the recent low buying activity and increasing profit-taking sentiment. Will Pepe Recover? If buyers hold the price above the $0.00001 level strongly, we might see further upward rally in the Pepe price chart. What is Pepe price prediction for 2025? The Pepe price prediction for 2025 expects the meme coin to record a maximum level of $0.000035. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040. Recent news A whale moved 500 billion $PEPE worth $3.85M to Binance after facing a huge $450,000 loss for holding $PEPE for 40 days. PEPE Price Prediction June 2025 If BTC price records robust surges this month, we might see PEPE price skyrocketing. We expect the PEPE price to record minimum and maximum prices of $0.000008 and $0.000017, respectively. The average price might be around $0.000011. Month Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) June 2025 0.000008 0.000011 0.000017 Pepe price prediction 2025 The Pepe roadmap is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. Despite its robust community, this lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2025 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. In 2025, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000005. It may peak at a maximum value of $0.000035, with an average trading price of $0.000027 throughout the year.

Record High in March 2024: Amidst a surge in the memecoin sector, PEPE reached a new all-time high of $0.00001074 on March 14, 2024, but slightly decreased to $0.0000083 by March 21, 2024. In May, the price of Pepe surged exponentially, and a new ATH was formed each week. On 27 May, Pepe price reached a new ATH at $0.00001718. However, the price heavily declined in June as it broke below the crucial level of $0.00001. In July, though the Pepe price touched $0.000012, it failed to maintain its momentum and dropped toward $0.0000093. In August, Pepe’s price dropped toward the $0.0000058 level. However, it is now recovering slightly. In September, the price of Pepe witnessed extreme fluctuation; however, it ended the month on a bullish note as it hit $0.000012. Pepe price experienced an Uptober rally later as it surged toward the high of $0.000012 in October. However, the price is now declining below support channels. In November, the price of Pepe skyrocketed above $0.000026. In December, Pepe consolidated below $0.00002. In January 2025, Pepe skyrocketed toward $0.000028, but it then declined to as low as 0.000010 in February. Pepe price crashed in February as it dropped below $0.0000078. In March, the price of Pepe declined heavily as it aimed for a low around $0.000005. The price of Pepe attempted to surge above $0.00001 in April but it failed to meet buyers’ demand. This resulted in a bearish decline in the PEPE price chart. In early May, the price of Pepe skyrocketed toward $0.000013. However, in early June, the price of Pepe declined toward the low of $0.00001.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|PEPE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-17 08:15:00

The official X accounts for Pump.fun and its founder, Alon Cohen, were abruptly suspended, alongside several other accounts linked to memecoin activities. This unexpected move has ignited widespread speculation across the community, with many wondering about the potential involvement of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Keeping up with such rapid changes is crucial in the fast-paced realm of Crypto News . What Happened with Pump.fun ‘s Social Presence? The core event that triggered this wave of speculation was the simultaneous suspension of multiple X accounts. The primary accounts affected were: The official @pumpdotfun account. The account belonging to Pump.fun founder, Alon Cohen (@alon). Reports also indicate other accounts associated with memecoin projects or figures saw similar suspensions around the same time. While the platform itself, Pump.fun , reportedly remains fully operational, the loss of its main communication channels on a widely used platform like X is significant. For a project heavily reliant on community engagement and viral marketing, losing access to such a vital platform can disrupt information flow and create uncertainty among users and potential investors. Why the SEC Speculation? The immediate leap to speculating about SEC involvement isn’t unfounded, especially given the current regulatory climate surrounding cryptocurrencies, particularly those perceived as volatile or potentially unregistered securities. Several factors contribute to this speculation: Timing and Scope: The simultaneous suspension of multiple related accounts raises questions about coordinated action, which could potentially originate from a regulatory body investigating a broader issue. Nature of the Platform: Pump.fun facilitates the rapid creation and launch of new tokens, predominantly memecoins. Memecoins, by their nature, are often highly speculative, lack fundamental value, and are prone to extreme volatility. Regulators like the SEC have expressed concerns about platforms that could potentially facilitate the issuance and trading of tokens deemed unregistered securities, or enable manipulative practices like pump-and-dump schemes. Prior Legal Challenges: As highlighted in the initial report, Pump.fun has already faced legal scrutiny. A proposed class-action lawsuit filed in January accused the platform of facilitating the sale of unregistered securities and profiting significantly from fees generated by these activities. Generating nearly $500 million in fees, as alleged, certainly puts the platform on the radar, especially if a significant portion comes from assets later deemed problematic. While X’s terms of service allow for account suspensions for various reasons, including violations related to spam, manipulation, or illegal activities, the timing and the context of the legal challenges make regulatory action a plausible, though unconfirmed, explanation. The Memecoin Market and Associated Risks The rise of platforms like Pump.fun is intrinsically linked to the explosion of the Memecoin market. Memecoins are cryptocurrencies inspired by internet memes, jokes, or cultural trends. They typically gain value through social media hype, community enthusiasm, and speculative trading rather than underlying technology or utility. While some memecoins have seen astronomical gains, attracting significant attention and capital, they are also associated with substantial risks: Extreme Volatility: Prices can surge and plummet dramatically within hours or days, often driven purely by sentiment and social media trends. Lack of Fundamentals: Unlike projects building decentralized applications or solving specific problems, memecoins often have no intrinsic value or clear use case beyond speculation. Pump-and-Dump Schemes: The low liquidity and hype-driven nature of many memecoins make them susceptible to manipulation, where early holders promote the coin heavily to inflate the price before selling off their holdings, leaving later investors with losses. Scams and Rug Pulls: Platforms that lower the barrier to entry for creating tokens can inadvertently become avenues for malicious actors to launch scam tokens, often disappearing with investor funds (a “rug pull”). Platforms that facilitate the easy creation of these tokens face the challenge of balancing accessibility with the need to prevent abuse and protect users from potential fraud and manipulative practices. Regulatory bodies worldwide are increasingly scrutinizing the crypto market, and the memecoin sector, due to its inherent volatility and association with potential scams, is often under a magnifying glass. Solana ‘s Role in the Memecoin Boom Pump.fun operates on the Solana blockchain, which has become a popular hub for memecoin activity. Solana’s architecture, known for its high transaction throughput and low fees, makes it an attractive network for launching and trading tokens quickly and cheaply. This has fostered a vibrant, albeit sometimes chaotic, ecosystem of new projects and tokens, many of which are memecoins. The popularity of Solana for memecoins has been a double-edged sword. On one hand, it has brought significant activity and attention to the network. On the other hand, it has also attracted criticism and regulatory focus due to the proliferation of speculative assets and the associated risks. Developments affecting major platforms on Solana, like Pump.fun, can have ripple effects on the perception and activity within the broader Solana ecosystem. Staying Informed with Crypto News Events like the Pump.fun X account suspension underscore the importance of staying informed in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. Regulatory actions, platform developments, and market sentiment can change rapidly. For anyone involved in the crypto space, whether as an investor, developer, or enthusiast, reliable Crypto News sources are essential for understanding the landscape, assessing risks, and making informed decisions. While the exact reasons behind the X suspensions remain officially unconfirmed, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the potential regulatory risks faced by platforms operating in less-defined areas of the crypto market, particularly those associated with highly speculative assets like memecoins. It highlights the ongoing tension between innovation in decentralized finance and the need for consumer protection and market integrity that regulators aim to uphold. The situation surrounding Pump.fun will likely continue to develop. Whether regulatory action is indeed underway, or if the suspensions relate to other issues, the event has already fueled significant discussion and highlighted the challenges within the memecoin sector and the platforms that support it.

Despite the bullish sentiment around Circle and the stablecoin sector, Hayes predicts a bubble driven more by hype and poor fundamentals than sustainable value. Meanwhile, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire compared stablecoins to the iPhone in their early days, and pointed to growing institutional interest and surging transaction volumes as signs of mainstream adoption. Major retailers and platforms like Amazon, Walmart, and Shopify are exploring or integrating stablecoin payments. At the same time, JPMorgan’s new trademark filing for “JPMD” fueled speculation that the bank could soon launch its own stablecoin. Circle Copycats Face Harsh Reality BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes issued a stark warning about the next phase of the crypto market, and described it as the beginning of a new “stablecoin mania” after Circle’s highly successful IPO. In a post on Monday , Hayes said that while Circle’s public listing was a huge milestone for the industry, it is also the start of a bubble that will ultimately burst. He predicted that many companies will try to replicate Circle’s success, but most will be overvalued and ultimately fail due to structural challenges and market saturation. Hayes didn’t mince words in his criticism of these upcoming ventures, and labeled them “Circle copycats.” He also suggested that their business models rely more on showmanship and leverage than sustainable financial practices. He warned investors to be extremely cautious, and described the coming wave of stablecoin stocks as something to be traded like a “hot potato.” Despite his grim outlook, Hayes stopped short of recommending short positions due to the strong pro-crypto sentiment in the US and a narrative-driven surge in demand that could initially drive prices sharply upward. “These new stocks will rip the faces off of shorts,” he cautioned. The US Senate is set to vote on critical stablecoin legislation on June 17, which could lend even more momentum to the sector if passed. Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov agreed with Hayes’ outlook by saying the approval of US regulation would trigger a global explosion in stablecoin projects. However, Hayes pointed out that distribution is still the Achilles’ heel for most new entrants. According to him, without access to major crypto exchanges, social media platforms, or legacy banking systems, new stablecoin companies have little to no chance of survival. Additionally, he argued that the few existing distribution channels are already locked up by incumbents, forcing newcomers to either pay high fees or offer unsustainable yields to attract users. At the same time, he believes Web2 giants and banks are more likely to issue their own stablecoins than partner with new providers. As a result, most new stablecoin IPOs will be speculative hype rather than solid investments. Hayes was particularly scathing toward the upcoming wave of founders, and described them as “suited-up clowns” set to deceive the public into buying into weak companies. Circle share price since launch (Source: Google Finance ) Even Circle (CRCL), he claims, is currently “insanely overvalued,” as half of its interest income is handed over to Coinbase. Yet, he acknowledged that the stock’s price will likely stay elevated due to market enthusiasm. Circle’s share price has surged over 80% since its listing on June 5, and reached an all-time high on June 16. Stablecoins Near iPhone Moment Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire believes that stablecoins are nearing a pivotal moment in mainstream adoption, and compared their current stage to the early days of the iPhone before developers recognized its full potential. In a post on Saturday , Allaire said that while stablecoins haven’t yet attracted developers at the same scale as Apple’s revolutionary product, that breakthrough is coming soon. He described stablecoins as “the highest utility form of money ever created.” Allaire’s comments were made in response to a post by a16z Crypto partner Sam Broner , who argued that stablecoins promote competition by lowering the costs of launching fintech applications. According to Broner, this new openness encourages better pricing, experiences, and accessibility in financial services. The discussion coincides with reports that major retailers like Walmart and Amazon are considering launching their own dollar-backed stablecoins for consumer use. Meanwhile, e-commerce platform Shopify confirmed plans to integrate Circle’s USDC for payments by the end of 2025. A16z Crypto data scientist Daren Matsuoka added to the bullish outlook by stating that stablecoins might be the crypto industry’s best chance to onboard a billion users. He explained that stablecoins have processed $33 trillion in transactions over the past year — which is almost 20 times PayPal’s volume, almost triple that of Visa, and rapidly approaching ACH transaction levels. This surge in adoption momentum follows Circle’s recent listing on the New York Stock Exchange. However, Tether opted not to follow suit. On June 8, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed that the company has no plans to go public. New JPMorgan Trademark Sparks Stablecoin Speculation Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase took a major step toward expanding its presence in the blockchain and digital asset space with a new trademark filing for “JPMD” in the United States. The trademark application was submitted to the US Patent and Trademark Office on Sunday, and outlines a comprehensive suite of crypto-related services, including digital asset trading, exchanges, transfers, clearing, and payment processing. While the application does not specifically mention stablecoins, the breadth of services it covers intensified speculation that JPMorgan may be preparing to launch its own stablecoin. These developments happened on the heels of a report from The Wall Street Journal on May 22, which indicated that JPMorgan, alongside other major financial institutions like Bank of America and Wells Fargo, is actively exploring the launch of a joint stablecoin. The timing of this report and the recent trademark filing led industry observers to draw connections between the two, with some suggesting that JPMorgan’s actions point to an accelerated push into blockchain-native financial infrastructure aimed at competing with established crypto players. Despite CEO Jamie Dimon’s longstanding skepticism toward Bitcoin, JPMorgan maintained a positive stance on blockchain technology as a tool for modernizing traditional finance. The firm already made inroads through its Kinexy platform (previously known as Onyx), which facilitates interbank payments using JPM Coin, a blockchain-based digital token backed 1:1 by fiat currencies including the US dollar, British pound, and euro. To date, Kinexy has handled over $1.5 trillion in tokenized transactions. The news of JPMorgan’s trademark application also arrives at a time of increasing regulatory momentum in the US regarding stablecoins. Last week, the Senate voted 68-30 to advance the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, clearing the way for debate and a full floor vote. If approved by both chambers of Congress, the bill will head to President Donald Trump for final authorization.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-17 09:30:00

The rise of CRWV coincides with a positive month for miner stocks that pivoted to high-density computing for AI. CoreWeave (CRWV) is back to expansion mode, leading to expectations of another rally. The AI computation company, which pivoted early from Ethereum mining, was one of the biggest winners during the LLM expansion stage. CRWV showed strong bullish momentum in the past month, with periods of trading based on a short squeeze. | Source: Yahoo Finance CRWV climbed to $158.50, on track to repeat previous records above $161. In the last two weeks, the CRWV rally raised suspicions that the stock was boosted by meme traders . However, the company has tapped demand for high-density computation for AI, and got a boost from Nvidia (NVDA). The stock moves on a mix of two major factors—trading based on a potential short squeeze, and general bullish momentum for all AI stocks. CoreWeave goes through another record borrowing period While CRWV is watched for its fundamental potential, in the short term, the price rally coincides with record costs to borrow shares, signaling a short squeeze. During the recent price climb to near-peak prices, CRWV borrowing rates also reached new records. As of June 12, the rate increased to 343.1%, then turned down to around 197%, with 200K CRWV shares available to borrow. CRWV borrowing rates increased to a record, suggesting a short squeeze is a partial factor for the stock’s rally. | Source: CompaniesMarketcap The short interest on CRWV moved within a wide range in the past few days, from 32% to as much as 45%. On social media, messages of short interest of up to 65% of the free float also appeared, boosting the FOMO for trading CRWV. Short interest is not a guaranteed trend, and can shift on a daily basis. However, CRWV can still trade under conditions similar to a short squeeze, at least in the short term. The shares are closely watched for their month-long bullish trend, which may lead to sharp increases in borrowing costs for covering short positions. In June, shares available to borrow increased, potentially easing the borrowing situation, though at a high price. On June 8, only 25K shares were available to borrow, increasing to over 250K at the new record borrowing rates. CoreWeave brings attention to mining companies The success of CoreWeave and demand for computation is boosting the shares of other mining companies. Core Scientific (CORZ) rose by over 12% in the past month. The company may have an ongoing boost from its 12-year deal with CoreWeave, with $4.7B earmarked for data center investments. Core Scientific is also building some of the CoreWeave data centers in Texas, with a goal of tapping 200MW in energy for data centers. The shares are up by 100% since the lows in April and May. The company mixes ongoing BTC mining with a treasury of 977 BTC, while also making forays into computation services. Other companies like CleanSpark and Riot Platforms are still trying to push off their recent lows, with more gradual gains. TeraWulf (WULF) had a more dramatic rally, rising from around $3.50 in early June to over $4.33. The company has previously benefitted from its pivot to AI data centers. It also extends the trend of seeking out renewable electricity resources to create sustainable data centers.

Eurite (EURI), a euro-pegged stablecoin regulated under the European Union’s pioneering Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, is possibly on the verge of a potential sell-off and incoming volatility. According to on-chain analytics platform Santiment, nearly 10% of EURI’s total supply was recently transferred to Binance. As per CoinMarketCap , EURI currently trades at $1.15, marking a minor 0.10% drop in the last 24 hours.

While trading hasn’t officially begun for all, the underlying funds are starting to see movement. Recent data reveals a notable development: US Spot ETH ETFs collectively recorded a net inflow of $21.4 million on June 16. This marks an important early indicator of investor interest in these newly approved investment vehicles. What Exactly Are US Spot ETH ETFs and Why Do These Inflows Matter? Before diving deeper into the numbers, let’s quickly recap what a US Spot ETH ETF is. It’s an exchange-traded fund that holds actual Ethereum (ETH) as its underlying asset. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which track the price of ETH futures contracts, a spot ETF aims to track the direct market price of Ethereum by holding the asset itself. This structure is generally preferred by investors seeking direct exposure to the asset’s price movements without the complexities of holding the cryptocurrency directly. The approval of US Spot ETH ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year was a landmark moment for the crypto industry. It followed the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, which saw billions in inflows and significantly boosted Bitcoin’s price and mainstream acceptance. The approval of Ethereum ETFs signals growing regulatory comfort and institutional acceptance of major cryptocurrencies as legitimate asset classes for traditional investment products. Therefore, any recorded inflows into these funds, even before they are fully trading on exchanges (pending S-1 form approvals), are highly significant. They represent the first tangible signs of capital entering these specific investment products, indicating that investors and institutions are beginning to allocate funds towards Ethereum through this regulated and accessible pathway. Breaking Down the Initial ETH ETF Inflows: Who is Leading? According to data compiled by Farside Investors, the $21.4 million net inflow on June 16 was concentrated in just two of the approved funds. Here’s the breakdown: BlackRock’s ETHA: This fund, managed by the world’s largest asset manager, led the pack with a substantial $16.1 million in net inflows. Fidelity’s FETH: Another major financial player, Fidelity, saw its Ethereum ETF attract $5.3 million in net inflows. Other Funds: The remaining US Spot ETH ETFs tracked by Farside Investors reported no change in their holdings for that specific day. This initial data highlights the immediate impact and reach of major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity. Their existing client bases, brand recognition, and distribution networks likely play a significant role in attracting early capital into their respective Ethereum ETF offerings. While $21.4 million is a modest start compared to the massive inflows seen during the initial days of the US spot Bitcoin ETFs, it’s important contextually. The S-1 registration statements, which allow these ETFs to officially begin trading, are still pending final approval for most issuers. These early inflows could represent seed funding or initial strategic allocations ahead of the official launch. How Do These Early ETH ETF Inflows Compare to the Bitcoin Experience? It’s natural to compare the initial performance of US Spot ETH ETF inflows to that of their Bitcoin counterparts. The US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw billions of dollars in inflows within their first few days of trading in January 2024. While the $21.4 million figure for Ethereum ETFs on June 16 is significantly smaller, it’s crucial to remember that this data point represents activity *before* full trading commencement for all funds. The Bitcoin ETFs had their S-1s approved concurrently with the 19b-4 rule change, allowing them to trade almost immediately after the SEC’s decision. The Ethereum ETF process has been slightly different, with 19b-4 approval granted first, followed by the ongoing S-1 approval process for individual issuers. Therefore, a direct day-one comparison isn’t entirely fair. The true test for ETH ETF inflows will come once all major funds receive their S-1 approvals and begin trading on exchanges. However, these early numbers, particularly the interest shown in the BlackRock ETH ETF and Fidelity ETH ETF , suggest that there is indeed appetite among investors for this new product. What Could These Initial Flows Signal for the Future of Ethereum? While it’s too early to make definitive predictions based on a single day’s data, these initial ETH ETF inflows are generally viewed as a positive sign for Ethereum. Here’s why: Growing Institutional Interest: The participation of major firms like BlackRock and Fidelity, and the capital they are attracting, underscores increasing institutional comfort and interest in gaining exposure to Ethereum. Increased Accessibility: Once fully operational, these ETFs will make investing in Ethereum significantly easier for traditional investors who are uncomfortable with or unable to navigate cryptocurrency exchanges and private key management. This expanded access could bring new capital into the ETH market. Potential Price Support: As ETFs accumulate ETH to back their shares, this creates buying pressure on the underlying asset. While the initial $21.4 million is small relative to Ethereum’s market cap, sustained inflows over time could provide significant price support. Market Legitimacy: The existence of regulated ETF products for Ethereum further solidifies its position as a recognized and legitimate asset class within the traditional financial system. Navigating the Path Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities While the launch of Ethereum ETF products presents significant opportunities, there are also potential challenges to consider: Opportunities: Massive Capital Influx: If ETH ETFs mirror the success of Bitcoin ETFs, they could unlock significant capital from retail and institutional investors who were previously unable or unwilling to invest directly in crypto. Enhanced Liquidity: Increased trading activity around the ETFs could indirectly improve liquidity in the underlying ETH market. Innovation in Financial Products: The success of spot crypto ETFs could pave the way for other regulated products based on digital assets. Challenges: Market Volatility: While ETFs offer a regulated wrapper, they still track a highly volatile asset. Investors must be prepared for significant price swings. Regulatory Uncertainty: Although the ETFs are approved, the broader regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the US remains complex and subject to change. Competition: The market is competitive, with multiple issuers vying for investor assets. Performance and fees will be key differentiators. Staking Exclusion: Importantly, the current US spot ETH ETFs are approved without a staking component, meaning investors in these funds will not earn staking rewards, which is a significant feature of holding native ETH. Actionable Insights for Those Watching US Spot ETH ETFs For investors and market observers, here are a few key takeaways: Monitor S-1 Approvals: Keep a close eye on the SEC’s approval timeline for the remaining S-1 registration statements. This will be the green light for full trading commencement. Track Inflow Data Post-Launch: Once trading begins, daily inflow/outflow data will provide a clearer picture of investor demand compared to these early seed figures. Observe Market Reaction: See how the price of Ethereum reacts as these ETFs go live and accumulate assets. Compare Performance: If considering investment (not financial advice), compare the fees, structure, and performance of different ETF offerings. Remember, investing in cryptocurrencies and related products carries significant risk. This information is for educational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice. Always conduct your own thorough research and consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions. The Broader Significance Beyond Just the ETF It’s also worth remembering that the Ethereum ETF is just one part of the larger Ethereum ecosystem. Ethereum is a foundational layer for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and numerous other decentralized applications. Its ongoing technical upgrades, such as the transition to Proof-of-Stake and future scaling solutions, are critical drivers of its long-term value proposition, independent of the ETF wrapper. The ETF provides a new gateway for traditional capital, but the underlying technology and network development remain paramount. Concluding Thoughts: A Promising Start for a New Era The reported $21.4 million in net inflows on June 16 for US Spot ETH ETFs represents a modest but symbolically significant step forward. It confirms early interest from major players like BlackRock and Fidelity and signals the impending arrival of these highly anticipated investment products to the broader market. While the true impact will unfold once full trading commences, this initial activity sets a positive tone for the potential integration of Ethereum into traditional investment portfolios. The journey of US spot ETH ETFs is just beginning, and market participants will be keenly watching to see if the early promise translates into sustained growth and adoption.

BladeDeFi, in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), warned followers that a significant downturn could be on the horizon, predicting a challenging summer ahead for the crypto space. Crypto Pump Or Trap? In his post, BladeDeFi emphasized that “crypto has already PEAKED” and forecasted a potential slump where alternative cryptocurrencies could see declines of up to 95%. He indicated that most indicators are flashing red, suggesting that the market is on the brink of a significant downturn. According to him, Bitcoin has already hit its all-time high early in the current cycle and is now trapped in a “slow-motion downtrend,” with each subsequent bounce becoming weaker than the last. Related Reading: Bitcoin Gold Rush 2.0? Treasuries Swell With 60 New Players The analyst pointed out a concerning trend: retail investors are becoming exhausted, while larger institutional players have begun to exit the market. Major firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and MicroStrategy are reportedly rotating their investments and hedging their positions, often without making their actions overtly public. The analyst suggests that this shift leaves retail investors vulnerable, potentially left holding depreciating assets as liquidity in the market continues to dwindle. BladeDeFi also criticized the current market dynamics, warning that sudden price increases or “green candles” are often deceptive, serving only to entice late buyers into traps that lead to further losses. He noted that without new capital inflows—such as fresh stimulus or significant investment—the recent price pumps lack sustainability. The absence of liquidity means that any upward movements are likely to be fleeting, and the overall trend remains downward. Bitcoin Poised For Year-End Peak? Adding to the bearish sentiment, another analyst, Peppeso, echoed similar concerns, suggesting that the top of the 2025 bull market has already been established. Peppeso observed historical patterns in previous market cycles, noting that while bull markets have become longer, bear markets have shortened and softened in their impact. Despite this, Bitcoin has consistently reached all-time highs in the final months of each cycle, reinforcing Peppeso’s expectation of a peak around November or December 2025.

With uncertainty clouding the outlook, many investors are adopting a risk-off approach, leading to a sustained downtrend in the crypto market. Even popular memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have experienced significant declines of 9% and 7% in the past week alone respectively, indicating that the hype surrounding these assets is fading.

Could Settle Within 1 Week to 2 Months,https://coinpedia.org/news/when-will-xrp-vs-sec-officially-end-could-settle-within-1-week-to-2-months/,"The post When Will XRP vs SEC Officially End? Could Settle Within 1 Week to 2 Months appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a latest twist in the Ripple vs SEC case, both parties have asked the Second Circuit Court to keep the appeals process on hold while they wait for a ruling from the district court. The SEC is expected to update the court with a status report by August 15. This comes after a joint request was filed by Ripple and the SEC on June 12 to lift the injunction and reduce the penalty. The final outcome now depends on how the district court rules on that request. If the court approves the proposed settlement, it could finally mark the end of this case. Otherwise, it could face new delays. All eyes are now on the next update, which is expected by mid-August. Update Likely Within a Week? One expert explains that the SEC refiled the motion with Judge Torres, and her response will guide the next steps. She also added that it might not take until August, as the last time Judge Torres responded within just 7 days, so a decision could come as early as Thursday or next week. Former SEC official Marc Fagel commented that writing legal opinions takes time and pointed out that this isn’t the only case in front of the judge. Will the Case Return to Judge Torres? Sherrie expressed that she would be surprised if Judge Torres were to reject the refiled motion. The community might need to be prepared for the possibility that, if the motion is not approved and either party restarts their appeals, the case could end back up in Judge Torres’ courtroom. This could trigger “conspiracy theories” within the XRP community. I don't think there's any way to predict whether she will modify her order. I could see it going either way. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) June 17, 2025 According to Fagel, it’s hard to predict whether the judge will modify her previous order. “I could see it going either way,” he said. So, both sides are now waiting on Judge Torres. If she accepts the motion, it could help wrap up the case. If not, the appeals process may restart and lead to more speculation across the community. If the case is resolved, it could boost XRP’s price and make way for spot XRP ETF approvals.

In a Monday blog post, Hayes expressed skepticism about a potential wave of copycat stablecoin companies aiming to replicate Circle’s (CRCL) IPO success . Hayes emphasized that Circle’s listing is likely just the beginning of a broader speculative frenzy. “The listing marks the beginning, not the end of this cycle’s stablecoin mania,” he wrote. He foresees a situation where companies attract massive investments by using financial tricks, excessive leverage, and flashy marketing—but ultimately lack a solid foundation. “The bubble will pop after a stablecoin issuer convinces investors to part with tens of billions, only to collapse,” he warned. New Entrants in Stablecoin World According to Hayes, most new stablecoin companies won’t survive. He outlined that the real challenge for these firms lies in distribution—specifically, how and where they get their stablecoins into users’ hands. Hayes identified three main distribution avenues: cryptocurrency exchanges, Web2 social media giants, and traditional banks. He argued that without access to at least one of these, a new stablecoin issuer has “no chance of success.” He added that existing players have already secured these routes, making it nearly impossible for newcomers to enter without paying significant fees or giving up yield. He noted that social media companies and banks are more likely to develop their own stablecoins rather than partner with third-party issuers. Despite his grim outlook, Hayes refrained from advising traders to short these companies’ stocks. “These new stocks will rip the faces off of shorts,” he wrote, citing the growing pro-crypto sentiment in the U.S. and momentum around stablecoin legislation. The U.S. Senate is expected to vote on a major stablecoin bill on June 17, which could further energize the market. Circle Soars Amid Caution Hayes was particularly critical of Circle’s current valuation, describing CRCL as significantly overvalued. He noted that Circle shares 50% of its interest earnings with Coinbase, which he sees as a structural weakness. Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the stock price is likely to remain high for now due to market hype. Circle’s share price has surged over 80% since its June 5 debut, hitting nearly $165 on June 16, according to Google Finance. Hayes sees this as a sign of things to come—but not in a good way.

In this cycle, a new class of meme coins is rising. All three tokens below currently trade with a market cap of under $10 billion, but each has a distinct path, narrative, and setup that could propel them to the $100 billion club in the next bull run. Let’s break down why Little Pepe (LILPEPE), SPX6900, and Pepe Coin may be the biggest meme winners of the next run. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) — Market Cap: Presale Stage While other meme coins fight for attention with clever branding or short-lived social spikes, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is doing something different — it's building the future of meme finance from the ground up. Not just a meme coin, LILPEPE’s explosive presale success shows that the market is already catching on. Since launching on June 10, Little Pepe’s presale has become one of the fastest-moving launches in the meme coin ecosystem. Stage 1 sold out in just 72 hours, and Stage 2 has already sold over 650 million tokens, raising more than $700,000. It's well on track to hit its $1,325,000 target soon. Here's why it's the one to watch: Meme-only Layer 2: It’s the first meme project to launch a dedicated Layer 2 blockchain tailored specifically for meme coins. This chain has sniper bot protection, ultra-low gas fees, and a launchpad. Pepe’s Pump Pad: that allows users to launch meme tokens with built-in liquidity locks and anti-rug mechanics. Zero Tax, Locked Liquidity: Ideal for whales, who have already begun accumulating early. CEX Listings Secured: Two centralized exchange listings are confirmed post-presale, with rumors of a Tier 1 exchange surfacing. Smart Contract Audit Complete: LILPEPE’s code passed its audit with zero critical or significant issues, providing early investors with confidence in its security. Importantly, Little Pepe is gaining traction across crypto Twitter and Telegram. Social buzz is surging, with multiple analysts now turning their eyes toward LILPEPE. Add to that its recently successful smart contract audit, and it’s clear the team is serious about security and execution, which is rare in the meme sector. Little Pepe is engineering long-term engagement through utility and scalability. With confirmed listings on two centralized exchanges following the presale, demand is expected to surge once trading starts. In the next bull run, it could be one of those that shoots to the moon, as its strong narrative remains a distinct factor. Intended to succeed PEPE, it could indeed outperform its successor and deliver massive returns. SPX6900 (SPX) — Market Cap: $1.37 Billion SPX/USD 1wk Price Chart|Source: TradingView SPX6900 led in 2024, rallying by about 20,000%. It crashed to $0.29 in March but has now rebounded massively. SPX is currently trading above $1.60, just shy of its January all-time high of $1.77. What makes SPX so promising? Whale Accumulation: Over 106 million tokens have been scooped up by large holders. This move shows long-term confidence. Community Resilience: Even after its official X (Twitter) account was suspended , engagement spiked. That’s a sign of a decentralized, organic movement—a vital trait of a meme coin. On-Chain Strength: Futures open interest has surged to over $163 million, and daily active addresses have hit a new high. This signals massive interest and liquidity. Technical Setup: The token is forming a textbook cup-and-handle breakout. RSI, ADX, and Chaikin Money Flow indicators are all flashing bullish continuation. If SPX6900 holds its trend and regains virality, a 10x move to a $15B–$20B valuation is plausible. A euphoric top around $100B isn’t off the table in peak mania. Pepe Coin (PEPE) — Market Cap: $4.69 Billion PEPE/USDT 1wk Price Chart|Source: TradingView Pepe Coin has already printed one explosive cycle. In early 2024, it surged from near-zero to multi-billion territory in just weeks. Now, with consolidation underway and smart money re-entering, many believe PEPE could outperform again. Here’s what gives PEPE its staying power: Cultural Dominance: It remains one of the most recognized meme brands in the cryptocurrency space. Technical Readiness: The current chart shows a descending flag, a classic bull continuation setup. Momentum indicators, such as RSI and MACD, are rebounding. Key Support Holding: The $0.000012 region has held critical support. It is aligning with the 100 and 200 EMA and 0.382 Fib level. Whale Confidence: Large holders are buying the dip, with minimal realized profits suggesting holders aren’t rushing to exit. With a clear breakout above $0.000014, PEPE could rocket toward its previous highs. And if the next bull cycle mirrors 2021, a $50B to $100B cap isn’t unrealistic given its retail gravity. Final Thoughts The next crypto bull run could see meme coins dominate, capturing attention and liquidity more quickly than any other asset class. SPX6900 brings technical strength and a defiant community. Meanwhile, Pepe Coin offers retail familiarity and proven explosive behavior. Little Pepe combines meme magic with real blockchain infrastructure, a feat no meme project has accomplished before. Still in its presale stage, it could offer explosive gains once it launches on top exchanges. For investors looking to place high-risk, high-reward bets, these three are your next 10x to 100x moonshots. LILPEPE’s presale is still open at littlepepe.com . With rising demand, the next stage price is imminent.

Both stocks and digital assets fell sharply on Friday following renewed Israeli strikes but began to stabilize on Monday. By early Tuesday, however, momentum had stalled . US index futures slipped, and cryptocurrency price action turned mixed over the previous 24 hours. Digital assets often mirror high-risk technology stocks—rising with investor optimism and reversing course when sentiment weakens. Geopolitical shocks typically trigger knee-jerk sell-offs, but markets tend to stabilize as traders reassess the broader implications. Amid this volatile backdrop, early-stage project Bitcoin Pepe has continued to see strong presale inflows. Since launching in February, the project has maintained steady investor interest, positioning itself as a notable outlier in an otherwise cooling meme coin segment. Firms continue to load up BTC The Blockchain Group has raised €7.2 million (approximately $7.7 million) to advance its ambition of becoming Europe’s leading Bitcoin Treasury company. In a press release dated June 17, the Paris-listed firm said the capital was secured via an “At-The-Market type” raise with asset manager TOBAM. The offering involved the issuance of 1.6 million new shares at an average price of €4.49, reflecting a 20.76% discount to the stock’s June 13 close amid market volatility.

The Blockchain Group aims to emulate firms such as US-based Strategy and Japan’s Metaplanet, which have adopted similar Bitcoin-forward capital allocation models. It plans to hold up to 260,000 BTC—currently valued at about $24 billion—by 2033, positioning itself as a pioneer of corporate Bitcoin adoption in Europe. Bitcoin Pepe: listing announcement scheduled for today Even amid a volatile market, the accelerating embrace of Bitcoin and digital assets by traditional finance has helped lift sentiment across the broader crypto ecosystem. In this risk-on climate, investors in search of outsized returns are rotating back into speculative plays—meme coins among the first to benefit. Among them, Bitcoin Pepe has emerged as one of 2025’s most closely tracked presales. The project distinguishes itself with the ambition to “build Solana on Bitcoin,” aiming to merge the Bitcoin network’s security with Solana-style scalability. The project’s PEP-20 token standard allows permissionless minting and trading on the Bitcoin network. Unlike meme tokens that rely purely on hype, Bitcoin Pepe is anchored by a defined technical roadmap and infrastructure-led narrative. The project has raised over $14.6 million in presale funding ahead of a planned listing announcement today, underscoring continued investor interest. As speculative capital flows back into early-stage assets, Bitcoin Pepe is well-positioned to harness the momentum in the final stretch of its token sale.

The cryptocurrency briefly touched a 24-hour high of $108,952 before pulling back to $106,000. Market sentiment improved following comments from French President Emmanuel Macron , who said that US President Donald Trump had received an offer—delivered through intermediaries—intended to secure a ceasefire and resume broader negotiations between the warring parties. “There is indeed an offer to meet and exchange. An offer was made especially to get a ceasefire and to kickstart broader discussions,” Macron told reporters that the development was a potentially positive step in resolving the Iran-Israel conflict. The broader market rebound is also benefiting early-stage tokens such as Bitcoin Pepe , which has continued to draw steady investor interest since its presale launch in February. Over the weekend, the project recorded more than $250,000 in new inflows, underscoring sustained momentum as traders seek high-upside opportunities amid improving sentiment. Trump’s Truth Social files for Bitcoin-Ether ETF Truth Social, the social media platform operated by Trump Media & Technology Group, has filed to launch an exchange-traded fund tracking the prices of both bitcoin and ether. According to a Form S-1 filed Monday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the proposed “Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, B.T.” will allocate approximately 75% of its assets to bitcoin, with the remaining portion invested in ether. The ratio may be adjusted at the discretion of the sponsor, Yorkville America Digital LLC, with any changes to be disclosed via prospectus supplements, SEC filings, or updates on the fund’s website. Foris DAX Trust Co. LLC is listed as the custodian, as in the platform’s earlier filing for a single-asset bitcoin ETF submitted on June 5. Truth Social is the third issuer to seek approval for a dual-spot crypto ETF, following similar filings by Bitwise and Hashdex. Other firms, including Volatility Shares and ProShares, have filed for bitcoin-ether ETFs as well, but tied to futures markets rather than spot prices. Bitcoin Pepe continues its forward march Bitcoin’s resilience amid macroeconomic uncertainty is lifting broader crypto market sentiment, rekindling speculative appetite across digital assets. Historically, such periods have often preceded market-wide rallies, especially in high-volatility segments like meme coins. Investors are once again rotating into riskier bets, with meme tokens among the early beneficiaries. One project gaining momentum is Bitcoin Pepe, which merges viral internet culture with a Layer 2 infrastructure play. Bitcoin Pepe is attempting to “build Solana on Bitcoin.” The project seeks to pair Bitcoin’s base-layer security with Solana-style scalability, distinguishing it from meme tokens that rely purely on hype. Unlike most of its peers, Bitcoin Pepe is underpinned by a technical roadmap and infrastructure-first narrative. That positioning appears to be resonating: the project has raised more than $14.6 million in its ongoing presale, with a listing announcement due today. As capital continues to rotate into early-stage, high-upside opportunities, Bitcoin Pepe is positioning itself to capitalise on renewed risk-taking in the final days of its token sale.

However, if you’re chasing real gains in 2025, they may not deliver as much as expected. These three tokens are quietly positioning themselves to outperform the biggest names in crypto. In fact, each has the potential to deliver 5x more returns than ETH or XRP this year. Here’s why they deserve a spot on your watchlist. Rexas Finance (RXS): An RWA Crypto on the Verge of a Massive Breakout Rexas Finance (RXS) is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about tokens of 2025, and for good reason. With just weeks to go before its official launch, this project has already proven it has what it takes to deliver significant gains, potentially 5 times more than many mainstream altcoins this year. Since the presale began, Rexas Finance has garnered the attention of investors, resulting in its impressive success. So far, the project has raised over 49 million, representing 93% of the presale tokens. Investors’ confidence is at an all-time high, with large investors buying and positioning themselves ahead of the token launch. Rexas Finance’s mission is to make real-world asset (RWA) tokenization accessible to everyone. That means giving people the tools to turn physical assets like real estate, luxury items, and more into blockchain-based tokens that can be traded, staked, or used in DeFi. Rexas Finance goes beyond its vision, having already designed an ecosystem that will make tokenization and DeFi investment accessible to even those with limited capital. It’s no-code Rexas Token Builder lets anyone create asset-backed tokens in just minutes. The QuickMint Bot takes it even further, allowing users to tokenize assets through Telegram and Discord even without technical knowledge. That kind of ease of use is what makes Rexas Finance different, and it’s what’s drawing in thousands of new holders. Rexas Finance crossed the 50,000 holder milestone in February during its presale, an impressive sign of demand before it even hits major exchanges. RXS has already jumped 566% in presale value, moving from $0.03 to $0.20, with an official listing price set at $0.25. Analysts say that once trading begins and the exchange listings go live, RXS could look at 100x returns within the current cycle. Beyond the hype, there’s real momentum. Over $49 million has been raised in presale funds, and the team has completed a full CertiK audit with zero critical issues. This has given investors more confidence in the project’s security and long-term roadmap. The token launch is scheduled for June 19, and the countdown is on. Rexas Finance is building a full ecosystem. With AI tools for NFT creation, fractional real estate ownership with passive stablecoin income, and cross-chain staking opportunities, RXS offers something for everyone—from retail traders to institutions. As the crypto market heats up and the narrative around RWA tokenization grows stronger, Rexas Finance is one of the few tokens positioned to lead this next phase. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Quietly Dominating, Ready to Explode Hyperliquid’s HYPE is already outperforming most big names. Despite the broader correction, it’s holding steady above $33 and recently hit an all-time high of $39. HYPE powers the Hyperliquid trading platform, which is gaining serious traction for its smooth user experience and high-speed performance. With limited token supply, real trading demand, and bullish technical patterns, this isn’t just another short-lived pump. Even when analysts flash caution signs, HYPE keeps bouncing back. It’s holding a critical support zone at $29.20 with solid volume behind it. That means buyers are serious. If the crypto market recovers, this token could easily surge past $40. It’s already outranking coins like Sui and sneaking toward the top 10 on CoinMarketCap with zero major marketing. Dogecoin (DOGE): Poised for a Powerful Comeback After a stretch of sideways movement, analysts have spotted a classic bullish signal forming on DOGE’s charts—an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. This setup often hints at the end of a downtrend and the beginning of a fresh rally. Crypto analyst Klejdi Cuni highlighted this pattern on the 1-hour chart, suggesting a short-term breakout could push DOGE toward $0.239 and then $0.25. While these may seem like modest gains, they mark key resistance zones that, once broken, could open the door to much larger price jumps. Adding fuel to the fire, another respected analyst, Ali Martinez, pointed to a TD Sequential buy signal known for predicting short-term rallies. Combined with Dogecoin’s recent higher lows and consolidation near $0.25, this suggests bulls are ready to take charge. As altcoins start gaining steam and meme coin hype returns, Dogecoin could be the dark horse of 2025. With strong technical support and growing momentum, it might deliver 5x returns this cycle. Conclusion Ethereum and Ripple have been in the spotlight, but 2025 belongs to the movers. Rexas Finance is redefining real-world asset tokenization with tools that bring DeFi to the masses. Hyperliquid is already dominating the trading space, and Dogecoin is gearing up for a technical breakout that could shock the market once again. Miss these three tokens now; you might be chasing them later at much higher prices.

For those following cryptocurrency, understanding broader macro trends, including shifts in Asia FX and other Currency Markets , is crucial. Recently, a confluence of factors – primarily escalating Geopolitical Risk in the Middle East and strategic moves by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) – has put significant pressure on Asian currencies while boosting the Japanese Yen . This complex interplay of international tension and central bank action is shaping the immediate outlook for forex traders and investors worldwide. Why is Asia FX Feeling the Pressure? Asian currencies have recently experienced a downturn, dipping against the US dollar and other safe-haven assets. Several factors contribute to this vulnerability: Increased Risk Aversion: Heightened Geopolitical Risk , particularly the tensions between Israel and Iran, prompts investors to move away from assets perceived as riskier, which often includes emerging market and Asian currencies. Capital tends to flow towards safer havens like the US dollar, the Swiss Franc, and the Japanese Yen . Sensitivity to Global Shocks: Asian economies are deeply integrated into global supply chains and trade. Any threat to global stability or trade routes can negatively impact their economic outlook and currency strength. Differential Central Bank Policies: While some global central banks are contemplating rate cuts, others like the BOJ have only recently started moving away from ultra-loose policy. This divergence in BOJ Monetary Policy and that of other regional central banks can create pressure points for Asia FX . Commodity Price Volatility: Rising tensions can impact oil prices and other commodities, affecting the trade balances and inflation outlooks for importing and exporting nations in Asia, further influencing their currencies. This collective pressure leads to depreciation in various Asian currencies, making imports more expensive and potentially impacting inflation targets and economic stability in the region. The Rise of the Japanese Yen: A Safe Haven Amidst Tension? While much of Asia FX has been under pressure, the Japanese Yen has shown relative strength, or at least resilience, and has even firmed up recently. This might seem counterintuitive given Japan’s economic challenges, but it highlights the Yen’s enduring status as a safe-haven currency during times of global uncertainty. When Geopolitical Risk rises, investors often flock to assets perceived as stable and liquid, and the Yen fits this description. Furthermore, recent developments regarding BOJ Monetary Policy have played a significant role. The Bank of Japan’s decision to finally exit negative interest rates and end its yield curve control policy marked a pivotal shift. This move, while modest, signals a potential path towards tighter monetary conditions in Japan, increasing the attractiveness of Yen-denominated assets relative to a period of near-zero or negative rates. This policy pivot, combined with safe-haven demand driven by Geopolitical Risk , has provided a floor, and at times, a boost to the Japanese Yen against many other currencies, including some within Currency Markets in Asia. Decoding BOJ Monetary Policy’s Impact on Currency Markets The Bank of Japan’s recent policy adjustments are perhaps the most significant change in BOJ Monetary Policy in years. After maintaining ultra-low interest rates for an extended period to combat deflation, the BOJ raised its short-term policy rate target to a range of 0% to 0.1%. Key aspects of this shift include: Ending Negative Rates: This move formally concludes an eight-year experiment with negative interest rates. Scrapping Yield Curve Control (YCC): The BOJ will no longer directly control the yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds, allowing market forces more influence. Halting ETF/J-REIT Purchases: The central bank will stop buying exchange-traded funds and Japanese real estate investment trusts, unwinding unconventional stimulus measures. Continued JGB Purchases: The BOJ stated it would continue buying Japanese government bonds, though the amount might decrease over time. This shift in BOJ Monetary Policy reduces the yield differential between Japanese bonds and those in other countries, making the Yen potentially more attractive for carry trades (borrowing in a low-interest currency to invest in a high-interest one). While the initial rate hike was small, the *direction* of policy change is significant for Currency Markets and provides fundamental support for the Japanese Yen , counteracting some of the depreciation pressures it faced when rates elsewhere were much higher. How Does Geopolitical Risk Influence Currency Flows? The current elevated level of Geopolitical Risk stemming from the Middle East conflict has a direct and immediate impact on Currency Markets . Here’s how: Flight to Safety: Investors panic or become cautious, selling assets they perceive as risky (stocks, emerging market bonds, some Asia FX ) and buying traditional safe havens (US Dollar, Gold, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen ). This capital movement directly affects currency valuations. Impact on Oil Prices: The Middle East is a major oil-producing region. Tensions there often lead to spikes in oil prices. For oil-importing nations in Asia, this means higher import costs, potentially widening trade deficits and weakening their currencies. Oil-exporting nations might see their currencies strengthen, but overall risk aversion often outweighs this. Supply Chain Disruptions: While not immediately apparent, prolonged conflict could threaten shipping lanes or supply chains, impacting economies reliant on trade and potentially weakening their currencies. Uncertainty: Markets dislike uncertainty. The unpredictable nature of geopolitical events makes investors hesitant to commit capital to riskier assets, favoring the stability offered by major reserve currencies and safe havens like the Japanese Yen . This heightened Geopolitical Risk environment is a primary driver behind the recent divergence observed between the struggling Asia FX complex and the relatively stronger performance of the Japanese Yen . What’s Next for Asia FX and the Japanese Yen? The outlook for Asia FX and the Japanese Yen remains closely tied to these dominant themes: Geopolitical Risk and central bank policy, particularly BOJ Monetary Policy and the actions of other major central banks like the US Federal Reserve. Key factors to watch include: De-escalation or Escalation: Any significant change in the Middle East situation will immediately impact risk sentiment and currency flows. De-escalation could see some recovery in Asia FX , while escalation would likely boost the Japanese Yen and other safe havens further. Future BOJ Moves: While the BOJ exited negative rates, the pace of future rate hikes is uncertain. Any hints from the BOJ about further tightening or dovish signals could significantly move the Japanese Yen . US Dollar Strength: The US dollar remains a primary safe haven. Its trajectory, influenced by Fed policy and US economic data, will heavily impact all Currency Markets , including Asia FX and the Yen. Economic Data from Asia: Inflation, growth, and trade data from key Asian economies will also play a role in determining the resilience of their currencies against external pressures. For investors, navigating these Currency Markets requires careful attention to both macro-geopolitical developments and specific central bank communications. The current environment underscores the importance of understanding how global risk translates into currency movements. Concluding Thoughts The recent dips in Asia FX and the relative strength of the Japanese Yen are clear indicators of how global Geopolitical Risk and central bank decisions, notably the recent shift in BOJ Monetary Policy , are shaping the landscape of Currency Markets . The tension in the Middle East has amplified demand for safe havens, benefiting the Yen, while simultaneously increasing risk aversion towards other Asian currencies. As these complex dynamics continue to unfold, staying informed about both geopolitical developments and monetary policy shifts will be essential for anyone involved in the forex space or interested in the broader macroeconomic factors influencing global finance.

While both altcoins have their supporters, investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald said he prefers Solana over Ethereum. According to The Block, Cantor Fitzgerald said he supports Solana more as a treasury asset than Ethereum. Solana is a more logical treasury asset than Ethereum, Cantor analysts said, despite Ethereum having wider adoption and higher total locked value. Stating that he focused on three companies that adopted Solana as a treasury asset at this point, Cantor listed them as DeFi Development Corp., Upexi and SOL Strategies. Cantor analysts said the basis for this view is Solana’s potential to strengthen stronger developer growth and future on-chain finance. Analysts have stated that although they prefer Solana to Ethereum, they do not see SOL as a reserve asset similar to Bitcoin. “Developer growth on Solana has far exceeded growth in ETH recently and we expect this to continue. At this point, it makes sense to use SOL as a treasury asset instead of ETH, as SOL is thought to be capable of overtaking ETH, which currently has a market cap that is approximately 259% higher. Just as Bitcoin has established itself as the primary reserve currency or asset for the digital economy, we believe Solana aims to be the technology that powers transactions and marketplaces in the digital economy. We believe that SOL treasury companies are betting that the future of finance will be on-chain and that Solana will be the chain of choice.” Cantor recently set a target of $45 for DeFi Development Corp., $16 for Upexi, and $4 CAD for SOL Strategies. *This is not investment advice.

According to the post , the two most misunderstood components in forecasting XRP’s value are its transactions per second (TPS) and the token’s annual velocity. Future XRP begins by addressing the current capabilities of the XRP Ledger. Under real-world conditions, the ledger handles 1,500 TPS. However, in stress testing environments, it has achieved throughput exceeding 3,400 TPS. He argues that, with enhancements such as validator optimization or horizontal scaling through sidechains, XRP’s infrastructure could realistically scale to 10,000 TPS, or more. This is important, he explains, because TPS directly affects XRP’s annual velocity—the number of times each token is used within a year. For XRP to serve as the backbone for global settlements, velocity must become a key metric in understanding how much transactional volume the network can support, relative to its circulating supply. XRP Circulating Supply vs Total Supply While the total supply of XRP is capped at 100 billion tokens, Future XRP argues that the effective circulating supply could be far lower. He points out that a significant share of XRP is expected to remain in cold storage, be reserved in ETFs , locked in institutional agreements, or allocated for long-term staking . Depending on the scenario, the truly liquid supply could be between 10 and 60 billion XRP. He then uses these ranges to explore how velocity would shift under different TPS levels. At 10,000 TPS, XRP could handle approximately 315.36 billion transactions per year. With 20 billion XRP in circulation, that implies a velocity of 15.8. If supply is at 60 billion, the velocity is 5.26. However, if TPS remains at just 1,500, annual transaction volume drops to 47.3 billion, dramatically reducing velocity. Under this low-performance scenario with 60 billion XRP in circulation, velocity falls to only 0.79 turns. Quantifying XRP’s Role in Global Settlement The analysis then shifts to the potential value XRP might be required to settle in future financial ecosystems. According to Future XRP, the realistic annual settlement volume for XRP ranges between $500 trillion and $1 quadrillion. He clarifies that these figures are not speculative projections but rather reflect portions of established financial systems, such as cross-border payments, foreign exchange (FX) markets, tokenized securities, and derivatives. As a benchmark, he cites the SWIFT network, which processes over $5 trillion daily. Ripple, the company behind the XRP Ledger, has previously stated its goal to capture a 10–14% share of that market . When extended to include other forms of institutional and governmental settlement, Future XRP asserts that $1 quadrillion per year is a conservative long-term estimate, especially by 2030. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Applying the MV = PQ Formula Using the standard equation from monetary theory, MV = PQ (where M is the circulating supply, V is velocity, and Q is the total value transacted), Future XRP illustrates the relationship between XRP’s technical utility and price. Under a high-performance setup—10,000 TPS and a 20 billion circulating supply—XRP achieves 15.8 annual velocity. To settle $1 quadrillion in volume, the price per XRP would be calculated as: Price = 1,000,000,000,000,000 ÷ (20,000,000,000 × 15.8) = $3,165 per XRP. Even with a 60 billion supply, the price still aligns closely at $3,145 due to the inverse relationship between velocity and supply. However, under lower performance conditions, with TPS limited to 1,500 and a 60 billion supply, the token’s velocity falls drastically, and the model demands a far higher price of over $21,000 per XRP to settle the same volume. Conclusion Based on Mathematical Models Future XRP concludes by emphasizing that XRP’s potential valuation is a function of its practical use in global financial infrastructure. According to his analysis, hype and market sentiment are not central to understanding XRP’s trajectory. Instead, pricing models derived from real transaction throughput and supply dynamics make a strong case for a four- or five-digit valuation if XRP is to fulfill a global settlement role. His argument rests on calculations rather than conjecture, highlighting the role of TPS and velocity in determining the token’s necessity-driven price.

Since January, it has surged over 30%, shooting past $3,403 after briefly topping $3,500 in April. That’s a rejection of Treasurys, the yen, and the Swiss franc. Investors and central banks are piling into gold, not because it’s shiny, but because the old safety nets are unraveling in real time. According to CNBC, every corner of the financial world is now watching bullion claim the throne as the new crisis asset of choice. At the annual Asia Pacific Precious Metals Conference, Metals Focus managing director Nikos Kavalis explained why this is happening: “Gold’s key advantage is that it is no one else’s liability.” Holding bonds or fiat currencies means trusting the governments behind them. That trust is evaporating fast, especially in 2025, as fiscal policies from Washington to Tokyo turn unhinged. Treasurys fall, dollar weakens, central banks dump risk The US dollar index is down nearly 10% this year. The Japanese yen and Swiss franc gained 8% and 10% respectively, but that hasn’t saved their reputation. The yield on 10-year Treasurys dropped 19 basis points, signaling investor nervousness, not confidence. But none of that compares to gold, which keeps pushing record highs as chaos spreads. Shaokai Fan, global head of central banks at the World Gold Council, said the fear runs deep: “There’s a growing sense of just not being sure what the future of the US dollar and US Treasury market is going to be.” In April, President Donald Trump rolled out his “reciprocal” tariff policy. Treasurys got hammered. Then in May, Moody’s downgraded the US credit rating. Trump’s new tax bill followed, triggering another exit from long-term debt. The 30-year Treasury yield busted through 5%, and the damage stuck. The recovery in demand for US bonds hasn’t restored faith. Japan didn’t escape the selloff either. Yields on 10-year Japanese bonds are up 39 basis points since January. That means investors are walking away. The Bank of Japan hasn’t done much to fix that—keeping interest rates at 0.5% during both its May and June meetings. That interest rate differential makes the yen less attractive: people just don’t want to park their money in a place where they’ll earn nothing. Swiss franc gets less sexy, gold pulls in record central bank buyers The Swiss franc is up, but it’s not enough. The Swiss National Bank cut its policy rate to 0.25% in March. Consumer prices dropped in May for the first time in over four years, and that’s raised expectations of negative interest rates returning. That alone kills the franc’s appeal. Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities, said: “If the Swiss now have negative rates, and if I buy a franc, I’m not getting a lot of returns.” That’s why central banks are going heavy on gold. In 2024, they added 1,044.6 tons of it to their reserves—the third straight year they crossed the 1,000-ton line. By the end of that year, the European Central Bank confirmed that gold overtook the euro to become the second-largest reserve asset globally. It now makes up 20% of all official reserves. This year, it’s not slowing down. A fresh survey by the World Gold Council shows 95% of central banks expect to increase gold holdings in the next 12 months—the highest reading since the survey started in 2018. Meanwhile, three-quarters of them think their US dollar holdings will shrink over the next five years. Geopolitical tension is also changing storage behavior. Central banks no longer feel safe keeping all their bullion in New York or London. In February, Trump publicly questioned whether gold had gone missing from Fort Knox, making foreign officials even more nervous. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York holds bullion on behalf of foreign central banks—but trust is wearing thin. India repatriated over 100 tons from the Bank of England in 2024. Nigeria followed suit. In the same WGC survey, 7% of respondents said they were planning to store more gold locally—the most since the pandemic. The goal? Make sure the asset is actually reachable during a crisis or in case of sanctions. The reasons they’re buying are clear. In the survey, central banks said gold’s reliability during crises, its zero default risk, and its ability to hedge against inflation were the main factors behind the buying spree. Ever since the US went after Russia’s access to the global financial system after the Ukraine invasion, more countries started looking for financial insurance.

Rate Cuts Look Unlikely… For Now https://t.co/lgG5fx58Hd — The All-In Podcast (@theallinpod) June 17, 2025 According to prediction market Polymarket, there’s a 98% chance the Fed rate cuts will hold steady in June, and nearly 87% expect no changes in July either. While inflation is easing and GDP growth remains steady, Chamath argues the Fed’s reluctance to cut rates stems from political caution, not a lack of economic justification. Chamath’s $600B Scenario On the All-In Podcast, Chamath proposed a scenario in which the Fed slashes rates by a full percentage point. He explained such a move would have immediate and powerful effects in the long run, as the government could save around $300 billion in interest payments, and cheaper borrowing costs would stimulate short-term lending and business activity. Combined with Trump’s projected $300 billion in added tariff revenues, that’s $600 billion in potential fiscal gains. Hence, “If you make that cheaper, people borrow more money. That fuels more growth, and that will end up in GDP,” Chamath said, noting that the resulting economic boost could even outweigh a slight rise in inflation. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : FOMC Meeting Today: What to Expect from Jerome Powell Speech and FED Interest Rate , So Why Not Cut Rates Now? If such a move could generate strong growth and fiscal savings, Chamath questioned why the Fed wouldn’t act. In his view, the Fed may be holding back to avoid stirring up political issues before the next elections. So even though the numbers suggest a rate cut makes sense, Chamath thinks the Fed is being careful because of how it might look politically. If inflation drops closer to 2%, Palihapitiya expects the Fed will face pressure to justify keeping rates high. Should rate cuts happen, he says it’ll fuel confidence in U.S. markets, with global capital flowing into American assets. Echoing a similar sentiment, Crypto analyst Weaver, in his X post , explained that the Federal Reserve tends to follow the direction of the 2-year Treasury yield. If strong buying pressure pushes the 2-year yield lower, it gives the Fed room to cut interest rates. In short, you have to watch the 2-year yield; when it drops, rate cuts are likely to follow. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Both Ripple and the SEC have asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to delay the appeals process until August 15, 2025. This means the case will not move forward for at least two more months. But why the delay? Why the Delay Till August 15? The main reason for this delay is that Ripple and the SEC are trying to finalize a settlement agreement. Earlier this year, in April, the two sides said they were trying to reach a final settlement and asked the court for an “indicative ruling” to help move the process forward. The idea was to modify an earlier judgment—specifically, to lift the permanent injunction against Ripple and cut down the penalty from $125 million to $50 million. But in mid-May, that first attempt hit a roadblock. Judge Analisa Torres denied their joint motion, saying it didn’t meet the rare, “exceptional circumstances” needed to change a final ruling. Second Try—Still Waiting Not giving up, Ripple and the SEC filed a new motion on June 12, asking the district court to dissolve the injunction against Ripple and to adjust the penalty distribution.

At the forefront of this transformation is the news that Deutsche Bank tokenization efforts are moving forward significantly. Germany’s largest commercial bank is making waves with its plan to launch a minimum viable product (MVP) of its ambitious blockchain-based asset tokenization platform. Deutsche Bank Tokenization Platform: What’s the Plan? According to reports from WatersTechnology, Deutsche Bank is targeting November 2025 for the launch of its asset tokenization platform MVP. This development stems from the bank’s ‘Dama 2’ initiative, a strategic project focused on exploring and implementing distributed ledger technology (DLT) solutions. The primary goal of this platform is to provide financial institutions – including asset managers and wealth advisors – with the tools they need to create and manage tokenized assets . This move signals a strong commitment from a major global bank to leverage the potential of DLT for core financial activities. Understanding Asset Tokenization and Its Potential At its core, asset tokenization involves representing ownership rights or value of an asset (like real estate, art, stocks, or even funds) as a digital token on a blockchain or other DLT. This process can potentially: Increase liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets. Reduce intermediaries and associated costs. Enable fractional ownership. Improve transparency and auditability. Speed up transaction and settlement times. Deutsche Bank’s platform aims to make this process more accessible and cost-effective for financial firms looking to dip their toes into or expand their use of asset tokenization platform capabilities. The Significance of Institutional Tokenization When a major player like Deutsche Bank enters the fray, it lends significant credibility and momentum to the adoption of DLT in traditional finance. This focus on institutional tokenization is crucial because it addresses the needs and compliance requirements of large-scale financial operations. The platform’s design, specifically tailored for asset managers and wealth advisors, suggests a focus on streamlining complex processes involved in managing diverse portfolios. One of the key selling points highlighted is the reduction of upfront infrastructure and hardware costs. This is a significant barrier for many firms considering tokenization, and Deutsche Bank’s solution aims to lower this entry hurdle, potentially accelerating wider adoption within the financial sector. Why is Blockchain in Finance Gaining Traction? The integration of blockchain in finance is not a new concept, but it’s moving beyond experimental stages into practical applications. Banks and financial institutions are exploring DLT for various use cases, including payments, trade finance, and increasingly, asset tokenization. The benefits of immutability, transparency (when designed appropriately), and efficiency offered by blockchain technology align well with the requirements of modern financial systems. Deutsche Bank’s Dama 2 initiative is a prime example of how large institutions are strategically exploring these technologies to stay competitive and create new business models. What Does This Mean for Tokenized Assets? The launch of platforms like Deutsche Bank’s could significantly boost the market for tokenized assets . By providing a reliable and cost-effective infrastructure, the bank is enabling more types of assets to be tokenized and traded. This could lead to a proliferation of tokenized securities, funds, and other financial instruments, potentially creating more efficient and accessible markets. While the MVP in November 2025 is just the first step, it lays the groundwork for potentially much larger-scale tokenization efforts within the traditional financial system. Looking Ahead: The Path Post-MVP The MVP launch in November 2025 will likely focus on specific use cases or a limited set of clients. The success of this initial phase will be critical for the platform’s future development and broader rollout. Key factors to watch will include: Client adoption rates and feedback. Regulatory responses to the platform’s operation. The types of assets successfully tokenized. How the platform integrates with existing financial infrastructure. This move by Deutsche Bank is a clear indicator that major financial institutions see a tangible future in tokenization and DLT, moving from exploration to implementation. Conclusion Deutsche Bank’s plan to launch its asset tokenization platform MVP by November 2025 is a significant development in the ongoing convergence of traditional finance and blockchain technology. By focusing on reducing costs and providing essential infrastructure, the bank is aiming to facilitate wider institutional tokenization and unlock the potential of tokenized assets for its clients. This step underscores the growing importance of blockchain in finance and highlights how major players like Deutsche Bank are actively shaping the future of digital asset markets.

In a recent post , DWF Labs CEO and Head of FalconStable, Andrei Grachev announced that the USD-backed stablecoin has been fully integrated into the Kaia ( KAIA ) Chain. The partnership enables the synthetic stablecoin to be embedded into the LINE messenger ecosystem through Kaia. “Together, we bring sustainable and innovative stablecoin yield solutions for more than 250 Millions of Line users BUIDL!” said Grachev in his recent post. By integrating USDf into Kaia Chain, LINE users will be able to access the stablecoin and earn passive yield from its staked product, sUSDf. Falcon Stable is a stablecoin venture established by DWF Labs’ Falcon Financial. Falcon Stable is the DWF Labs’ synthetic stablecoin protocol that enables users to mint a yield-bearing U.S. dollar‑pegged token called USDf. Unlike most stablecoins, Falcon’s USDf allows users to deposit various digital assets, such as other stablecoins like USD Coin ( USDC ) and Tether ( USDT ), major tokens like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and ETH ( ETH ) and even tokenized real-world assets into the protocol. These different assets are then used as collateral to mint USDf. You might also like: Societe Generale-FORGE to launch new USD CoinVertible stablecoin on Ethereum and Solana The stablecoin also offers yield for holders who stake minted USDf. Minted USDf can be staked to receive sUSDf, an interest-bearing version that accrues yield with an APY that has surpassed 22%. At press time, the stablecoin has accumulated a market cap of nearly $560 million and a 24 hour trading volume of more than $1.7 million. Kaia Chain serves as the main web3 infrastructure for the messaging platform, LINE. Kaia powers the Mini Dapp and Dapp Portal within LINE’s messaging app, allowing users to seamlessly access and interact with decentralized applications without the need for web3 onboarding. LINE is a messaging platform popular among East Asians, with a user base of more than 250 million people registered. Back in August last year, LINE began diving into web3 with the integration of mini dApps powered by Kaia blockchain. The Kaia DLT Foundation is an independent body born from the merger of two prominent blockchain projects, from LINE and South Korean tech giant Kakao. The blockchain combines Line’s Finschia blockchain and Kakao’s Klaytn blockchain.

Even though he holds an advisory role at the firm managing the deal, Trump says he has no public involvement . Still, his post on X calling Tron founder Justin Sun a “great friend” and a “crypto icon” has raised eyebrows. So, what’s really going on between Tron, the Trumps, and their growing role in the crypto space? Tron’s Big Nasdaq Move Instead of going the traditional IPO route, Tron is set to go public through a reverse merger with SRM Entertainment, a little-known company based in Florida. SRM recently secured a $100 million investment from an undisclosed backer and plans to rebrand as “Tron.” The company will also start building a crypto treasury by accumulating TRX tokens. Leading the deal is Dominari Securities, a Trump-affiliated firm based in Trump Tower. It’s handling a $210 million stock offering tied to the merger. Both Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. joined Dominari’s advisory board earlier this year. Justin Sun and the Trump Connection Tron founder Justin Sun has been showing up more and more in Trump’s world. He attended the private launch party for Donald Trump’s meme coin, bought a $75 million stake in World Liberty Financial (WLFI), and is now the biggest holder of the $TRUMP token. At a Trump-hosted dinner for the top 220 $TRUMP holders, Sun was gifted a luxury Trump Golden Tourbillon watch. It’s another sign of his growing closeness to the Trump circle. Soon after Sun’s WLFI investment, the U.S. SEC quietly paused its long-running investigation into him and his companies. The probe was focused on possible market manipulation and unregistered securities. Whether that timing is coincidental or not is still up for debate. Donald Trump’s Crypto Cash Flow Donald Trump’s involvement in crypto is growing fast. In 2024, he made $58 million from crypto-related deals – mostly through WLFI token sales. That figure was second only to his hospitality income. And there’s more coming. In 2025, he’s expected to make another $390 million from token sales and gains from his meme coin, which launched earlier this year. Trump is also involved in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs. The SEC recently approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury plan, which includes 85 million shares – 29 million of them tied to convertible notes. Eric Trump Says “No Public Role” But Questions Remain Eric Trump’s statement distancing himself from the Tron deal hasn’t stopped the speculation. His role at Dominari, paired with the family’s expanding crypto activity, makes many wonder what’s really happening behind the scenes. With Tron’s public listing on the way and the Trumps playing a bigger role in the space, there’s no doubt this story is far from over.

On Monday, June 16, 2025, the official platform handles for the Solana-based memecoin launchpad Pump.fun and its co-founder founder Alon Cohen were taken offline from the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). When accessed, each now displays the message “Account suspended,” accompanied by X’s standard notice for violations of its platform rules. Screenshot of Pump.fun’s suspended X profile | Source: X The move appears to be part of a wider enforcement action targeting accounts tied to the memecoin sector. Over 20 accounts have been affected, including those linked to trading platforms BullX, Bloom Trading, GMGN, among others. Many of the suspended accounts are associated with bot infrastructure or automated trading tools, commonly used for launching tokens, sniping early trades, and managing memecoin positions. You might also like: Over 60% pump.fun traders saw losses, less than 0.01% made over $1m While X has yet to issue an official statement, speculation is mounting that the move is largely tied to Pump.fun’s controversial services. Since its debut, the platform has gained massive traction for allowing users to easily create and trade new tokens. However, this ease of access has also fueled a surge in malicious launches, including meme tokens that end in rug pulls or pump-and-dump schemes. This aspect of the platform has often drawn scrutiny, even resulting in two lawsuits earlier in January. Others across the community suggest that the suspensions may be due to the use of third-party APIs by the impacted accounts, a practice X officially banned in January 2023. Neither Pump.fun nor its founder has addressed the X account suspensions, and it remains to be seen whether the removals are temporary or permanent. One of the other affected platforms, GMGN, announced via Telegram that it is aware of the suspension and is in contact with the platform in hopes of restoring access.

In its June 13 filing made public on Monday, Paradigm requested that the court instruct the jury that for Storm to be convicted under federal money transmission laws, there must be clear evidence that he knowingly operated a business that controlled user funds, charged fees for transactions, and knowingly processed funds tied to criminal activity. Paradigm argued that the prosecution’s theory ignores longstanding FinCEN guidance, including 2019 statements issued under the Treasury Department clarifying that developers without control over funds are not money transmitters. “Subjecting a software developer to criminal liability under § 1960 for others’ independent actions, when the software developers had no control over any funds and their only ‘operation’ was creating immutable open-source code, would be as absurd as prosecuting a television manufacturer for state secrets being divulged on-air,” the brief stated. According to the brief, Storm’s role was limited to publishing open-source, self-custodial software. In an accompanying blog post , Paradigm’s chief legal officer Katie Biber and general counsel Gina Moon warned that allowing the charge to proceed could “let unelected prosecutors change the plain meaning of criminal statutes” and threaten people with imprisonment “even if they are following widely-disseminated and accepted regulatory guidance.” You might also like: Paradigm-backed AI startup Succinct launches token to transform contract analysis Industry executives have echoed Paradigm’s concerns in recent months. Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang previously signed a public letter calling for the case to be dismissed. Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko and Bankless co-founder Ryan Sean Adams were among over 250 signatories urging President Trump’s administration to intervene and halt what they described as regulatory overreach. The DeFi Education Fund, which authored the April 28 petition, has argued that the Department of Justice’s approach threatens to criminalize “code-writing itself.” The prosecution has become a flashpoint in ongoing debates over how U.S. law treats open-source development. During Congressional hearings earlier this month, lawmakers raised similar concerns while reviewing the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act. Storm’s legal battle began in August 2023, when U.S. authorities charged him with conspiracy to facilitate money laundering, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitter, and violating U.S. sanctions. He faces up to 45 years in prison if convicted. Storm’s trial is scheduled to begin on July 14 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

According to data from crypto.news, WhiteBIT Coin ( WBT ) surged 32% intraday, forming a sharp breakout candle often referred to as a “god candle,” and reached a new all-time high of $52.27. The rally pushed its year-to-date gains above 110%. With a market cap of $7.43 billion, WBT has overtaken Toncoin ( TON ) and Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) to become the 21st-largest cryptocurrency in the market. The primary catalyst behind the surge was WhiteBIT’s announcement of an exclusive partnership with Juventus, one of Europe’s most iconic football clubs. The deal includes WhiteBIT’s logo being featured on Juventus’ official matchday jerseys, significantly increasing the exchange’s brand visibility across global sports audiences.

Here’s why. In his recent essay “Assume the Position”, Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, explained that the “stablecoin mania” is just getting started, but many retail investors are likely to get burned. Inspired by Circle’s stellar IPO , stablecoins will flood the market, Hayes says, with giants like Meta, X, and Airbnb jumping in, embedding their stablecoins directly into messaging, commerce, and payout systems. That’s great for tech stockholders, but bad for upstart stablecoin issuers who will be crushed by Big Tech’s scale. More importantly, stablecoin issuers are in a weak position because their success depends entirely on its distribution channels. If a company can’t get its coin listed on crypto exchanges, integrated into social media platforms, or adopted by legacy banks, it won’t survive. “… the only question you must ask yourself when evaluating an investment in a stablecoin issuer is this: how will they distribute their product? If they have no distribution, they have no chance of success. And if you can’t easily verify that said issuer has the access to push product through one or more of these channels, run away!” You might also like: “No need to go public:” Tether brushes off IPO talk post Circle debut Hayes believes that the stablecoin bubble will burst after a stablecoin issuer goes public and pulls in billions from unsuspecting investors by “using a combination of financial engineering, leverage, and amazing showmanship.” “A very bankable charismatic individual will get on stage and spew all sorts of nonsense, wave his (most likely a male) hands to and fro, and convince you why the leveraged piece of dogshit he is selling is about to corner the multi-trillion dollar stablecoin total addressable market (TAM),” Hayer writes. However, Hayes warns investors not to short stablecoin stocks just yet, saying, “These new stocks will rip the faces off of shorts.” Circle’s shares will also “continue levitating” in the near term, although Hayes considers it “insanely overvalued.” “Trade this shit like a hot potato,” he cautions, referring to both Circle and stablecoin stocks, in general.

This isn’t just a scaling strategy. It’s a statement about how the future of crypto infrastructure will work. Solana’s modular, L1-integrated extensions preserve validator security, support differentiated consensus and transaction logic, and offer developers more design surface without forcing them to launch new chains or settle for constrained rollups. That’s a big deal for anyone building high-performance applications—from games to decentralized physical infrastructure networks to real-world finance. While Ethereum L2s offload computation and struggle with fragmented liquidity, Solana is building something quieter but more elegant: a unified, highly customizable L1 that treats specialization as a first-class primitive. And in doing so, it might just leapfrog the rollup wars entirely. Customization without fragmentation Ethereum’s L2s were built to scale. Solana’s network extensions were built to specialize. While Ethereum rollups increase throughput, they all run essentially the same playbook: general-purpose blockspace, minimal variation, and fragmented liquidity across siloed chains. The architecture improves efficiency, but not flexibility. Solana takes a different view. Network extensions let developers define their own execution environments from the ground up. They can customize consensus mechanisms, transaction logic, dedicated storage, and isolated environments that don’t compete with mainnet traffic. More importantly, they do it without breaking composability or spinning up entirely new chains. Data availability, Solana style Unlike Ethereum’s standardized rollups, Solana has not mandated a single approach to network extensions. That’s by design. It invites experimentation, so long as extensions validate state transitions and anchor them to layer 1, preserving Solana’s unified state and liquidity. To achieve this, Solana has introduced specialized data lanes, akin to Ethereum’s blobspace for rollups. One of the most promising developments is ZK compression, a joint effort by Helius and Light Protocol. By compressing account state and using zk-proofs to validate state transitions, ZK compression offers a glimpse into how Solana can scale without sacrificing verifiability or speed. Comparing Ethereum’s approach: Throughput over customization While Solana is enhancing execution environments with network extensions, Ethereum is focusing on two major scalability improvements: Layer-2 rollups and preconfirmations. Rollups bundle transactions off-chain, then submit them to Ethereum L1. The tradeoff? Fragmented liquidity and an independent state. Preconfirmations aim to reduce perceived latency by issuing soft guarantees before block inclusion. Useful? Sure. Transformative? Not really. Solana’s approach skips the workaround entirely. With sub-second finality, it doesn’t need preconfirmations. And with network extensions, it avoids the L2 complexity tax by keeping specialized execution environments anchored to a unified chain. Why this matters for builders For developers, network extensions lower the barriers to launching custom environments, without the overhead of managing an entirely new chain or compromising user experience. This unlocks a long tail of blockchain applications that don’t want to live inside generalized blockspace. Customization has already proven its value as a driver of innovation.. Network extensions encourage experimentation by providing secure, flexible execution environments for applications. Specifically, consumer-focused applications—where abstraction and UX optimization are paramount—stand to benefit the most. Applications that stand to benefit include: DeFi: Custom execution environments enable high-frequency trading, low-latency transactions, and built-in regulatory compliance features like KYC enforcement. Supply chain management: Isolated environments facilitate complex logistics workflows, ensuring data integrity and real-time tracking without burdening the mainnet. DePIN and IoT: Extensions can efficiently process data from IoT devices and integrate with blockchain-based DePIN networks. Gaming: Dedicated resources allow for near-instant settlements and optimized in-game economies. What comes next? Network extensions mark a shift in how blockchains can scale—not just by handling more transactions, but by supporting more types of applications. As more developers experiment with specialized execution environments, Solana’s infrastructure could evolve into a network of purpose-built layers that remain unified at the base. This model stands in contrast to the fragmentation creeping into other ecosystems. Rather than offloading scale to separate rollups or appchains, Solana keeps customization close to the core. That reduces friction, preserves composability, and gives developers more room to build without starting from scratch. This approach could yield custom-tailored DeFi platforms, next-gen consumer applications, and institutional blockchain environments compliant with real-world regulations. The success of network extensions will depend on developer adoption, tooling, and real-world deployment. But the early signs are promising. If executed well, this strategy could redefine blockchain infrastructure—shifting the focus from mere scalability to flexibility, adaptability, and application-specific performance.

Its massive online community fuels sudden price movements and surges in trading volume. Yet, for investors looking beyond the social buzz, it’s becoming increasingly clear that hype alone doesn’t sustain long-term gains. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently in Phase 5 of its presale, is steadily gaining real traction—not through trending hashtags, but through growing demand for its decentralized lending protocol and proven development progress. From Meme Power to Protocol Strength Shiba Inu (SHIB)’s journey highlights how internet culture can inflate token value quickly. However, tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB) are not typically backed by functional utility. While community support remains strong, the fundamental purpose of the token has remained limited compared to true DeFi solutions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, is attracting investor attention for a different reason. It is building a permissionless lending ecosystem where real users are preparing to earn revenue from lending out their crypto, all while maintaining full control over their assets via non-custodial smart contracts. The ecosystem will include both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models—offering tangible ways for users to generate income beyond speculation. At the heart of the protocol lies the P2C lending system. Lenders will be able to deposit tokens such as ETH, SOL, USDC, BTC, and others into liquidity pools. These pools will then be accessed by borrowers who must provide sufficient collateral to take out loans. As pool utilization increases, so will interest rates, creating a self-adjusting economic model driven entirely by market supply and demand. This system is designed to let users earn real yield, rather than depending on unsustainable token emissions. To make the experience more accessible, lenders will receive mtTokens in return for deposits. These mtTokens represent the initial deposit plus interest, and can be used within the ecosystem or even traded. For example, a DAI deposit generates mtDAI on a 1:1 basis, with the token accumulating value over time through yield generated in the lending pools. Unlike meme coins that rely solely on buying pressure and community sentiment, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a system where every interest payment has a source—borrower demand. And for users interested in more tailored strategies, the P2P lending model will allow lenders to set individual rates for unique tokens, including popular meme assets like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and DOGE. This flexibility offers a powerful advantage that centralized platforms rarely offer. The ecosystem is already showing signs of strong early momentum. With over $10.7 million raised and more than 12,100 holders on record, the presale is gaining the kind of traction typically seen in more mature protocols. The ongoing $100K giveaway is further encouraging user engagement and expanding the reach of the community. Security with a Stamp of Approval In a DeFi environment where trust is everything, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out with its third-party security verification. The protocol has completed a CertiK audit, a respected industry standard in smart contract evaluation. With a token scan score of 80.00 and a timeline spanning both manual and static analysis, this audit adds a crucial layer of trust for incoming users. As the protocol prepares for public launch, many users are calculating the long-term gains available at the current price of $0.03. For instance, a $2,000 investment at this stage can become $60,000 if the token reaches a 30x valuation after launch. With a total supply of 4 billion tokens and a future listing price of $0.06, early access provides a strategic entry point for those seeking value rooted in actual use cases—not just speculative hype. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not building a token for traders to flip—it is building an economy where participants generate income by supplying liquidity, negotiating direct loans, and contributing to a decentralized treasury. Layer-2 Infrastructure Brings Speed and Efficiency Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also preparing for scalability. By building the protocol with Layer-2 integration in mind, the team aims to address the limitations of traditional DeFi platforms—high gas fees and network congestion. Faster transactions and lower costs will significantly improve usability, especially for users who actively manage positions across the P2P and P2C models. As the lending ecosystem evolves, this Layer-2 foundation will give Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a competitive edge. It will make it easier to support more assets, onboard new users, and process thousands of loan agreements simultaneously—all while preserving decentralization and transparency. MUTM is the core token of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) protocol. Its role extends beyond transactional utility—it serves as a performance-linked indicator of protocol health. The development team has confirmed plans to use a portion of platform profits to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market. Those purchased tokens will then be sent to safety-module participants who stake mtTokens in designated contracts. This mechanism is designed to increase staking participation while reinforcing token value through sustained buy-side pressure. Future Milestones: A Platform Built for Long-Term Adoption While still in presale, the development roadmap indicates that a functional beta version of the Mutuum platform is being prepared besides the token’s launch. The decentralized stablecoin currently under development will further diversify protocol usage. Backed entirely by on-chain collateral and algorithmically controlled, this stable asset is expected to offer a reliable borrowing alternative while simultaneously contributing to protocol growth through interest redirection. Shiba Inu (SHIB)’s viral presence continues to attract retail attention, and such moments of social enthusiasm are part of what keeps the crypto market dynamic. But long-term success depends on more than just engagement metrics. Investors are increasingly shifting focus toward platforms like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), where real utility, sustainable earnings, and advanced technology combine into a single, working system.

Deep Dive: The South Korea Stablecoin Bill Details While the bill covers broader aspects of digital assets, a major highlight is its detailed approach to stablecoin regulation . Stablecoins, designed to maintain a stable value relative to a traditional currency or other asset, have become a critical part of the crypto ecosystem. However, their stability depends heavily on their underlying reserves and operational transparency, issues that have led to significant concerns globally. The proposed South Korean bill addresses these concerns directly by imposing stringent requirements on stablecoin issuers. According to reports, issuers will need to meet a set of 12 specific conditions to operate legally within the country. These conditions are designed to ensure the financial soundness, governance, and transparency of stablecoin operations. Let’s break down some of the key requirements: Capital Requirement: Issuers must hold a minimum capital of at least one billion won, which is approximately $734,000 USD at current exchange rates. This significant financial threshold aims to ensure that issuers have sufficient resources to manage their operations and potentially absorb losses. Executive Eligibility: Executives of stablecoin issuing companies must meet specific eligibility criteria outlined under existing financial company governance laws. This ensures that leadership has the necessary expertise and adheres to high standards of conduct, similar to traditional financial institutions. Clear User Redemption Policies: The bill mandates that issuers establish and clearly communicate policies for users to redeem their stablecoins for the underlying reserve assets or fiat currency. This is crucial for maintaining the ‘stable’ peg and ensuring users can access their funds when needed. Reserve Asset Standards: Strict standards will be set for managing the assets that back stablecoins. This includes rules on what types of assets can be held (e.g., cash, government bonds), how they should be stored, and how frequently reserves must be audited and reported. These requirements signal a clear intent from South Korean regulators to treat stablecoins with the same level of scrutiny as other financial instruments, emphasizing stability and investor protection. Why This Matters for Global Stablecoin Regulation? South Korea’s move is not happening in isolation. Countries worldwide are grappling with how to regulate stablecoins. The collapse of Terra/Luna in 2022 highlighted the potential risks associated with poorly regulated or structured stablecoins, accelerating the push for clearer rules. This South Korea stablecoin bill adds to the growing global trend of bringing stablecoins under tighter regulatory control. We’ve seen similar discussions and proposals in the United States, the European Union (with MiCA regulation), and other jurisdictions. South Korea’s specific approach, particularly the detailed conditions and capital requirements, could serve as a reference point or influence regulatory discussions in other countries. It underscores the international consensus that stablecoins, due to their potential role in payments and the broader financial system, require a robust regulatory framework to mitigate risks related to liquidity, solvency, and transparency. What Does This Crypto Law South Korea Mean for Issuers and Users? For stablecoin issuers looking to operate or continue operating in South Korea, this new crypto law South Korea represents a significant compliance challenge. Meeting the 12 conditions, including the substantial capital requirement and stringent reserve management rules, will require considerable investment in infrastructure, personnel, and legal expertise. On the flip side, for users of stablecoins in South Korea, the bill aims to provide greater confidence and security. Knowing that issuers are subject to strict capital, governance, and reserve standards should reduce the risk of stablecoin de-pegging or issuer insolvency. Clear redemption policies mean users should have reliable access to their funds. This could potentially make stablecoins a more trusted and widely used tool for payments and transfers within the South Korean digital asset market, fostering healthier growth built on a foundation of regulatory clarity and safety. Navigating Digital Asset Regulation in South Korea The proposed bill is a crucial step in the broader landscape of digital asset regulation in South Korea. It signals a shift from a relatively less structured environment to one with specific rules for key components like stablecoins. This move is part of a larger global trend where regulators are defining how cryptocurrencies fit into existing financial systems. While the bill’s full impact will become clearer upon its finalization and implementation, it’s evident that South Korea is positioning itself to create a regulated, yet innovative, digital asset market. Companies operating in or planning to enter the South Korean market must pay close attention to these developments and prepare for increased compliance requirements, particularly concerning stablecoins. This regulatory clarity, while demanding, is often seen as a necessary step for attracting institutional investment and fostering mainstream adoption of digital assets, as it provides a framework of trust and accountability. In conclusion, South Korea’s planned crypto bill, with its detailed requirements for stablecoins including a significant capital threshold, marks a pivotal moment in the country’s approach to digital asset regulation. It reflects a global trend towards stricter oversight of stablecoins and aims to build a more secure and reliable environment for participants in the South Korean crypto market. As the bill progresses through the legislative process, its specific provisions will be closely watched by the international crypto community.

The world of early-stage crypto projects just got a bit more interesting. Binance Alpha, a dedicated showcase platform nestled within the powerful Binance Wallet ecosystem, is set to feature the Matchain (MAT) token starting June 19. This move, announced via Binance’s official communication channels, highlights Matchain MAT as a project gaining traction and community interest. What Exactly is Binance Alpha and Why Does it Matter for Crypto Projects? Think of Binance Alpha as a curated spotlight for promising, early-stage crypto projects . It’s not the main Binance exchange listing platform, but rather a feature within the broader Binance Wallet environment. Its primary goal is to give visibility to tokens that have demonstrated strong community engagement, innovative technology, or alignment with current market trends among emerging projects. For nascent crypto projects like Matchain MAT, being selected for Binance Alpha offers significant benefits: Increased Visibility: Gaining exposure within the massive Binance ecosystem immediately puts the project in front of a large, active user base interested in crypto. Community Growth: The spotlight can attract new community members, developers, and potential investors. Validation (Partial): While not a full endorsement or guaranteed crypto listing , inclusion suggests the project has met certain initial criteria assessed by Binance’s team. Potential for Future Growth: Strong performance and continued development while featured on Alpha could potentially pave the way for deeper integration or even a full crypto listing on the main Binance exchange down the line (though this is explicitly NOT guaranteed). This platform serves as a bridge, allowing users within the Binance Wallet to discover and potentially interact with tokens before they might hit the mainstream trading markets. Meet Matchain MAT: What Do We Know? Based on the announcement, Matchain (MAT) is the project stepping into the Binance Alpha spotlight. While specific details about Matchain’s technology, use case, and roadmap would require a deep dive into the project’s own documentation (website, whitepaper, etc.), its selection by Binance Alpha suggests it fits the criteria of an engaging and potentially trend-aligned emerging project. Users interested in Matchain MAT should conduct their own thorough research into its fundamentals, team, tokenomics, and community before considering any involvement. Key aspects to research about Matchain MAT would typically include: The core problem the project aims to solve. The technology stack or blockchain it utilizes. Its target market or user base. The utility and distribution of the MAT token. The strength and activity of its community. Understanding these elements is crucial for anyone looking at crypto projects featured on platforms like Binance Alpha . Understanding the Crucial Caveat: Binance Alpha vs. Full Crypto Listing This is perhaps the most critical point for users and potential investors to grasp. The announcement clearly states that inclusion on Binance Alpha does NOT guarantee a future crypto listing on the main Binance exchange. This distinction is vital for managing expectations and assessing risk. Think of it this way: Feature Binance Alpha Inclusion Full Binance Crypto Listing Platform Featured within Binance Wallet Tradable on Binance Exchange (Spot, Futures, etc.) Availability Showcased to Binance Wallet users Available for trading to all eligible Binance users globally Selection Criteria Community engagement, market trends among emerging projects More rigorous review: technology, team, market demand, compliance, etc. Trading Typically no direct trading pairs on Binance Exchange (users might need to acquire elsewhere) Official trading pairs (e.g., MAT/USDT, MAT/BTC) Guarantee of Future Listing NO GUARANTEE Is the listing itself While being on Binance Alpha is a positive signal and provides exposure, it’s a separate process from the stringent evaluation required for a full crypto listing . The journey from Alpha to a main exchange listing, if it happens at all, is often long and depends on the project’s continued performance, adoption, and meeting Binance’s evolving listing standards. Actionable Insights for Those Watching Matchain MAT and Binance Alpha For individuals interested in Matchain MAT or keeping an eye on projects featured on Binance Alpha , here are some key takeaways and actions: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): This cannot be stressed enough. Don’t treat the Binance Alpha inclusion as an implicit endorsement for investment. Investigate Matchain’s fundamentals independently. Understand Binance Alpha’s Role: Recognize that it’s a discovery platform within the Binance Wallet , not a trading launchpad on the main exchange. Assess Risk: Early-stage crypto projects are inherently high-risk. They may face significant volatility, development challenges, or fail to gain traction. Only consider exposure if you are comfortable with potential total loss. Monitor Community and Development: Since Binance Alpha considers community engagement and trends, observe how the Matchain MAT community reacts and how the project progresses after the June 19th feature date. Manage Expectations: Do not assume a quick crypto listing on the main Binance exchange is imminent or guaranteed. Plan based on the project’s own merits, not solely on its Alpha status. Utilizing Binance Wallet to potentially interact with featured projects requires understanding the wallet’s functionalities and associated risks. Challenges Early Crypto Projects Face (and How Alpha Might Help) Early crypto projects navigate a challenging landscape. They need to build technology, find product-market fit, attract users, and build a strong community, often with limited resources and intense competition. Gaining visibility is one of the biggest hurdles. This is where Binance Alpha provides a potential advantage. By featuring projects like Matchain MAT , it helps them overcome the initial visibility barrier. However, the fundamental challenges remain: Adoption: Can the project attract real users and achieve widespread adoption? Sustainability: Is the business model and tokenomics sustainable long-term? Competition: How does it stack up against similar projects? Regulation: How will evolving regulations impact the project? Execution: Can the team deliver on their roadmap? Being on Alpha doesn’t solve these core challenges, but the increased attention might provide the necessary boost in community and resources to better address them. Summary: A New Chapter for Matchain MAT on Binance Alpha The addition of Matchain MAT to Binance Alpha on June 19 marks an exciting step for the project, granting it valuable exposure within the extensive Binance Wallet user base. As a platform designed to showcase promising, community-driven crypto projects , Binance Alpha serves as an important discovery tool. However, it is crucial for everyone in the crypto space to remember that this feature is distinct from a full crypto listing on the main Binance exchange and comes with no guarantee of one. Users interested in Matchain MAT should approach with informed caution, conducting thorough research and understanding the inherent risks associated with early-stage ventures. This development offers an opportunity for the Matchain project to gain momentum and for users to explore a potentially interesting new project within the familiar environment of the Binance ecosystem.
