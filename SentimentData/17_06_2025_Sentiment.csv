Ben Zhou, the exchange’s CEO, shared details about the project on his X account. Byreal is the name of this new decentralized exchange (DEX) that will start to operate by the end of the month. Announcing Byreal — our first onchain DEX incubated by Bybit, will be LIVE by end of the month. Starting from scratch and now born on Solana. what's special: 1/ CEX + DEX synergy Byreal isn’t “just another DEX.” It’s combining CEX-grade liquidity with DeFi-native transparency.… https://t.co/JU60e4zHQ4 — Ben Zhou (@benbybit) June 15, 2025 Zhou emphasized that Byreal combines “CEX-grade liquidity with DeFi-native transparency.” It will offer low slippage and prevent miners’ manipulation through MEV protection. Byreal will directly compete with leading decentralized solutions within the Solana ecosystem like Raydium, Orca, and PumpSwap. The token’s significant uptick in the past day indicates how excited market participants are for the news as it could attract significant transaction volumes to this blockchain. The news favors a bullish Solana price prediction. Solana Price Prediction: SOL Eyes Retest of $185 After Support Bounce Solana DEX volumes in the past 24 hours stood at $1.8 billion while they rose by 10.2% in the past 30 days to $77.43 billion according to data from DeFi Llama . The above-mentioned three DEXs account for more than three-quarters of that total with Raydium leading the pack with a 29% market share. Looking at the daily chart, Solana (SOL) has bounced for a third time off the $140 level in the daily chart to solidify the importance of this key threshold. Meanwhile, trading volumes in the past 24 hours have nearly doubled. The price has hit a key resistance at $155. This level acted as a ceiling for the price action previously. If SOL breaks out above this threshold and retests it from above it will confirm a clear runway to $185. Momentum indicators favor a bullish outlook as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has jumped above the 14-day moving average. As the Solana network prepares to receive higher transaction volumes from Byreal, the need for a scaling solution like Solaxy (SOLX) is more evident than ever. This is one of the hottest crypto presales of the year and it is about to end. Solaxy (SOLX) Enters Last 2 Days of Its Presale with $52M Raised Solana has struggled to keep up with rising transaction volumes during peak usage periods like January this year when TRUMP and MELANIA were launched. Solaxy (SOLX) is a layer-2 scaling protocol for the Solana blockchain that bundles transactions offline in a side chain to alleviate the mainnet’s burden. The developing team has already launched the Solaxy testnet and will launch the mainnet this month. A block explorer is available so investors can check the solution’s performance in real time before its official rollout. With just 2 more days ahead before the end of its successful presale, this is the last opportunity that investors will have to grab $SOLX at its heavily discounted presale price of $0.001764. This token will see a spike in its demand once the solution is embraced by top wallets and exchanges. In addition, the project offers attractive staking rewards that currently sit at 80%. To buy $SOLX, simply head to the Solaxy website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or SOL or use a bank card to invest.

Shareholders of Japan-listed company Beat Holdings are making waves with an ambitious push: they’re urging the company to raise a substantial ¥799 billion (approximately $5.6 billion) specifically for a significant Bitcoin acquisition . This bold move, reported by The Bitcoin Historian on X, signals a growing appetite among traditional companies, even in Japan’s sometimes cautious market, to embrace digital assets. Why Are Beat Holdings Shareholders Eyeing a Major Bitcoin Acquisition? The primary driver behind this intriguing shareholder proposal is a desire for Beat Holdings to compete directly with the increasingly prominent Metaplanet strategy . Metaplanet, another Japan-based firm, has garnered significant attention recently for adopting a treasury strategy heavily focused on accumulating Bitcoin. This approach mirrors that of pioneers like MicroStrategy in the U.S. Metaplanet’s stock price has seen notable movements tied to its Bitcoin buys, catching the eye of investors and potentially inspiring others in the Japan crypto market . Shareholders advocating for this massive fund believe that a strategic investment in Bitcoin could: Provide a hedge against currency devaluation (like the Yen). Offer significant potential for capital appreciation in the long term. Enhance the company’s balance sheet strength. Attract a new class of investors interested in crypto-exposed equities. Position Beat Holdings as a forward-thinking leader in the digital asset space within Japan. The proposed ¥799 billion fund is earmarked to acquire up to 50,000 Bitcoin. To put that into perspective, 50,000 BTC represents a substantial holding, potentially placing Beat Holdings among the ranks of major corporate Bitcoin holders globally, though still behind giants like MicroStrategy. Understanding the Metaplanet Strategy and Its Influence Metaplanet’s decision to pivot towards a Bitcoin-centric treasury reserve asset strategy has been a significant story in the Japan crypto market . Instead of holding traditional cash reserves that are subject to inflationary pressures, Metaplanet has opted to convert portions of its treasury into Bitcoin. This strategy is predicated on the belief that Bitcoin, with its fixed supply and decentralized nature, serves as a superior store of value in the long run compared to fiat currencies. Key aspects of the Metaplanet strategy include: Treasury Transformation: Shifting from Yen-denominated cash reserves to Bitcoin. Capital Raises: Utilizing various financing methods (like debt or equity raises) specifically to fund Bitcoin purchases. Investor Communication: Being transparent about their Bitcoin holdings and strategy to attract like-minded investors. This approach has not been without its risks, as the price of Bitcoin is volatile. However, for companies like Metaplanet and potentially Beat Holdings, the perceived long-term benefits outweigh the short-term price fluctuations. The success and visibility of Metaplanet’s strategy have clearly served as a catalyst for this bold shareholder proposal at Beat Holdings. What Are the Benefits and Challenges of Such a Large Bitcoin Acquisition? Embarking on a large-scale Bitcoin acquisition presents both compelling opportunities and significant hurdles for a company like Beat Holdings . Potential Benefits: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s limited supply makes it attractive as a hedge against the potential devaluation of fiat currencies. Growth Potential: Historically, Bitcoin has shown significant price appreciation over multi-year periods, offering potential returns far exceeding traditional assets. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin to the balance sheet can help diversify corporate reserves. Attracting Investment: A clear Bitcoin strategy can appeal to a growing segment of investors interested in digital assets. Potential Challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile, which could lead to significant fluctuations in the company’s reported asset values and potentially impact earnings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, particularly for corporate holdings, is still evolving globally and within Japan. Custody and Security Risks: Safely storing and managing a large amount of Bitcoin requires specialized expertise and robust security measures to prevent loss or theft. Accounting Treatment: Accounting rules for holding cryptocurrencies can be complex and may require mark-to-market adjustments that impact financial statements. Shareholder & Board Alignment: Not all shareholders or board members may agree with such a high-risk, non-core investment strategy. The proposal itself highlights that this is being pushed by *some* shareholders. The success of this shareholder proposal will depend heavily on Beat Holdings’ ability to navigate these challenges while capitalizing on the potential benefits. Comparing Strategies: Beat Holdings’ Proposal vs. Metaplanet’s Holdings While both companies are based in Japan and are looking towards Bitcoin, the proposed scale of Beat Holdings’ potential acquisition is noteworthy when compared to Metaplanet’s current known holdings (as of recent reports). Let’s look at a simplified comparison: Company Proposed/Known Bitcoin Holdings (Approx.) Funding Strategy (Proposed/Used) Beat Holdings (Proposed) Up to 50,000 BTC Raising ¥799B fund Metaplanet (Known) Significantly less than 50,000 BTC (specific number fluctuates with buys) Equity/Debt Financing, Treasury Cash Note: Metaplanet’s exact holdings change as they make further purchases. This table is illustrative based on public reports regarding their strategy. The scale of the proposed Bitcoin acquisition by Beat Holdings is ambitious and, if successful, would represent one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holdings outside of MicroStrategy. This underscores the potential impact such a move could have on both the company’s future and the broader perception of corporate crypto adoption in Japan. What’s Next for Beat Holdings and the Shareholder Proposal? A shareholder proposal is just the first step in a potentially long process. For this proposal to move forward, it would typically need to gain traction among a significant portion of shareholders and ultimately receive approval from the company’s board of directors. The board will need to carefully evaluate the risks and rewards, consider the feasibility of raising such a large sum, and assess the potential impact on the company’s core business and overall financial health. Key factors that will influence the outcome include: The level of support among major shareholders. The board’s risk tolerance and view on digital assets. The company’s ability to successfully raise the necessary ¥799 billion fund. The prevailing market conditions for Bitcoin and the broader economy. Regulatory developments in the Japan crypto market . The outcome of this proposal could set a precedent for other Japanese companies considering similar treasury strategies. It’s a story worth following closely for anyone interested in corporate finance, the evolution of treasury management, and the continued integration of Bitcoin into the traditional financial system. Actionable Insights for Investors and Observers For those watching this space, the situation with Beat Holdings and the proposed Bitcoin acquisition offers several points to consider: Monitor Shareholder Activism: Pay attention to shareholder proposals related to crypto adoption in publicly traded companies. This indicates growing investor interest. Track Corporate Treasury Strategies: Observe how companies like Metaplanet and potentially Beat Holdings implement and manage their Bitcoin holdings. This provides real-world examples of corporate crypto adoption. Evaluate Company Fundamentals: When considering investments in companies adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies, look beyond the crypto holdings and assess the strength of their core business. Understand Market Context: Developments in the Japan crypto market and regulatory environment can significantly impact companies operating there. This development underscores that the trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption is not limited to Western markets and is gaining momentum in Asia, driven by factors like inflation concerns and the desire to emulate successful strategies like the Metaplanet strategy . A Bold Vision for Beat Holdings’ Future? The proposal for Beat Holdings to raise ¥799 billion for a massive Bitcoin acquisition is undoubtedly bold. It reflects a significant shift in how some investors view corporate treasury management and the potential role of digital assets. While the outcome remains uncertain, the very existence of such a high-profile shareholder proposal highlights the increasing legitimacy and appeal of Bitcoin as a reserve asset, even in traditional financial circles within the Japan crypto market . It’s a fascinating development that could pave the way for more Japanese companies to explore similar strategies, further bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset world.

The Cardano Foundation reported that a total of 2,004 decentralized applications are developing and expanding their projects within this blockchain as of June 13, 2025. Meanwhile, the number of native assets minted on the Cardano blockchain currently sits at 10.83 million while transaction volumes rose by 0.2% compared to the previous week to stand at 110.40 million. The number of smart contracts – known as Plutus and Aiken scripts – will soon surpass the 140,000 mark. These figures point to Cardano’s robust and continually-expanding ecosystem. Although the network has been criticized in the past for missing out on some top trends in the crypto space like DeFi and meme coins, there are still developers who are betting on the future of this blockchain as the preferred alternative to deploy real-world applications. Minswap is currently the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) in the Cardano network with 30-day trading volumes of $79 million. Meanwhile, Liqwid is the largest decentralized application. It specializes in lending and currently has a total value locked (TVL) of $80.9 million. The combined TVL of Cardano dApps currently sits at $285 million as per data from DeFi Llama. This is a tiny fraction of Solana’s $8.8 billion TVL and just a breadcrumb of Ethereum’s massive $62.9 billion ecosystem. However, the founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson, has always emphasized that his network’s ambitions are centered on powering real-world applications rather than just DeFi apps. Ecosystem growth is robust according to these latest figures and that favors a bullish Cardano price prediction. Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Could Rise to $1 If This Happens Cardano (ADA) recovered during the week after a 4-day losing streak. The $0.600 level seems to have acted as strong support for the price action and could trigger a move toward the $0.7500 resistance in the near term. The price is currently sitting below its short-term and long-term moving averages and these are currently the key resistances to watch for ADA. A breakout above these markers would favor a bullish Cardano price prediction. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) seems poised to send a buy signal if it rises above the 14-day moving average. If the price rises above $0.730 and retests that level from above, this would confirm a bullish outlook that could push ADA to $1. This means an upside potential of 37% for the token. Apart from Cardano, the Bitcoin blockchain is has significant untapped potential for the development of DeFi applications. A new crypto presale called Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) aims to launch a layer-2 scaling solution that will make it possible for these dApps to thrive and unlock trillions of dollars in liquidity that would flow to Bitcoin native protocols. Bitcoin Hype (HYPER) Raises More than $1M in Less Than 15 Days Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) aims to makes the top crypto’s blockchain a suitable home for meme coins, payment platforms, DeFi applications and more. The developing team aims to achieve this through the launch of a robust side chain powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). The solution will act as a bridge between the two blockchains to facilitate cheap and fast asset transfers of BTC tokens. The demand for HYPER, the native asset of this L2, will skyrocket once the protocol is launched and becomes adopted by top wallets and exchanges. To buy $HYPER at its discounted presale price, head to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or BTC for this token or use a bank card to invest.

ADA’s XRP Yields, Bitcoin’s Gold Faceoff, and Qubetics’ 28K Holders",https://thecoinrise.com/top-crypto-coins-to-buy-now-adas-xrp-yields-bitcoins-gold-faceoff-and-qubetics-28k-holders/,"As crypto markets push deeper into 2025, the debate between innovation and resilience has entered a new chapter. Three coins stand at the crossroads of this dynamic moment: Qubetics , Bitcoin, and Cardano. Each represents a different facet of blockchain evolution, from radical privacy tools to resilient network fundamentals and adaptive scalability. Qubetics features a decentralized VPN (dVPN), redefining how Web3 users access and protect digital content. With major updates and a fast-closing crypto presale, it’s attracting both privacy advocates and serious crypto backers. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s standing as a digital asset is being reassessed amid geopolitical uncertainty, as investors increasingly weigh its position against traditional safe havens like gold. And Cardano is leveraging its layered architecture to pivot toward real-world use cases amid scalability debates. With macroeconomic pressures, shifting regulations, and new decentralized solutions emerging, knowing the top crypto coins to buy now is about timing, technology, and tenacity. Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN: Reclaiming the Internet From Central Control The decentralized VPN built into Qubetics is the centrepiece of a broader vision to reclaim internet sovereignty. Traditional VPNs often store logs, can be compelled to turn over data, or suffer from central points of failure. Qubetics changes the equation by distributing trust. Its dVPN operates on a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer blockchain network. There is no singular authority, no centralized control, and no way for governments or corporations to censor or throttle the system. Using multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption, it masks both user identity and routing metadata. Every connection remains anonymous, with a trustless architecture ensuring verifiable privacy. The dVPN also features tokenized incentives. Users can share unused bandwidth in exchange for $TICS tokens, turning idle resources into rewards. This economic layer strengthens participation and builds out a sustainable node ecosystem. By tying its dVPN into broader decentralized applications, Qubetics reinforces the foundation for DeFi protocols, decentralized storage, and dApps that demand censorship-resistant access. As more of the internet migrates toward tokenized systems, tools like the dVPN become foundational infrastructure amid the top crypto coins to buy now. Qubetics Presale Update: A Rising Opportunity Qubetics has entered its final crypto presale phase, Stage 37, offering $TICS tokens at a fixed rate of $0.3370 with just under 10 million tokens left. Over $18 million has already been raised, and more than 515 million tokens have been sold to more than 28,000 buyers. By cutting the total supply from 4 billion to 1.36 billion, Qubetics has engineered immediate scarcity. And by increasing its public sale allocation to 38.55%, it is handing more control to its users. With fewer tokens and a fairer distribution, Qubetics now stands out among the top crypto coins to buy now, especially for adopters prioritizing transparency, utility, and long-term potential. Growth Scenarios: What $6,000 in Qubetics Could Become Qubetics is on the brink of listing, with analysts forecasting an initial token price of $0.40. If a $6,000 investment is made at the current presale price of $0.3370, it secures approximately 17,802 $TICS tokens. Upon listing at $0.40, the value would rise to $7,120—an instant 18.6% gain. If the token hits $1, that same investment is worth $17,802. At $5, it balloons to $89,010. Should Qubetics reach $10 following its mainnet launch, the investment jumps to $178,020. If the $TICS token touches $15, the final value would be a staggering $267,030. With the dVPN as a key use case, reduced total supply, and momentum from its community-driven distribution, Qubetics could very well surpass expectations. Analysts are watching this project not for speculative buzz but for its grounded fundamentals, placing it firmly among the top crypto coins to buy now. Bitcoin: Is the Digital Gold Narrative Slipping? As geopolitical instability surges, traditional safe-haven assets like gold have soared. Gold recently touched $3,450 per ounce, just shy of its all-time high. Bitcoin, often dubbed “digital gold,” hasn’t kept pace. BTC currently trades 5.3% below its May 22 high of $111,800. While that may suggest resilience, some analysts argue that Bitcoin’s safe-haven appeal is weakening. Instead, it behaves more like a risk asset, echoing moves in US equity markets. Analysts explain that Bitcoin continues to mirror tech-heavy indices. As equity futures rebound, Bitcoin could play catch-up. Holding above its $95,000–$100,000 support zone is crucial. If this support holds, retesting $112,000 becomes feasible, with upside potential toward $116,000 and $120,000. However, caution remains. Bitcoin’s volatility and correlation with liquidity cycles make it vulnerable. Its narrative as a hedge against inflation or war-driven instability is under review. As such, Bitcoin holds its place among the top crypto coins to buy now, not as a hedge, but as a high-risk, high-reward macro play. Cardano’s Midnight: XRP DeFi Yield Revolution Cardano founder Hoskinson proposes using Midnight, a privacy‑centric sidechain, to unlock DeFi yields for XRP holders. Midnight leverages Cardano’s extended UTXO model to enable private smart contracts off the base chain. In 2024, Midnight launched a testnet ahead of a mainnet release later this year. Now, XRP holders may bridge assets into Midnight to earn “much better yields” through liquidity provision and farming. Airdrops under the “Glacier Drop” plan will distribute NIGHT and DUST tokens to 37 million wallets, including XRPL addresses. This aligns with Cardano’s broader vision of cross‑chain modular DeFi and positions it as a leading protocol among the top crypto coins to buy now. Midnight uses privacy-enabled smart contracts without altering Cardano’s base layer. Developers will code in the extended UTXO framework, enabling modular execution, transaction privacy, and side‑chain isolation. Bridging tools will facilitate XRP transfers from XRPL into the Midnight environment. Once bridged, assets can access yield‑based protocols similar to staking, lending, or AMM pools. By retaining privacy while enabling composability, Midnight pioneers a new DeFi paradigm blending secrecy, utility, and interoperability, boosting Cardano into the top crypto coins to buy now narrative. Final Words: Timing the Shift, Not Just the Price—Top Crypto Coins to Buy Now Crypto investment in 2025 is less about wild speculation and more about positioning. Qubetics is rewriting the rules of internet privacy through its dVPN. Bitcoin remains a liquidity-driven instrument with macro potential. Cardano continues to gain traction in key institutional sectors by proposing advanced DeFi tech. Understanding the strengths and trade-offs of each coin is essential. The top crypto coins to buy now are no longer defined by hype alone—they are grounded in architecture, traction, and long-term vision.

It operates on a peer-to-peer blockchain network, eliminating central control and increasing privacy through encryption and decentralization. Is Qubetics’ crypto presale still active? Yes, it’s in its final phase with less than 10 million tokens remaining at a fixed price of $0.3370. Why hasn’t Bitcoin followed gold in recent rallies? Bitcoin currently behaves more like a risk asset than a safe haven, making it sensitive to equities and macro liquidity trends. Is Cardano still a good investment in 2025? Its layered architecture, regulatory alignment, and real-world use cases make it a strong long-term bet. What’s the projected return for $6,000 invested in Qubetics now? If the token hits $15 after launch, the return could be around $267,030. The post Top Crypto Coins to Buy Now?

46167873,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=169469,1750116009,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/46167873.jpeg,Revolutionary Step: France Eyes Nuclear Energy Surplus for Sustainable Bitcoin Mining,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/france-nuclear-bitcoin-mining/,"BitcoinWorld Revolutionary Step: France Eyes Nuclear Energy Surplus for Sustainable Bitcoin Mining Imagine a world where the energy powering the future of finance also helps balance national power grids and utilizes clean energy sources. This isn’t science fiction; it’s potentially the future being shaped in France. Recent developments suggest that French lawmakers are seriously considering a groundbreaking proposal to integrate Bitcoin mining operations into the nation’s existing energy infrastructure, specifically by leveraging the significant surplus generated by its extensive Nuclear energy France network. This bold initiative, initially brought to light via reports from sources like @solidintel_x on X, represents a potentially significant shift in how countries view both cryptocurrency mining and national energy management. By tapping into power that might otherwise go unused or be sold at lower rates, France could position itself as a leader in Sustainable crypto mining , addressing common environmental concerns associated with the industry while simultaneously bolstering its own French energy strategy . What’s Driving This Potential Integration of Bitcoin Mining? At its core, this proposal is driven by a confluence of factors related to energy economics and the evolving landscape of digital finance. France boasts one of the world’s most robust nuclear power programs, providing a large percentage of its electricity. While incredibly reliable, nuclear plants are designed to run continuously at or near full capacity. This can sometimes lead to periods of Energy surplus , particularly during times of low demand or high renewable energy production. Managing this surplus effectively is a constant challenge for grid operators. Simultaneously, Bitcoin mining has emerged as a significant energy consumer globally. The process, which involves powerful computers competing to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and secure the network, requires substantial electricity. This energy demand has often drawn criticism regarding its environmental footprint, especially when powered by fossil fuels. The French proposal sees an opportunity in this dynamic: pair the energy-hungry process of Bitcoin mining with the periods of excess clean energy production from nuclear plants. This could provide a consistent, reliable, and potentially low-cost power source for miners, while also offering the grid a valuable, interruptible load that can consume surplus power when needed, helping to stabilize the network. How Does Nuclear Energy France Fit into the Picture? France’s reliance on nuclear power is a defining feature of its energy profile. Unlike many nations, France made a strategic decision decades ago to invest heavily in nuclear technology to achieve energy independence and reduce carbon emissions. Today, nuclear reactors account for roughly 70% of the country’s electricity generation, making France a global leader in nuclear energy utilization. This extensive infrastructure, while providing clean and stable baseload power, also presents unique challenges in grid management. Nuclear plants are not easily ramped up or down in response to fluctuating demand or variable renewable energy input (like solar or wind). This inflexibility means that during periods of low demand, particularly overnight or on weekends, the grid can experience an Energy surplus . Finding ways to efficiently use or store this surplus energy is crucial for grid stability and economic efficiency. Traditionally, managing surplus involves exporting power, storing it (though large-scale, cost-effective storage is still developing), or in some cases, curtailing production (which is inefficient for nuclear). The idea of directing this surplus to energy-intensive operations like Bitcoin mining offers a novel solution that could be mutually beneficial. Exploring the Potential Benefits of This French Energy Strategy Integrating Bitcoin mining with France’s nuclear surplus could unlock several significant advantages, aligning economic, environmental, and strategic goals: Economic Opportunities: Utilizing surplus energy provides a revenue stream for energy producers that might otherwise be lost. It can also attract Bitcoin mining operations to France, creating jobs (though perhaps not as many as traditional industries, given the automated nature) and potentially generating tax revenue. For miners, access to reliable, potentially cheaper, clean energy is a major operational advantage. Grid Stability and Efficiency: Energy-intensive loads like Bitcoin mining can act as ‘flexible demand.’ When there’s an Energy surplus , miners can increase operations, consuming the excess power. When demand from other sectors is high, mining operations can be curtailed or powered down, freeing up capacity. This interruptible load helps balance the grid, reducing the need for costly curtailment or reliance on less flexible power sources. Promoting Sustainable Crypto Mining: This is perhaps the most compelling benefit from a global perspective. By powering mining with clean, low-carbon nuclear energy, France would significantly contribute to reducing the overall carbon footprint associated with Bitcoin mining . This addresses a major criticism leveled against the industry and promotes a model for Sustainable crypto mining that other nations with significant clean energy sources could potentially emulate. Strategic Integration into French Energy Strategy: Officially incorporating Bitcoin mining into the national energy plan acknowledges its growing importance as an industry and provides a framework for managing its energy needs in a controlled and beneficial manner. It signals France’s willingness to engage with emerging technologies and potentially become a hub for clean crypto operations. Reducing Reliance on Fossil Fuels: By providing a clean power source for mining, this initiative indirectly reduces the pressure on fossil fuel-based electricity generation that might otherwise be used for mining elsewhere. What Challenges Might France Face? While the potential benefits are substantial, implementing such a strategy is not without its hurdles. French lawmakers and energy operators would need to carefully navigate several challenges: Regulatory Framework: Establishing clear regulations for how Bitcoin mining operations can connect to the grid and utilize surplus power is essential. This includes defining tariffs, connection requirements, and protocols for curtailment during peak demand. Infrastructure Requirements: While France has ample generation, ensuring sufficient transmission and distribution capacity to transport surplus power to potential mining sites is necessary. Mining facilities also require specific infrastructure, including cooling systems and secure locations. Public Perception: Despite using clean energy, the energy consumption of Bitcoin mining remains a topic of public debate. Educating the public about the ‘surplus utilization’ aspect and the benefits for grid stability will be crucial to garnering support. Market Dynamics: The profitability of Bitcoin mining is highly dependent on the price of Bitcoin and the cost of electricity. While surplus energy might be cheaper, ensuring long-term viability for miners requires stable energy pricing and a favorable regulatory environment. Technical Integration: Seamlessly integrating energy-intensive, interruptible loads like mining farms into the existing grid management system requires sophisticated technical solutions and coordination between grid operators and mining companies. Addressing these challenges effectively will require careful planning, collaboration between the energy sector and the crypto industry, and potentially new policy innovations as part of the broader French energy strategy . Examples and Global Context: Is France Alone in This Thinking? France’s proposal, while potentially revolutionary in its scale due to the nation’s nuclear capacity, is part of a broader global trend exploring how energy-intensive computing, including Bitcoin mining , can be integrated with energy production, particularly surplus or otherwise wasted energy. For instance: Utilizing Flare Gas: In regions with significant oil and gas production (like parts of the US, Canada, and Africa), miners are setting up operations to use natural gas that would otherwise be flared (burned off). This turns waste energy into productive output and reduces methane emissions compared to flaring. Geothermal Energy: Countries with abundant geothermal resources, like Iceland and El Salvador, are using this clean, renewable energy source to power mining operations. Hydroelectric Power: Regions with significant hydroelectric capacity, such as parts of China (though regulations have changed), Canada, and Scandinavia, have historically attracted miners due to low energy costs, though this also presents challenges during dry seasons or peak demand. Capturing Waste Heat: Some innovative projects are exploring using the significant heat generated by mining operations for other purposes, such as heating buildings or greenhouses, further improving energy efficiency. The French approach, focusing on nuclear surplus, adds a powerful new dimension to this global conversation. It highlights the potential for established, large-scale clean energy infrastructure to play a role in the future of digital assets, moving the narrative around Bitcoin mining towards one of efficiency and Sustainable crypto mining . What Does This Mean for the Future of Bitcoin Mining and Energy? If the French proposal moves forward successfully, it could serve as a significant case study for other nations with substantial nuclear or large-scale renewable energy infrastructure that experience periods of Energy surplus . It could: Shift the geographical landscape of Bitcoin mining , attracting operations to regions with favorable clean energy policies. Accelerate the adoption of Sustainable crypto mining practices globally, pushing the industry towards cleaner energy sources. Influence future energy policy, demonstrating how energy-intensive computing can be managed as a flexible, beneficial load on the grid. Potentially stabilize energy markets by providing a consistent consumer for surplus power. This development underscores the dynamic relationship between technology and infrastructure. As the crypto industry matures, its integration with traditional sectors like energy becomes increasingly important. France’s potential move is a bold step in this direction, seeking to harmonize the energy demands of the digital age with the realities and opportunities of existing national energy resources as part of a forward-looking French energy strategy . Actionable Insights for the Reader For those following the intersection of crypto and energy, this French proposal offers several key takeaways: Monitor Policy Developments: Keep a close eye on legislative progress in France regarding this amendment and related energy policies. Policy is a major driver for where Sustainable crypto mining can thrive. Understand Energy Sources: When evaluating mining operations or investments, pay attention to their energy mix. Initiatives like France’s highlight the growing importance of clean and efficient energy sourcing for long-term viability and public acceptance. Recognize Grid Dynamics: The concept of using interruptible loads like mining to manage Energy surplus is a critical aspect of modern grid management. Understanding this can provide insight into future energy infrastructure developments. Consider the Global Context: France is not in isolation. Look for similar initiatives or discussions in other countries with significant clean energy production (hydro, nuclear, large-scale solar/wind). Engage in the Conversation: As these proposals develop, participate in informed discussions about the role of crypto mining in energy transitions and the potential for Sustainable crypto mining models. These insights are crucial for investors, policymakers, energy professionals, and crypto enthusiasts alike, offering a glimpse into how national strategies are adapting to technological change. In Conclusion: A Strategic Alignment for a Greener Future? The proposal by French lawmakers to explore using surplus Nuclear energy France for Bitcoin mining represents a potentially pivotal moment. It’s a strategic move that seeks to align the energy demands of a burgeoning digital industry with the practical realities of managing a large, clean energy infrastructure. By potentially turning an Energy surplus challenge into an opportunity to foster Sustainable crypto mining , France could set a precedent for how nations can integrate energy-intensive technologies into their national French energy strategy in an environmentally responsible and economically beneficial way. While challenges remain, the core idea is compelling: leveraging existing clean energy assets to power the future of finance. This initiative highlights the innovative thinking required to bridge traditional infrastructure with cutting-edge technology, potentially paving the way for a greener, more stable energy future alongside the growth of the crypto economy.

The MP has filed his bill in the Chamber of Deputies, the Portuguese-language media outlet Livecoins reported. Brazilian Crypto Tax: Could Levies Be Scrapped? The bill calls for the removal of the clauses in the tax code that explicitly mention the taxation of cryptoassets. The Brazilian lawmaker Eros Biondini calling for support for his bill on social media. The caption reads: “Fight against the taxation of cryptoassets in Brazil.” (Source: @erosbiondini/Instagram) It also calls for the abolition of a 2023 law that spells out the means of collecting income tax from profits derived from cryptoassets. The bill will first be assessed by a Chamber of Deputies committee. The committee will decide whether or not to pass the bill on to the lower house. From there, it could then move on to the Senate and the office of the President. Both the Senate and the President would have the power to veto the bill. Biondini also claims that new taxes on financial transactions, including foreign exchange and insurance transfers, are ill-timed. He claimed that imposing a new tax burden on the population at “a time of economic fragility” would have negative consequences. The lawmaker noted that the Brazilian tax “burden” reached 32.32% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in FY2024. This is the tax-to-GDP ratio’s highest rate in the last 15 years, per Treasury data. Biondini criticized the government’s crypto policy. He complained that Brazil, “instead of leading” the world in crypto adoption, is now “going against the grain.” He said existing and future crypto tax laws “penalize people who are looking for a legitimate, safe, and sovereign store of value.” Formal Recognition for BTC Savers The crypto-adovocating lawmaker has previously authored a bill that seeks to formally recognize Bitcoin as a strategic store of value in Brazil. This proposal seeks to create tax exemption for BTC buyers and holders. It also seeks to spell out citizens’ rights to become self-custodians of their coins, without having to rely on crypto wallet operators. Méliuz has become the first Bitcoin treasury company in Brazil after shareholders approved the acquisition of $28.4 million Bitcoin. #Méliuz #BitcoinTreasury #BitcoinStrategy https://t.co/v1zZ77GH3h — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 16, 2025 Biondini took to social media last week in an attempt to unite the Brazilian crypto community behind his bill. He suggested that if the topic were to go viral, the lower house would be pressured to reject efforts to boost crypto tax revenues in Brazil. Biondini also called on fellow parliamentarians to back his bill. He explained that it had been designed to defend taxpayers, industry players, and Brazil’s “economic sovereignty.” In November last year, Biondini unveiled a bill proposing the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve . The plan called for the government to convert up to 5% of Brazil’s $372 billion international reserve fund to Bitcoin.

Polyhedra Network ( ZKJ ) token was trading at $0.374, up 47% from its lowest point this week. This jump brought its market capitalization to $101 million, down from last week’s high of $620 million. In an X post, Polyhedra attributed the crash to a series of abnormal on-chain transactions within a short period on the ZKJ/KOGE trading pair.

Data shows that three wallets drained about $7 million in liquidity. In a note to crypto.news, a Bitunix analyst said in a note: “On-chain analysis revealed that three major wallets executed a coordinated ‘liquidity pull + targeted dump,’ first crashing KOGE, then triggering ZKJ’s collapse — a classic bull trap. Warning signs emerged beforehand: LP withdrawals, plunging APYs, and reduced wash trading.” ZKJ token price also crashed as investors braced for an upcoming token unlock. Tokens worth over $10 million will be unlocked on June 19, with the funds allocated to ecosystem and network incentives, foundation reserves, community, and token purchasers.

However, there is a risk that the rebound is a bull trap or a dead-cat bounce, a situation where an asset in freefall bounces temporarily before resuming its downtrend. A good example of this is Mantra ( OM ), whose token plunged by over 90% on a Sunday a few months ago. At the time, the developers blamed the crash on exchange-driven liquidations and insisted that the underlying technology remained strong, triggering a 500% surge shortly after its drop . However, the surge proved to be a dead-cat bounce, and the token eventually resumed its downtrend. ZKJ may follow a similar path as the bull trap fades and existing holders exit their positions. In the note, the Bitunix analyst added: “Confidence in ZKJ has collapsed — without clear capital inflows, a rebound is unlikely. Cease wash trading or arbitrage strategies, and stay alert to tokens with high FDV, suspiciously stable prices, or abnormal rankings.” ZKJ crypto technical analysis ZKJ crypto chart | Source: TradingView Technicals suggest that the ZKJ price may form either a rectangle or a triangle pattern as it consolidates, potentially a bearish flag or pennant.

A prime example currently unfolding involves the intricate dance between the United States and Iran concerning a potential revival of the nuclear deal. While seemingly distant from Bitcoin or Ethereum, shifts in this complex geopolitical situation, particularly regarding energy markets and overall risk sentiment, are worth paying attention to. What Are the Odds of a US-Iran Nuclear Deal Right Now? One fascinating way to gauge the market’s collective sentiment on such complex events is through prediction markets. According to data highlighted by Walter Bloomberg on X, the prediction market platform Kalshi currently places the odds of a US-Iran nuclear deal being reached at around 44%. This figure isn’t just a random guess; it reflects the aggregated bets and predictions of participants on the platform, offering a unique, real-time insight into perceived probabilities based on available information and analysis. Prediction markets like Kalshi allow users to bet on the outcome of future events, ranging from political elections to economic indicators and, yes, even international diplomacy. The price of a contract predicting a specific outcome reflects the market’s perceived probability of that event occurring. A 44% chance suggests that while a deal is far from guaranteed, the market sees a significant possibility of progress compared to times when talks seemed completely stalled. Why Are These Odds Shifting? De-escalation Signals Emerge The movement in the Kalshi odds isn’t happening in a vacuum. Recent reports indicate potential de-escalation signals from Iran. Specifically, Iran has reportedly signaled a willingness to resume talks regarding the nuclear agreement, albeit with a significant condition: the U.S. must avoid involvement in the recent protests within Iran. This condition adds another layer of complexity to already delicate negotiations, highlighting the intertwined nature of domestic politics and international diplomacy. Facilitating these sensitive discussions are Arab intermediaries. Diplomacy often thrives behind closed doors, and the involvement of neutral third parties is crucial in bridging communication gaps and finding common ground between nations with deep-seated mistrust. These intermediaries are reportedly working to pave the way for renewed dialogue, which contributes to the perceived increase in the likelihood of talks resuming, as reflected in the US-Iran nuclear deal odds on Kalshi. How Does This Impact Global Markets, Especially Oil Prices ? One of the most immediate and tangible impacts of shifts in the US-Iran nuclear deal prospects is felt in the energy markets, particularly concerning oil prices . Iran is a major oil producer, and sanctions related to its nuclear program have significantly curtailed its ability to export oil globally. A revived nuclear deal would likely lead to the easing or lifting of some of these sanctions, potentially allowing more Iranian oil to enter the international market. When the possibility of more supply hitting the market increases, it typically puts downward pressure on prices, assuming demand remains constant. This is precisely what has been observed recently; oil prices have reportedly fallen as supply concerns eased following the signals of potential de-escalation and resumed talks. For consumers and economies reliant on stable energy prices, this potential increase in supply is a positive sign, helping to mitigate inflationary pressures linked to high energy costs. Here’s a simplified look at the potential chain reaction: Signal of Talks → Increased probability of sanctions easing Sanctions Easing → Potential for more Iranian oil exports More Supply → Easing of global supply concerns Eased Supply Concerns → Downward pressure on oil prices However, it’s crucial to remember that this is a dynamic situation. Other factors, such as global demand, production decisions by OPEC+, and ongoing geopolitical tensions elsewhere, also heavily influence oil prices. Understanding Geopolitical Risk and its Wider Implications The situation between the U.S. and Iran is a prime example of geopolitical risk – the risk that political decisions, events, or instability in one region can significantly impact global markets and economic activity. Geopolitical risk is a constant factor investors must consider, and it can manifest in various ways: Supply Chain Disruptions: Conflicts or sanctions can interrupt the flow of goods. Commodity Price Volatility: Events in key producing regions (like the Middle East for oil) directly affect prices. Investment Uncertainty: Increased risk can lead investors to pull back from certain markets or assets. Inflationary Pressures: Rising energy or food prices due to geopolitical events can fuel inflation. The ongoing tensions, even amidst de-escalation signals, are underscored by the fact that Israel continues to conduct airstrikes. This highlights the volatile nature of the region and the multifaceted security concerns that complicate any diplomatic progress. Such continued military action serves as a reminder that the path to a stable agreement is fraught with challenges and setbacks, keeping geopolitical risk elevated. Connecting the Dots: How Does This Affect the Cryptocurrency Market ? Now, let’s bring this back to the cryptocurrency market . How does a potential US-Iran nuclear deal , Kalshi odds, and fluctuating oil prices relate to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins? The connection is primarily through macroeconomic sentiment and geopolitical risk . Cryptocurrency, while often seen as a decentralized alternative, is not immune to global market forces. In times of high geopolitical tension and uncertainty, investors often move towards perceived ‘safe-haven’ assets. Historically, this has meant assets like gold or government bonds. The role of Bitcoin as a ‘digital gold’ or safe haven is still debated and tested during such periods. Here are some potential ways the US-Iran situation and related market shifts could influence crypto: Risk-On/Risk-Off Sentiment: De-escalation signals (like potential deal progress) can sometimes contribute to a broader ‘risk-on’ sentiment in global markets, where investors become more willing to invest in riskier assets, including stocks and potentially cryptocurrencies. Conversely, rising tensions or deal collapse could fuel ‘risk-off’ sentiment, potentially leading to outflows from crypto. Inflationary Expectations: As mentioned, easing oil prices can help temper inflation. If inflation concerns decrease, central banks might feel less pressure to aggressively hike interest rates. High-interest rates can make riskier assets like crypto less attractive compared to fixed-income investments. Therefore, anything that eases inflationary pressure (like lower oil) could be seen as a positive signal for crypto in the long run, though the link is indirect. Sanctions and Crypto: While not directly tied to the nuclear deal’s success, the broader context of sanctions against Iran has sometimes led to discussions about crypto’s potential use in circumventing traditional financial systems. This remains a complex and often controversial topic, but geopolitical pressures can sometimes inadvertently highlight perceived use cases for decentralized currencies, even if those uses are debated or illegal. Overall Market Volatility: Geopolitical events inject uncertainty, leading to increased volatility across financial markets. The cryptocurrency market is known for its own inherent volatility, but it can be exacerbated by external macro factors. Watching global indicators, including energy prices and geopolitical developments, provides crucial context for understanding broader market movements that can spill over into crypto. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities? The path to a revived US-Iran nuclear deal is fraught with challenges. Deep mistrust, differing interpretations of past agreements, regional security concerns (like Israel’s actions), and domestic political pressures in both the U.S. and Iran make reaching a comprehensive agreement incredibly difficult. The 44% odds on Kalshi reflect this uncertainty – it’s possible, but far from a sure thing. However, the opportunity lies in the potential for increased stability. A successful deal could lead to reduced geopolitical risk in a critical region, potentially easing pressure on energy markets and fostering a more predictable global economic environment. For the cryptocurrency market , reduced external volatility from geopolitical shocks could allow market dynamics to be driven more by internal factors like technological development, adoption rates, and regulatory clarity. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Investor So, what does this mean for you as a crypto investor? While you’re likely focused on Bitcoin charts and blockchain developments, keeping an eye on major geopolitical events and their impact on traditional markets is a wise strategy. Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources covering international relations and energy markets. Understand how events in key regions can influence global economics. Watch Oil Prices: Significant movements in oil prices can be indicators of broader shifts in supply/demand dynamics and geopolitical stability, which in turn can influence inflation expectations and overall market sentiment relevant to crypto. Understand Risk Sentiment: Pay attention to whether the general market mood is ‘risk-on’ or ‘risk-off’. Geopolitical developments are major drivers of this sentiment shift. Consider Diversification: Geopolitical shocks underscore the importance of a diversified portfolio. While crypto offers unique opportunities, understanding its correlation (or lack thereof) with traditional assets during different types of crises is key. Use Prediction Markets (with caution): Platforms like Kalshi offer interesting data points on market expectations for non-crypto events. While not direct trading signals for crypto, they provide insight into the perceived likelihood of events that *could* impact the broader market landscape. Ultimately, navigating the cryptocurrency market involves understanding not just the technology and tokenomics, but also the wider economic and political forces at play globally. The dance between the U.S. and Iran, tracked by platforms like Kalshi and impacting oil prices and geopolitical risk , is a potent reminder of this interconnectedness. Summary: Global Threads in the Crypto Tapestry The recent signals regarding the US-Iran nuclear deal , reflected in the 44% odds on Kalshi prediction market, highlight a moment of potential, albeit fragile, de-escalation. While Iran sets conditions and regional tensions persist with actions like Israeli airstrikes, the involvement of Arab intermediaries offers a glimmer of diplomatic hope. This dynamic immediately impacts markets, notably causing a dip in oil prices as supply concerns temporarily ease. For participants in the cryptocurrency market , these events serve as a crucial reminder that crypto exists within a global financial ecosystem. Shifts in geopolitical risk , energy prices, and overall market sentiment can influence crypto valuations and volatility. Staying informed about these broader macro factors, even those seemingly unrelated like a distant nuclear negotiation, provides valuable context for making informed decisions in the fast-paced world of digital assets.

According to analyst Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT), the digital asset’s breakout from a long-standing technical formation has already produced a substantial rally. But the next stage of its cycle could soon begin. XRP surged more than 500% between November 2024 and January 2025 after breaking above a 7-year pennant formation that had been developing since 2017. The pattern, highlighted in Michael’s July 2024 analysis, revealed a long-term volatility squeeze that could lead to a sharp directional move. The breakout occurred in late September , validating the prediction, with XRP soaring from around $0.55 to briefly touch the $3.39 level before settling above the $2 mark. XRP has been consolidating for 7 months since it pumped 700% after breaking out of the 7-year pennant, which I predicted. It has now reached the end of its healthy consolidation period. The next major move will begin soon and should align with Bitcoin breaking the 8-year line. https://t.co/D4dWE6powa pic.twitter.com/GSnXsghfbW — Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) June 15, 2025 Consolidation and Structural Strength In his new chart, the analyst emphasized that the asset has now undergone a “healthy consolidation” for approximately seven months, trading mostly sideways but maintaining its position above key psychological levels . “It has now reached the end of its healthy consolidation period,” he said, noting that a new major move is expected soon. The chart shows XRP respecting the upper range of its breakout and maintaining elevated price levels, which the analyst interprets as structural strength. The consolidation, while extended, has not led to any sustained retracements, indicating that selling pressure may be limited. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Context and Next Phase Importantly, Michael connects the next stage in XRP’s price development with broader market trends. He specifically mentions the potential alignment with Bitcoin’s trajectory. The asset’s perceived reputation as Bitcoin’s successor positions it to benefit from the largest cryptocurrency’s growth. XRP’s performance post-breakout has largely followed a predictable pattern of explosive upside followed by consolidation. However, what sets this phase apart is the context, both technical and historical. Breakouts from 7-year structures are rare in crypto markets, which typically experience shorter accumulation and distribution cycles. The sustained move and relative price stability over the last two quarters reflect what could be the foundation for another surge. Looking Ahead XRP is currently trading at $2.18, and whether the asset will maintain this momentum depends not only on its chart structure but also on broader crypto market behavior. If Bitcoin does break its 8-year resistance, XRP may benefit from the liquidity and sentiment shift that usually accompanies such moves.

The social media platform also suspended accounts associated with leaders of the Pump.fun platform on Monday, including the founder Alon. The suspension of the Pump.fun X account triggered mixed reactions from the crypto community. While some were disappointed with the closure, some applauded the move as it will reduce crazy speculation and give a chance to utility coins. Possible Reasons Why Pump.fun Was Suspended on X Today The official reasons why X account belonging to Pump.fun was suspended had not been released at the time of this writing. However, research suggests that Pump.fun uses unauthorized third-party X APIs or black-market X trackers to attract more users. Another possible reason for X account suspension was a potential misuse of the Live Stream feature, which has been controversial in the past year. The X accounts associated with Pump.fun were also likely suspended due to potential fraudulent activities, which include autorug. Meanwhile, a potential incoming regulatory scrutiny by the U.S. SEC could have led to the suspension of the X account belonging to Pump.fun. However, there was no official confirmation from the SEC on an investigation on Pump.fun yet. Market Impact The suspension of the pump.fun’s X account will significantly disorient its short-term market outlook.

Tensions between major regional players can send ripples through economies worldwide. Recently, a significant development suggests a potential shift in the ongoing Iran Israel dynamic, offering a glimmer of hope for reduced hostilities. Understanding the Iran Israel Dynamic For years, the relationship between Iran and Israel has been marked by significant tension and proxy conflicts across the region. This animosity stems from a complex mix of historical grievances, ideological differences, and competing strategic interests. While direct confrontation has been rare, indirect clashes and rhetoric have kept the region on edge, impacting everything from oil prices to investment sentiment in various markets, including how investors perceive regional stability. The recent exchange of direct fire marked a notable escalation, raising international alarm. However, amidst this heightened tension, signals are now emerging that suggest a potential off-ramp. Prospects for De-escalation: What Are the Signals? According to sources cited by The Wall Street Journal, Iran has reportedly expressed an interest in cooling down tensions with Israel. This interest was conveyed through Arab intermediaries, indicating a preference for diplomatic channels rather than continued confrontation. The use of intermediaries is a common tactic in complex geopolitical situations, allowing for communication without direct, formal recognition or engagement between adversaries. Furthermore, a report shared by Walter Bloomberg on X highlighted a specific condition mentioned by Iran for resuming discussions: the United States must remain uninvolved in the conflict. This condition underscores the intricate web of alliances and rivalries in the Middle East, where the role of global powers significantly influences regional dynamics. Let’s break down the key elements of these signals: Channel: Arab intermediaries are being used, suggesting a move towards indirect diplomacy. Goal: Expressed interest in de-escalating tensions. Condition: Resumption of talks contingent on U.S. non-involvement. These signals, while preliminary and requiring careful observation, represent a potential shift from the recent tit-for-tat exchanges. Why Middle East Stability Matters Globally The Middle East is a crucial geopolitical hub due to its energy resources, strategic waterways, and complex political landscape. Instability in this region has far-reaching consequences: Energy Markets: Disruptions can lead to volatile oil and gas prices, affecting global economies. Supply Chains: Key shipping lanes pass through the region, vulnerable to conflict. Refugee Flows: Conflict can trigger humanitarian crises and mass displacement. Global Security: Regional conflicts can attract external powers and fuel international terrorism. Financial Markets: Uncertainty leads to risk aversion, impacting stocks, bonds, and commodities, and yes, even the resilience of the crypto market can be tested by such external shocks. Therefore, any movement towards de-escalation is not just a regional matter but a development with global implications for geopolitics and economic stability. Geopolitics and the Crypto Market While the immediate news is about international relations, it’s important for anyone monitoring global markets, including crypto enthusiasts, to understand the broader context. Geopolitical events, particularly those involving major state actors and potential conflict, can significantly influence market sentiment. Periods of high tension often lead investors to seek safer assets, while signs of stability or de-escalation can foster a more risk-on environment. Although this specific news does not directly involve cryptocurrency, it falls under the umbrella of macro-geopolitical factors that savvy investors track. The interconnectedness of global finance means that developments in the Middle East, or any other volatile region, can indirectly affect liquidity, investor confidence, and market direction across asset classes. Challenges and Considerations Ahead While the signals for de-escalation are positive, several challenges remain: Trust Deficit: Decades of animosity have created a deep lack of trust between Iran and Israel. Conditionality: Iran’s condition regarding U.S. non-involvement is complex and may not be easily met or agreed upon by all parties. Proxy Activities: Even if direct tensions ease, activities by proxy groups supported by Iran in the region could continue to be a source of friction. Internal Politics: Both countries have internal political dynamics that can influence foreign policy decisions. Moving from signaling interest to actual talks and meaningful de-escalation is a long and challenging process requiring sustained diplomatic effort and flexibility from all sides. The role of Arab intermediaries will be crucial in navigating these complexities. Actionable Insight: Stay Informed For those interested in global markets, including the crypto space, the actionable insight here is the importance of monitoring geopolitical developments. Events like potential de-escalation in the Iran Israel conflict, shifts in Middle East dynamics, and broader geopolitics are not isolated incidents. They are part of the global tapestry that influences economic conditions and market sentiment. Staying informed allows for a more nuanced understanding of potential market volatility and risk factors beyond just asset-specific news. Conclusion: A Hopeful Sign for Regional Stability? The reports of Iran signaling a desire to de-escalate tensions with Israel, conveyed through Arab intermediaries and conditioned on U.S. non-involvement, offer a potentially hopeful turning point after a period of heightened direct confrontation. While significant hurdles remain, and the path to genuine regional stability is fraught with challenges, these signals are a reminder that diplomatic off-ramps are always possible, even between long-standing adversaries. Monitoring how these signals translate into action will be critical for understanding the future trajectory of Middle East geopolitics and its potential ripple effects across the globe, including in sensitive markets like cryptocurrency.

The aim? To leverage their influence to persuade former U.S. President Donald Trump to pressure Israel for an immediate ceasefire. This intriguing development, initially reported by Reuters and highlighted by Walter Bloomberg on X, signals a complex web of regional dynamics and strategic bartering. Why Turn to the Gulf States for Iran Ceasefire Efforts? The choice of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Oman as intermediaries is deliberate and reflects the nuanced relationships within the Middle East and with the United States. Each of these nations holds unique standing: Qatar: Often plays a mediating role in regional conflicts and maintains channels with various international actors, including the U.S. and groups involved in the conflict. Saudi Arabia: A major regional power and a close strategic partner of the United States. While relations with Iran are complex, there have been recent efforts towards de-escalation and dialogue. Riyadh’s voice carries significant weight in Washington. Oman: Traditionally acts as a neutral broker in the region, often facilitating backchannel communications between adversaries, including Iran and the U.S. By approaching these specific Gulf states, Iran appears to be seeking multiple avenues to influence U.S. policy towards Israel, hoping that their collective or individual pressure points could be effective. The Nuclear Negotiations Link: What Flexibility Means Perhaps the most striking element of this report is Iran’s reported offer of flexibility in nuclear negotiations with the U.S. in exchange for this diplomatic assistance. This ties two seemingly distinct issues – regional conflict and nuclear talks – together, revealing Iran’s strategic approach to international relations. Flexibility in nuclear talks could encompass various aspects, such as: Willingness to return to the negotiating table regarding the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Potential adjustments to enrichment levels or stockpile limits. Greater transparency or access for international inspectors. Discussion on other related issues like ballistic missiles or regional activities (though historically, Iran has been resistant to including these). Offering this flexibility serves as a potential incentive for the U.S. to consider Iran’s ceasefire request seriously, albeit indirectly through its influence on Israel. It positions the ceasefire as a potentially achievable outcome linked to a major U.S. foreign policy goal: curbing Iran’s nuclear program. Challenges and Opportunities in Middle East Diplomacy This reported request highlights the intricate nature of Middle East diplomacy . While the offer of nuclear flexibility presents a potential opportunity for renewed dialogue between the U.S. and Iran, several challenges exist: U.S. Political Landscape: The request specifically names Donald Trump, who is currently not in office. While he remains a significant political figure, the current administration under President Biden handles official foreign policy. This adds a layer of complexity regarding who Iran believes holds the relevant influence or who they prefer to negotiate with. Gulf States’ Position: While willing to mediate, the Gulf states have their own interests and relationships to balance, particularly their security ties with the U.S. and their complex interactions with both Israel and Iran. Israel’s Stance: Any decision regarding a ceasefire ultimately rests with Israel, which has its own security imperatives and strategic objectives in the ongoing conflict. Trust Deficit: Decades of mistrust and conflict between the U.S., Iran, and regional players create a significant hurdle for any substantial diplomatic breakthrough. Despite these challenges, the willingness of Iran to link nuclear talks to a regional ceasefire, and its outreach to key Gulf states, suggests a potential window for de-escalation and negotiation, however narrow. Understanding US Iran Relations Through This Lens The dynamic between the US Iran relations is a constant factor in Middle East stability. This latest development underscores the indirect pathways often used in their interactions. Instead of direct communication, Iran is reportedly using intermediaries to convey a message and an offer to a former U.S. president. This highlights the lack of direct high-level diplomatic channels and the reliance on regional partners to bridge the gap. The U.S. has consistently stated its goals regarding Iran: preventing nuclear weapon acquisition, countering regional destabilization, and addressing human rights concerns. Iran, conversely, seeks sanctions relief, security guarantees, and regional influence. The reported offer attempts to align Iran’s desire for a ceasefire with a U.S. priority (nuclear talks), demonstrating a strategic attempt to find common ground, even if through a convoluted route involving regional partners and a former U.S. leader. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean? For observers of geopolitical events and those tracking international relations, this report offers several key insights: Interconnectedness: Regional conflicts and nuclear proliferation issues are deeply intertwined in the Middle East. Solutions often require addressing multiple fronts simultaneously. Role of Intermediaries: Third-party mediators like Qatar, Oman, and potentially Saudi Arabia remain crucial facilitators in resolving complex international standoffs where direct talks are difficult. Strategic Bartering: Nations like Iran are willing to use leverage points (like nuclear program flexibility) from one area to achieve goals in another (like influencing a ceasefire). Importance of Regional Dialogue: The involvement of Gulf states emphasizes the growing importance of intra-regional dialogue in addressing shared security challenges and facilitating broader diplomatic efforts. While the outcome of this reported request remains uncertain, it provides a fascinating glimpse into the high-stakes diplomatic maneuvering occurring behind the scenes in the Middle East. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Diplomacy? The report of Iran asking Gulf states to press Donald Trump for an Israel ceasefire, linked to flexibility in nuclear negotiations, is a powerful reminder of the complex, multi-layered nature of Middle Eastern geopolitics. It highlights the critical roles played by regional intermediaries and the strategic calculations involved in international relations. While achieving a lasting ceasefire and resolving nuclear standoffs are monumental tasks fraught with challenges, every diplomatic overture, no matter how unconventional, represents a potential step towards de-escalation and dialogue. Keeping a close watch on the responses from the Gulf states, the U.S., and Israel will be crucial in understanding the potential impact of this intriguing development on the future trajectory of the region.

However, on-chain data suggests that both Bitcoin whales and retail investors still anticipate further upside for the leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Whale And Retail Inflows To Binance Tumble According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Darkfost, Bitcoin inflows to Binance crypto exchange from two distinct cohorts – whales and retail investors – have fallen to their lowest levels in the current market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Upward Momentum ‘Highly Likely’ To Continue, On-Chain Data Shows Darkfost shared the following chart illustrating that Bitcoin whale inflows to Binance have hit their lowest point since 2024. Similarly, retail investor inflows are also at their lowest since 2024, signalling a strong preference to hold rather than sell. The contributor emphasized that this alignment in behavior between whales and retail investors is a “highly constructive signal for the market.” Apart from the consistent inflows observed at the start of the current cycle, Darkfost identified two previous instances when both groups acted in sync. Notably, such periods of aligned behavior have typically coincided with previous market tops. These tops were marked by synchronized BTC inflows into exchanges, leading to a significant uptick in selling pressure and, eventually, market demand exhaustion. Commenting on the recent drop in BTC inflows, Darkfost suggested that market participants may be waiting for clearer macroeconomic cues or are simply exhibiting high conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. They added: Such alignment across investor classes may also reflect broader market confidence, with expectations of further profits ahead. Recent trading setups support the aforementioned outlook. In a separate X post, seasoned crypto analyst Ash Crypto highlighted that a Bitcoin whale had opened a massive $200 million long position with 20x leverage. Should BTC Holders Be Worried? Despite the encouraging dip in BTC inflows to major exchanges like Binance, some analysts warn that a deeper correction may be imminent. For example, TradingView analyst MIRZA recently predicted that BTC could fall as low as $85,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Negative Funding On Binance – A Classic Setup For A Short Squeeze? Similarly, veteran trader Peter Brandt shared a cautionary note, that BTC may see a steep slide in the coming months. Brandt stated that if BTC mirrors the 2021-22 market cycle, then it may risk falling to as low as $23,600. That said, BTC outflows from exchanges continue to rise, depleting available reserves – a dynamic that could result in a supply shock. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $106,920, up 1.8% over the past 24 hours.

From old favourites like Litecoin to newer names like BlockDAG, there’s no shortage of choices. Each coin brings something different to the table. Litecoin offers history and stability. Filecoin builds real utility with decentralised storage. Uniswap powers DeFi’s biggest moves. Then there’s BlockDAG, fresh, fast-growing, and already up 2,660% in value. It’s not just hype. BlockDAG has raised $306 million, sold 22.6 billion coins, and its tech is live. This article breaks down what makes each coin worth watching and why they’re all in the conversation for the top crypto to invest in as the next market cycle takes shape. 1. BlockDAG’s Numbers Show It’s Built for Growth BlockDAG is becoming the top crypto to invest in because it has both the numbers and the momentum. It’s priced at $0.0276 in Batch 29, with a launch price set at $0.05. That alone gives a near 81% upside. But those who bought at $0.001 in Batch 1 are already sitting on 2,660% gains. However, a rare opportunity is still open; BDAG is available at a limited-time rate of just $0.0018 until June 20. This gives new participants one last chance to enter at a price close to Batch 1 and aim for similar high-return potential before the price rises further. So far, 22.6 billion coins have been sold and $306 million raised. This isn’t just hype, it’s backed by progress. BlockDAG’s chain combines DAG tech with Proof-of-Work, aiming to handle over 15,000 transactions per second. It’s EVM-compatible, so Ethereum dApps can shift over without rewriting code. Over 20 exchanges are preparing for listings, and a high-profile U.S. partnership is in the works. The project’s dashboard is another draw; it features wallet functions, real-time leaderboards, and automated bonuses that encourage user growth. With 2 million mobile miners onboard and a loyal user base, BlockDAG is growing beyond early hype. For those looking for the top crypto to invest in with high upside and working systems, BlockDAG checks every box. 2. Litecoin Holds Firm as a Reliable Option Litecoin still deserves a spot among the top cryptocurrencies to invest in. It trades around $86.40, gaining over 3% in a week. While monthly losses show a 16% dip, the coin recently bounced off $82 support, showing it still has legs. Its volume stays high across big exchanges, especially on Binance with active LTC/USDT pairs. Technical charts suggest the coin is building strength again. Despite low whale action since the ETF delay, trading patterns show it might be in a steady accumulation phase. If you’re after a long-time player with strong liquidity and low-risk entry points, Litecoin stays on the list of the top crypto to invest in. 3. Filecoin’s Use Case May Catch Up to Price At $2.53, Filecoin isn’t flying, but it may be underestimated as a top crypto to invest in. It’s up 2.5% in the past 24 hours, though still down for the week. The SEC’s focus on the token brought some unwanted attention, but on-chain stats tell a better story. Filecoin’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (FEVM) has processed over 5,000 contracts. It’s also gaining ground in the DePIN sector, where decentralised storage meets real-world use cases. Derivatives trading volume around FIL sits close to $5 billion, proof that traders haven’t lost interest. If regulators back off, and more builders join the ecosystem, FIL could shift from niche to major player. It’s not loud, but it might surprise people looking for the top crypto to invest in. 4. Uniswap’s Return Could Be More Than a Bounce Uniswap has surged past $7.50 with a 25% weekly gain. That move alone puts it back in the conversation as a top crypto to invest in. But the real story is what’s happening behind the scenes. The recently passed “Uniswap Unleashed” proposal means the V4 version is coming fast. That means better features, more trading tools, and more active users. Volume on Uniswap V2 is already up to $3.4 billion. Whales are also returning, with charts showing strong buys above the $7 mark and potential resistance only around $8.25. If governance improvements keep rolling out and DeFi remains hot, UNI could outperform other decentralised protocols. Final Thoughts on Where to Place Your Bet In a sea of choices, only a few cryptos offer the full package of performance, adoption, and upside. Litecoin continues to show its value as a stable veteran. Filecoin offers a real-world use case with growing traction. Uniswap is proving that strong products and governance matter. But BlockDAG is different; it’s checking every box with clear momentum. With 2,660% gains already locked in from Batch 1 and 22.6 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is proving it’s not just noise. The current $0.0018 price still gives major room for growth. If it hits its $1 target, that’s a huge return. If you’re still wondering what the top crypto to invest in is for 2025, this might be your answer.

The fund is scheduled to begin trading on June 18, 2025, and will be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). This development follows the company’s receipt of regulatory clearance from the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), marking a significant milestone for XRP investors in the region. Canada to Host First Spot XRP ETF in North America The new ETF from Purpose Investments will offer direct exposure to XRP, currently the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Unlike futures-based products, spot ETFs are backed by actual holdings of the underlying asset. This enables investors to gain price exposure without managing crypto wallets or dealing directly with exchanges. The approval from the OSC positions Canada as the first jurisdiction in North America to greenlight a spot XRP ETF. This follows the country’s earlier pioneering efforts in digital asset ETFs, including those based on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Status of Spot XRP ETFs in the United States While Canada is moving ahead, the United States has yet to approve any spot XRP ETFs. Several major asset managers, including Franklin Templeton , WisdomTree , and Bitwise , have submitted proposals to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch similar products. However, regulatory approval remains pending. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bloomberg analysts suggest that the SEC may approve these proposals in the fourth quarter of 2025, possibly alongside other spot-based altcoin ETFs. Market watchers note that the launch of regulated XRP futures by CME Group has improved the chances of spot XRP ETF approval in the U.S., raising expectations to an estimated 88% likelihood by the end of the year. Overview of Existing U.S. XRP ETF Products Although no spot XRP ETF has been approved in the U.S. to date, some alternative ETF products have already entered the market. In April 2025, Teucrium introduced a leveraged XRP ETF, which aims to deliver double the daily return of XRP. Additionally, Volatility Shares rolled out a futures-based ETF in May, offering investors one-to-one exposure to XRP’s performance using regulated futures contracts. These products provide some exposure to XRP for U.S.-based investors, but they differ in structure and risk profile from spot ETFs. Market participants continue to monitor the SEC’s next moves, anticipating broader access to XRP investment options.

This isn’t an outright rejection of the ETF itself, but rather a specific instruction regarding a feature that many applicants included to make their products more appealing to investors. It signals the SEC ‘s continued scrutiny over aspects of cryptocurrency that blur the lines between commodities and securities, particularly crypto staking . Understanding Crypto Staking and Why It Matters for an Ethereum ETF So, what exactly is crypto staking , and why is its potential inclusion (or exclusion) in an Ethereum ETF such a big deal? In simple terms, crypto staking on proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum involves locking up cryptocurrency to support the network’s operations, such as validating transactions and securing the blockchain. In return for staking their Ether (ETH), participants can earn rewards, similar to earning interest in a traditional bank account or dividends from stocks. For an Ethereum ETF , the idea was to potentially stake a portion of the underlying ETH held by the fund. This could offer investors a yield on their investment on top of any potential price appreciation of ETH. This yield component was seen as a significant advantage, potentially making the ETF more attractive compared to simply holding ETH directly or through other non-staking investment vehicles. Potential Benefits of Including Staking in an Ethereum ETF (Now Delayed for Franklin) Potential Yield: Earn passive income on the underlying ETH holdings. Enhanced Investor Appeal: Makes the ETF potentially more competitive and attractive to a broader range of investors seeking yield. Network Participation: Indirectly supports the Ethereum network’s security and operations. Challenges and SEC Concerns Regarding Crypto Staking The SEC ‘s stance on crypto staking has been a subject of debate. One major concern revolves around whether staking services constitute an investment contract, which could classify the staked asset (or the staking service itself) as a security under U.S. law. This has significant regulatory implications. Other concerns might include: Custody Complexity: How the staking process and earned rewards would be managed and secured within the ETF structure. Slashing Risk: Although rare, staked ETH can be penalized (slashed) if the validator node acts maliciously or goes offline, potentially impacting the ETF’s assets. Regulatory Clarity: The overall lack of clear regulatory guidelines specifically for staking services offered to large investment vehicles. What Does This Mean for the Broader Spot Ethereum ETF Landscape? While this specific report is about Franklin Templeton ‘s application, it likely has implications for other applicants as well. Major players like BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and others also have pending applications for a Spot Ethereum ETF , and many had initially included staking features. This request from the SEC suggests a potential standardized approach: the regulator may require all approved Spot Ethereum ETF products to exclude staking initially. This would simplify the regulatory approval process by removing a contentious element and aligning these ETFs more closely with the structure of approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, which do not involve staking. If staking is universally excluded, it could impact the potential returns for investors compared to holding and staking ETH directly. However, it might also pave a clearer path for the ETFs to receive approval, potentially opening the door for broader institutional and retail access to Ethereum exposure through a regulated investment product. Let’s look at a simplified comparison of potential scenarios: Feature Potential Staked Ethereum ETF (Delayed) Likely Approved Non-Staked Ethereum ETF Holding ETH Directly (with Staking) ETH Exposure Yes Yes Yes Potential Yield from Staking Yes (if allowed) No Yes Regulatory Structure Complex/Uncertain Simpler/More Certain (like Spot Bitcoin ETF) Self-regulated Accessibility Via Brokerage Account Via Brokerage Account Via Crypto Exchange/Wallet Custody Risk Managed by ETF Provider Managed by ETF Provider Self-custody risk This table highlights that while a non-staked ETF might lack the yield component, it could be the necessary compromise to gain regulatory approval and offer a familiar, regulated investment wrapper for gaining exposure to ETH. What Does This Ethereum ETF Delay Mean for Investors? Actionable Insights For investors eagerly awaiting a U.S. Spot Ethereum ETF , this news, while potentially disappointing regarding staking yield, doesn’t necessarily mean the end of the road for approval. It could simply be a step in the negotiation process with the SEC to get the structure right. Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights: Patience is Key: The regulatory process is often slow and involves back-and-forth between issuers and the SEC . Delays and requested amendments are common. Focus Shifts to Core Approval: The market’s attention may now pivot more towards the likelihood of *any* Spot Ethereum ETF approval, even without staking, by the key deadlines in May. Understand the Product: If an ETF is approved, understand whether it includes staking or not, as this will impact potential returns. Direct ETH vs. ETF: Consider the trade-offs between holding ETH directly (which allows for staking if you choose) and investing in a potentially non-staked ETF (which offers regulatory structure and ease of access via traditional brokerage accounts). Monitor Regulatory Signals: Keep a close eye on further communications or filings from the SEC and the ETF applicants like Franklin Templeton . While the exclusion of staking might slightly diminish the yield potential compared to direct staking, the primary appeal of a Spot Ethereum ETF for many investors is regulated access to ETH price movements within a familiar investment structure. Conclusion: Navigating the Path to a Spot Ethereum ETF The news that the SEC has reportedly asked Franklin Templeton to remove staking from their Spot Ethereum ETF application is a significant signal regarding the regulatory path forward. It underscores the SEC ‘s cautious approach, particularly concerning aspects like crypto staking that have unclear regulatory classification. This development, while a delay for a desired feature, might ultimately help streamline the approval process for a basic Spot Ethereum ETF product by removing a potential hurdle. Investors should stay informed and be prepared for the possibility that initial U.S. Ethereum ETF s may focus solely on providing exposure to the price of ETH, without the added layer of staking yield. The journey towards regulated crypto investment products is complex, but each step, including these detailed requests from the SEC to applicants like Franklin Templeton , brings more clarity, even if it comes with temporary setbacks for specific features like crypto staking .

The U.S. Senate is gearing up for a crucial vote on the GENIUS Act, a piece of legislation that could fundamentally redefine the role of stablecoins in the American economy. This isn’t just another crypto bill; experts like Wall Street-based asset manager Bernstein believe it has a strong chance of becoming law in the coming months, potentially paving the way for stablecoins to function as true Digital cash and a core part of our Internet payment infrastructure . What is the GENIUS Act and Why Does it Matter for Stablecoin Regulation? At its heart, the GENIUS Act aims to establish a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. For years, stablecoins have existed in a legal grey area, raising concerns among regulators about consumer protection, financial stability, and illicit finance. This proposed US stablecoin law seeks to bring clarity and structure. Here’s what the bill reportedly intends to do: Define Stablecoins as Digital Cash: By classifying stablecoins this way, the bill intends to treat them similarly to traditional currency for certain purposes, potentially boosting confidence and usability for everyday transactions. Promote Mainstream Adoption: A clear regulatory path can encourage businesses and consumers to use stablecoins, knowing they operate within established legal boundaries. This could unlock significant potential for their use in commerce and payments. Limit Non-Financial Firms: The bill is expected to place restrictions on companies primarily outside the financial sector, like retail giants Amazon and Walmart, from issuing their own stablecoins. This measure is likely intended to prevent large corporations from creating private currencies that could challenge monetary policy or create systemic risk outside the regulated financial system. Encourage Partnerships: Instead of issuing their own tokens, non-financial firms would likely be required to partner with regulated stablecoin issuers. This could foster collaboration between tech companies and financial institutions, leveraging the strengths of both while maintaining regulatory oversight. This focus on robust Stablecoin regulation is seen by proponents as essential for integrating digital assets safely into the broader financial system. How Could Stablecoins Become True Digital Cash? Imagine a world where paying online is as simple and instant as handing over physical cash, but digitally. That’s the promise of stablecoins operating as Digital cash under a framework like the one proposed by the GENIUS Act . Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar. This stability is crucial for their function as a medium of exchange. If regulated effectively, stablecoins could offer: Instant Settlement: Transactions can often be settled in seconds or minutes, much faster than traditional banking rails. Lower Costs: Fees for processing stablecoin transactions can be significantly lower than credit card or wire transfer fees, especially for cross-border payments. Accessibility: Potentially accessible to anyone with a smartphone and internet connection, including the unbanked or underbanked populations. Programmability: As digital assets, they can be integrated into smart contracts and automated processes, enabling innovative financial applications. The classification as Digital cash by a potential US stablecoin law like the GENIUS Act would lend significant credibility and legal standing to these attributes, accelerating their potential adoption for everyday transactions. Reshaping Internet Payment Infrastructure: What Does That Mean? Currently, online payments often rely on complex networks involving banks, credit card companies, and payment processors. This system, while functional, can be slow, costly, and sometimes inefficient, particularly across international borders. Stablecoins, if regulated and integrated effectively, could become a foundational layer for the future of Internet payment infrastructure . Here’s how: Peer-to-Peer Efficiency: Stablecoins allow for direct value transfer between parties, reducing the need for multiple intermediaries. Global Reach: Internet-based stablecoin payments aren’t constrained by traditional banking hours or national borders in the same way. Integration with Web3: Stablecoins are native to blockchain technology, making them ideal for integrating payments directly into decentralized applications, metaverses, and other emerging digital environments. Wholesale and Retail Payments: They could facilitate faster, cheaper settlements between businesses (wholesale) and also enable smoother consumer transactions (retail). The vision is that a robust Stablecoin regulation framework, potentially enacted by the GENIUS Act , could unleash the potential for stablecoins to become a seamless, efficient, and widely accessible method for conducting commerce and transferring value online, truly building a new layer of Internet payment infrastructure . The US Stablecoin Law’s Impact: Winners and Losers? Any significant regulatory change creates shifts in the market. The potential passage of the GENIUS Act and its approach to Stablecoin regulation could have varied effects on different players: Potential Winners: Regulated Stablecoin Issuers: Companies already operating within or capable of meeting stringent financial regulations are likely to benefit significantly. They could see increased demand for their services as partners for larger corporations. Businesses Adopting Stablecoin Payments: Companies that integrate stablecoins for customer payments or supply chain finance could benefit from lower transaction costs and faster settlements. Consumers: Could eventually benefit from faster, cheaper, and more accessible payment options online and potentially offline. Potential Losers (or those facing challenges): Non-Financial Firms (like Amazon, Walmart) Wishing to Issue Their Own Tokens: These companies would face direct restrictions and would need to adapt their strategies, likely through partnerships, rather than creating proprietary stablecoins. Existing Payment Processors: While stablecoins might integrate with existing systems, their efficiency and lower costs could put pressure on traditional payment service providers. Unregulated or Offshore Stablecoin Projects: The focus on regulated issuers within the U.S. framework could marginalize stablecoins that don’t comply with the new law. The passage of this US stablecoin law would signal a clear preference for regulated, compliant digital assets, aiming to channel growth through established financial oversight. Navigating the Challenges: What Hurdles Remain for the GENIUS Act? While Bernstein’s optimism is notable, the path to the GENIUS Act becoming law isn’t without potential obstacles. Crafting effective Stablecoin regulation is complex, balancing the need for innovation with financial stability and consumer protection. Challenges could include: Political Divisions: Reaching bipartisan consensus on complex financial technology legislation can be difficult in the U.S. Senate. Balancing Innovation and Risk: Regulators must ensure the law doesn’t stifle technological advancement while adequately mitigating risks like bank runs or illicit use. Defining ‘Digital Cash’ Clearly: The precise legal implications and requirements stemming from this classification will need careful consideration and potentially further regulatory guidance. Enforcement and Oversight: Implementing and enforcing the new rules will require resources and expertise from regulatory bodies. The debate around this potential US stablecoin law highlights the ongoing challenge of integrating rapidly evolving technology into existing legal and financial structures. Actionable Insights: What Should You Watch For? For anyone interested in cryptocurrencies, finance, or the future of online payments, the coming weeks are crucial. Here’s what to keep an eye on: The Senate Vote: The outcome of the vote on the GENIUS Act is the immediate key event. Its passage through the Senate would be a significant step forward. House Action: Even if it passes the Senate, similar legislation would need to pass the House of Representatives and be signed by the President to become law. Monitor progress on companion or similar bills in the House. Industry Reactions: Observe how major players in the crypto space, traditional finance, and tech sectors react to the bill’s progress and potential passage. Regulatory Guidance: If the bill becomes law, watch for subsequent rule-making and guidance from regulatory bodies like the Treasury or financial regulators on implementation details for Stablecoin regulation . Market Response: The market value and adoption trends of regulated stablecoins could react positively to clearer legal status. Understanding the nuances of this potential US stablecoin law is vital for anticipating future trends in Digital cash and Internet payment infrastructure . Conclusion: The impending U.S. Senate vote on the GENIUS Act represents a pivotal moment for the future of stablecoins. By potentially classifying them as Digital cash and laying the groundwork for their integration into Internet payment infrastructure , this proposed US stablecoin law could unlock new levels of mainstream adoption and utility. While challenges remain, the movement towards clear and comprehensive Stablecoin regulation signals a maturing landscape for digital assets. Keeping a close watch on legislative developments is essential for anyone navigating the evolving world of digital finance.

This potential Truth Social ETF filing, initially reported by Bloomberg ETF Analyst James Seyffart on X, marks a significant and perhaps unexpected step into the digital asset space by the company. An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is an investment fund that trades on a stock exchange, much like stocks. ETFs hold assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds, and investors buy shares in the ETF. For cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, a spot ETF would hold the actual underlying asset, providing investors with exposure to the price movements of BTC or ETH without requiring them to directly buy, store, or manage the cryptocurrencies themselves. This simplifies access for traditional investors and institutions. What Does the Truth Social ETF Filing Mean? The core news revolves around Truth Social’s reported application for an ETF that would encompass two of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization: Bitcoin and Ethereum . While the specifics of the filing are not yet fully public, the announcement by a reputable ETF analyst suggests a formal step has been taken towards potentially launching a financial product linked to these digital assets under the Truth Social brand. Here’s a quick breakdown: Applicant: Truth Social (Trump Media & Technology Group) Proposed Asset Class: Dual Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) Filing Body: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Source: Reported by Bloomberg ETF Analyst James Seyffart This isn’t just another company filing for a crypto ETF; it’s a social media platform with a distinct user base and political ties venturing into the complex world of digital asset financial products. The move raises questions about strategy, potential market impact, and the regulatory path ahead. Why a Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF Together? Choosing to file for a dual Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF is notable. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two dominant forces in the crypto market, often seen as complementary rather than competitive by many investors. Consider the differences and why pairing them makes sense for a broad ETF product: Feature Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Primary Use Case Digital Store of Value, Peer-to-Peer Cash Platform for Smart Contracts, DApps, NFTs, DeFi Consensus Mechanism Proof-of-Work (PoW) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) (after The Merge) Market Cap Largest Second Largest Regulatory Status (ETFs) Spot ETFs Approved in US Spot ETFs Pending/Approved in US (as of recent developments) Offering exposure to both allows the ETF to capture different segments of the crypto market and cater to investors interested in either or both assets. Bitcoin is often viewed as ‘digital gold,’ while Ethereum is the backbone of the decentralized web. A dual ETF could appeal to a wider range of investors seeking diversified exposure to the top-tier digital assets through a familiar investment vehicle. Navigating the SEC Crypto ETF Landscape The U.S. SEC Crypto ETF landscape has been a complex and evolving terrain. For years, the SEC was hesitant to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, citing concerns about market manipulation and investor protection. This changed dramatically in January 2024 with the approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs from major financial players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale. The approval of spot BTC ETFs was a watershed moment for the industry, opening the door for massive institutional and retail capital to flow into Bitcoin via regulated channels. Following this, attention quickly turned to Ethereum. As of recent developments, the SEC has also moved towards approving spot Ethereum ETFs, signaling a potential shift in regulatory comfort with major proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies. Any new ETF filing, including the potential Truth Social ETF , must go through a rigorous SEC review process. This involves: Initial Filing (S-1): The applicant submits a registration statement outlining the proposed ETF. Review Period: The SEC reviews the filing, often asking for amendments and clarifications. Decision: The SEC must ultimately approve or disapprove the application within specific timeframes, although these can be extended. Given the SEC’s recent actions regarding spot BTC and ETH ETFs, the regulatory environment is arguably more favorable than in the past. However, a filing from a company like Truth Social, with its unique profile, could still face specific scrutiny or delays. Potential Implications for Trump Media and the Crypto Market What does a move like this mean for Trump Media and the broader crypto space? For Trump Media, launching an ETF could be a strategic business diversification, potentially tapping into the significant interest in crypto investing among certain demographics. It could also be a way to generate revenue through management fees if the ETF is approved and attracts significant assets. From the perspective of the crypto market, a Truth Social-branded ETF could have several implications: Increased Awareness: It brings cryptocurrency further into the mainstream, potentially introducing crypto investing to a new audience who are users of the Truth Social platform. Market Legitimacy: Another ETF filing from a recognized (albeit non-financial) brand adds to the growing list of entities seeking to offer regulated crypto products, further legitimizing the asset class. Political Intersection: This filing uniquely intersects the world of finance, technology, and politics, potentially sparking broader public and political discussions about cryptocurrency regulation and adoption. Competition: If approved, the Truth Social ETF would compete with existing and upcoming spot BTC and ETH ETFs from established financial institutions. The success and impact of this potential ETF would, of course, depend heavily on SEC approval, the structure of the fund, and investor appetite. What Are the Potential Benefits? Should the Truth Social ETF gain approval, several potential benefits could arise: Easier Access for Investors: Provides a familiar, regulated pathway for individuals and institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum through brokerage accounts. Potential for Increased Capital Inflow: A new ETF, particularly one associated with a prominent brand, could attract fresh capital into the BTC and ETH markets. Enhanced Liquidity: As with other spot ETFs, this could contribute to increased trading volume and liquidity for the underlying assets. Mainstream Validation: Another ETF product signals growing acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies into the traditional financial system. What Challenges Lie Ahead? Despite the potential benefits, the path to launching the Truth Social ETF is likely fraught with challenges: SEC Approval Uncertainty: While the environment is more favorable, approval is not guaranteed. The SEC will scrutinize the filing, market surveillance, and potential risks. Regulatory Changes: The regulatory landscape for crypto is constantly evolving, which could impact the approval process or the operation of the ETF. Market Volatility: Bitcoin and Ethereum are known for price volatility, which could impact the performance of the ETF and investor sentiment. Competition: The market for BTC and ETH ETFs is becoming crowded with offerings from major financial players. Attracting assets under management (AUM) will be competitive. Political Scrutiny: Given Truth Social’s affiliation, the filing may attract political attention and debate, potentially adding another layer of complexity. Actionable Insights: What Should You Watch For? For those following the crypto market and this development, here are some key things to watch: Keep an eye on official announcements from the SEC regarding the filing. ETF applications have specific review periods, and any updates or delays will be publicly noted. Observe the market reaction to this news. While initial reports may cause a stir, sustained impact depends on the likelihood of approval and investor interest. Look for any further details or statements from Trump Media & Technology Group or Truth Social regarding their intentions, the structure of the proposed ETF, and their strategy for entering the crypto space. A Surprising Turn in the Crypto ETF Race The filing by Truth Social for a dual Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF is undoubtedly a surprising development in the ongoing race to bring regulated crypto investment products to market. It highlights the increasing mainstream interest in digital assets, even from companies outside the traditional finance sector. While the road to SEC approval is never guaranteed, especially for a novel application like this, the filing itself is a significant event, underscoring the expanding reach and influence of cryptocurrencies in the broader financial and technological landscape. The coming months will reveal how the SEC responds and what this could ultimately mean for Truth Social, Trump Media, and the future of crypto investing.

The Aptos network, known for its focus on scalability and usability, is taking a significant step to strengthen its ecosystem’s integrity. A major development recently announced is the collaboration between the Aptos Foundation and leading blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. This Chainalysis partnership is set to significantly enhance Aptos security and foster greater confidence across the network. Understanding the Chainalysis Partnership with Aptos The core of this collaboration involves the Aptos Foundation sharing information regarding addresses identified as being linked to illicit or risky activities directly with Chainalysis. This data exchange is a critical move in proactive defense against financial crime within the blockchain space. Chainalysis, with its sophisticated tools and extensive database, can then integrate this information to improve its monitoring and tracing capabilities specifically for the Aptos network. Here’s what the partnership fundamentally aims to achieve: Enhanced Monitoring: Allowing Chainalysis to better identify and track potentially problematic transactions and wallets on Aptos. Improved Compliance: Providing businesses and services operating on Aptos with better tools and data to meet regulatory requirements. Risk Mitigation: Helping to flag and potentially prevent funds associated with illegal activities from moving through the network. This move aligns Aptos with industry best practices for security and compliance, demonstrating a commitment to creating a responsible and safe blockchain environment. Strengthening Aptos Security Through Collaboration While Aptos is built with robust technical architecture designed for safety and reliability, the threat landscape in the crypto world is constantly changing. Exploits, scams, and illicit financing attempts are persistent challenges. By integrating Chainalysis’s expertise, Aptos is adding a crucial layer of defense focused on the financial flows on the network. Think of it this way: the core Aptos protocol provides the secure rails for transactions. The Chainalysis partnership adds the intelligence layer that helps identify if the *contents* of those transactions or the *participants* involved might be linked to harmful activities. This proactive sharing of information about suspicious addresses allows for faster identification and potential action against bad actors, making the network inherently safer for legitimate users and applications. The Power of Blockchain Analytics in Combating Illicit Activity Blockchain analytics is the process of inspecting, identifying, clustering, and tracing transactions on a blockchain. Firms like Chainalysis are at the forefront of this field, developing sophisticated software that can analyze vast amounts of on-chain data. Their tools can: Identify addresses belonging to known entities (exchanges, darknet markets, sanctioned entities, etc.). Trace the flow of funds across multiple transactions and even different blockchains. Estimate the risk score associated with a particular wallet or transaction based on its history and connections. Detect patterns indicative of fraudulent activity, money laundering, or sanctions evasion. By leveraging Chainalysis’s capabilities, the Aptos ecosystem gains access to world-class tools for understanding the financial activity occurring on its chain. This is vital not just for security, but also for transparency and accountability, which are key to mainstream adoption. Driving Better Crypto Compliance on the Apt Aptos Network For decentralized applications (dApps), businesses, and service providers building on or interacting with Aptos, regulatory compliance is becoming increasingly important globally. This Chainalysis partnership directly supports efforts to improve crypto compliance within the ecosystem. How does this help with compliance? Chainalysis provides compliance software and services that businesses can use to screen transactions and wallets for risk. With the Aptos Foundation sharing specific illicit addresses, Chainalysis’s data for Aptos becomes more accurate and comprehensive. This means: Exchanges and Wallets: Can better screen deposits and withdrawals to avoid interacting with funds from illicit sources. dApps and Protocols: Can integrate compliance checks where necessary, reducing their exposure to regulatory risk. Institutions: Gain more confidence in the network’s integrity, potentially lowering barriers to institutional participation. Improved compliance coverage makes the Aptos network a more attractive and viable platform for businesses that need to operate within regulatory frameworks, ultimately fostering growth and legitimacy. Enhancing On-Chain Security for a Safer Ecosystem Ultimately, the goal of this partnership is to enhance overall on-chain security on the Aptos network. This goes beyond just tracking illicit funds; it contributes to building a safer, more trustworthy environment for everyone. Key benefits for the ecosystem include: Increased User Trust: Users can feel more confident transacting on a network actively working to combat fraud and illicit activity. Developer Confidence: Developers building dApps can do so with greater assurance that the underlying network is being monitored for harmful uses. Ecosystem Growth: A reputation for strong security and compliance attracts more legitimate projects, users, and investment. Reduced Risk of Exploitation: While analytics doesn’t prevent all exploits, tracing funds post-exploit can aid recovery efforts and deter future attacks by making it harder for attackers to cash out. This collaboration signifies Aptos’s commitment to proactive security measures that protect its community and promote responsible innovation in the Web3 space. What This Means for the Future of Aptos This partnership is more than just a technical integration; it’s a strategic move positioning Aptos as a network that prioritizes safety and compliance alongside performance and scalability. In an era of increasing scrutiny on the crypto industry, demonstrating a commitment to combating illicit activity is crucial for mass adoption and positive regulatory engagement. While challenges remain, such as balancing privacy with security and ensuring the accuracy of data, this step is a significant positive development. It provides a foundation for a more secure and compliant ecosystem, paving the way for broader participation from users, developers, and institutions alike. Actionable Insights For Users: While network-level security is enhanced, always practice good personal security habits (secure wallets, beware of phishing). Be aware that increased analytics can sometimes impact privacy, though the focus is typically on illicit activity. For Developers & Businesses on Aptos: Explore integrating Chainalysis tools or similar compliance solutions into your dApps or services, especially if handling significant value or user funds. Stay informed about evolving compliance requirements. For the Community: Support initiatives that enhance network safety and report suspicious activity through appropriate channels if available. Conclusion: A Safer Horizon for Aptos The partnership between Aptos and Chainalysis marks a vital step forward in strengthening the security and compliance posture of the Aptos network. By combining Aptos’s performant architecture with Chainalysis’s leading blockchain analytics capabilities, the collaboration aims to create a safer environment, combat illicit activity, and enhance crypto compliance for all participants. This focus on building trust through robust on-chain security is essential for the long-term health and widespread adoption of the Aptos ecosystem, promising a more secure future for Web3 innovation on the platform.

The latest to make headlines is Universal Digital, a Canadian publicly-listed company, which has announced a significant pivot in its treasury strategy. They are moving towards a Bitcoin treasury strategy , a decision that signals a growing trend in corporate adoption of the leading cryptocurrency. What Exactly is Universal Digital’s Bitcoin Treasury Strategy? Universal Digital has publicly stated its intention to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy . According to a press release highlighted by Crypto Briefing, the company plans to gradually divest its existing portfolio of various altcoin holdings . The funds generated from these sales will then be strategically reallocated into purchases of Bitcoin (BTC). This isn’t just a simple portfolio adjustment; it represents a fundamental shift in how Universal Digital Bitcoin reserves will be managed, prioritizing Bitcoin as the primary digital asset for their corporate treasury. This move suggests a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its suitability as a reserve asset compared to a diversified basket of altcoins. The gradual nature of the sale of altcoin holdings indicates a planned approach to minimize market impact and manage the transition effectively. By consolidating their digital asset exposure into Bitcoin, Universal Digital aims for a more focused and, in their view, potentially more secure and valuable treasury position. Why the Growing Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? Corporate Bitcoin adoption has become a hot topic in recent years, spearheaded by companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla, who have famously added significant amounts of BTC to their balance sheets. But why are more businesses considering a Company Bitcoin strategy ? Several factors contribute to this trend, particularly in the current macroeconomic climate: Inflation Hedge: Many corporate treasurers are concerned about the devaluation of fiat currencies due to inflation and quantitative easing policies globally. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, is increasingly viewed as a potential hedge against this loss of purchasing power. Store of Value: Proponents argue that Bitcoin serves as a digital store of value, akin to digital gold, offering a durable asset that is resistant to censorship and confiscation, unlike traditional financial assets. Potential Appreciation: While highly volatile, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant long-term price appreciation potential since its inception. Holding BTC offers the possibility of substantial returns on treasury capital, potentially outperforming traditional low-yield investments like bonds or cash reserves. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can provide diversification benefits to a traditional corporate treasury portfolio that might be heavily concentrated in cash, government securities, or short-term corporate debt. Leading Digital Asset: Bitcoin’s first-mover advantage, largest market capitalization, deepest liquidity, and robust decentralized network security make it the most established and widely accepted digital asset for institutional adoption. For companies like Universal Digital, moving towards a Corporate Bitcoin adoption strategy is often a calculated decision based on these perceived benefits, a long-term outlook on the future of finance, and a desire to be at the forefront of digital asset integration. Navigating the Shift: Selling Altcoin Holdings for Bitcoin The core of Universal Digital’s announcement involves selling their existing altcoin holdings . This process requires careful execution and strategic planning. Liquidating potentially diverse altcoin portfolios can present challenges related to market depth, execution risk, and timing. Selling large amounts of less liquid altcoins could potentially impact their price, leading to less favorable execution than anticipated. However, the strategic intent behind divesting altcoin holdings is clear: consolidate value into Bitcoin. This move signifies a strategic focus, shifting away from the potentially higher risk and volatility associated with a broader range of digital assets to concentrate on Bitcoin, which is often viewed as the most secure, liquid, and established cryptocurrency in the space. The decision to move from a diversified altcoin portfolio to a concentrated Bitcoin treasury strategy highlights Universal Digital’s specific risk assessment and long-term vision for its digital asset reserves. Is a Company Bitcoin Strategy Right for Your Business? Key Considerations While Corporate Bitcoin adoption is gaining traction, implementing a Company Bitcoin strategy is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Businesses must carefully consider various factors and assess their own circumstances before taking the plunge. It requires a thorough understanding of the risks and complexities involved: Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin’s price volatility is notoriously high. Companies must have a strong appetite for risk and the ability to withstand significant short-term fluctuations in the value of their treasury holdings. This is perhaps the most critical factor. Regulatory Environment: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally and varies significantly by jurisdiction. Companies need to navigate potential compliance, reporting, and licensing requirements, which can be complex and subject to change. Custody and Security: Securing Bitcoin holdings requires specialized knowledge and robust security infrastructure. Losing private keys means permanent loss of funds. Companies must implement secure custody solutions, whether through self-custody best practices or engaging institutional-grade custodians with strong security track records. Accounting and Tax Implications: Managing Bitcoin on the balance sheet involves complex accounting and tax considerations. Rules vary by region, and businesses often need expert advice to ensure compliance with relevant accounting standards (like GAAP or IFRS) and tax laws. Stakeholder Communication: A move into Bitcoin treasury requires clear communication with shareholders, employees, and the public about the rationale, risks, and strategy behind the decision. Long-Term Vision: A Bitcoin treasury strategy is typically a long-term play, focused on preserving or growing capital over years, not a short-term trading strategy. Companies need conviction in Bitcoin’s future role in the global financial system. Here’s a simplified look at some pros and cons to consider when evaluating a Company Bitcoin strategy : Potential Benefits of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Potential Challenges of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Hedge against inflation and currency devaluation High price volatility and potential for significant losses Potential for significant capital appreciation Evolving and uncertain regulatory landscape Diversification away from traditional assets Complex security and custody requirements Increased visibility and perception as innovative Accounting complexities and tax implications Accessibility and global transferability Public and stakeholder perception risks Universal Digital’s decision reflects their specific risk assessment, strategic goals, and confidence in managing the complexities involved in transitioning from diverse altcoin holdings to a concentrated Bitcoin position. The Broader Picture: The Evolving Landscape of Digital Asset Treasuries The move by Universal Digital Bitcoin strategy is part of a larger narrative surrounding the integration of digital assets into corporate finance. While Bitcoin remains the dominant choice for corporate treasury reserves due to its maturity, liquidity, and perceived security, the broader landscape of digital asset treasury management is slowly evolving. Some companies are exploring stablecoins for operational purposes or yield-generating strategies in decentralized finance (DeFi), though these carry different risk profiles than holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset. However, the focus for treasury strategies largely remains on Bitcoin as the primary non-sovereign, hard-capped asset. The trend towards a Bitcoin treasury strategy highlights a growing confidence among certain corporate leaders in the long-term viability and potential benefits of holding cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets. As the infrastructure around digital assets matures, including institutional custody solutions, clearer regulatory frameworks, and better accounting guidance, we may see even wider Corporate Bitcoin adoption in the coming years. This evolving landscape of how companies manage their digital assets, moving potentially from diverse altcoin holdings to more focused strategies like Universal Digital’s, is one to watch closely as it shapes the future of corporate finance. Conclusion: A Strategic Shift in the Digital Age Universal Digital’s announcement to shift its altcoin holdings into a dedicated Bitcoin treasury strategy is a significant development in the corporate world’s increasing engagement with digital assets. It underscores the growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class for corporate balance sheets and aligns with a broader trend of Corporate Bitcoin adoption seen globally. While challenges exist, including volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and operational complexities, the decision by companies like Universal Digital signals a forward-thinking approach to treasury management in the digital age. Their move to consolidate into Bitcoin from diverse altcoin holdings is a clear statement about their preferred digital asset focus and their belief in Bitcoin’s role as a long-term store of value. This strategic pivot highlights the dynamic nature of corporate finance as it adapts to the possibilities and challenges presented by the digital asset revolution.

Recent reports highlight escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, with a specific warning that could have far-reaching implications. Understanding this geopolitical risk is crucial for anyone navigating today’s interconnected markets. According to information shared by Walter Bloomberg on X, the semi-official Iranian news agency Mehr has reported that Iran is prepared to deliver a “major blow” to Israel. This statement, while brief, carries substantial weight given the historical context and ongoing friction in the region. Such declarations often signal potential shifts in military or diplomatic posture, which in turn can send ripples across international relations and financial stability. Understanding the Potential Market Impact of Iran Israel Tensions Geopolitical events, particularly those involving significant regional powers like Iran and Israel, frequently trigger reactions in global financial markets. Why does this matter for assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies? The primary connection lies in increased uncertainty and perceived risk. When major conflicts or threats emerge, investors often seek to re-evaluate their portfolios. Traditional markets, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities, are typically the first to react. Oil prices, for instance, are highly sensitive to Middle East tension due to the region’s critical role in global energy supply. Gold, historically seen as a safe-haven asset, often sees increased demand during times of political instability. The knock-on effect of these movements, coupled with a general rise in investor anxiety, can influence the broader financial ecosystem, including the crypto market. Here are some potential ways escalating Iran Israel tensions could manifest in market reactions: Increased Volatility: Uncertainty fuels volatility. News of potential conflict can lead to sharp price swings in various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Shift in Investor Sentiment: A risk-off sentiment might emerge, prompting some investors to reduce exposure to perceived riskier assets like altcoins or even Bitcoin, at least initially. Safe-Haven Narrative Testing: Bitcoin has, at times, been presented as a digital safe haven. Geopolitical crises can test this narrative, showing whether investors flock to or away from BTC during times of stress. Impact on Traditional Finance: Significant disruption in traditional markets could indirectly affect the crypto space through capital flows or changes in institutional investor behavior. How Does Geopolitical Risk Influence Crypto Market Volatility? While the cryptocurrency market operates 24/7 and is less directly tied to specific national economies than traditional stock markets, it is not immune to global events. Major geopolitical flashpoints contribute to overall market sentiment and liquidity. High levels of geopolitical risk can lead to: Liquidity Crunch: In times of panic, investors might sell assets (including crypto) to raise cash, leading to downward price pressure. Correlation Shifts: The correlation between crypto and traditional assets might change. Sometimes Bitcoin acts like a tech stock; other times, it shows traits similar to gold. Geopolitical events can influence which correlation dominates. Regulatory Uncertainty: Heightened international tensions can sometimes lead to increased scrutiny or calls for stricter regulation of decentralized assets like crypto, adding another layer of uncertainty. It’s important to note that the relationship between geopolitical events and crypto market volatility is complex and not always predictable. While a major negative event might intuitively suggest a sell-off, counter-narratives (like Bitcoin as a decentralized asset outside traditional control) can also come into play. What Should Crypto Holders Consider Amidst Middle East Tension? Given the potential for increased Middle East tension to impact markets, crypto holders might consider several factors: Stay Informed, But Be Skeptical: Follow reputable news sources for updates on the geopolitical situation, but be wary of sensationalism or FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) specifically targeting the crypto market based on these events. Review Your Risk Tolerance: Understand how potential market swings align with your personal financial goals and risk appetite. Diversification: Ensure your portfolio, both within crypto and across different asset classes, is diversified according to your strategy. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term investors, short-term geopolitical volatility might be viewed as noise or even potential buying opportunities, rather than a reason to panic sell. Security: Regardless of market conditions, always prioritize the security of your private keys and exchange accounts. The report from Mehr, relayed by Walter Bloomberg, serves as a reminder that external global factors can and do influence the financial world. While the direct outcome of the reported “major blow” threat remains to be seen, its potential to amplify geopolitical risk and subsequently affect market dynamics is clear. In conclusion, the news of Iran’s preparedness to deliver a “major blow” to Israel, as reported by Mehr news agency, underscores the ever-present reality of Iran Israel tensions. For the crypto community, this serves as a critical reminder that while decentralized, the market does not exist in a vacuum. Global events, particularly those increasing Middle East tension and geopolitical risk , have the potential to drive significant crypto market volatility . Staying informed, maintaining a clear strategy, and understanding the broader market context are essential for navigating these turbulent times.

Dogecoin Is Currently Trading Inside A Symmetrical Triangle In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared a chart that shows where Dogecoin currently stands from a technical analysis (TA) perspective. Below is the graph in question, showing the trend in the 1-day price of the memecoin. From the chart, it’s visible that the Dogecoin price has possibly been trading inside a triangular channel during the last few months. The channel hasn’t appeared to be just any triangle-shaped one, either, but a special type called the Symmetrical Triangle. Related Reading: Ethereum ETF Frenzy: Inflows Jump 5x While Bitcoin Stalls A Symmetrical Triangle forms whenever an asset observes consolidation between two trendlines converging at a roughly equal and opposite slope. The upper line of the pattern tracks lower highs in the price, and the lower one higher lows. As the asset moves inside this channel, its range becomes narrower with time, until it shrinks down to a point at the apex. Generally, volatile moves are more likely to occur when consolidation tightens, so a breakout of the pattern becomes increasingly probable as the price approaches the tip of the triangle Symmetrical Triangle breakouts can signal a continuation of the trend in the direction of the break. This means that a rise above the pattern can be a bullish sign, while a drop below it may be a bearish one. As displayed in the chart, the 1-day price of Dogecoin has recently been nearing the end of the triangle, a potential sign that a breakout could be imminent. Currently, the memecoin is retesting the lower line, so it will be interesting to see whether the level holds or if this is where a break would finally happen. Unlike the Ascending and Descending Triangles, two other popular types of triangular channels in TA, breakouts are usually considered to be equally probable in either direction for a Symmetrical Triangle. The reason is simple: consolidation occurs in an exactly sideways manner in this pattern. In contrast, the Ascending and Descending types slope upward and downward, respectively, which can bias the breakout direction. Thus, even if Dogecoin is retesting the lower level right now, a rebound and then breakout from the upper line may also still be quite possible. That said, in the event that a bearish breakout does take place, things can be especially troubling for DOGE, as there is another level of importance just nearby.

Unlike purchasing XRP directly on a crypto exchange, an ETF trades on traditional stock exchanges like the TSX. This means investors can buy and sell shares of the ETF through their regular brokerage accounts, alongside stocks and bonds. The structure of this particular ETF is crucial: it will directly invest in XRP. This ‘physical’ backing means the ETF’s performance is intended to track the price movements of XRP itself, minus management fees and operational costs. This direct investment approach is often preferred by investors seeking genuine exposure to the underlying asset’s price action. The listing date is set for June 18th on the Toronto Stock Exchange . This adds XRP to the growing list of cryptocurrencies that have received ETF approval in Canada, further solidifying the country’s position as a leader in regulated crypto investment products. Understanding the Purpose Investments XRP Offering: Tickers Explained Purpose Investments, known for launching North America’s first Bitcoin ETF, is bringing its expertise to the XRP market. Their new offering, the ‘Purpose XRP ETF’, will be available under three different tickers on the TSX to cater to various investor preferences regarding currency exposure: XRPP (CAD hedged): This ticker is designed for investors who want to minimize the impact of fluctuations between the Canadian dollar (CAD) and the underlying asset’s price (which is typically benchmarked against USD). The hedging aims to isolate the performance based primarily on the price movement of XRP in USD terms, reducing CAD/USD currency risk. XRPP.B (CAD unhedged): This ticker offers direct exposure to the price of XRP in Canadian dollars. The performance will reflect both the price changes of XRP and the exchange rate movements between CAD and USD. This is suitable for investors comfortable with currency risk or those who believe the CAD may strengthen relative to the USD. XRPP.U (USD standard): This ticker allows investors to trade the ETF in US dollars directly on the Toronto Stock Exchange. This is convenient for investors who hold USD or prefer to think about their investment performance in USD terms without currency conversion effects from the CAD side. Providing multiple tickers with different currency options gives investors flexibility in how they manage their portfolio’s currency exposure when they decide to invest in XRP via this ETF. The Significance of a Crypto ETF Canada Listing for XRP Canada has been at the forefront of approving cryptocurrency ETFs, starting with Bitcoin and Ethereum. The addition of an XRP ETF is noteworthy for several reasons: Increased Legitimacy: Listing on a major regulated exchange like the Toronto Stock Exchange lends a layer of legitimacy and validation to XRP as an asset class in the eyes of traditional finance. Accessibility: ETFs are highly accessible investment vehicles. They can be bought and sold easily through existing brokerage accounts, bypassing the complexities sometimes associated with setting up accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges, managing wallets, and understanding private keys. This opens the door for a broader range of investors, including institutions and retail investors who prefer traditional investment structures. Institutional Interest: While retail investors benefit from ease of access, a regulated XRP ETF Canada could also pave the way for greater institutional participation in the XRP market. Many institutional mandates restrict investments to regulated securities, making an ETF an ideal vehicle. Market Depth: The introduction of a regulated investment product can potentially increase liquidity and market depth for XRP by attracting capital from traditional financial markets. This move by Purpose Investments, following regulatory approval, highlights the growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into mainstream financial systems, particularly within the Canadian market. Investing via the Toronto Stock Exchange : Benefits and Challenges Accessing crypto assets like XRP through a regulated exchange like the Toronto Stock Exchange offers distinct advantages: Benefits: Regulatory Oversight: ETFs are regulated financial products, offering investor protections not always available when trading directly on unregulated crypto platforms. Ease of Use: Trading through a standard brokerage account is familiar to most investors. Custody Handled: The ETF provider handles the complexities and security risks associated with storing the underlying XRP. Liquidity: ETFs are generally highly liquid, making it easy to enter and exit positions. However, there are also potential challenges when you decide to invest in XRP this way: Challenges: Management Fees (MER): ETFs charge annual fees (Management Expense Ratio) which can eat into returns over time. These are typically higher for crypto ETFs than traditional equity ETFs. Tracking Error: The ETF’s performance might not perfectly mirror the price of the underlying asset due to fees, operational costs, and trading differences. Lack of Direct Ownership: You own shares of the ETF, not the actual XRP. This means you cannot use the XRP for transactions, staking, or participation in any potential network activities. Trading Hours: ETFs trade only during standard stock market hours, unlike crypto markets which operate 24/7. Investors should weigh these factors when considering whether an ETF is the right way for them to gain exposure to XRP. How to Invest in XRP Through the New ETF For Canadian investors interested in gaining exposure to XRP via the Purpose XRP ETF, the process is straightforward if you already have a brokerage account. On or after June 18th, you will be able to search for the ETF using its tickers (XRPP, XRPP.B, or XRPP.U) on your brokerage platform, whether it’s with a major bank or an online broker. You can then place buy or sell orders just like you would for any stock. Choosing the right ticker depends on your view on currency fluctuations and your preferred trading currency. If you are concerned about the CAD/USD exchange rate impacting your returns, the hedged CAD option (XRPP) might be suitable. If you want pure XRP price exposure in CAD, the unhedged option (XRPP.B) works. If you prefer trading in USD, use XRPP.U. This new option sits alongside direct purchases on crypto exchanges, offering an alternative for those prioritizing regulation, ease of access through traditional finance, and professional custody over direct asset control. Conclusion: A New Chapter for XRP ETF Canada The approval and upcoming listing of the Purpose XRP ETF on the Toronto Stock Exchange is undeniably a significant step forward for XRP within the regulated financial landscape. It provides Canadian investors with a familiar, accessible, and regulated pathway to gain exposure to the digital asset, potentially attracting new capital and increasing XRP’s visibility in traditional markets. While direct ownership offers different benefits, the ETF provides a compelling alternative for those prioritizing ease of access and regulatory compliance. As the Crypto ETF Canada market continues to mature, this listing marks another milestone in the ongoing convergence of traditional finance and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies.

The technical signs like a decline through key moving averages and dwindling volumes are whispering about a market that is waiting on new catalysts. Solana remains one of the leaders on the crypto market but lacking adoption by institutional buyers or a growth in network TVL its elevation can be constrained. In the meantime new DeFi crypto token Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting some traction with a price under 1 dollar as investors seek the next major cryptocurrency that can take off. Mutuum Finance currently at $0.03 is starting to gather serious momentum amongst early investors who have made large bets on its DeFi utility and potential gain. Solana Faces Key Technical Hurdles at $160 Level Solana (SOL) is trading at $152.95 experiencing a minor pullback within a broader market consolidation. SOL is however encountering robust selling at the $160-$161 region which has curtailed multiple breakout attempts in recent sessions even as the token recovers the losses suffered in May. Technical charts show that Solana is lower than its 50-day moving average by a small margin and the volume is declining as well which is a sign of absence of short term momentum. Phase 5 of Mutuum Finance Presale Now Underway The fifth phase of Mutuum Finance presale has started as the platform attracts increasing investor interest. The DeFi solution provided by Mutuum Finance operates as a scalable long-term solution instead of risky meme coins. Investor confidence remains high since Phase 5 of the presale has surpassed $10.6 million total sales and attracted more than 12000 token holders before the following price adjustment. The presale token price has reached $0.03 during Phase 5 of the presale while the launch will bring it to $0.06. USD-Pegged Stablecoin and Audited by CertiK Mutuum Finance will launch its fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Built to survive the collapses of algorithmic models, the stablecoin’s robust construction enables long-term stability and price consistency. Underpinned by open-source smart contracts and the success of a Certik audit the platform offers a safe foundation for digital financial transactions. Mutuum Finance is pairing state-of-the-art lending features with a robust ecosystem charting a definite course for the future of DeFi. Early Investors Reap Rewards as Community Expands As the platform gains traction, Mutuum Finance continues to reward its early backers. Ten lucky investors will be selected to share a $100,000 giveaway prize each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens as a thank-you for supporting the project early on. As Solana (SOL) struggles with the resistance at the $160 mark and the decreasing momentum investors are beginning to turn their attention to high-reward projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Having raised the capital of more than $10.6 million and 12,100+ people already on board MUTM is starting to receive recognition as a DeFi heavyweight yet it trades at only $0.03. The basics of the project such as a fully audited Certik security report a USD-pegged stablecoin and a dual-lending protocol can make it enter the top 20 cryptocurrencies in 2025. With SOL failing to deliver the thrills even at the early-stage projects such as Mutuum Finance are proving to be the popular choices among investors aiming to capture more substantial gains. Get your stake now before the price increases to 0.035 during the next presale stage.

The age‑old question is, can cryptocurrency prevent cross‑border crime? Criminals in early 2024 abducted two ethnic Chinese executives in the Philippines, Southeast Asia. They demanded a ransom of $3.75 million paid in cryptocurrency due to a digital trail too complex to follow, funds too fluid to stop, and technology too fast for law enforcement to catch up. What seemed like the perfect crime backfired after the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, stepped in to help. Their Financial Intelligence Unit worked with law enforcement to track the blockchain, identify the wallets involved, freeze the funds in real-time, and uncover the laundering trail the criminals thought would keep them hidden. This case suggests that cryptocurrency’s publicly accessible ledger might be the key to solving crimes. It dismisses the idea that digital currencies make it easier for people to commit offenses across borders and get away with them. However, it only worked because Binance chose to help, which raises some difficult questions. What happens if other platforms don’t do the same? What if a company refuses to give information, takes too long to respond, or doesn’t have the tools or staff to act fast? And if only a few big exchanges like Binance can freeze crypto or recover ransom money, does that mean they now have too much power to decide when to act, who to help, and how to support police or victims? Users say this control raises issues about fairness, trust, and accountability because it could give private companies more influence than some governments. Abductors launder crypto ransom through casino junkets The captors combined the ransom with other funds to make it untraceable. They sent it to multiple crypto wallets based in other countries through casino junkets because they aren’t well-regulated and can quietly move huge amounts of cash or crypto. The abductors took advantage of the junkets’ secrecy to make the investigation extremely difficult. While junkets look like travel planners or casino VIP services that help rich people travel and gamble in luxury casinos, they help move money behind the scenes. The Philippine law enforcement authorities contacted Binance’s Financial Intelligence Unit to help track the ransom payment of nearly $3.75 million in crypto scattered across several digital wallets. Binance FIU steps in Binance’s FIU team used powerful blockchain analytics tools to track the funds through the public ledger by analyzing their movement, mapping out the wallet addresses involved, and connecting them to real user accounts on the platform. They identified key wallets and accounts suspected to be part of the laundering operation. They froze over $3.5 million worth of crypto tied directly to the ransom payment to prevent the criminals from cashing out or transferring the funds to other platforms. Binance’s FIU helped turn what seemed like a hopeless digital trail into a clear path toward justice and gave law enforcement the breakthrough they needed to understand how the operation worked. Crypto solved the case, but critics say not all platforms are up to the task People have long believed that crypto helped criminals hide and move money without a trace. Still, investigators in the abduction could follow the digital trail and connect the dots because the public blockchain records every crypto transaction. Some users claim the case proves crypto can be useful in bringing criminals to justice, with one official close to the case saying, “Binance’s help was crucial. The funds were highly fragmented, but the blockchain doesn’t lie.” However, critics argue that smaller exchanges or offshore platforms lack the resources and experience to handle these complex investigations and may even ignore law enforcement requests or delay action. They say the case raises concerns about uneven capabilities in the wider crypto industry because its success depended heavily on Binance’s ability and willingness to cooperate with police. Is Binance creating a pattern of success—or just riding a lucky break? Binance’s FIU is a powerful crime-fighting team that works closely with police in high-stakes situations other than abduction in the Philippines. It helped recover over $6 million tied to fake investment wallet scams that had affected dozens of victims in “Operation Fox Hunt” in Thailand. It worked alongside Malaysian local authorities to solve yet another abduction and return more than $1.6 million in ransom paid in crypto. The team has a faster turnaround (responds to police requests within three days) than many expect from corporate investigations. It uses blockchain tools to track funds across wallets or exchanges and freeze suspicious assets before they disappear. Binance fills in the gaps that traditional financial systems and local police departments often struggle with, especially when crimes quickly cross borders and currencies. Binance’s good track record shows what’s possible when private platforms and public agencies work together with urgency and shared purpose. But it doesn’t yet prove that the whole crypto ecosystem is ready, or willing, to help stop crime on this level. The company’s assistance in these high-profile cases was voluntary, based on their internal policies and leadership choices. No global rules force crypto exchanges to cooperate with law enforcement, no consistent legal obligations that require them to freeze funds or share data, and no international body that ensures other platforms follow Binance’s example. Fighting crypto crime takes more than luck Law enforcement agencies worldwide must invest time, money, and training into building teams that understand blockchain and follow digital money trails. They should also work with advanced forensic tools to investigate crimes that now move at digital speed. Without this knowledge, they risk falling behind criminals who are already using these tools to hide their tracks. Crypto platforms, on the other hand, should integrate strict compliance rules, real-time transaction monitoring, freezing protocols, and systems that allow them to respond quickly when police request help. Companies need to build dedicated teams like Binance’s FIU and give them the power and tools to step in fast because delays can mean the difference between saving millions or losing everything. Criminals are also aware that the law is quickly catching up because digital money leaves receipts that investigators can follow, even months or years after a crime. Victims can now hope for better policies and measures to protect their money. However, while Binance proved that crypto could stop cross-border abducting, allowing more people to see it as a tool and not a threat, another deep question arises: Can crypto consistently help stop it?

He argues that increased liquidity, low transaction costs , and staking rewards offer SOL an edge over other cryptocurrencies in the treasury asset space. While Bitcoin remains the dominant crypto treasury asset, popularized by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, Shinske believes Solana offers more efficient, scalable solutions for institutional finance, especially as the industry explores tokenized securities. “With increased liquidity making it easier to raise capital, Solana treasury companies can follow the ‘Saylor playbook’ and raise capital at a premium to NAV, purchase SOL, and increase SOL-per-share,” Shinske said Solana-linked firms surge as Shinske flags $250M capital potential Shinske pointed to several firms poised to benefit from Solana’s cachet. DeFi Development Corp. , a blockchain protocol and SOL treasury company came out as the number one choice. With the firm’s US capital markets access and a crypto-native leadership team, the firm is expected to raise $250 million annually at an average premium of 250% to net asset value (NAV). Nasdaq-listed Upexi Inc., an e-commerce company, was also estimated to raise $250 million yearly, even though it has less presence in the Solana ecosystem. SOL Strategies Inc ., a Canadian operation, is another company on the cusp of getting listed in the US and is anticipated to raise the same amount at a 250% premium. Shinske commended the company’s forward-looking approach toward SOL despite a more passive approach to acquiring SOL on the open market. Those companies’ stock rallied on the news, with DeFi Development surging as much as 19% on Monday. Upexi soared 12%, and SOL Strategies rose 9.4%. Staking edge positions Solana treasury firms for faster growth than Bitcoin peers Unlike Bitcoin, Solana allows token holders to stake their assets directly to validate transactions, earning rewards in the process—without diluting equity. This, Shinske says, gives SOL treasury firms a structural advantage. “Combining staking with treasury operations should result in Solana treasury companies growing SOL/share faster than BTC treasury companies growing BTC/share, all else equal,” he wrote. Although SOL remains more volatile than Bitcoin and currently has a lower total value locked (TVL) than Ethereum, Shinske sees it as a potential frontrunner in the evolving treasury asset market. SOL is currently trading around $157, a 19% drop on the year. By contrast, Ethereum (ETH) is nursing 21% losses and changing hands for $2,644, while Bitcoin is up 14% for the period and is exchanging hands for $107,597. Even in the face of market headwinds, Cantor Fitzgerald’s endorsement puts Solana treasury companies in pole position as a new means of crypto exposure, particularly for the investors who can’t go straight to the source or custody a digital asset themselves. With Shinske now the sole Wall Street analyst with formal coverage of Solana treasury companies, the sector may experience more institutional interest, especially if Solana’s use in financial apps continues to do well.

This is up from the current 25%. This change encourages chip manufacturers to invest more in new facilities before the tax benefit runs out at the end of 2026. It will also boost a subsidy for chipmakers to build factories in the US. Chip makers count on the Senate for the fate of the Chips Act President Joe Biden signed the Chips and Science Act in 2022. This was one of the main pillars of his domestic policy, aiming to use government support to reverse a shift in semiconductor production from the United States to Asia. It offered $39 billion in grants and as much as $75 billion in loans, but the biggest advantage of the law was its 25% tax credit for projects. The biggest beneficiaries include Intel Corp., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Samsung Electronics Co., and Micron Technology Inc. The tax credits are likely the largest portion of Chips Act incentives issued to any company in nearly all cases. In the meantime, Trump has urged repeal of the Chips Act, even if lawmakers of both parties have exhibited little enthusiasm for getting rid of subsidies that lead to high-paying jobs in their districts. On the other hand, in place of the legislation, officials from the administration, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, are renegotiating deals with semiconductor makers to negotiate larger investments without new taxpayer funding. The Senators aim to send the tax bill — which would deliver trillions of dollars in tax cuts for households and businesses — to Trump’s desk by July 4. Additionally, the bill is expected to be revised in the Senate before being put to a floor vote. The House must also approve the final version before it can become law. Trump firmly supports his tariff policies as effective in increasing investment in the US President Donald Trump’s trade war and his push to bring manufacturing back to American shores threaten one of his predecessor’s signature achievements: the Chips and Science Act. The bipartisan law is Washington’s $52 billion effort to boost the American semiconductor industry. This plan aims to lessen the United States’ dependence on Asia for the tiny parts essential to today’s economy, as they are used in everything from smartphones to missiles. The Chips Act has prompted nearly $450 billion in promises to create factories in the United States — nearly $10 in private-sector investment for every $1 spent by the government. Despite this, Trump has complained that the program is a “waste” of taxpayer funds, calling it a “horrible, horrible thing” in remarks to Congress. Additionally, the president maintains that tariffs are more effective than subsidies in spurring investment in the US. He has also hinted he would levy fresh import duties on semiconductors “down the road.” Therefore, according to him, these are enough reasons for the Republicans, who hold majorities in both chambers, to repeal the law. However, there are indications that Trump sees import taxes and direct funding as options that can work together. In support of this, a month after he suggested getting rid of the Chips Act, he signed an executive order to create a new office. This office will manage the Chips Act funds and try to negotiate “better deals” than those made by the Biden administration. This shows he might want to put his mark on the program instead of completely eliminating it. Lutnick urges other companies to follow TSMC’s lead Howard Lutnick said at his January confirmation hearing that he plans to take a look at the Chips Act awards given out under the Biden administration and ensure he receives what he refers to as the “benefit of the bargain.” A new group in the Commerce Department, known as the United States Investment Accelerator, is now taking on the review role. Trump established this office in March with an executive order that “aims to negotiate much better deals” than Biden’s. The main goal for Trump’s team is to encourage more announcements like TSMC’s, which said in March it would invest an extra $100 billion in US plants. This adds to a previous commitment of $65 billion — all without increasing its Chips Act grants. Both Trump and Lutnick believe that the threat of tariffs influenced this decision, while TSMC pointed out that strong market demand drove its growth in the US.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Analysis As Asia begins its trading day, Tron DAO's TRX token is trading flat, up 1%. Crypto traders don't seem to be making much out of a recent announcement that Tron – for all intents and purposes – is 'going public' on the NASDAQ via a reverse merger with SRM Entertainment, a lightly traded Nasdaq-listed toy company that is now rebranding as “Tron Inc.” complete with a TRX treasury strategy. While a blockchain going public might be a little different than what traditional investors are used to, in theory, this might be a stablecoin infrastructure play. The proposed public vehicle would give equity traders access to a network that is home to 30% of all stablecoin transactions ( according to DeFi Llama data ) occur, and where half of all USDT in circulation live . In contrast, while Circle is a regulated issuer of USDC, a fiat-backed stablecoin, Tron Inc. would likely provide investors with indirect exposure to a blockchain network that facilitates a significant portion of global stablecoin activity in both the crypto market and the fast-growing global south, where the population is skeptical of the existing banking system. Unlike Circle, which does not control the infrastructure on which USDC circulates, Tron operates the network itself. This is where the two business models differ: Tron captures transaction fees and on-chain activity directly, whereas Circle’s business model is centered on custody, compliance, and interest income on the reserves backing USDC. On-chain data shows that the Tron network hosts massive whale activities, with a recent note from CryptoQuant pointing out that 59% of May’s USDT volume on Tron came from transactions over $1 million. Tron is also the network of choice for countries where the local populace doesn't trust the existing banking system, from Lebanon to Argentina and Brazil. As CoinDesk reported earlier , users in these emerging and underbanked markets typically equite dollar access directly with using Tether on Tron, rather than thinking in terms of stablecoins or blockchain protocols more broadly. While the market reaction has been muted, investors with experience in fintech or infrastructure plays may recognize the pattern. Visa’s IPO in 2008, following MasterCard’s debut in 2006, allowed public markets to gain exposure to the payment rails of the developed world. The health of the western consumer and their desire to spend pushed fees through the respective networks and dividends into investors' pockets. In China, UnionPay never went public, and so equity investors have pinned their hopes on Ant Group’s long-awaited IPO to access Alipay’s rails just as Tencent's listing gave exposure to WeChat Pay. While some once speculated that virtual yuan infrastructure might power commerce in the global south, that thesis has not materialized. Instead, commerce in underbanked regions is increasingly conducted in stablecoins and largely over Tron’s infrastructure. If that trend holds, Tron Inc. may become the most direct public-market proxy for the payment rails of emerging markets. Hong Kong’s First Solana Public Equity Listing Facilitated by OSL OSL has facilitated what appears to be the first Solana (SOL) treasury allocation by a Hong Kong-listed company, enabling MemeStrategy (2440.HK), a digital asset venture backed by 9GAG, to purchase 2,440 SOL through its platform. The acquisition of 2,440 SOL, worth approximately $370,000, was completed using OSL’s institutional platform, which provided execution, settlement, and custody services. $1.9B Inflows Cement Crypto as 2025’s Risk-On Favorite: CoinShares Digital asset investment products pulled in $1.9 billion last week, marking the ninth straight week of inflows, according to a recent report from CoinShares. That brings 2025’s year-to-date total to a record $13.2 billion, suggesting institutional appetite for crypto remains strong despite geopolitical volatility. While broader markets showed caution, capital rotated into both digital assets and gold, traditionally seen as uncorrelated safe havens, hinting at crypto’s evolving role as part of a macro hedge strategy. Bitcoin led the charge with $1.3 billion in inflows, snapping a two-week stretch of minor outflows. Ethereum followed with $583 million, the highest weekly total since February, and including its strongest single-day inflow this year. Together, the top two crypto assets accounted for over 95% of weekly inflows. But activity wasn’t limited to the majors: XRP reversed three weeks of outflows with $11.8 million in new capital, and Sui continued its hot streak with $3.5 million in inflows, a sign that select altcoins are gaining traction among professional allocators. Regionally, the United States was responsible for virtually all inflows, while Hong Kong and Brazil posted net outflows of $56.8 million and $8.5 million, respectively. These regional divergences underscore the uneven pace of crypto adoption globally, despite total flows reaching historic highs. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin surged past $108,000 with a 3.6% daily gain, showing strong resilience amid Middle East tensions as low exchange reserves and high volume pushed prices toward a key resistance level. ETH: Ethereum jumped nearly 7% to $2,671 as whales accumulated $3.8 billion worth of ETH and spot ETFs recorded 16 consecutive days of inflows, driving strong breakout momentum above key resistance levels. Gold: Gold fell below $3,400 to $3,383 despite ongoing Middle East tensions, as analysts point to a looming U.S. debt ceiling crisis, not geopolitics, as the key driver for precious metals. Nikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.21% in early trade Tuesday as Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed, with investors watching for the Bank of Japan’s policy decision and hopeful signs of de-escalation from Iran. S&P 500: The S&P 500 closed at 6,033.11, up 0.94%, as easing oil prices and hopes that the Israel-Iran conflict will remain contained boosted investor sentiment.

Ethereum is showing fresh signs of strength, pushing for a move past $4,000 as DeFi activity returns. At the same time, Pi Network’s market buzz is cooling after Binance decided not to list the token, despite strong support from users. In the middle of this shift, Web3 ai is drawing serious interest at $0.000422, helped by upcoming tools like its Crypto Lending & Borrowing Advisor. As hype-based coins start to lose ground and more focus shifts to utility-driven platforms, Ethereum’s role in DeFi keeps it high on many watchlists. Still, for those looking for bigger gains from a low entry, Web3 ai stands out. With a growing AI toolset and a forecasted 1,747% return, it is being looked at as a possible best long term crypto choice. Pi Network Stumbles After Missed Listing Chance The Pi Network is losing its recent momentum after the long-expected Binance listing failed to happen. Even with strong backing in community votes, Binance did not move forward, disappointing many PI holders. This result has slowed the PI market reaction, with trading volume falling and less interest showing up across exchanges. Missing a spot on one of the top global exchanges has created doubt about Pi’s progress and future plans. Experts point out that most of Pi’s buzz has come from community excitement, not actual product results. With energy fading, many traders are taking a second look at their positions. Though Pi is still a known name, the lack of real tools or DeFi use makes it harder to hold in a market now focused more on real-world use. As Pi continues to cool down, attention is shifting to projects with clear goals and working products. Ethereum Pushes Higher as $4,000 Level Comes Into Focus Ethereum is showing more signs of growth as it becomes stronger again in the DeFi space. Reports say Ethereum handled over $480 billion in stablecoin volume last month, much of it powered by trading bots. This spike proves Ethereum is still a key platform for DeFi, pulling in users and builders alike. Its supply setup also looks solid. Since the merge, Ethereum burns more than it creates, and this has helped make it one of the most balanced tokens in terms of supply. These signs help support the view that Ethereum could move past $4,000 soon. Chart watchers point to higher lows and strong moving average recovery as signs that Ethereum is building power. For those holding long-term, Ethereum remains one of the most trusted names in crypto. Its strong user base and high developer interest make it a steady option in a wider plan. Web3 ai Attracts Attention with $0.000422 Price and Practical Tools As Pi loses momentum and Ethereum holds firm, Web3 ai is standing out to those searching for the best long term crypto entry point in 2025. Now in Stage 08 of its presale, Web3 ai has collected over $7.8 million and sold 22 billion tokens at a base price of $0.000422. Its appeal isn’t based on hype, but on working tools like the soon-to-launch Crypto Lending & Borrowing Advisor. This AI-based tool is designed to boost returns on platforms such as Aave, Compound, and Venus. It will review live lending rates, compare lock-up times, study platform fees, and send alerts when user collateral is at risk of being liquidated. With its automation layer, it can also reinvest returns into top-performing pools, allowing earnings to grow without constant action. What makes Web3 ai different is how it builds safety into its system. Before recommending any lending platform, it checks for past audits, scans for contract bugs, and looks at failure points. These checks are key in 2025 as many DeFi users still worry about hacks and disappearing liquidity. The Crypto Lending & Borrowing Advisor will support Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon at launch, which are three of the busiest DeFi platforms. Users will get regular suggestions based on their goals, whether they want quick APY gains or slow and steady lending. In a market where making passive income matters more than chasing price spikes, Web3 ai is stepping into a real-world role. Where the Crypto Market Is Moving Next Crypto in 2025 is moving away from hype and toward projects that deliver working features. Ethereum continues to show bullish strength as DeFi use rises and its supply model improves. At the same time, Pi is losing steam as its expected progress falls short and its network lacks real tools. On the other hand, Web3 ai is showing signs of real growth. With a low entry price, working AI tools, and a clear goal for the future, it is gaining attention. With $7.8 million already raised, a 1,747% ROI forecast at listing, and the Crypto Lending & Borrowing Advisor set to launch, Web3 ai is shaping up as one of the best long term crypto choices in this cycle.

Ethereum (ETH) is approaching a breakout that could carry it to $4,000, while Avalanche (AVAX) has dropped under $21, aiming at its previous $15.28 low from March. These movements reflect the ongoing shifts in popular crypto coins. Yet away from the spotlight, a different project is steadily capturing attention. Unstaked, a crypto project powered by AI, has collected over $10 million in its presale so far. With no private allocation, intelligent governance, and a price target of $0.1819 at launch, which is significantly higher than the current $0.011397, Unstaked is becoming a top contender for those tracking emerging high-upside crypto coins. ETH Price Outlook: Is $4,000 in Reach? ETH is currently hovering just below $2,850, a key resistance level at the top of a long-term ascending triangle. Traders are watching this formation closely, as history suggests a breakout could lift prices toward $3,800–$4,000. Looking at wider trends, Ethereum has cleared a major bull flag, which strengthens its upside case. While Bitcoin moves sideways, ETH is gaining on the ETH/BTC chart, often a sign of a broader shift toward altcoins. Chart analyst Titan of Crypto points out that as long as ETH remains above the breakout zone, a rally toward new highs is on the table. In the past day, ETH trading volume jumped by nearly 47%, and RSI readings suggest the rally has room left. A strong close above $2,850 this week could turn the $4K price from a hopeful scenario into a realistic target. AVAX Slides Toward $15 as ETF Decision Gets Delayed Unlike ETH, Avalanche (AVAX) is under strong selling pressure. Its price has dropped 13.49% this week, slipping below the February low of $20.20 and now sitting at $20.07, its lowest in more than three months. This sharp fall is linked to the SEC’s delay in ruling on Grayscale’s AVAX ETF, which is now postponed until July 15. What was supposed to fuel optimism instead created uncertainty. The impact shows in Avalanche’s DeFi data, with total value locked dropping by $108 million in three days, from $1.581 billion to $1.473 billion. Technically, AVAX has exited a descending triangle, consistently posting lower highs since April and failing to hold the $21 level. A fall below $19.50 could pull the price further down to $15.28, nearly wiping out its yearly gains. Currently, over 90% of AVAX holders are in the red, and net outflows from exchanges have surpassed $4.34 million, highlighting weak sentiment. Unstaked’s $0.011397 Presale and 27x Launch Forecast Draw Attention While the top coins ride their respective waves, Unstaked is rapidly gaining traction as one of the most-watched upcoming crypto launches. Its crypto presale has reached stage 20, raising over $10 million and selling 1 billion coins at $0.011397 each. What stands out is the planned listing price of $0.1819, offering a potential 27x upside. Unstaked’s design centers on an AI-based model called Proof of Intelligence, where algorithms adjust network actions in real time. Instead of fixed coding structures or privileged leadership teams, the system evolves through user data, decentralized learning, and feedback-driven loops. The community plays a major role in this process. Decision-making happens through AI-assisted proposals and weighted on-chain voting. Every participant’s input is optimized for better outcomes, showing how the project values true engagement. There is also complete public distribution, no coins are set aside for private buyers or insiders. This approach removes backdoor manipulation and ensures alignment between the builders and the wider community from the start. Unstaked is also running a $1M giveaway, where 20 winners will receive $50,000 each in $UNSD. To qualify, participants must complete various tasks, share socially, and purchase a minimum of $100 in tokens. The campaign spans five months, offering a combination of activity-based rewards and community-driven excitement. With the listing approaching and only a few stages remaining, the pace is picking up. Those seeking strong upside and early access are eyeing Unstaked not only for its pricing potential but for its tech-driven approach. It’s important to note that while the platform’s AI agents are part of the plan, they will only become active post-launch, once the presale ends. In a Nutshell! All in all, Ethereum is gearing up for a potential rally while Avalanche battles continued losses. However, Unstaked is steadily building its story with major presale success. With AI tools, community-powered decisions, and a fully public distribution model, Unstaked brings something different to the crypto market: a clear use case, pricing clarity, and forward progress. As major projects face external headwinds, Unstaked could emerge as the quiet frontrunner in this new cycle.

46176002,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=772327,1750125649,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/46176002.jpeg,"Bitcoin To $140,00 In 50 Days? Bitwise Bets On War Rally",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-to-14000-in-50-days-bitwise/,"Bitwise Asset Management’s European research arm argues that the sharp sell-off that followed last week’s military escalation between Iran and Israel is likely to give way to a powerful relief rally in Bitcoin, echoing the cryptocurrency’s behaviour after earlier geopolitical shocks. In its 16 June weekly newsletter Bitwise Europe points to a “Chart of the Week” that lines up the twenty most significant geopolitical risk events since July 2010 and finds that, on average, Bitcoin was “up 31.2 percent fifty days after the event, with a median gain of 10.2 percent.” According to the authors, “major geopolitical risk events tend to be good buying opportunities for bitcoin and other crypto assets.” The firm’s in-house Crypto Asset Sentiment Index briefly turned negative on Friday—its first dip below zero since May—but had already swung back into slightly bullish territory by Monday morning, a shift Bitwise attributes to renewed inflows into spot exchange-traded products and continued US-dollar weakness. At Bitcoin’s current price of around $107,000, a 31% rally would bring it to approximately $140,000. Missiles Fly, Bitcoin To $140,000? The historical analogue is being tested in real time as markets digest the first open exchange of missiles between Tehran and Jerusalem. The Associated Press reports that Iran has fired more than 370 projectiles at Israel since 13 June, killing at least twenty-four people, while Israel claims to have destroyed over 120 Iranian launchers and says it now enjoys “full aerial superiority over Tehran.” Related Reading: Bitcoin 656% Cyclical Gain Highlights Deep Market Demand – Glassnode The confrontation triggered a textbook flight to safety: gold blasted through $3,430 an ounce on Friday, establishing a fresh record high, while Brent crude spiked and global equities lurched lower. Bitcoin, which had been flirting with its all-time peak near $111,000 early last week, sank as low as $102,600 during the first wave of air-strike headlines before rebounding to the $106,000–107,000 zone. Even after that drawdown, Bitwise notes, the flagship cryptocurrency still out-performed the S&P 500 on a weekly basis thanks to a late-week equity swoon. Bitwise’s thesis rests on three pillars. First is behavioural: previous geopolitical shocks—from Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea to the US–Iran standoff of January 2020—produced knee-jerk liquidations in risk assets, yet Bitcoin’s selling pressure tended to exhaust quickly, setting the stage for a mean-reversion pop. Second is macroeconomic. Related Reading: Bitcoin Future Post Israel-Iran Event: On-Chain Analysis Disputes BTC’s $50K Crash The firm highlights a “pronounced depreciation of the US Dollar,” as the DXY index slid to its weakest level since March 2022 following softer-than-expected inflation prints and another uptick in continuing unemployment claims. Fed-funds futures now imply 1.9 rate cuts by December 2025, loosening global financial conditions and historically favourable for non-yielding, dollar-denominated assets such as Bitcoin. Third is structural demand: US spot Bitcoin ETFs took in a net $1.37 billion last week, while corporate treasuries kept accumulating—Strategy’s Michael Saylor announced the acquisition of 10,100 BTC for $1.05 billion today , and Tokyo-listed Metaplanet disclosed an additional 1,112 BTC purchase that brings its war chest to 10,000 coins. In derivatives, Bitwise flags that the put-call open-interest ratio on Bitcoin options ended the week at 0.61 after dipping to 0.55, while the one-month 25-delta skew flipped decisively into positive territory at +4.87 percent, indicating a premium for upside exposure despite realised volatility languishing around 30 percent. Funding rates on perpetual swaps also remained net long even during Thursday’s risk-off purge, a pattern the firm interprets as “bullish positioning or demand for topside hedging.” Behind the scenes, whales withdrew a net 169,527 BTC from exchanges, and exchange-held reserves fell to 2.92 million coins—about 14.6 percent of supply—further tightening spot liquidity. Sceptics may note that past performance is not predictive and that the explosive rally following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine was fuelled in part by unprecedented monetary stimulus that may not be replicated. Bitwise itself concedes that realised losses spiked to $55.5 million on-chain last week and that momentum in “apparent demand” has softened. Yet the firm argues that the confluence of structural inflows, dollar weakness and depressed sentiment mirrors the set-ups that preceded its historical sample of 31-percent rallies. As the newsletter concludes, “structural demand by both ETPs and corporate treasuries as well as continued macro tailwinds via Dollar weakness and global money supply expansion still support a positive market development for bitcoin and crypto assets.” At press time, BTC traded at $107,239.

Two projects broadcasting both value and vision are Kaspa and Qubetics. While Kaspa’s steady climb is drawing attention from data-driven analysts, Qubetics is charting a different course, aiming to solve blockchain’s biggest bottleneck: interoperability. As projections for 2030 circulate and crypto presales gather steam, these two networks stand out for distinct reasons. Kaspa’s high-throughput consensus and data availability innovations offer tangible performance metrics for price speculation. Meanwhile, Qubetics is advancing as a Web3-aggregated chain, aiming at seamless connections across decentralized systems. This article dives deep into Kaspa price prediction 2030, followed by a comprehensive look at Qubetics’ interoperability feature, token supply update, and real-world forecasts for $TICS post-launch. Kaspa Price Prediction 2030: A Year-by-Year Surge to the $0.70 Mark Kaspa’s evolution has positioned it as a high-performance Layer 1 network focused on scalability without compromising decentralization. Analysts tracking long-term performance suggest the Kaspa price prediction for 2030 may offer surprising strength across all quarters. In January 2030, the minimum projected price for KAS stands at $0.425. Its average price is expected to hover around $0.437, with a potential ceiling at $0.504. These estimates reflect conservative market confidence, boosted by Kaspa’s ability to handle fast confirmation times. February follows with a minor uptick—minimum price predicted at $0.441, an average of $0.453, and a possible high of $0.522. March continues the trend with a base of $0.457 and an average monthly figure of $0.469. If upward momentum holds, KAS may top $0.540. April is forecasted at $0.472 to $0.558, while May climbs slightly higher, averaging $0.502 with a possible peak at $0.576. Mid-year gains seem consistent. June sees projected ranges between $0.504 and $0.594. By July, predictions hit $0.520 at the minimum, $0.535 on average, and up to $0.611 at the high end. August builds on the trend with an average forecast of $0.551. Entering the fall, Kaspa’s value may cross into mainstream speculation territory. September and October are forecasted at maximum highs of $0.647 and $0.665, respectively. November’s forecast jumps to $0.683, while December potentially finishes the year at a high of $0.701. Kaspa’s year-round average price for 2030 is projected to be $0.6167, with a minimum around $0.5999 and a potential annual ROI as high as 830.9%—a figure drawing strong attention across blockchain trading desks and modeling analysts. Qubetics: High Interoperability to Connect Blockchains While Kaspa’s strength lies in speed and scalability, Qubetics is setting its foundation on a more ambitious layer: interoperability. In an area where most blockchains operate in silos, Qubetics is positioning itself as the connective tissue of the decentralized internet. Its architecture supports seamless interactions between blockchains, tokens, and DApps—including legacy giants like Bitcoin. Current chains often struggle to share data or transfer assets without cumbersome bridges or centralized workarounds. Qubetics aims to remove these issues by offering native-level compatibility and frictionless cross-chain execution. By enabling different protocols to speak the same language, Qubetics creates a composable ecosystem where apps can scale and interoperate, regardless of their origin chain. Such a setup doesn’t just aid developers. It creates smoother user experiences across wallets, DeFi protocols, and decentralized identity layers. Qubetics Crypto Presale: Scarcity Meets Acceleration The Qubetics presale is in its final public stage—Stage 37—and momentum is accelerating. With the token priced at $0.3370, over $18 million has already been raised. More than 515 million $TICS tokens have been sold, and the total number of token holders now exceeds 28,000. A major tokenomics update has drastically reduced the total supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion. This redesign enhances scarcity while increasing the public allocation to 38.55%. That shift empowers the wider community, putting more governance and rewards directly in the hands of $TICS holders. With less than 10 million tokens remaining in the final tranche, analysts are forecasting a 20% jump at listing. Qubetics Price Predictions: A $15,000 Allocation in Perspective Allocating $15,000 to $TICS at today’s crypto presale rate of $0.3370 would secure approximately 44,504 tokens. If the listing price rises to $0.40, that portfolio would be worth $17,801—an instant gain of nearly 18.7%. Should the price surge to $1, the same tokens would be valued at $44,504. At $5 per token, the value would spike to $222,520. In more aggressive growth scenarios, where $TICS hits $10 after mainnet and ecosystem integrations mature, the value becomes $445,040. At a post-mainnet valuation of $15, the original $15,000 would translate to $667,560. That’s a 4,349% ROI based on a forecasted mainnet price point, powered by both the scarcity mechanics and the projected utility of its interoperable framework. These forecasts are speculative and depend on market adoption, liquidity conditions, and continued project execution. However, analysts are increasingly confident due to strong presale performance and a transparent development roadmap. Conclusion: A Future Fueled by Cross-Chain Collaboration and Scalable Infrastructure Kaspa and Qubetics are prime examples of the dual trajectory of the blockchain space: one rooted in optimizing internal performance and another focused on external connectivity. Kaspa’s consistent growth and efficient architecture position it as a key contender for gradual, high-confidence value appreciation by 2030. Qubetics, meanwhile, offers a different kind of value—one rooted in network unification. By providing native interoperability across decentralized systems, it lays the groundwork for a truly aggregated Web3 experience. For those tracking both scalability and connectivity, Kaspa and Qubetics represent complementary avenues in a decentralized future.

The deal dramatically reduces tariffs on British exports and expands the US access to key UK markets. The executive order, signed just hours after a brief meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Canada, is expected to “operationalize” the agreement. Central to the deal is reducing the US automotive tariff from 27.5% to 10% for the first 100,000 UK-manufactured vehicles shipped to the American market annually. “This is a very good day for both of our countries, a real sign of strength,” Starmer said, confirming the new terms will immediately take effect. The agreement also shields British exports of jet engines and other aerospace components from US tariffs linked to a national security investigation Trump had launched into the aerospace sector. That exemption hinges on UK commitments to exclude China from sensitive defense and technology supply chains. Tariff relief spurs industry divides as UK bioethanol, steel sectors raise alarm While industries such as automotive and aerospace are celebrating the deal, the agreement has provoked controversy in other sectors. The UK has granted the US a tariff-free quota of 1.4 billion liters of ethanol, equivalent to the country’s entire annual demand. UK bioethanol producers have warned the decision threatens the viability of domestic production. Britain also agreed to enhance market access for American beef and industrial goods in exchange for the US tariff cuts. Negotiations regarding the treatment of UK steel and aluminum are still ongoing. The trade deal promises to eliminate US tariffs on these exports, but technical and legal hurdles have delayed implementation. British officials say they are still working with the US to finalize a quota system that would allow UK steelmakers to sidestep the 25% global steel tariff imposed by Trump under national security provisions. The situation is further complicated by US rules that require steel to be “melted and poured” in the country of origin to qualify for tariff relief—criteria that much of Britain’s steel, which is reprocessed from imported material, does not meet. As negotiations continue, Trump has offered the UK a temporary exemption from his newly doubled global steel tariff of 50%, giving time to resolve the issues. Starmer pushes rapid rollout as UK industries react to landmark US trade deal Under mounting pressure at home to secure relief for industries battered by tariffs, Starmer emphasized the importance of swift implementation. The UK automobile sector, in particular, has applauded the car tariff reduction, calling it a much-needed boost for exports amid economic uncertainty. Despite objections from the UK’s bioethanol industry, the trade pact marks one of the most comprehensive bilateral deals between the two nations in recent years and a shift in transatlantic economic relations. “We just signed it, and it’s done,” Trump told reporters, adding that the agreement reflects a new chapter in US-UK cooperation.

According to a filing dated June 16, 2025, the SEC submitted a status report to the court, requesting that the appeals stay on hold until at least August 15, 2025, when they’ll provide another update. This move comes as Ripple and the SEC continue working through a possible settlement that could reshape the outcome of the long-running case. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP In light of the pending motion for an indicative ruling, the parties have requested that the Second Circuit continue to hold the appeals in abeyance, with the @SECGov to file a status report by August 15, 2025. https://t.co/7oQvL5Rx7U — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) June 17, 2025 Earlier this year, both sides reached an agreement in principle to settle the case, but it requires the district court’s approval to modify the final judgment. Under the proposed deal, Ripple would pay a reduced penalty of $50 million, down from $125 million, with the remaining funds returned to Ripple. The SEC would also agree to lift the injunction against the company. However, a previous motion for this change was denied by the district court in May because it didn’t explain why “exceptional circumstances” justified the modification. Ripple and the SEC have since filed a new joint motion on June 12, providing additional reasons and requesting an indicative ruling from the court. Until that decision is made, both Ripple and the SEC agree it’s best to keep the appeals paused. If the district court grants their request, both sides would then ask the Second Circuit for a limited remand to finalize the settlement. On the flip side, XRP price gained 7% and hit a high of $2.34 before hitting a reverse.

About 13% of people in the city say they put money into crypto and check stocks on a regular basis. In London, 24% of residents use dating apps at least three days a week, compared with just 4% across Britain as a whole. Liverpool Takes Crypto Lead Based on reports from the survey, Liverpudlians are more likely than anyone else in Britain to log on and manage digital assets. That 13% figure outstrips every other city in the study. It suggests a strong local appetite for things like Bitcoin and Ethereum , even as markets wobble. Many people in Liverpool said they check prices several times a week, and some log in every day just to see what’s happening. Daily Online Time Remains High According to the findings, the average person in the UK spends about three-and-a-half hours online each day. About 20% of respondents admitted they spend over five hours a day in front of screens. Weekends don’t change much. When asked when they log on most, 64% said they’re active between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Of those late‑night users, 19% head straight to YouTube . That pattern hints at a mix of work‑shift browsing and just plain night‑owl habits. Northern Cities Show Their Stripes In Manchester, 27% of residents say they use Instagram regularly, more than anywhere else. Sheffield stands out in two areas: 32% of its people scroll through TikTok often, and 30% stream music every day. Sheffield households also top the list for time online, with 32% spending more than five hours a day on the internet. By comparison, only 11% of people in Brighton hit that mark. Signs Of Screen Fatigue The survey also found growing web‑use worries. About 43% of Britons feel they waste time online, and 37% worry about “doom‑scrolling.” A third (33%) say they’d feel more relaxed if they cut back on their screen hours. These figures show a real push for balance, as people juggle work chats, social feeds and streaming services. Experts say these regional differences could guide local projects and advertisers. Openreach’s deputy CEO, Katie Milligan, added that while it’s great to see how areas adapt to life online, it’s even better that many recognize the need to switch off now and then. This mix of heavy use and self‑awareness paints a clear picture: Britain is more connected than ever, but many are ready for a digital breather.

Prices bounced back above $2,600 and hovered near a key resistance level that has held for months. Traders piled into new positions, setting the stage for a big move in either direction. Related Reading: Amid Bitcoin Hype, Seasoned Trader Predicts Sudden Drop To This Level Futures Open Interest Hits Yearly High According to CoinGlass data, open interest in ETH futures jumped sharply over three days, hitting $36.56 billion on Monday. That number marks the highest level since last year. It shows that many traders are using borrowed funds to bet on where Ethereum will go next. Price Tests Multi‑Year Resistance ETH rose about 4.5% in a single session. Based on technical charts, that rally pushed ETH right up to a long‑standing descending trendline. Investors have watched that line for over a year. It sits just above the 50‑week moving average, while the 200‑week average lies just below. If ETH can clear and hold above these levels, it may signal room to run. But weak trading volume could mean bulls need more firepower before taking charge. ETF Flows Show Steady Support US spot funds tied to Ethereum saw a small outflow of $2.18 million on the same day, marking the first net withdrawal in 19 days. Yet weekly inflows still totaled $528.12 million, pushing total assets under management in these ETFs beyond $10 billion. Institutional Backing Expands ETH Reach Major asset managers are also getting more creative with Ethereum. Companies such as BlackRock and Fidelity have begun rolling out tokenized treasury products and stablecoin‑backed funds that link directly to ETH.
