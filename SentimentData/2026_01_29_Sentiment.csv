The model suggests that an extended bull market, paired with clearer and more supportive regulatory frameworks in the United States, could push top digital assets to fresh record highs in the coming years. Below is Alibaba AI’s outlook for three cryptocurrencies it believes could reach surprising new all-time highs (ATHs) this year. XRP ($XRP): Alibaba AI Sees XRP Exploding to $25 by 2027 Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) entered 2026 with strong upside momentum, rising 19% during the first week of the year. Currently trading around $1.93, KIMI AI projects that a sustained bull market could drive XRP as high as $25 by the end of 2026. That forecast implies potential gains of roughly 1,200%, equating to more than a thirteenfold increase from current levels. Source: KIMI XRP was among the top-performing large-cap cryptocurrencies last year. In July, it achieved its first new ATH in seven years, reaching $3.65 after Ripple secured a landmark legal win against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That decision significantly reduced regulatory ambiguity surrounding XRP and eased fears of wider enforcement actions across the altcoin market. Investor sentiment also improved following Donald Trump’s return to the White House, which renewed expectations of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. From a technical standpoint, XRP’s Relative Strength Index is hovering near 43, indicating that selling pressure is currently dominant. However, since early January, price action has been consolidating into a bullish flag formation. Supportive macroeconomic conditions and clearer regulatory guidance could act as the catalyst for a sustained breakout that aligns with KIMI’s $25 projection. Adding to the bullish case, newly approved spot XRP ETFs in the U.S. are beginning to attract interest from traditional investors, mirroring inflows previously seen after the launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Solana (SOL): Alibaba AI Targets $650 for SOL The Solana ($SOL) ecosystem currently holds more than $8.3 billion in total value locked and boasts a market capitalization exceeding $71 billion, supported by steady growth in both developers and users. Interest in SOL has intensified following the rollout of Solana-focused ETFs from major asset managers, including Bitwise and Grayscale. After a sharp correction toward the end of 2025, SOL has spent recent months consolidating around a key support level and is now trading near $126. A decisive move higher will likely depend on Bitcoin reclaiming the $100,000 mark, a milestone many see as inevitable sooner rather than later. Under Alibaba’s most bullish assumptions, Solana could surge to $650 by 2027. This would represent approximately 420% upside from current prices and more than double SOL’s previous all-time high of $293, set last January. Institutional adoption continues to strengthen Solana’s long-term narrative. The network is increasingly being used for real-world asset tokenization, with firms such as Franklin Templeton and BlackRock highlighting Solana’s growing role within traditional finance. Dogecoin (DOGE): Alibaba AI Expects a 7.5x Run for DOGE but No New ATH What started in 2013 as a joke has grown into one of crypto’s largest digital assets. Dogecoin ($DOGE) now carries a market capitalization close to $21 billion, accounting for nearly half of the $44 billion meme coin sector. DOGE formed several constructive chart patterns in late summer and early autumn of 2026, although momentum faded following a sharp, market-wide sell-off in October. Dogecoin reached its all-time high of $0.7316 during the retail-driven bull market of 2021. While the widely discussed $1 target remains a psychological milestone for the Dogecoin community, Alibaba AI predicts DOGE could go even higher to hit $1.50 this year. From its current price of around $0.125, that would still represent a 1,100% gain, or 12x. DOGE has also seen increasing use as a payment method. Tesla accepts Dogecoin for select merchandise, and major platforms such as PayPal and Revolut now support DOGE transactions, strengthening its real-world utility beyond meme culture. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Meme Coin Designed for High Volatility Beyond Alibaba’s analysis, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has emerged as one of January’s most talked-about meme coin presales, raising more than $4.5 million ahead of its exchange debut. The project adopts Dogecoin’s louche, gym-bro distant cousin, a hilarious figure parading in over-the-top meme culture and embracing the irreverent spirit that originally propelled meme coins into the spotlight. Maxi Doge is building its own community to defeat Dogecoin, uniting traders drawn to high-risk speculation, community-building fun, and unapologetically degen humor. MAXI is issued as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network, giving it a smaller environmental footprint compared with Dogecoin’s proof-of-work structure. Presale participants can stake MAXI for yields of up to 69% APY, with rewards gradually decreasing as more users join. The token is priced at $0.0002801 in the current presale phase, with automatic price increases triggered at each funding milestone. Purchases are supported via MetaMask and Best Wallet .

This high-stakes meeting represents a significant effort to revive comprehensive digital asset legislation that has remained stalled in the Senate for months, potentially reshaping America’s financial regulatory landscape. The CLARITY Act’s Legislative Journey The Crypto-Asset Market Structure and Transparency Act, commonly called the CLARITY Act, represents a bipartisan effort to establish clear regulatory frameworks for digital assets. Lawmakers introduced the legislation in early 2024 to address growing concerns about regulatory gaps in cryptocurrency markets. The bill specifically aims to define jurisdictional boundaries between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Furthermore, it seeks to create comprehensive consumer protection measures and establish transparency requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges. Congressional committees advanced the legislation through initial hearings with relative speed. However, the Senate Banking Committee encountered significant obstacles during mark-up sessions. Committee members debated numerous amendments throughout the summer of 2024. The legislation ultimately reached an impasse over provisions related to stablecoin regulation. Consequently, the planned committee vote scheduled for earlier this month faced indefinite postponement. Stablecoin Interest Provisions: The Core Dispute The current legislative deadlock centers specifically on Section 302 of the CLARITY Act, which addresses interest and rewards programs for U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins. These provisions have generated intense debate among lawmakers, regulators, and industry stakeholders. Stablecoins represent digital assets pegged to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar. They maintain their value through reserve assets held by issuing entities. The controversy stems from whether interest-bearing stablecoin products should fall under securities regulations. Proponents of strict regulation argue that interest-bearing stablecoins function similarly to money market funds. They believe these products should register with the SEC and comply with existing securities laws. Conversely, industry advocates contend that stablecoins serve primarily as payment instruments rather than investment vehicles. They emphasize the importance of maintaining regulatory flexibility to foster innovation in digital payments. The White House Crypto Committee has identified this issue as the primary obstacle requiring resolution before further legislative progress can occur. Banking Industry Perspectives on Digital Asset Regulation Traditional financial institutions have expressed cautious optimism about the CLARITY Act’s potential to create regulatory certainty. Major banking associations have submitted detailed comments to congressional committees throughout the legislative process. These institutions generally support provisions that would establish clear guidelines for bank involvement in digital asset custody services. However, they have raised concerns about potential regulatory overlaps and compliance burdens. Banking representatives have particularly emphasized the need for consistent anti-money laundering requirements across all digital asset service providers. They advocate for applying existing Bank Secrecy Act standards to cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers. Additionally, traditional financial institutions seek clarification on capital requirements for digital asset exposures. The upcoming meeting with administration officials will provide banking industry leaders with an opportunity to address these concerns directly. Cryptocurrency Industry’s Regulatory Priorities Digital asset companies have consistently advocated for regulatory frameworks that balance consumer protection with innovation support. Industry associations have published numerous white papers and position statements regarding the CLARITY Act. Cryptocurrency exchanges particularly emphasize the importance of clear market structure definitions. They seek legislation that distinguishes between different types of digital assets based on their economic functions rather than applying blanket securities regulations. The industry has identified several key priorities for the upcoming discussions: Regulatory clarity for decentralized finance platforms Transparent disclosure requirements for stablecoin reserves Reasonable compliance timelines for existing market participants Interagency coordination mechanisms to prevent regulatory conflicts International regulatory alignment to maintain U.S. competitiveness Cryptocurrency companies have expressed particular concern about the potential for regulatory fragmentation across different states. They advocate for federal legislation that would establish consistent standards nationwide. Historical Context of Cryptocurrency Legislation The current legislative effort represents the latest chapter in a decade-long struggle to establish comprehensive digital asset regulations in the United States. Previous congressional sessions have considered multiple cryptocurrency bills with varying degrees of success. The 117th Congress saw the introduction of the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act, which focused primarily on CFTC oversight of digital commodity markets. That legislation advanced through committee but never reached a full floor vote. Several factors have contributed to the historical difficulty of passing cryptocurrency legislation: Congressional Session Primary Legislation Status Key Issues 117th Congress (2021-2022) Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act Committee Approval CFTC jurisdiction, consumer protections 118th Congress (2023-2024) CLARITY Act Stalled in Committee Stablecoin regulation, SEC/CFTC jurisdiction 119th Congress (2025-present) CLARITY Act (revised) Administration Discussions Interest provisions, banking integration The Trump administration’s direct involvement marks a significant escalation in executive branch engagement with cryptocurrency policy. Previous administrations have generally deferred to regulatory agencies rather than pursuing comprehensive legislation. Potential Economic Impacts of Regulatory Clarity Financial analysts have projected substantial economic benefits from establishing clear digital asset regulations. A 2024 study by the Chamber of Digital Commerce estimated that comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation could generate over $180 billion in economic growth within five years. The research identified several specific areas where regulatory certainty would stimulate investment and innovation. These projections assume that legislation would reduce compliance costs for existing companies while attracting new market participants. Market structure clarity would particularly benefit institutional investors who have remained cautious about digital asset exposure due to regulatory uncertainty. Major asset managers have indicated they would increase cryptocurrency allocations once Congress establishes clear regulatory frameworks. Additionally, banking institutions have suggested they would expand digital asset service offerings with appropriate regulatory guidance. These developments could significantly increase market liquidity and stability for cryptocurrency investors. International Regulatory Competition Considerations The United States faces increasing pressure from international regulatory developments as global financial centers establish their own digital asset frameworks. The European Union implemented its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in 2024, creating comprehensive rules for cryptocurrency markets across member states. Similarly, the United Kingdom has advanced its Financial Services and Markets Act, which includes specific provisions for digital assets. Asian financial centers like Singapore and Hong Kong have also implemented progressive cryptocurrency regulations. These international developments have created competitive pressure for the United States to establish its own regulatory framework. Financial technology companies have increasingly considered relocating operations to jurisdictions with clearer regulations. The CLARITY Act represents an effort to maintain American competitiveness in the growing digital asset sector. Administration officials have emphasized the economic importance of keeping cryptocurrency innovation and investment within United States markets. Consumer Protection Implications The CLARITY Act includes several provisions specifically designed to enhance consumer protections in digital asset markets. These measures address concerns raised by consumer advocacy groups following several high-profile cryptocurrency exchange failures. The legislation would establish minimum reserve requirements for cryptocurrency custodians. It would also create standardized disclosure rules for digital asset risks. Additionally, the bill proposes enhanced auditing requirements for stablecoin issuers. Consumer protection advocates have generally supported these provisions while calling for additional safeguards. They have particularly emphasized the need for: Clear conflict of interest disclosures for cryptocurrency platforms Enhanced educational resources for retail investors Robust cybersecurity standards for digital asset storage Transparent fee structures for cryptocurrency transactions The upcoming discussions will likely address how to balance these consumer protection measures with industry concerns about regulatory burden. Conclusion The Trump administration’s engagement with cryptocurrency and banking industry leaders represents a pivotal moment for the Crypto-Asset Market Structure and Transparency Act. This high-level discussion aims to resolve the stablecoin interest provisions that have stalled legislative progress for months. Successful resolution of these issues could unlock comprehensive digital asset regulation that has eluded Congress for years. The outcome will significantly influence America’s position in the global digital economy and shape cryptocurrency markets for years to come. Market participants, regulators, and consumers await the results of these crucial negotiations with substantial interest. FAQs Q1: What is the Crypto-Asset Market Structure and Transparency Act? The CLARITY Act is proposed legislation that would establish comprehensive regulatory frameworks for digital assets in the United States. It addresses market structure, consumer protections, and regulatory jurisdiction between the SEC and CFTC. Q2: Why has the CLARITY Act been stalled in the Senate? The legislation has faced delays primarily due to disagreements over how to regulate interest and rewards programs for U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins. The Senate Banking Committee postponed a planned vote after reaching an impasse on this issue. Q3: What are the key issues being discussed in the White House meeting? Administration officials are meeting with industry representatives to specifically address stablecoin interest provisions, banking integration concerns, and regulatory coordination between agencies. Q4: How might the CLARITY Act affect cryptocurrency investors? The legislation would establish clearer regulatory frameworks that could increase institutional participation, enhance market stability, and provide stronger consumer protections for all cryptocurrency investors. Q5: What happens if the CLARITY Act doesn’t pass? Without comprehensive federal legislation, cryptocurrency regulation would likely continue through agency actions and state laws, creating potential regulatory fragmentation and continued uncertainty for market participants.

This metric measures, as its name suggests, the percentage of the total BTC circulating supply that’s currently being held at some net unrealized loss. Related Reading: Next Ethereum Move Hinges On This Level, Says Glassnode Analyst The indicator works by scanning through the transaction history of each token in circulation to determine the price at which it was last transacted on the network. If this previous transaction value for any coin was greater than the latest spot price, then the metric assumes that particular token to be underwater. The Supply in Loss adds up all coins falling in this category and finds what part of the supply they make up for. A counterpart metric known as the Supply in Profit tracks the supply of the opposite type. Since the total supply must add up to a 100%, however, the Supply in Profit is simply equal to the Supply in Loss subtracted from 100. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 365-day simple moving average (SMA) of the Bitcoin Supply in Loss over the cryptocurrency’s history: As displayed in the above graph, the 365-day SMA Bitcoin Supply in Loss plummeted to the lowest point for the cycle back in October. This plunge came as the asset rallied to a new all-time high (ATH) beyond the $126,000 level. Since the low, however, the indictor has witnessed a rapid climb, a consequence of the bearish momentum that BTC has faced following its ATH. So far, the indicator hasn’t risen to a significant level compared to past capitulation levels, but the change in direction has been solidifying itself. “Historically, this shift has marked the early phase of bear markets, when losses begin to spread beyond short-term holders and gradually reach longer-term participants,” explained the quant. From the chart, it’s visible that bearish transitions in past cycles occurred as the indicator shot up, with a high value in it coinciding with the cycle bottom. Related Reading: Bitcoin Social Interest Fades As Retail Chases Gold, Silver Hype Whether the recent reversal in the Supply in Loss is the beginning of something similar only remains to be seen. Earlier in this cycle, an upward turn in the indicator ended up only being temporary, as the H1-2025 drawdown gave way to renewed bullish momentum rather than a prolonged bear phase. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $89,000, up over 1% in the last 24 hours.

Still, quieter periods are often the most compelling entry points for investors who want to maximise the next bull run. Coinbase recently stepped away from backing the CLARITY Act, a proposed U.S. bill aimed at clarifying which regulators oversee different segments of the crypto market. In response, the Senate Banking Committee has delayed the bill by several weeks. Even so, the path toward comprehensive crypto regulation in the United States appears increasingly unavoidable. At the same time, Bitcoin’s market dominance has been trending lower since summer , meaning the next bull run will more likely be led by altcoins like XRP, Cardano, and Pepe. XRP (XRP): Payments-Focused Blockchain Targets $5 in Q1 XRP ($XRP) , with a market capitalization hovering around $118 billion, is the most established digital asset in global payments, valued for rapid settlement and ultra-low transaction fees. Ripple engineered the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as a faster, cheaper alternative to legacy messaging networks such as SWIFT for banks and financial institutions. Ripple’s network has attracted attention from the UN Capital Development Fund and the White House, reinforcing XRP’s reputation as a serious paradigm changer in the field of global payments. After resolving its long-running lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, XRP rallied to an all-time high (ATH) of $3.65 in mid-2025. Broader market weakness later triggered a pullback of roughly 47%, leaving the token trading near $1.93. A key recent development has been the approval of spot XRP ETFs in the U.S., opening the door to regulated exposure for both institutional and retail investors. Further ETF launches and clearer regulatory frameworks could provide the momentum needed for XRP to approach the $5 level by the second quarter. Cardano (ADA): Ethereum Co-Founder Delivers DeFi Giant Cardano ($ADA) was founded in 2015 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson and officially went live in 2017. Its Proof-of-Stake network is built on a foundation of peer-reviewed academic research, a methodology that continues to distinguish Cardano from other blockchain projects. With a market capitalization of over $13 billion and total value locked (TVL) of $164 million , ADA still has significant headroom for growth before it can rival Solana as Ethereum’s primary challenger. From a technical standpoint, ADA’s Relative Strength Index sits around 44. Over the last 24 hours, the token has climbed roughly 4%, pushing its price to approximately $0.36. The emergence of a bullish falling wedge pattern in late 2026 suggests a possible imminent breakout. Under favorable market conditions, ADA could overcome nearby resistance and rally toward $1.20 by the end of the first quarter. Should the CLARITY Act move forward, Cardano will likely revisit its ATH of $3.09 before the close of the year. Pepe (PEPE): The Iconic Webcomic Became One of Crypto’s Most Copied Coins Since launching in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) has quickly climbed to become the third-largest meme coin, fueled by the endearing and enduring appeal of Matt Furie’s Pepe the Frog. Now capitalizing $2.1 billion, PEPE is the largest meme coin not based on a Shiba Inu theme. Speculation surged when famous Dogecoin/Bitcoin investor Elon Musk briefly adopted a Pepe image as his profile picture on X, prompting chatter about his possible Pepe holdings. PEPE is currently trading near $0.0000050, marking a 21% gain over the past month. Even so, it remains about 82% below its late-2024 peak of $0.00002803 after a quiet summer and an underwhelming end to 2025. Its Relative Strength Index stands at 45, reflecting neutral conditions following recent profit-taking. If a broader bull market emerges in Q1, PEPE could potentially reclaim its previous all-time high by the end of the quarter. A sharp 69% surge between December 30 and January 6 underscored the token’s classic meme-coin volatility, amplifying market moves both upward and downward. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Blending Meme Appeal With a Bitcoin Layer-2 Vision Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a newly introduced Bitcoin Layer-2 initiative aimed at boosting transaction throughput, reducing fees, and enabling advanced smart contracts on Bitcoin. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine, Bitcoin Hyper combines decentralized governance with a Canonical Bridge that allows seamless transfers of Bitcoin across different chains. The project’s presale has already secured more than $31 million, with some analysts speculating on potential returns ranging from 10x to 100x once the token begins trading publicly. A recent Coinsult audit found no critical issues within the project’s smart contracts. The HYPER token serves as the backbone of the ecosystem, powering transaction fees, governance voting, and staking rewards. Presale participants can stake their tokens for yields of up to 38% APY, though rewards are structured to taper as more users join the network. With exchange listings expected later this year, Bitcoin Hyper’s presale provides early exposure to what could represent the next phase of Bitcoin’s tech.

Professor Kim Jae-won of Seoul National University’s Business School noted, “This development demonstrates mature blockchain application in regulated finance.” Market reception appears positive, with strong investor demand reported for the digital bond. International financial institutions have expressed interest in similar instruments for their own operations. The successful issuance suggests growing institutional comfort with blockchain-based financial products. Future Implications and Development Trajectory The successful digital bond issuance establishes important precedents for future financial innovation. Other South Korean financial institutions will likely accelerate their own digital transformation initiatives. The technology could expand to other asset classes including commercial paper and structured products. Additionally, the multi-currency approach might inspire similar innovations throughout global markets. Financial regulators will monitor outcomes to inform future policy decisions. Moreover, this development supports South Korea’s broader digital economy initiatives. The government has prioritized financial technology as a strategic growth sector. Successful implementations like Mirae Asset’s digital bond strengthen South Korea’s position in global financial innovation rankings. The technology could eventually integrate with central bank digital currency initiatives currently under development. This convergence might create even more efficient financial ecosystems.

Q3: Why did Mirae Asset issue the bond in multiple currencies? The dual-currency structure in Hong Kong dollars and U.S. dollars expands the potential investor base, provides natural hedging benefits for international investors, and demonstrates sophisticated financial engineering capabilities while facilitating integration with global financial systems. Q4: What regulatory framework supports digital bonds in South Korea? South Korea’s Financial Services Commission has developed comprehensive guidelines for digital securities that ensure investor protection while encouraging innovation, with Mirae Asset working closely with regulators throughout the issuance process to ensure full compliance. Q5: How might this development impact other Asian financial markets? This successful issuance provides a proven template for other private sector entities considering digital bond offerings, potentially accelerating blockchain adoption across Asian capital markets and encouraging cross-border digital securities transactions between jurisdictions.

57548228,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=266537,1769640312,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"BNB ETP Achieves Landmark Listing on Nasdaq Stockholm, Unlocking Regulated Crypto Access for Nordic Investors",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bnb-etp-nasdaq-stockholm-listing/,"BitcoinWorld BNB ETP Achieves Landmark Listing on Nasdaq Stockholm, Unlocking Regulated Crypto Access for Nordic Investors In a landmark development for European digital asset markets, Stockholm-based Virtune has successfully listed a BNB-based Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) on Nasdaq Stockholm, the premier stock exchange in Northern Europe. This pivotal move, confirmed in March 2025, provides Swedish and broader Nordic investors with their first regulated, exchange-traded avenue for direct exposure to the BNB cryptocurrency, marking a significant step in the institutional integration of blockchain-based assets. BNB ETP Listing Represents a Major Institutional Milestone The listing of a BNB ETP on a major regulated exchange like Nasdaq Stockholm is not an isolated event. Instead, it represents a clear continuation of a broader trend toward financial product innovation within traditional markets. For context, exchange-traded products provide a familiar, secure wrapper for assets, allowing investors to gain exposure without directly holding the underlying cryptocurrency. Consequently, this structure mitigates concerns around private key security and custody, which often deter more conservative institutional participants. Furthermore, Nasdaq Stockholm operates under the stringent regulatory oversight of the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (Finansinspektionen). Therefore, the Virtune BNB ETP’s approval signals a growing regulatory comfort with specific digital assets in the Nordic region. This development follows similar crypto ETP listings on exchanges in Germany and Switzerland, yet it stands out as a first for a Binance-affiliated token on a Nordic bourse. The product will trade under a dedicated ticker symbol, offering full transparency and liquidity during market hours. Understanding the Market Context and Key Players To fully grasp this news, one must understand the entities involved. Virtune is a Swedish digital asset manager specializing in bringing cryptocurrency investment products to the traditional financial market. The firm has previously listed physically-backed crypto ETPs on European exchanges, building a reputation for regulatory compliance and product reliability. The underlying asset, BNB , originally launched as the Binance Coin utility token for the Binance exchange, has evolved into a multi-chain ecosystem powering the BNB Smart Chain. Its market capitalization consistently ranks it among the top five cryptocurrencies globally. Meanwhile, Nasdaq Stockholm serves as the cornerstone of Sweden’s financial infrastructure, listing hundreds of companies and facilitating billions in daily trading volume. Its involvement lends immediate credibility and access to a deep pool of capital. Expert Analysis on Regulatory and Market Impact Financial analysts point to several immediate impacts. Firstly, the listing provides a compliant on-ramp for Swedish pension funds, asset managers, and retail investors who are mandated or prefer to invest only in listed, regulated securities. Secondly, it enhances price discovery and market stability for BNB by channeling demand through a transparent, surveilled venue. “This is a textbook case of traditional finance infrastructure adapting to incorporate digital assets,” notes a market structure analyst from a Nordic investment bank. “It doesn’t replace decentralized exchanges, but it creates a parallel, regulated lane that attracts a different, often larger, class of capital.” The timeline leading to this event is also instructive. Over the past three years, European regulators have progressively clarified rules around crypto-assets, culminating in frameworks like the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. Virtune’s product likely underwent extensive review to ensure compliance with EU financial instruments directives, custody standards, and anti-money laundering protocols. This rigorous process sets a precedent for future crypto ETP listings in the region. Comparative Analysis: Crypto ETPs Across Europe The European landscape for crypto exchange-traded products has become increasingly competitive. The table below illustrates how the new Virtune BNB ETP compares to similar products in key jurisdictions. Product / Issuer Exchange Underlying Asset Key Feature Virtune BNB ETP Nasdaq Stockholm BNB (Binance Coin) First Nordic-listed BNB product 21Shares Crypto Basket ETP SIX Swiss Exchange Multi-asset Basket Broad diversification across major cryptos CoinShares Physical Bitcoin ETP Xetra (Germany) Bitcoin (BTC) One of Europe’s largest by AUM ETC Group Physical Ethereum ETP Euronext Paris Ethereum (ETH) Dominant ETH product in Eurozone As shown, the Virtune listing carves out a specific niche. While Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs are established, a BNB-focused product on a major Nordic exchange targets a unique segment of the market, potentially capturing demand from investors bullish on the broader BNB Chain ecosystem’s utility and growth. Practical Implications for Investors and the Ecosystem For the average Swedish investor, this listing translates to tangible new options. Investors can now: Access BNB through their existing brokerage accounts , using the same interfaces and tools they employ for stocks and ETFs. Benefit from regulated custody , as the physical BNB tokens are held by a licensed third-party custodian, not the individual investor. Experience tax clarity , as transactions within a securities account are typically reported automatically, simplifying tax obligations. Trade with leverage or within tax-advantaged accounts , depending on local Swedish investment account rules and broker offerings. For the BNB ecosystem, the listing represents a vote of confidence and a new source of potential demand. It also introduces the asset to a cohort of investors who conduct deep fundamental research, potentially increasing analyst coverage and institutional understanding of BNB’s use cases beyond exchange fee discounts. Conclusion The listing of the Virtune BNB ETP on Nasdaq Stockholm is a definitive milestone in the convergence of digital and traditional finance. It underscores the growing acceptance of select cryptocurrencies within rigorous European regulatory frameworks and provides a safe, familiar conduit for institutional and retail capital. This strategic move not only grants Swedish investors direct exposure to BNB but also sets a compelling precedent for other asset managers and exchanges globally. As regulatory landscapes continue to mature, such bridge products will likely proliferate, further cementing cryptocurrencies as a legitimate and accessible asset class within the global financial system. FAQs Q1: What exactly is a BNB ETP? An Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) is a regulated security that tracks the price of an underlying asset. The Virtune BNB ETP is a financial instrument listed on Nasdaq Stockholm whose value is directly tied to the market price of the BNB cryptocurrency. Investors buy and sell shares of the ETP, not the actual BNB tokens. Q2: How is this different from buying BNB on Binance? The key differences are regulation, custody, and access. Buying the ETP occurs on a traditional, regulated stock exchange through a brokerage account. The BNB tokens backing the ETP are held by a professional, licensed custodian. This method suits investors who prefer the security and familiarity of the traditional stock market over managing private keys on a crypto exchange. Q3: Who can invest in this BNB ETP? Primarily, any investor with access to Nasdaq Stockholm through their broker can invest. This includes retail investors in Sweden and internationally, as well as Swedish and European institutional investors like pension funds and asset managers, many of whom are restricted from investing in unregulated crypto exchanges. Q4: What are the main risks associated with this BNB ETP? The primary risk remains the volatility of the underlying BNB cryptocurrency. The ETP also carries counterparty risk related to the issuer and custodian, although this is mitigated by strict EU regulations. Additionally, investors pay a management fee to the issuer, which slightly underperforms the direct spot price of BNB over time. Q5: Does this mean BNB is now a regulated security in Sweden? Not exactly. The ETP itself is a regulated financial instrument. The regulatory status of the underlying BNB token is a separate, complex legal question. The listing indicates that regulators are comfortable allowing a regulated product to track BNB’s price, which is a significant step but does not automatically reclassify BNB as a security under Swedish law.

Typical, yet this time it feels different as XRP and Solana are trying to catch up. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $89,500 and is up 2.14% on the day. Bitcoin continues to look weak as stocks and gold break to new all-time highs again. Altcoins like XRP and Solana are passengers in this move and are suffering alongside Bitcoin after a tough 2025 overall. Below is how their prices may play out through 2026. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Bitcoin Price Prediction: It’s The Deciding Time Now, Which Side Is BTC Going? Source: Bitcoin ETF Net Flow Chart / CMC Five out of the last six days have been negative for Bitcoin ETF flows. A total of $480M has left Bitcoin ETFs in the last 7 days alone. Bitcoin dropped as low as $86,000 but is now trading around $89,500, meaning it is down 1% over the past 7 days despite all these outflows. Technically, Bitcoin price remains stuck between a rising support line and a falling resistance line, signaling a tightening squeeze. Buyers are defending dips near support, but sellers continue to prevent rallies. The lower trendline is still holding, so downside is being defended for now. However, the market keeps printing lower highs under resistance, which keeps the bias neutral to slightly bearish. Momentum agrees with that. RSI is sitting around the mid-40s, not oversold and nowhere near strong enough to signal a breakout. A bullish scenario would require an improvement in ETF flows alongside a clean daily close above the $97,000 to $98,000 resistance zone. That would likely open the door toward $102,000 and potentially $105,000. Until then, it is mostly a waiting game. A break of support would favor a move back toward the mid $80,000s, while a breakout above resistance would finally give bulls something real to work with. XRP Price Prediction: Can XRP Finally Breakout Of Its Downtrend? Bitcoin dominance has risen to 59.1% after dipping toward 58.3% earlier this month. This shows that capital remains concentrated in Bitcoin. However, Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin over the past 24 hours with a 3% move higher. This slightly improved short-term sentiment across the altcoin market. XRP followed that move with a 2% pump. XRP is still stuck inside a descending channel that has been controlling price for months, with the latest bounce coming off the lower boundary around the $1.80 to $1.85 demand zone. That area has now been defended multiple times, so it looks like real structural support, not just a random wick. Momentum is still weak, though. RSI is hovering around 43, below the 50 level, which tells you bearish pressure has cooled of,f but buyers are not in control yet. The recent rejection around $2.30 to $2.35 lines up perfectly with channel resistance and prior supply, making that zone the first real wall bulls need to break. A clean daily close above the descending trendline would be the first proper signal that the trend is shifting, with upside toward $2.50 first and then the $3.00 area where heavier resistance sits. Until that happens, this is still a corrective structure with bounce potential, not a confirmed reversal. On the bigger picture, XRP is still trading like a high beta alt, so any real follow-through likely depends on broader market stability and Bitcoin holding its own support. Solana Price Prediction: Will SOL Get Past $144 Again? Solana price is still trading inside a clean descending channel, with the price recently bouncing off the lower boundary around the $118 to $120 support zone. That area has been attracting buyers consistently, but structurally, the trend is still corrective, not bullish. Lower highs are intact, and the price has not reclaimed the upper channel resistance yet. RSI sitting around 43 shows bearish momentum is fading, but this is more stabilization than a true momentum reset. It suggests sellers are easing off, but buyers have not stepped in aggressively either. The $140 to $145 zone is the key area to watch, as it lines up with prior support turned resistance and the descending trendline. A strong daily close above that region would be the first real sign of a structural shift, opening the door toward $200 initially, with the $250 to $260 zone acting as the next major supply area. On the bearish side, if price fails to hold above $118, the setup weakens, and the $105 to $95 demand zone comes back into play. Solana is still highly sensitive to overall risk appetite and Bitcoin’s direction, but improving on-chain activity and ecosystem engagement give it a constructive backdrop if the market flips back to risk on. Bitcoin Is Stuck. Bitcoin Hyper Is Betting On What Comes After While Bitcoin remains stuck in a tightening range and altcoins like XRP and Solana struggle to break their downtrends, Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself around a different thesis. Instead of waiting for Bitcoin or altcoins to lead the next leg higher, it focuses on fixing Bitcoin’s biggest limitation directly. Bitcoin Hyper is a Bitcoin-focused Layer 2 designed to bring Solana-level speed and low-cost transactions to the Bitcoin ecosystem. The goal is to keep Bitcoin’s security intact while enabling faster payments, smart contracts, dApps, and even meme coin creation, all built around BTC rather than competing against it. Momentum around the project is already building. The presale has raised over $31,000,000 , with $HYPER currently priced at $0.013635 ahead of the next increase. Staking rewards of up to 38 % are also being offered. This gives early participants exposure to yield that Bitcoin itself does not provide. Bitcoin Hyper has completed audits by Consult. They are also building out a full ecosystem that includes wallets, bridges, staking, explorers, and on-chain tooling. The broader bet is simple. If Bitcoin continues to dominate market value but struggles with usability and speed, demand will shift toward solutions that extend Bitcoin rather than replace it. In a market where Bitcoin is undecided, and altcoins remain reactive, Bitcoin Hyper is trying to position itself as the infrastructure play built for whatever comes next.

57548349,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=266535,1769640612,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Gemini Zcash Credit Card Launches, Unlocking Revolutionary Privacy-First Crypto Rewards",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/gemini-zcash-credit-card-launch/,"BitcoinWorld Gemini Zcash Credit Card Launches, Unlocking Revolutionary Privacy-First Crypto Rewards NEW YORK, March 2025 – In a significant move bridging privacy-focused digital assets with everyday finance, cryptocurrency exchange Gemini has officially launched a Zcash (ZEC)-themed credit card. This innovative product, first reported by Decrypt, directly offers users cryptocurrency rewards, including ZEC, on their purchases. Consequently, this launch marks a pivotal moment for mainstream adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies within regulated financial services. Gemini Zcash Credit Card: A Detailed Breakdown The newly unveiled Gemini Zcash credit card represents a strategic expansion of the exchange’s financial product suite. Unlike traditional reward cards, this card specifically incentivizes the use and accumulation of Zcash, a cryptocurrency renowned for its strong privacy features. Cardholders will earn a percentage of their spending back in ZEC, seamlessly deposited into their Gemini account. Moreover, this initiative follows a broader industry trend where major exchanges develop integrated ecosystems. For instance, competitors like Coinbase and Crypto.com have previously launched similar card products, though none have centered exclusively on a privacy coin like Zcash. Therefore, Gemini’s move is both competitive and pioneering. Technical Integration and User Experience Gemini has engineered the card to operate on major payment networks, ensuring global acceptance. The backend integration automatically converts a portion of fiat spending into ZEC rewards. Importantly, the card functions like any standard credit card for merchants, who receive traditional currency. This design choice navigates complex regulatory landscapes by separating transaction privacy from merchant acceptance. Furthermore, Gemini provides a dedicated app interface for users to track their ZEC rewards, spending categories, and redemption options. The process is designed for simplicity, aiming to lower the barrier to entry for consumers new to privacy coins. The Strategic Significance of Zcash Rewards Choosing Zcash as the cornerstone reward asset is a calculated decision with profound implications. Zcash utilizes advanced zero-knowledge proof technology called zk-SNARKs. This technology allows for fully shielded transactions where sender, receiver, and amount are encrypted, yet verifiable on the public blockchain. By promoting ZEC, Gemini is tacitly endorsing the viability and importance of financial privacy in the digital age. Industry analysts note this could catalyze wider acceptance for privacy coins, which have often faced scrutiny from regulators. Simultaneously, it provides a legitimate, compliant use-case for ZEC beyond speculative trading. The rewards structure itself is a key differentiator. A comparative analysis with other crypto cards reveals Gemini’s unique value proposition: Card Provider Primary Reward Asset Privacy Focus Reward Rate Gemini (New Card) Zcash (ZEC) High (zk-SNARKs technology) Up to 3% back in ZEC* Coinbase Card Varied (BTC, ETH, etc.) Low (Transparent blockchain) Up to 4% back in crypto Crypto.com Card CRO (Native token) Low Up to 8% back (staking required) *Initial promotional rate; subject to change. Expert Perspectives on Market Impact Financial technology experts highlight several potential impacts. “Gemini’s launch is a legitimization signal for the entire privacy coin sector,” notes Dr. Anya Petrova, a fintech researcher at Stanford University. “It demonstrates that with proper compliance frameworks, such as Gemini’s custodial model and KYC/AML checks, privacy-enhancing technologies can coexist with regulated finance.” Additionally, market data suggests a positive correlation between such product announcements and asset valuation. Following the news, ZEC trading volume on Gemini reportedly increased by 45% within 24 hours, indicating immediate market responsiveness. Navigating the Regulatory Landscape in 2025 The launch occurs within an evolving regulatory environment. In 2025, global standards for cryptocurrency, particularly privacy coins, are becoming more defined. Gemini, a New York Trust company, operates under one of the strictest regulatory regimes (the NYDFS BitLicense). This context is crucial. The card’s design inherently addresses regulatory concerns: On-Ramp Compliance: All users undergo full identity verification. Transaction Monitoring: Fiat transactions are fully visible to Gemini and its banking partners. Reward Delivery: ZEC rewards are delivered to a custodial wallet, not a private, shielded address. This model creates a clear regulatory perimeter. Users enjoy the benefits of ZEC ownership and potential appreciation, while the on- and off-ramps remain transparent. Consequently, this approach may serve as a blueprint for other institutions seeking to integrate privacy assets. Real-World Context and Adoption Timeline This development is not an isolated event. It follows a multi-year trajectory of crypto-card evolution. The timeline below contextualizes this launch: 2021-2022: First-generation crypto debit cards gain popularity (e.g., Coinbase, Crypto.com). 2023: Regulatory pushback increases scrutiny on privacy protocols like Tornado Cash. 2024: Gemini pilots a beta version of its rewards card with select users. Early 2025: Full public launch of the Zcash-themed credit card. The successful beta phase reportedly showed strong user engagement, particularly among demographics valuing digital privacy. This data-driven rollout suggests Gemini is responding to genuine market demand. Conclusion The launch of the Gemini Zcash credit card is a landmark event in the convergence of cryptocurrency and traditional finance. By offering ZEC rewards, Gemini is strategically promoting a privacy-centric asset within a fully compliant framework. This move provides users with a novel financial tool, enhances Zcash’s utility, and sets a precedent for regulated privacy coin adoption. Ultimately, the success of this Gemini Zcash credit card will depend on user adoption, regulatory continuity, and the evolving public discourse on financial privacy in the digital era. It represents a bold step toward a future where enhanced privacy and mainstream financial services are not mutually exclusive. FAQs Q1: How does the Gemini Zcash credit card work? The card works like a standard credit card on payment networks. You spend fiat currency (like USD), and Gemini rewards you with a percentage of that spend in Zcash (ZEC), deposited into your Gemini account. Q2: Is using the Zcash card anonymous? No. To comply with regulations, Gemini requires full identity verification (KYC) to open an account and issue the card. Your fiat transactions are visible to Gemini and its partners. The privacy features of Zcash apply to the ZEC asset itself once you hold it, not to the card’s fiat payment process. Q3: Why did Gemini choose Zcash for its rewards? Gemini likely chose Zcash to differentiate its product in a crowded market and to support the adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies. It signals a belief in the long-term value and utility of ZEC’s zero-knowledge proof technology within a regulated framework. Q4: Can I spend the ZEC I earn directly with the card? Not directly. The card spends fiat currency. You earn ZEC as a reward. You can hold, trade, or potentially withdraw the ZEC from your Gemini account to a private wallet, subject to Gemini’s terms and conditions. Q5: How does this card impact the broader cryptocurrency market? It brings legitimacy and a clear use-case to a privacy-focused cryptocurrency. By integrating ZEC into a common financial product like a credit card, it could drive increased awareness, demand, and mainstream acceptance for privacy coins, potentially influencing their market valuation and development.

This announcement, made public on the exchange’s official communications channels, immediately generated substantial discussion among traders, developers, and market analysts regarding the token’s technical merits and market trajectory. The roadmap serves as a transparent indicator of assets under technical review, though it does not guarantee a final listing decision. Consequently, this development represents a critical milestone for the HYPE project and its community, highlighting the evolving standards for digital asset evaluation by major trading platforms. Understanding the Coinbase Listing Roadmap Process Coinbase’s listing roadmap functions as a public-facing dashboard of potential digital assets undergoing technical and compliance assessment. The exchange employs a rigorous, multi-phase evaluation framework before any asset achieves full trading availability. Initially, the engineering team conducts a comprehensive security review of the asset’s underlying blockchain protocol. Subsequently, legal and compliance experts analyze the asset against regulatory standards in each jurisdiction where Coinbase operates. This meticulous process often spans several months and involves constant dialogue with the project’s development team. The inclusion of HYPE on this roadmap indicates it has passed initial screens and entered this substantive review phase. Historically, many assets featured on the roadmap have eventually graduated to full listing status, though the outcome is never automatic. This system enhances market transparency and allows the community to monitor the exchange’s exploratory efforts. The Technical and Market Profile of HYPE HYPE operates as a utility token within a specific decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem focused on community engagement and digital rewards. According to its publicly available whitepaper and blockchain explorers, the token facilitates transactions, governance voting, and access to premium features within its native platform. On-chain data reveals a defined total supply and a transparent distribution model, factors that Coinbase’s evaluation team scrutinizes closely. From a market perspective, HYPE’s trading volume and liquidity have historically concentrated on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and smaller centralized platforms. A potential Coinbase listing would dramatically expand its accessibility to retail and institutional investors, likely impacting its liquidity profile and price discovery mechanisms. Market analysts often observe a ‘roadmap effect,’ where an asset’s trading activity increases following such an announcement, as seen with previous tokens like RLY and POLY before their eventual listings. Comparative Analysis with Previous Roadmap Additions The trajectory of assets on the Coinbase roadmap provides valuable context for understanding HYPE’s potential path. A comparative analysis reveals common characteristics among successfully listed tokens. Asset Roadmap to Listing Time Key Evaluation Factor Polygon (MATIC) ~4 months Scalability solution & Ethereum integration Render Token (RNDR) ~5 months Real-world utility in GPU rendering Arweave (AR) ~6 months Decentralized data storage protocol This table illustrates that projects with clear utility, robust technology, and active development typically navigate the review process efficiently. For HYPE, its defining characteristics include: Community Governance: Token holders can vote on ecosystem proposals. Utility-Driven Model: The token is required for accessing core platform services. Transparent Tokenomics: Publicly verifiable supply and distribution data. These factors align with Coinbase’s publicly stated criteria, which emphasize technical security, regulatory compliance, and project credibility. Furthermore, the exchange has increasingly prioritized assets that demonstrate real-world use cases beyond pure speculation. Potential Market Impact and Strategic Implications The announcement carries immediate and long-term implications for various market participants. For existing HYPE holders, the news validates the project’s technical foundations and could attract new investor attention. However, market veterans caution that roadmap inclusion is not a trading signal, as price volatility can be unpredictable during the review period. For the broader cryptocurrency market, this move signals Coinbase’s continued exploration of assets beyond the largest market-cap tokens. It reflects a strategic effort to diversify its trading pairs and capture value from emerging blockchain verticals. Industry experts note that such listings can have a network effect, increasing overall ecosystem liquidity and fostering greater institutional comfort with the digital asset class. Regulatory observers also watch these developments closely, as a U.S.-based exchange’s due diligence process often sets a de facto standard for asset legitimacy. Expert Perspectives on Exchange Due Diligence Financial technology analysts emphasize the rigor of modern exchange listing reviews. “The process today is far more structured than in the early years of crypto,” notes a researcher from a blockchain analytics firm. “Exchanges like Coinbase perform deep technical audits, legal analysis, and market surveillance reviews. They assess code quality, governance structures, and the team’s background. A roadmap placement means HYPE has already cleared several of these initial hurdles.” This expert viewpoint underscores the significance of the announcement beyond mere speculation. It represents a substantive step in the project’s maturation within the regulated digital finance landscape. The review also examines the asset’s resilience to manipulation, the health of its decentralized network, and the clarity of its communication with users. Conclusion The addition of HYPE to the Coinbase listing roadmap marks a pivotal development for the token’s trajectory and reflects the exchange’s ongoing strategy to evaluate innovative digital assets. This process, grounded in technical and compliance due diligence, provides a transparent window into how major platforms assess new cryptocurrencies. While the outcome remains subject to the full review’s findings, the inclusion itself highlights the project’s alignment with current market and regulatory standards. For the cryptocurrency community, it reinforces the importance of fundamental project attributes—utility, security, and transparency—in achieving broader recognition and accessibility. The market will now observe how the HYPE project navigates the subsequent phases of this rigorous evaluation on its path toward potential exchange integration. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when a token is added to the Coinbase listing roadmap? It means the token has entered Coinbase’s technical and compliance review process for a potential future listing. It is an indication of interest and evaluation, not a guarantee of a final listing. Q2: How long does it typically take from roadmap addition to actual listing? The timeline varies significantly based on the asset’s complexity and review findings. Historical data shows a range from several months to over a year, with many assets completing the process within 4-6 months. Q3: Does a roadmap addition affect the token’s price? Market activity can increase due to heightened attention, but price movement is influenced by many factors. Analysts advise against using roadmap status alone as an investment signal. Q4: What criteria does Coinbase use to evaluate assets for its roadmap? Publicly stated criteria include technical security, regulatory compliance, project credibility, market demand, and the asset’s alignment with Coinbase’s mission to create an open financial system.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $2.92 by the end of 2029. By 2032, WIF’s price may surge to $4.80. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.3185 Market cap $318.70M Trading volume $112.74M Circulating supply 998.92M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $0.3302 24-hour low $0.3151 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 11.43% (Very High) 50-day SMA $0.3558 14-Day RSI 42.78 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 29 (Fear) Green days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.6343 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown WIF is still in a broader downtrend, roughly 25% off recent highs. Momentum loss is slowing, but buyers have not stepped in decisively. A reclaim of $0.36 is needed for upside; otherwise, $0.30 remains at risk. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart WIF is trading around $0.323 on January 28, after a mild −0.31% daily slip, extending a broader corrective phase from the recent swing high near $0.43, marking roughly a 25% drawdown. The coin continues to trend below the Bollinger mid-band around $0.358, with the upper band declining, confirming sustained bearish pressure rather than volatility expansion. WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview The lower band near $0.298 is acting as the key downside magnet; failure to reclaim $0.35 keeps the risk skewed toward a retest of this zone. MACD remains negative, with a widening separation below the signal line, though the histogram momentum is flattening, hinting that selling pressure is slowing rather than reversing. RSI sits near 41, below the neutral 50 and drifting sideways, signaling weak demand but not yet oversold conditions. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour timeframe, WIF is attempting a short-term bounce to $0.324, up about +1.9% from the prior session, but price remains capped below the Alligator averages clustered between $0.325 and $0.327, keeping the trend technically bearish. WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview The recent impulsive drop from $0.33 to $0.316 erased prior consolidation gains, and while the bounce is constructive, it lacks volume confirmation. OBV remains depressed near −312M, showing no meaningful accumulation, while CMF at −0.13 confirms capital is still flowing out despite the bounce. As long as price fails to hold above $0.33, rallies are corrective rather than trend-changing. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3649 SELL SMA 5 $0.3266 SELL SMA 10 $0.3212 BUY SMA 21 $0.3600 SELL SMA 50 $0.3558 SELL SMA 100 $0.4031 SELL SMA 200 $0.6343 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3666 SELL EMA 5 $0.3702 SELL EMA 10 $0.3605 SELL EMA 21 $0.3519 SELL EMA 50 $0.3775 SELL EMA 100 $0.4615 SELL EMA 200 $0.6187 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF is likely to continue ranging weakly between $0.30 and $0.33, with downside risk toward $0.30–$0.29 if $0.32 fails, while a bullish shift only becomes credible on a daily close back above $0.36. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $100 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of approximately $2 by the end of 2026 and between $5 and $7 by 2032. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

Wise investors realize that you should join a project when it is only happening when the technology is transitioning to reality. We are in a transition period whereby the next big crypto player in decentralized finance is emerging. This is a moment of a window of opportunity. The installation is made and the security checked. The people who have to see the project on the first page of all the news sites usually lose the largest profits. The actual rise occurs in the silent period prior to an entire market introduction. When the code becomes operational, and the initial users start dealing with the system, the process of valuation begins to change. This is whereby a protocol becomes more than just a good idea and it becomes a robust financial engine. Evolution of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a digital wealth management system. It is decentralized and designed to use crypto assets without selling them. The protocol has two methods of communication with the market. The first of them is the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) market. This is aimed at being fast and convenient. To illustrate, in case you are holding the USDT, you can deposit it in a common pool. The protocol will automatically borrow it out and you get interest. It is an investment approach that is non-custodial. The second is the Peer to peer (P2P) market. This is to be used by those who prefer to have more control. There is a chance to negotiate certain terms with another person. This is ideal when it comes to special deals or when the more volatile assets are being used as collateral. There has already been colossal support of the project. It has raised and has an excess of 19.900 holders. This is important as a big investor-base translates to a strong and diversified base of the project. V1 Protocol Launch As of now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) reached a major milestone by releasing its V1 protocol to the Sepolia testnet. This launch moves the project from a plan to a working tool where users can test the system without using real money. The main goal of this beta is to stress-test the core lending and borrowing markets in a live environment. The V1 protocol features Liquidity Pools for initial assets like ETH, USDT, LINK, and WBTC. When you deposit these assets, you receive mtTokens. These are interest-bearing receipts that track your deposit and grow in value as the protocol collects interest from borrowers. On the other side, borrowers receive Debt Tokens to track their loan balances in real-time. To keep the system safe, an automated Liquidator Bot is active to manage risky positions and ensure the protocol stays solvent. The tech is backed by high security standards, including a full audit by Halborn and a 90/100 safety score from CertiK. The team is also offering a $50,000 bug bounty during this phase to reward anyone who finds a vulnerability. This successful launch has pushed the project to over $20.1 million in funding. While the current price is $0.04 and the launch is set for $0.06, the live testnet gives analysts confidence that the token could realistically target 750% growth after the mainnet follows. The Rush for Q1 2026 The overall supply of MUTM has a limit of 4 billion tokens. To be fair, the team divided the supply between the initial distribution stages 45.5%. This equals 1.82 billion tokens. Demand is moving very fast. Up to now, there are more than 835 million already sold tokens. Currently MUTM is in pre-sale Phase 7. The token had already gained 300% appreciation since the very first stage. The initial investors in the protocol will record a 500% MUTM growth by the time the protocol officially goes live at $0.06. The cost is raised with each stage. The second step will involve price increasing by almost 20%. It is due to this that timing is a matter of importance. Now would be the time to have a cheaper price because the next automatic price will be higher. It generates an inherent profit prior to the token ever entering the open market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) being an Ethereum-based protocol is poised to remain a new crypto leader for the rest of 2026. It is attracting both small and big investors by addressing the liquidity issues of the past by offering a secure and audited platform. Phase 7 has sold out and the V1 protocol in place, meaning the time to get MUTM at a 50% discount is rapidly running out.

57548478,https://timestabloid.com/?p=96042,1769641206,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Zero Knowledge Proof Explained: The Crypto Project Turning Private Data Into Daily Passive Income,https://timestabloid.com/zero-knowledge-proof-explained-the-crypto-project-turning-private/,"For many years, the internet has followed an unfair setup. People create posts, searches, and activity every day, but large tech companies take all the value. Each click adds to their profits, while users gain nothing in return. This unfair structure is called extraction economics, and it has shaped the online space for a long time. A major change is now taking shape that brings value back to everyday users. A fresh digital infra is emerging to challenge this outdated model. It focuses on turning normal internet users into active earners within the data economy. At the center of this shift is ZKP crypto , a layer 1 network with a live presale auction that is designed to ensure people get rewarded for their digital actions. Many now see ZKP as the best crypto to buy today because it directly links data use with real earnings. Why Free Platforms Cost You More Than You Think Today’s data system clearly favors large platforms. Companies like Facebook and Google collect massive value from personal data without consent or payment. User activity is treated like a free resource that can be gathered and sold endlessly. This approach has gone on for too long and is now being challenged directly. This network changes the rules by introducing a decentralized data marketplace. Users are no longer treated as products but as active partners. Data providers keep up to 80% of the revenue created from their uploads, which is a huge shift from the zero return offered by social platforms. Removing middle layers ensures value flows back to the source. Analysts believe this fair model will pull in millions of users, strengthening the case for ZKP as the best crypto to buy today. Verified Data Without Giving Up Privacy Most free online tools require users to sacrifice privacy, but this network refuses that trade. It uses a system where data can be confirmed without being revealed. Buyers can check accuracy and usefulness without viewing sensitive details inside the dataset. This process relies on a Zero Knowledge Proof approach. This method works like a digital verifier that confirms facts while keeping private information hidden. For instance, health researchers can study trends without seeing personal identities. This solves a long-standing trust issue in data sharing. Companies need quality data, while users want safety. By solving this balance, the network opens a massive economy where privacy and earnings can exist together. This makes ZKP stand out as the best crypto to buy today for users focused on control and security. A Simple Path to Mass Adoption Widespread use depends on easy access, and this project delivers exactly that. Anyone can join without technical skills. Proof Pods, which are small tablet devices, allow users to connect to the network with minimal effort. Priced at $249, they are affordable and simple to set up, and proof pods are already delivering to users. Because entry is so accessible, experts expect fast network growth. As people earn through ZKP, others around them are likely to join. This creates a strong growth cycle that can push ZKP into daily use much faster than complex systems. Many see this simplicity as another reason ZKP is the best crypto to buy today. Low-Cost Hardware: The starting cost fits most households, unlike costly mining setups. Daily Rewards: Users earn coins every day, supporting steady returns. Strong Upside: Earnings can start near $1 daily and rise up to $300 at higher levels. This earning structure supports financial freedom and long-term user interest. Infrastructure Designed for Long-Term Use Behind these earnings is a strong technical base. The network uses a hybrid consensus model that combines storage with intelligence. Instead of wasting energy on random calculations, power is used for useful AI tasks. This turns the network into more than a payment system; it becomes a shared AI computer. Security remains a top focus. Military-grade encryption works alongside Zero Knowledge Proof systems to protect data as the network grows. This design keeps the infra stable even as usage expands. Market watchers are paying attention because a network that solves real problems while paying users is rare. This balance strengthens ZKP’s position as the best crypto to buy today while its presale auction remains live at stage 2. Final Thoughts Giving away valuable data for nothing is slowly coming to an end. By sharing revenue fairly and keeping participation simple, this project builds a path toward shared value. Affordable proof pods and strong earning potential set ZKP apart within the crypto space. It is rare to see a system that aligns everyday users with a massive data industry. As network growth continues, ZKP is positioned to gain wide recognition. The move away from extraction toward fair compensation is already underway, and ZKP is guiding that change, making many view it as the best crypto to buy today .

The Smart Glasses Market Acceleration Zuckerberg’s vision draws a direct parallel to the smartphone revolution that transformed mobile communication. He specifically noted that billions of people already wear glasses for vision correction, creating a massive potential market for augmented functionality. Meanwhile, Meta’s sales data reveals explosive growth in consumer adoption, though the company hasn’t disclosed specific unit numbers. Industry analysts suggest this growth trajectory mirrors early smartphone adoption curves from the late 2000s. The competitive landscape has intensified dramatically in recent months. Google recently announced a $150 million partnership with Warby Parker to develop consumer-focused smart glasses expected to launch later this year. Apple has reportedly shifted engineering resources from its Vision Pro headset to accelerate development of lightweight smart glasses, according to Bloomberg sources. Additionally, Snap announced this week it would spin its AR glasses division, Specs, into a separate subsidiary for greater operational focus. Technical Evolution and Market Readiness Current generation smart glasses represent a significant advancement from earlier attempts like Google Glass. Modern devices integrate several key technologies: Advanced micro-displays with higher resolution and brightness On-device AI processing for real-time translation and object recognition Improved battery technology enabling all-day wear Sleeker industrial design resembling conventional eyewear Meta currently offers multiple models, including Oakley-branded smart glasses designed specifically for athletic use. These fitness-focused devices demonstrate one of the most promising early use cases, providing real-time workout metrics and coaching without interrupting physical activity. Industry-Wide Investment in AI Wearables The smart glasses market represents just one segment of the broader AI wearables revolution. OpenAI is reportedly developing AI-powered earbuds and pin devices, while Apple is rumored to be working on an AirTag-sized AI companion. However, the commercial failure of Humane’s AI pin serves as a cautionary tale about premature market entry and user experience shortcomings. Market research firms project substantial growth in the coming years. According to recent analyses, the global smart glasses market could reach $15 billion by 2027, representing a compound annual growth rate exceeding 25%. This projection assumes continued technological improvements and decreasing production costs. Smart Glasses Market Projections 2025-2027 Year Projected Market Size Key Growth Drivers 2025 $8.2 billion Enterprise adoption, fitness applications 2026 $11.5 billion Consumer fashion integration, improved AI 2027 $15.1 billion Mass market pricing, prescription integration Historical Context and Previous Predictions Zuckerberg’s current enthusiasm for smart glasses follows his earlier, less successful prediction about metaverse adoption. During 2021-2023, Meta invested heavily in virtual reality and metaverse technologies, anticipating rapid consumer adoption that hasn’t materialized as projected. This historical context suggests analysts should approach new predictions with measured skepticism while acknowledging improved market conditions for wearables. Several factors differentiate the current smart glasses push from previous metaverse efforts. First, smart glasses address existing consumer behavior rather than creating entirely new ones. Second, the technology builds upon established mobile computing infrastructure. Third, multiple major competitors are entering the market simultaneously, suggesting broader industry confidence. Privacy and Social Considerations The proliferation of camera-equipped wearable devices raises significant privacy concerns that manufacturers must address. Early smart glasses like Google Glass faced public backlash over recording capabilities, leading to temporary bans in certain establishments. Current generation devices incorporate clearer recording indicators and more transparent privacy controls, but societal acceptance remains an ongoing challenge. Regulatory frameworks are evolving alongside the technology. The European Union’s AI Act includes specific provisions for wearable AI devices, while various U.S. states are considering legislation regarding recording consent in public spaces. Industry leaders emphasize that responsible development must precede widespread adoption to avoid previous mistakes. Use Case Development and Consumer Value Successful adoption will depend on demonstrating clear consumer value beyond novelty. Current promising applications include: Real-time language translation for travelers and international business Accessibility features for visually impaired users Hands-free navigation and information retrieval Professional applications in healthcare, manufacturing, and field service Fitness applications currently represent the most developed consumer use case. Smart glasses designed for athletic use can provide performance metrics, route navigation, and coaching feedback without requiring users to check a separate device. This hands-free functionality proves particularly valuable during activities like cycling, running, and weight training. Manufacturing and Supply Chain Developments The rapid scaling of smart glasses production presents unique manufacturing challenges. Unlike smartphones, these devices require precise optical calibration and comfortable, durable designs suitable for all-day wear. Meta has reportedly developed proprietary manufacturing techniques for its Ray-Ban and Oakley collaborations, though specific details remain confidential. Supply chain analysts note increasing competition for micro-display components and specialized processors optimized for on-device AI. This competition could potentially create temporary shortages as production scales, similar to early smartphone component constraints. However, established manufacturing relationships from smartphone production may help mitigate these challenges. Economic Implications and Market Dynamics The shift toward smart glasses could significantly impact several adjacent industries. Traditional eyewear manufacturers face potential disruption, while optical retailers may need to adapt to technology integration. Insurance providers and vision care plans might eventually cover smart glasses as medical devices if they incorporate vision correction and health monitoring capabilities. Enterprise adoption could drive initial market growth before consumer segments reach critical mass. Industries including logistics, healthcare, and field service have demonstrated interest in smart glasses for hands-free information access and remote expert assistance. These business applications often justify higher price points than initial consumer models. Conclusion Mark Zuckerberg’s prediction about AI smart glasses reflects broader industry momentum toward wearable AI integration. While historical technology predictions require cautious interpretation, current market indicators suggest genuine potential for smart glasses adoption. Multiple major technology companies are investing substantially in this category, consumer sales are growing rapidly, and technological improvements are addressing previous limitations. The coming years will determine whether AI smart glasses achieve smartphone-level ubiquity or occupy a more specialized market position. Regardless of adoption scale, these devices represent a significant evolution in human-computer interaction and personal technology integration. FAQs Q1: What exactly are AI smart glasses?

Meanwhile, XRP ETFs have achieved a remarkable milestone, surpassing $2 billion in total volume, reflecting growing institutional demand and interest . Grayscale Files New Amendment For Its XRP ETF On Tuesday, January 20, Grayscale updated its Form 8-K filing for the Spot XRP ETF, highlighting new details it has included in the index calculation. The amendment, which was submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) , revealed changes to the digital asset trading platforms previously used to determine the Index Price for the Grayscale XRP Trust ETF, GXRP . The CoinDesk Indices, Inc., which provides the index, initially included Bitstamp by Robinhood, Crypto.com, Gemini, Kraken, LMAX Digital, OKX, and Bitfinex for XRP-USD trading pairs in the original XRP Spot ETF filing. For XRP-USDC trading pairs, the index previously featured Bitstamp, Bullish, Bybit, Kraken, and OKX. Notably, the January 20 amendment has now added Binance, Gate, and Hashkey as new platforms for XRP trading pairs. These additions follow a routine monthly review where the platforms met the conditions and eligibility criteria for inclusion. At the same time, Bitfinex was removed from the index. Grayscale disclosed that the reason for the exclusion was due to Bitfinex’s failure to meet the Index Provider’s conditions for inclusion. The asset manager’s move reflects its ongoing efforts to maintain a more accurate and reliable pricing for its XRP ETFs. Market analyst Xaif Crypto has stated that the new amendment improves NAV accuracy on NYSE Arca.

This controversial decision, revealed in Tesla’s Wednesday shareholder letter, follows xAI’s recent $20 billion Series E funding round and highlights the increasingly complex relationship between Musk’s corporate entities. The investment represents a significant bet on artificial intelligence convergence despite clear shareholder reservations expressed through voting mechanisms last November. Tesla’s xAI Investment Defies Shareholder Opposition Tesla proceeded with the $2 billion commitment to xAI despite a formal shareholder vote that technically rejected the proposal. According to Bloomberg’s reporting from November, approximately 1.06 billion votes supported the nonbinding measure authorizing the Tesla board to invest in xAI, while 916.3 million votes opposed it. However, Tesla’s corporate bylaws count abstentions as votes against, resulting in the measure’s official rejection. Consequently, Tesla moved forward regardless, presenting a detailed justification in its recent shareholder communication. This decision underscores the board’s confidence in the strategic necessity of the investment, prioritizing long-term AI alignment over immediate shareholder preferences. The shareholder letter explicitly connects the investment to Tesla’s Master Plan Part IV, which outlines the company’s vision for bringing artificial intelligence into the physical world.

Strategic Alignment Between Tesla and xAI Tesla and xAI already maintain multiple operational connections that predate this investment. For instance, Tesla supplies its Megapack batteries to power xAI data centers, as Musk confirmed last year. Additionally, Tesla has integrated the xAI chatbot Grok into some vehicle models, providing early examples of practical collaboration. Bloomberg further reported that xAI informed investors about plans to develop AI specifically for humanoid robots, directly aligning with Tesla’s Optimus project. These existing ties demonstrate how the companies already function as complementary entities within Musk’s technological ecosystem. The strategic rationale extends beyond simple financial investment. Tesla’s shareholder letter emphasizes developments in physical AI and robotics, including ongoing Optimus robot development, semitruck projects, and autonomous capabilities. By investing in xAI, Tesla gains closer access to cutting-edge digital AI research that could accelerate its physical robotics ambitions. Conversely, xAI benefits from Tesla’s real-world deployment platforms and manufacturing expertise. This symbiotic relationship creates a unique competitive advantage in the rapidly evolving AI landscape, potentially accelerating innovation cycles for both companies. Financial Context and Market Implications Tesla’s investment comes during a period of mixed financial performance. While the company broadly exceeded Wall Street estimates for earnings and revenue, its profit declined by 46% last year. This context makes the $2 billion commitment particularly notable, representing a significant allocation of capital toward long-term AI strategy. The investment is expected to close during the first quarter, according to the shareholder letter. Other investors in xAI’s $20 billion Series E round include prominent names like Valor Equity Partners, Fidelity, Qatar Investment Authority, plus strategic investors Nvidia and Cisco. This diverse investor base validates xAI’s technological potential and market position. Market analysts will closely watch how this investment affects Tesla’s financial metrics and competitive positioning.

This significant development, first reported by Eleanor Terrett of Crypto in America, establishes definitive parameters for how federal securities laws apply to blockchain-based financial instruments. The guidance arrives at a pivotal moment for institutional adoption and represents the SEC’s most comprehensive framework to date for digital securities. SEC Tokenized Securities Framework: Core Distinctions The SEC’s new guidance fundamentally distinguishes between two primary tokenization structures. First, the framework addresses tokenization initiatives led directly by the asset issuer. Second, it provides separate parameters for structures involving third-party intermediaries. This distinction represents a critical advancement in regulatory thinking. Previously, market participants operated with considerable uncertainty regarding these operational models. Consequently, the new guidance provides much-needed specificity for compliance teams and legal departments across the financial sector. Tokenized securities represent traditional financial assets recorded on blockchain networks. These digital instruments include stocks, bonds, and real estate investment trusts. The SEC’s guidance specifically addresses how existing securities regulations apply to these blockchain implementations. For instance, the framework clarifies registration requirements for tokenized offerings. Additionally, it outlines disclosure obligations for issuers utilizing distributed ledger technology. Market analysts immediately recognized the guidance’s importance for institutional blockchain adoption. Regulatory Evolution and Market Context The SEC’s guidance follows years of regulatory development and market evolution. Initially, the Commission issued its 2017 DAO Report, which first applied securities laws to digital assets. Subsequently, multiple enforcement actions established precedents for token classification. However, market participants consistently requested formal guidance rather than regulation through enforcement. The 2025 framework directly addresses these longstanding requests for clarity. Several factors prompted this regulatory advancement. First, traditional financial institutions have increasingly explored tokenization projects. Major banks and asset managers have announced blockchain initiatives throughout 2024. Second, technological advancements have made tokenization more accessible and secure. Third, international regulatory developments created competitive pressure for clear U.S. standards. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, implemented in 2024, established comprehensive European rules for digital assets. Expert Analysis and Industry Response Financial regulation experts have analyzed the guidance’s potential impacts extensively. “This represents the most significant regulatory development for digital assets since the Howey Test application,” noted Professor Alan Michaels of Georgetown Law. “The SEC has provided actionable parameters rather than vague principles.” Industry participants have generally welcomed the clarity while noting implementation challenges. Compliance officers now face the task of adapting existing programs to the new digital asset specifications. The guidance specifically addresses several contentious issues that previously created regulatory uncertainty: Secondary Market Trading: Clarifies when tokenized securities qualify for existing exchange exemptions Custody Requirements: Outlines digital asset custody standards for broker-dealers Recordkeeping Obligations: Specifies blockchain data retention and verification standards Investor Communications: Defines disclosure delivery methods for tokenized offerings Implementation Timeline and Compliance Requirements The SEC has established a phased implementation timeline for the new guidance. Initial compliance requirements take effect in Q3 2025, with full implementation expected by Q2 2026. This timeline provides market participants with adequate preparation periods. However, the guidance applies immediately to new tokenization initiatives announced after its publication date. Existing tokenized securities projects have twelve months to achieve full compliance with the new standards. The framework introduces specific compliance mechanisms for different market participants: Participant Type Primary Requirements Compliance Deadline Issuer-Led Tokenization Enhanced disclosure, investor verification, transfer restrictions Q3 2025 Third-Party Platforms Registration requirements, custody standards, surveillance systems Q4 2025 Existing Projects Documentation review, compliance gap analysis, implementation Q2 2026 Market infrastructure providers must develop new technological solutions to meet these requirements. Several fintech companies have already announced compliance tool development initiatives. These solutions will help market participants navigate the complex regulatory landscape. Furthermore, the guidance encourages technological innovation within established regulatory boundaries. Global Implications and Competitive Landscape The SEC’s guidance positions the United States within the global regulatory competition for digital asset leadership. Previously, regulatory uncertainty drove some blockchain innovation to jurisdictions with clearer frameworks. Singapore, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom have established progressive digital asset regulations. The new U.S. guidance creates more competitive conditions for domestic blockchain development. International financial centers now face renewed competition from American markets. Global standard-setting bodies will likely reference the SEC framework in their own deliberations. The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) has monitored digital asset regulation developments closely. Many experts predict the SEC’s approach will influence international standards significantly. Consequently, the guidance extends beyond domestic American markets to shape global financial regulation evolution. Technological Considerations and Security Protocols The guidance acknowledges technological considerations without endorsing specific blockchain implementations. It establishes security requirements for tokenized securities platforms regardless of their underlying technology. These requirements include cybersecurity protocols, key management systems, and network resilience standards. The framework emphasizes technological neutrality while ensuring investor protection across all implementation methods. Several technological challenges remain despite the regulatory clarity. Interoperability between different blockchain networks requires further development. Scalability solutions must accommodate potential high-volume trading environments. Privacy-preserving technologies need integration with regulatory reporting requirements. The guidance encourages continued technological innovation to address these challenges within compliant frameworks. Conclusion The SEC’s new guidance on tokenized securities represents a watershed moment for digital asset regulation. By distinguishing between issuer-led and third-party tokenization structures, the framework provides essential clarity for market participants. This development supports continued blockchain innovation while maintaining robust investor protections. The guidance establishes the United States as a competitive jurisdiction for digital asset development. Consequently, the SEC tokenized securities framework will likely accelerate institutional adoption of blockchain technology throughout global financial markets. FAQs Q1: What are tokenized securities? Tokenized securities are traditional financial instruments, like stocks or bonds, represented digitally on blockchain networks. They combine the regulatory protections of conventional securities with the technological efficiencies of distributed ledger systems. Q2: How does the SEC’s new guidance change existing regulations? The guidance clarifies how existing securities laws apply to blockchain implementations rather than creating entirely new regulations. It provides specific parameters for compliance with registration, disclosure, and trading requirements in digital asset contexts. Q3: What is the difference between issuer-led and third-party tokenization? Issuer-led tokenization occurs when the security’s original creator directly manages the blockchain implementation. Third-party tokenization involves separate entities creating digital representations of existing securities, often for trading or settlement efficiency. Q4: When must market participants comply with the new guidance? New tokenization projects must comply immediately, while existing initiatives have until Q2 2026. Initial requirements for some participant categories take effect in Q3 2025, with phased implementation across different market segments. Q5: How does this guidance affect international blockchain projects? The framework establishes U.S. regulatory standards that global projects must meet to access American markets. It also influences international regulatory discussions, potentially shaping digital asset standards across multiple jurisdictions through organizations like IOSCO.

57548875,https://cryptonews.com/?p=480359,1769642321,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/57548875.jpeg,"Crypto Crime Hits $158B in 2025 – But Illicit Use Keeps Falling, Says TRM",https://cryptonews.com/news/trm-report-crypto-crime-2025-illicit-use-decline/,"A new report by blockchain intelligence company TRM Labs showed that crypto-related crime had a record nominal value in 2025, albeit that the proportion of illicit activity in the wider digital asset economy kept dropping as a whole. The report estimates that the volume of illegitimate cryptocurrencies had risen to $158 billion in 2025, 145% higher than the figure of a year ago, which was $64.5 billion. Source: TRM Although the dollar terms increased sharply, the illicit transactions formed only 1.2% of the entire on-chain volume, compared to 1.3% in 2024 and much less than the 2.4% high in 2023. These numbers are generally in line with the estimates released this month by Chainalysis , which estimated crypto crime at $154 billion in 2025 as being less than 1% of total crypto activity. Illicit Actors Capture Less Crypto Capital Despite Higher Volumes To better capture risk, TRM introduced a new metric that measures illicit activity relative to deployable capital rather than raw transaction volume. Through this method, the company discovered that the illicit players took 2.7% of the liquidity of the crypto in 2025 compared to 2.9% the year before and 6.0% the year before. Source: TRM Labs TRM said the data suggest that while certain illicit categories expanded in absolute terms, criminal actors absorbed a smaller proportion of new capital entering the ecosystem. In 2025, activity related to sanctions had led to the illicit volume, mostly associated with Russia-related flows. TRM credited the growth to the increased use of A7A5, a ruble-pegged stablecoin that transacted a total volume of more than $72 billion throughout the year. Russia’s ruble-backed stablecoin A7A5 has surpassed more than $100 billion in transactions in less than a year. #RussiaStablecoin #A7A5 #RussiaSanctions https://t.co/QUp9twlECE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 23, 2026 At least $39 billion of transactions were correlated to wallets belonging to the Russian sanctions-evasion system A7, suggesting a high level of coordination of an activity related to state-consistent financial infrastructure, instead of extensive use of the market. Stablecoins were the main vehicle, and the activity moved to less regulated and riskier channels as enforcement increased. Cryptography was reconfigured by geopolitical pressures that influenced several areas, as Venezuelans have turned into major users of stablecoins and peer-to-peer transactions to pay their daily income, remittances, and informal services due to the lack of economic stability. In Iran, crypto buying and selling activities have been resilient to sanctions, with the total volume of transactions decreasing in the June 2025 Iran-Israel war, yet values went up, indicating larger transfers, with illegal operations reaching up to $580 million. Iran is reportedly offering ballistic missiles, drones and warships to foreign governments for cryptocurrency, seeking payment routes that bypass Western financial controls. #Iran #ArmsTrade https://t.co/kfVy8B4bgL — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 2, 2026 Scams, Hacks, and AI Fuel Crypto Crime in 2025 Another key cause of illicit volume was crypto theft, where $2.87 billion was stolen in almost 150 hacks and exploits in 2025. Although there was a slight decrease in the number of incidents, the number of losses shot up as attackers began to target operational infrastructure instead of smart contracts. Source: TRM Labs In February, a single breach at Bybit, which was linked to the North Koreans, cost the company $1.46 billion , or over half of the entire annual losses. In total, five cases accounted for about 70% of stolen money, underlining the impact of several big attacks on annual results. Fraud remained persistent, with scams accounting for an estimated $35 billion in losses, similar to 2024 levels. Investment scams, including so-called pig butchering schemes and Ponzi operations, made up nearly two-thirds of that figure. Stablecoins dominated fraud inflows, and TRM noted that criminal networks increasingly used generative AI to scale outreach and create more convincing deceptions while accelerating laundering to move funds within days of receipt. Other illicit markets also expanded, with online drug trafficking reaching more than $3.4 billion in crypto volume, driven largely by Russian-language darknet marketplaces.

Major cryptocurrency companies, including Coinbase, Andreessen Horowitz and Ripple are major contributors to Fairshake, the pro-crypto super PAC. How is the crypto industry spending money on the 2026 elections? The pro-crypto super PAC known as Fairshake has reported that it has more than $193 million in its “war chest” ahead of the 2026 election cycle. “With the midterms approaching, we are united behind our mission with Fairshake continuing to oppose anti-crypto politicians and support pro-crypto leaders,” Fairshake’s spokesman, Josh Vlasto, said . For years, crypto companies have argued that U.S. laws are outdated. They have said that the current regulations, which are often enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are confusing and harmful to innovation. By spending nearly $200 million, the industry hopes to seat a Congress that will pass specific crypto-friendly laws like the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, also known as FIT21 and also laws regarding stablecoin regulation. During the 2024 cycle, Fairshake-funded advertisements were credited with helping defeat candidates like Jamaal Bowman and Cori Bush, who were seen as critics of the cryptocurrency industry. Coinbase gave $25 million to the PAC in the first half of 2025. Ripple and Andreessen Horowitz also contributed, giving $25 million and $24 respectively. Which political figures and parties are being targeted by these funds? Fairshake has stated that it does not strictly support Republicans or Democrats, but its spending often targets specific high-profile individuals who hold anti-crypto views. The organization consists of a trio of super PACs that work together to influence both parties simultaneously. Fairshake provides the funds, while “Protect Progress” supports Democrats and “Defend American Jobs” supports Republican candidates. During the 2024 election cycle, the trio spent over $40 million to defeat Senator Sherrod Brown in Ohio. Brown was the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee at the time and so was a high-profile skeptic of digital assets. Fairshake and its affiliate, Defend American Jobs, supported his challenger, Bernie Moreno, who was a former luxury car dealer and blockchain entrepreneur. In the 2026 cycle, Fairshake is expected to focus on key Senate races where the margin of victory is thin. By running television ads and digital campaigns, they can influence undecided voters.

Versan Aljarrah, founder of Black Swan Capitalist, recently addressed this issue, stating that constant monitoring of XRP’s daily price fluctuations reflects a spectator mindset rather than a serious investment approach. His comments have resonated within segments of the XRP community that prioritize structural development over near-term market performance. Aljarrah’s position is grounded in the belief that digital assets should be evaluated based on adoption, regulatory positioning, and institutional integration. From this perspective, price volatility is a secondary consideration, particularly for those assessing XRP’s role within the evolving financial system. Reframing What Long-Term Investment Means Supporters of XRP increasingly argue that price alone provides an incomplete picture of progress. While the asset remains well below its previous high near $3.66, proponents contend that several foundational elements have strengthened over time. These include expanded regulatory engagement, increased institutional participation, and continued infrastructure development by Ripple. XRP price obsession is for spectators. Real investors focus on adoption, infrastructure, and regulatory integration, the pieces that create long-term value. — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) January 27, 2026 This approach reframes XRP not as a short-term trading vehicle but as a component of a broader financial architecture. Advocates suggest that focusing exclusively on price movements obscures developments that may take years to fully materialize but are critical to sustained value creation. Regulation remains central to XRP’s long-term narrative. Several analysts point to ongoing legislative efforts in the United States as a potential catalyst for institutional adoption. Proposed frameworks, including the CLARITY Act, expected to advance through the legislative process in the coming years, are viewed as steps toward clearer classification and oversight of digital assets. In parallel, Ripple has continued to pursue formal regulatory alignment. The company recently received conditional approval from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to establish a national trust bank. If finalized, this status would place Ripple and its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, under federal supervision. Observers interpret this move as a deliberate effort to operate within established financial regulations rather than outside them. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Participation Continues to Expand Beyond regulatory progress, institutional involvement with XRP has grown. Spot XRP exchange-traded funds introduced in the United States have accumulated significant assets , with issuers collectively holding over $1.3 billion worth of XRP to support these products. This level of exposure suggests sustained interest from institutional allocators, even during periods of price underperformance. Additionally, several firms have disclosed treasury strategies that include XRP, signaling confidence in its long-term relevance. These developments indicate that institutional participation is extending beyond speculative exposure into more structured financial use cases. Ripple’s strategic direction further reinforces this long-term orientation. The company has invested heavily in infrastructure through acquisitions, partnerships, and product expansion aimed at improving cross-border payments and settlement efficiency. XRP remains positioned as a functional element within this ecosystem rather than a standalone speculative asset. This emphasis on infrastructure aligns closely with public statements from Ripple’s leadership. CEO Brad Garlinghouse has consistently emphasized that meaningful change within global finance requires sustained effort, regulatory cooperation, and technical integration over extended periods. Price Performance Versus Long-Term Conviction Despite these developments, XRP’s market price has yet to reflect the scale of institutional and regulatory progress cited by supporters. The asset remains roughly 50 percent below its most recent peak, a reality that continues to frustrate short-term traders. However, long-term holders argue that price lag does not negate underlying progress. From this viewpoint, the disconnect between price and fundamentals represents a divergence rather than a failure. While market participants focused on short-term charts may remain cautious, those aligned with Aljarrah’s perspective see current conditions as part of a longer investment horizon shaped by infrastructure, regulation, and adoption rather than immediate price appreciation.

The XRP Golden Ticket Theory The idea surfaced in an exchange on X after one user, Alex Cobb, a well-known commentator within the XRP community, argued that US market-structure legislation, the CLARITY Act, is “XRPs golden ticket.” Another renowned community member, Krippenreiter, pushed the focus back on product rails rather than policy catalysts: “Personally I think Ripple Payments sourcing liquidity from the onchain XRPL DEX and Ripple Prime settling post trade on the XRP Ledger are XRPs golden tickets.” Personally I think Ripple Payments sourcing liquidity from the onchain XRPL DEX and Ripple Prime settling post trade on the XRP Ledger are XRPs golden tickets. (Long-term view 🫡) https://t.co/DOkLdsH1oo — Krippenreiter (@krippenreiter) January 27, 2026 Krippenreiter clarified that the phrasing tracks what Ripple has previously messaged about how it intends to use the XRPL in institutional contexts. “The ideal is to do everything on-chain, so yes. Anything happening on-chain settles on XRPL,” they wrote, adding: “I said ‘post-trade settlement’ because that’s what Ripple initially publicly stated for what they plan on using XRPL for.” Related Reading: XRP Funding Rates And Spot Volume Tell An Interesting Story For Price That distinction matters because routing liquidity through a public DEX, especially for regulated entities, creates a different compliance surface than using a ledger as a settlement layer after execution happens elsewhere. In the thread, attorney Bill Morgan framed the gating issue bluntly: “Eventually, once it can source liquidity from the XRPL DEX without risk of regulatory non-compliance.” Others pointed to Permissioned Domains and a permissioned DEX construct as the major blocker for regulated liquidity sourcing, with Krippenreiter describing “credentials,” “permissioned domain,” and “permissioned dex” as the solution set. Morgan noted the implication extends beyond Ripple: if that’s a blocker for Ripple, “it will be a block for any other institution that may wish to use the XRPL DEX.” Notably, the Permissioned Domains amendment is on track to go live next week, XRPScan shows 27 of 34 validator votes (88.24% consensus) and an estimated activation time of Feb. 4, 2026 at 09:57:51 UTC, provided it remains above the required threshold through the enablement window. The same thread pulled Ripple Prime into the picture. Luke Judges (middle management at Ripple) said, “Prime underrated, we need more CEXs to support XRPL inventory. Working on it.” Related Reading: XRP Ledger Congestion Could Burn 1 Billion Coins A Year, Developer Claims Krippenreiter suggested that, beyond exchange inventory, privacy could be the other hard prerequisite for Prime’s deeper XRPL integration, calling it “the blocker” in circulating rumors. That maps onto Ripple’s own public framing: in an October 2 post, Ripple engineering leader J. Ayo Akinyele argued that “finance cannot function without confidentiality, yet blockchains are built on transparency,” and that institutional-grade adoption requires privacy that still supports compliance. Akinyele put the institutional constraint in plain terms: “Without privacy, financial institutions cannot safely use public ledgers for core workflows. Without accountability, regulators cannot sign off. With programmable privacy, we can have both.” The discussion landed just as Ripple and GTreasury rolled out “Ripple Treasury,” positioning it as enterprise treasury infrastructure that blends traditional cash operations with digital-asset rails.

During a recent investor call, Zuckerberg confirmed that new AI models and applications will begin rolling out to users in the coming months, culminating in a major 2026 infrastructure and product push designed to leverage Meta’s unique access to personal context. Meta’s AI 2026 Roadmap: From Foundation to Frontier Zuckerberg framed 2025 as a year of foundational rebuilding for Meta’s AI program, following a significant restructuring of its AI research labs. Consequently, the coming year represents a critical execution phase. “Over the coming months, we’re going to start shipping our new models and products,” Zuckerberg stated, adding, “I expect us to steadily push the frontier over the course of the new year.” This timeline sets the stage for what the CEO calls “a big year for delivering personal superintelligence.” The company’s financial commitment underscores this ambition. Meta’s projected capital expenditures for 2026 have surged to between $115 billion and $135 billion, a substantial increase from $72 billion in 2025. The company’s official filing attributes this jump directly to “increased investment to support our Meta Superintelligence Labs efforts and core business.” The Strategic Pivot to Agentic Commerce While specific product details remain under wraps, Zuckerberg explicitly highlighted AI-driven commerce as a primary focus. He introduced the concept of “agentic shopping tools,” which he described as systems that “will allow people to find just the right set of products from the businesses in our catalog.” This vision involves AI agents—autonomous or semi-autonomous software programs—that can understand complex user intent, navigate vast product catalogs, and make personalized recommendations or complete transactions. This move aligns Meta with a broader industry trend. For instance, both Google and OpenAI have developed platforms for agent-enabled transactions, securing partnerships with major firms like Stripe and Uber. However, Meta’s strategy hinges on a distinct competitive advantage: unparalleled access to personal data. Personal Context: Meta’s Defining Edge in AI Zuckerberg repeatedly emphasized the value of personal context, which may become Meta’s most significant differentiator. “We’re starting to see the promise of AI that understands our personal context, including our history, our interests, our content and our relationships,” he explained. He argued that an agent’s true value stems from its unique contextual awareness. Therefore, Meta believes it can “provide a uniquely personal experience” by integrating insights from across its family of apps—Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. This approach contrasts with other AI labs that may possess advanced technical infrastructure but lack Meta’s deep, cross-platform understanding of user behavior and social graphs. Acquisitions and Infrastructure: Building the AI Engine Meta’s strategy extends beyond internal development. In December 2024, the company acquired Manus, a developer of general-purpose AI agents. Meta announced it would continue to operate Manus’s service while also integrating its technology into Meta’s own products. This acquisition provides ready-made expertise in agent architecture. The massive infrastructure spending, meanwhile, funds the computational backbone required for training and running advanced AI models. Analysts note that while the $115-135 billion figure is staggering, it remains below earlier reports that suggested Zuckerberg envisioned up to $600 billion in infrastructure spending through 2028. This scaling indicates a focused, yet still enormous, commitment to achieving AI scale. Meta’s AI Investment & Timeline (2024-2026) Period Key Focus Capital Expenditure Strategic Goal 2024 Lab Restructuring, Acquisition (Manus) N/A Rebuild Foundations 2025 Model Development, Infrastructure Build-out ~$72 Billion Prepare for Deployment 2026 (Projected) Product Rollout, Agentic Commerce Launch $115-135 Billion Deliver “Personal Superintelligence” Industry Context and Competitive Landscape The race to deploy commercial AI agents is intensifying across the tech sector. Several key dynamics define the current landscape: Platform Wars: Google, OpenAI, and Amazon are all developing agentic platforms, turning AI assistants into transactional hubs. Data as a Moat: Meta’s argument centers on data. Its platforms host social interactions, commerce interests, and communication history, creating a rich dataset for personalization. Investor Scrutiny: Meta has previously faced investor questions about the return on its immense AI spending. The focus on commerce provides a clearer, revenue-linked justification. Technical Hurdles: Delivering reliable, trustworthy agents that can handle financial transactions requires breakthroughs in reasoning, safety, and user interface design. The Commerce Evolution: From Search to Agent The shift from keyword search to AI-agent-driven discovery represents a fundamental change in digital commerce. Traditional search requires users to know what they want. In contrast, an agent can infer needs, consider past preferences, compare options across criteria, and even negotiate or purchase autonomously. For businesses, this means optimizing for AI discovery rather than just search engine algorithms. It also raises important questions about consumer trust, bias in recommendations, and the transparency of AI-driven decisions. Conclusion: A Defining Bet on Personalized AI Mark Zuckerberg’s announcement sets a clear marker for Meta’s direction through 2026. The company is betting its future on the premise that personal context will be the ultimate currency in the AI era. By channeling unprecedented resources into infrastructure and focusing its initial product push on agentic commerce , Meta aims to translate its social media dominance into leadership in the next computing paradigm. The coming months will reveal the first tangible results of this strategy, testing whether Meta’s unique data advantage can indeed create a “uniquely personal” AI experience that reshows how billions of people shop and interact online. FAQs Q1: What is “agentic commerce”? Agentic commerce refers to online shopping facilitated by AI agents. These are advanced software programs that can understand a user’s needs, search for products, compare options, and potentially complete transactions with a high degree of autonomy, moving beyond simple search or recommendation engines. Q2: When will Meta’s new AI tools launch? Mark Zuckerberg stated that Meta will begin shipping new AI models and products to users “in the coming months,” with a steady rollout and advancement expected throughout 2026. Specific dates for the agentic commerce tools were not provided. Q3: How is Meta’s approach to AI different from Google’s or OpenAI’s? While all are building advanced AI, Meta emphasizes its unique access to “personal context”—data from social interactions, interests, and relationship graphs across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The company argues this allows for more personalized and intuitive AI agents than those built solely on public data or search history. Q4: Why is Meta spending so much on infrastructure? The projected $115-135 billion in 2026 capital expenditures is primarily for data centers, servers, and networking hardware required to train and run increasingly large and complex AI models. This scale of computing power is essential for achieving the “personal superintelligence” Zuckerberg described. Q5: What did Meta acquire with the company Manus? In December 2024, Meta acquired Manus, a developer of general-purpose AI agent technology. The acquisition provides Meta with existing agent architecture and expertise, accelerating its ability to build and deploy the agentic commerce tools discussed by Zuckerberg.

57549533,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=266559,1769644512,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Gold Price Soars Past $5.5K, Shattering Records in a Stunning Rally",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/gold-price-record-high-5500/,"BitcoinWorld Gold Price Soars Past $5.5K, Shattering Records in a Stunning Rally In a stunning display of market strength, the spot gold price has decisively broken the $5,500 per ounce barrier, setting new consecutive all-time highs and surpassing the $5,400 mark. This remarkable rally, confirmed on April 10, 2025, represents a pivotal moment for global financial markets and precious metals investors. Consequently, analysts are now scrutinizing the complex interplay of macroeconomic forces driving this unprecedented valuation. Gold Price Reaches Uncharted Territory Above $5,500 The London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) fixing recently confirmed spot gold trading firmly above $5,400, with intraday peaks testing the $5,550 level. This surge marks a continuation of a record-setting trend that began in late 2024. For context, the previous major resistance zone sat near $2,100 per ounce just a few years prior. Therefore, the velocity of this ascent has captured global attention. Several key technical indicators now signal a strongly bullish long-term trend. Market data reveals consistent buying pressure across both physical and derivative markets. Furthermore, trading volumes for gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have spiked significantly. Major funds like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) report substantial inflows. This institutional demand provides a solid foundation for the current price level. Central bank purchases have also provided a consistent bid under the market. According to the World Gold Council, official sector buying has remained robust for eight consecutive quarters. This diversified demand profile helps explain the asset’s resilience. Analyzing the Macroeconomic Drivers Behind the Rally Multiple interrelated factors are converging to propel gold to these historic highs. Primarily, shifting expectations for global interest rate policy play a central role. While some central banks have paused hiking cycles, real interest rates in many major economies remain negative when adjusted for inflation. This environment traditionally diminishes the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold. Additionally, persistent geopolitical tensions continue to fuel safe-haven demand. Investors are increasingly seeking assets perceived as stores of value during uncertainty. The monetary landscape also contributes significantly. Many analysts point to sustained high levels of fiscal stimulus and sovereign debt as long-term supportive factors. These conditions can erode confidence in fiat currencies over time. The following table summarizes the primary demand catalysts identified by sector analysts: Demand Catalyst Recent Impact Central Bank Purchases Record net buying in Q4 2024; diversification away from USD reserves. Institutional ETF Inflows Largest weekly inflow in 3 years reported in March 2025. Retail Physical Demand Strong coin and bar sales in North America and Asia. Futures Market Positioning Managed money net-long positions at a 5-year high. Expert Perspectives on Sustainability and Future Trajectory Market strategists offer nuanced views on whether the current gold price level is sustainable. Some emphasize that gold’s performance must be evaluated against other asset classes. For instance, the gold-to-S&P 500 ratio has risen but remains below historical peaks. This suggests potential for further rebalancing by portfolio managers. Mining analysts also highlight supply-side constraints. New major mine discoveries have lagged, and the average cost of production has risen steadily. This creates a higher fundamental floor for prices. However, other experts caution about short-term volatility. They note that speculative positioning is elevated, which could lead to sharp corrections if sentiment shifts. The consensus view acknowledges the strong fundamental backdrop but advises investors to focus on long-term strategic allocation rather than timing short-term peaks. Historical Context and Comparison to Previous Bull Markets The current gold bull market exhibits distinct characteristics when compared to historical rallies. The 1970s surge was primarily driven by oil shocks and high inflation. The 2008-2011 rally responded to the Global Financial Crisis and quantitative easing. Today’s environment combines elements of both, plus unique modern factors like digital asset volatility and complex global supply chains. The pace of the current advance, while rapid, has seen periods of consolidation. This has allowed the market to build support at progressively higher levels. Key technical milestones, such as the breach of the 2011 inflation-adjusted high, have acted as significant accelerants. Market participants now watch for a potential test of the next major psychological resistance near $6,000 per ounce. Historical data suggests that after breaking key multi-decade resistance, gold often enters a new multi-year trading range at a significantly higher plateau. The rally’s impact extends beyond the spot price. It is affecting related markets and industries in profound ways: Mining Equities: Gold mining stocks have outperformed the broader equity market, though often with higher volatility. Currency Markets: The Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, as commodity-linked currencies, have shown correlation with gold’s strength. Central Bank Reserves: Institutions are accelerating reviews of their reserve asset allocations. Jewelry Demand: High-value consumer demand in key markets like India has adapted, with a shift towards lighter-weight pieces. Conclusion The gold price breaking above $5,500 represents a landmark event in financial markets. This move stems from a confluence of macroeconomic forces, including monetary policy, geopolitical risk, and sustained institutional demand. While the velocity of the ascent prompts questions about near-term sustainability, the fundamental case for gold as a portfolio diversifier appears robust. Investors and analysts will closely monitor upcoming economic data and central bank communications for signals that may influence the next phase of this historic gold price rally. The asset’s performance continues to underscore its unique role within the global financial system. FAQs Q1: What does “spot gold” price mean? The spot price refers to the current market price for immediate delivery and payment of gold. It is the benchmark price for physical metal and many derivatives, set by trading activity on global over-the-counter markets. Q2: Why is gold considered a safe-haven asset? Gold is historically perceived as a store of value during periods of economic uncertainty, high inflation, or geopolitical stress because it is no single entity’s liability, has limited supply, and maintains purchasing power over long periods. Q3: How does the rise in gold price affect everyday consumers? While direct effects on most consumers are limited, it can lead to higher prices for gold jewelry and electronics containing gold. Indirectly, it may signal broader economic concerns that could impact investment portfolios and savings. Q4: What is the difference between investing in physical gold versus gold stocks or ETFs? Physical gold offers direct ownership of the metal (e.g., bars, coins). Gold ETFs provide exposure through shares of a trust that holds physical bullion. Gold mining stocks represent shares in companies that extract gold, whose value is tied to operational performance and leverage to the gold price. Q5: Have other precious metals like silver followed gold’s rally? Precious metals often move in correlation, but not always in lockstep. Silver has also seen significant gains, though its price is more influenced by industrial demand cycles in addition to investment flows, leading to different performance characteristics.

In the days following the removal of $DMC perpetuals trading on Binance Futures, the token surged more than 200%, a move DeLorean Labs says reflects long-suppressed organic participation finally re-emerging after leverage-heavy market dynamics were removed. For DeLorean Labs, the rebound is less about short-term price action and more about a broader market structure correction — one the team argues had been holding the project back since its earliest exposure. A Derivatives-First Introduction $DMC first entered the market in June 2025 through Binance’s Alpha program, which introduced the token into an incentives- and derivatives-heavy environment before spot-led liquidity had time to develop. Prior to $DMC’s Alpha listing, Binance had publicly acknowledged Sybil-related issues within its Alpha points system and stated that mitigation efforts were underway. Follow-up communications after $DMC went live indicated those issues had not yet been fully resolved. According to DeLorean Labs, the combination of unresolved incentive dynamics and derivatives-first exposure created early selling pressure that did not reflect the project’s fundamentals, roadmap, or long-term community conviction. That imbalance intensified last week when Binance removed $DMC perpetuals trading. As derivatives positions unwound, the market experienced sharp volatility, which was further amplified as additional perpetuals venues followed suit. DeLorean Labs maintains that these moves were driven by market mechanics tied to derivatives exposure — not any change in development, partnerships, or execution. Community Steps In — Twice What followed surprised even long-time observers. As volatility peaked, the DeLorean community rallied — not once, but twice — with long-term holders stepping in during periods of extreme dislocation. Within days, $DMC rebounded sharply, erasing losses and posting triple-digit gains. Market observers have likened the episode to moments in traditional markets where aligned retail communities reshaped price discovery around iconic brands — including GameStop — highlighting the influence communities can exert when leverage-driven dynamics step aside. “From the beginning, we’ve believed that how a token trades matters just as much as why it exists,” said Evan Kuhn, CEO of DeLorean Labs. “Perpetuals can serve a purpose in mature markets with deep spot liquidity, but when they arrive too early, they tend to distort price discovery and pull focus away from building. Stepping away from derivatives-first dynamics creates healthier conditions for long-term participants and the community.” More Than a Token Narrative DeLorean Labs argues that focusing solely on price misses the bigger picture. In May 2025, DeLorean launched the world’s first on-chain vehicle marketplace , bringing real car sales on-chain and enabling blockchain-based purchasing, ownership records, and marketplace participation tied directly to the DeLorean ecosystem. The initiative positioned DeLorean as the first major automotive manufacturer to take real-world vehicle commerce natively on-chain. The DeLorean brand is also the first major car company to launch a native token and the largest global consumer brand to have a live ticker on CoinMarketCap — a distinction that brings both visibility and heightened scrutiny. A Broader Industry Question Zooming out, DeLorean Labs sees this episode as emblematic of a wider issue in crypto: centralized derivatives and incentive programs exerting disproportionate influence over early-stage token markets. As the industry matures, the company expects growing skepticism toward derivatives-first listings and greater emphasis on spot-led participation that rewards builders and aligned communities over extractive trading dynamics. “Crypto doesn’t need fewer ambitious projects,” Kuhn said. “It needs better foundations.” For DeLorean Labs, the $DMC rally isn’t a victory lap — it’s a signal that when market structure aligns with fundamentals, communities can help carry ambitious projects into the future.

This confrontation highlights the ongoing tension between fostering innovation and implementing consumer protection within one of the world’s most active digital asset markets. The proposed stake limit regulation by the Financial Services Commission (FSC) now faces substantial political resistance, potentially altering the trajectory of crypto oversight in Asia’s fourth-largest economy. South Korea’s Crypto Regulation Faces Political Hurdles According to reports from Edaily, Rep. Kim Sang-hoon, a prominent member of the National Assembly’s Political Affairs Committee, has publicly criticized the FSC’s initiative. As chairman of the PPP’s special committee on stock and digital asset value-up, Kim represents a powerful voice within the ruling party’s economic policy framework. He argues that imposing stake limits on major shareholders of digital asset exchanges would create management ambiguities. Furthermore, he suggests such measures could trigger unintended consequences like capital flight from the domestic market. Kim’s opposition centers on timing and regulatory consistency. He contends that if the government intended to implement ownership rules, it should have established them when South Korea’s digital asset market began forming over a decade ago. The lawmaker specifically criticized the FSC for pursuing regulations that weren’t included in its original legislative proposals. Kim suggested the commission is now acting under inappropriate influences from what he described as “unseen forces from above,” though he didn’t specify these forces explicitly. Historical Context of South Korea’s Crypto Regulatory Evolution South Korea’s relationship with cryptocurrency has evolved dramatically since Bitcoin first gained traction in the early 2010s. The country emerged as a global cryptocurrency hub, with trading volumes sometimes surpassing stock market activity during peak periods. However, this rapid growth prompted regulatory responses. Initially, authorities focused on anti-money laundering (AML) measures and investor protection following several high-profile exchange collapses and fraud cases. The regulatory landscape shifted significantly with the implementation of the Travel Rule in 2021, requiring exchanges to share transaction data for transfers exceeding approximately $830. Subsequently, the Digital Asset Basic Act began taking shape as a comprehensive framework. This proposed legislation aims to establish clear guidelines for token issuance, exchange operations, and investor safeguards. The current debate over ownership limits represents a crucial component of this broader regulatory architecture. Comparative International Regulatory Approaches Globally, cryptocurrency exchange ownership regulations vary substantially. The United States employs a state-by-state licensing system through the Money Transmitter framework, while the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation focuses on entity authorization rather than ownership percentages. Japan, with its longstanding crypto regulatory framework, requires exchange operators to maintain robust internal controls and capital adequacy, but doesn’t impose specific ownership caps. Singapore’s Payment Services Act emphasizes anti-money laundering compliance and technology risk management over ownership structures. South Korea’s proposed approach appears unique in its direct intervention in ownership structures. Proponents argue this could prevent market manipulation and ensure exchange stability. Critics, including the PPP, counter that such measures might stifle entrepreneurship and drive investment overseas. This debate reflects broader questions about how governments should balance innovation with consumer protection in rapidly evolving financial technologies. Potential Impacts of the Proposed Stake Limit Regulation The FSC’s proposed stake limit could significantly affect South Korea’s cryptocurrency ecosystem. Major exchanges like Upbit, Bithumb, and Coinone would need to restructure their ownership arrangements if the legislation passes. These platforms currently dominate the domestic market, processing billions of dollars in daily transactions. Ownership restrictions might force current majority shareholders to divest portions of their holdings, potentially altering corporate governance and strategic direction. Industry analysts identify several potential consequences: Market Concentration Changes: Ownership limits could redistribute exchange control among multiple stakeholders Foreign Investment Effects: International investors might reconsider South Korean crypto investments Innovation Pace: Regulatory uncertainty could slow technological development and service improvements Competitive Landscape: Smaller exchanges might gain relative advantages if larger competitors face restructuring challenges Financial technology experts note that exchange ownership structures often influence platform security practices, listing decisions, and fee structures. Consequently, ownership changes could indirectly affect millions of South Korean cryptocurrency users. The debate therefore extends beyond political and regulatory circles to impact ordinary investors who rely on these platforms for digital asset transactions. Political Dynamics and Legislative Process The confrontation between the PPP and FSC occurs within South Korea’s complex political environment. The People Power Party currently holds a legislative majority, giving it substantial influence over financial legislation. However, the FSC operates as an independent regulatory body with authority derived from financial oversight mandates. This institutional tension creates uncertainty about which perspective will ultimately prevail in the legislative process. Several factors will likely determine the outcome: Factor Potential Influence Public Opinion Growing retail investor base may pressure politicians Economic Considerations Potential capital flight concerns versus market stability International Standards Global regulatory trends may inform domestic decisions Upcoming Elections Political calculations could shape legislative priorities The legislative timeline remains uncertain, with the Digital Asset Basic Act still under parliamentary review. Observers suggest compromise language might emerge, potentially implementing phased ownership restrictions or alternative governance requirements. Such middle-ground approaches could address regulatory concerns while minimizing disruption to existing exchange operations. Expert Perspectives on the Regulatory Debate Financial regulation specialists offer diverse viewpoints on this developing situation. Some experts support the FSC’s proactive stance, arguing that clear ownership rules could enhance market transparency and reduce systemic risks. They point to historical instances where concentrated exchange ownership contributed to problematic practices, including preferential treatment for certain tokens or inadequate security investments. Conversely, blockchain industry advocates generally align with the PPP’s position. They emphasize that South Korea’s cryptocurrency sector has matured significantly since its early days, developing sophisticated self-regulatory practices. These proponents suggest that prescriptive ownership limits might unnecessarily constrain business models that have proven successful in the Korean context. They advocate for outcome-based regulation focusing on consumer protection rather than structural mandates. Academic researchers highlight the novelty of regulating digital asset exchanges through ownership caps. Traditional financial institutions often face ownership restrictions to prevent excessive control, but cryptocurrency exchanges represent a different technological and operational paradigm. Scholars suggest that regulatory frameworks must account for these differences while still addressing legitimate concerns about market integrity and consumer welfare. Conclusion The political opposition to South Korea’s proposed crypto exchange stake limit regulation represents a pivotal moment in the nation’s digital asset governance. As the People Power Party challenges the Financial Services Commission’s legislative push, the outcome will significantly influence South Korea’s position in the global cryptocurrency landscape. This debate transcends technical regulatory details to address fundamental questions about innovation, consumer protection, and market stability. The resolution will likely establish precedents affecting not only exchange ownership but also broader approaches to financial technology regulation. South Korea’s crypto regulation continues evolving amid these complex political and economic considerations, with implications for investors, entrepreneurs, and policymakers worldwide. FAQs Q1: What specific stake limit is the FSC proposing for crypto exchanges? The Financial Services Commission hasn’t publicly specified exact percentage limits in current reports, but the proposed regulation would restrict ownership percentages for major shareholders of digital asset exchanges to prevent excessive control. Q2: Why does the People Power Party oppose these ownership restrictions? The PPP argues that stake limits would blur management responsibility lines, potentially cause capital flight, and represent inappropriate timing since such rules should have been established when South Korea’s crypto market first formed over a decade ago. Q3: How might this regulation affect ordinary cryptocurrency investors in South Korea? Exchange ownership changes could indirectly impact users through potential alterations to platform security practices, token listing decisions, fee structures, and overall market stability, though direct effects would depend on final legislation. Q4: What is the current status of the Digital Asset Basic Act in South Korea? The comprehensive crypto legislation remains under parliamentary review and debate, with the stake limit proposal representing one contentious element within this broader regulatory framework. Q5: How do other countries regulate cryptocurrency exchange ownership? Regulatory approaches vary globally, with the EU focusing on entity authorization, Japan emphasizing internal controls, and the US using state licensing systems, but few major economies impose specific ownership percentage caps like South Korea is considering.

Here’s What It Means for Price,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-forms-bullish-heikin-ashi-candle-heres-what-it-means-for-price/,"XRP has shown an early technical improvement after an extended period of selling pressure, as the asset recently printed its first bullish Heikin-Ashi candle on the daily chart in nearly two weeks. This development has drawn attention from market participants, as it may signal that downward momentum is beginning to weaken following a sharp correction earlier this month. The appearance of the bullish candle follows a significant decline that saw XRP fall from a January 6 high of $2.41 to a new yearly low near $1.80 on January 25. During this period, bearish sentiment dominated price action, with sellers maintaining control across multiple sessions. However, recent trading behavior suggests that the balance between buyers and sellers may be starting to shift. Price Stabilization Emerges After Prolonged Weakness After reaching its recent low, XRP has posted a modest rebound, with the price recovering to approximately $1.90 at the time of writing. While this move remains limited in magnitude, it represents the first sustained attempt at stabilization following weeks of consistent losses. Market commentator CW has pointed out that this recovery aligns with a broader set of technical signals that may indicate an early-stage trend transition rather than a short-lived bounce. A green candlestick appeared in the $XRP Heikin-Ashi candlestick. The trend is reversing. Also, a golden cross on the sub-indicator is imminent. pic.twitter.com/i0r6DHEJoi — CW (@CW8900) January 27, 2026 From January 15 through January 26, XRP recorded twelve consecutive bearish Heikin-Ashi candles, reflecting uninterrupted downside pressure. This sequence highlighted the strength of the prevailing downtrend and the absence of meaningful buyer intervention. The bullish candle printed on January 27 effectively ended this streak, marking the first visible interruption to the pattern of lower prices. Heikin-Ashi charts, which smooth price data by averaging candle values, are often used to identify sustained directional trends. Extended runs of candles in one direction typically indicate strong momentum. As a result, the emergence of a bullish candle after nearly two weeks of consistent declines is technically notable, especially when accompanied by improving momentum indicators. Momentum Indicators Show Signs of Improvement Several commonly used momentum tools are beginning to reflect a shift in market dynamics. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which tracks changes in trend direction and strength, has remained in bearish territory since mid-January. However, recent price action has altered the relationship between its components. The MACD line has started to turn upward while the signal line continues to slope lower, narrowing the gap between the two. If this movement continues, it could result in a bullish crossover, often interpreted as an early signal of trend reversal. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In parallel, the Stochastic Relative Strength Index has rebounded sharply from deeply oversold conditions. After falling from elevated levels earlier in the month, the indicator dropped to approximately 2.12 on January 26. Such readings typically occur during periods of extreme selling pressure. As XRP’s price began to recover, the Stochastic RSI climbed back toward the 20 level, suggesting that bearish momentum may be easing. The traditional Relative Strength Index has also shown improvement. During the January decline, RSI fell from overbought territory to a low near 34.61, reflecting sustained selling activity. Since then, it has risen to around 41.04 and is approaching its moving average, currently near 42.45. A confirmed move above this level would further support the case for strengthening buyer participation. Despite these technical developments, the broader trend has not yet been conclusively reversed. Sustained bullish Heikin-Ashi candles and confirmed indicator crossovers are still required to validate a durable shift in market direction. Without continued follow-through, the current recovery could fail, leaving XRP vulnerable to renewed selling pressure. For now, the data suggests that XRP may be entering a stabilization phase following its recent decline. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The index, a crucial barometer of market psychology, currently holds at a value of 26, firmly entrenched in the “fear” territory. This reading, down three points from the previous day, signals a sustained period of caution among digital asset investors. Market analysts closely track this metric to gauge the emotional temperature of the crypto space, which often moves contrary to rational fundamentals. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 26 The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, provided by data analytics firm Alternative, serves as a composite measure of market sentiment. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 represents “Extreme Fear,” while 100 signifies “Extreme Greed.” The current value of 26 places the market squarely in the “Fear” category. This metric is not a simple survey; it is a data-driven calculation derived from multiple market sources. The index’s methodology provides a structured, quantitative view of the often-irrational forces driving price action. Consequently, a prolonged period in fear territory can sometimes precede market inflection points, as extreme sentiment often reverses. The calculation of the index relies on a weighted blend of six core components. Each component captures a different facet of market behavior and public interest. For instance, market volatility and trading volume together account for 50% of the score, emphasizing the importance of price action and liquidity. Social media sentiment and surveys contribute another 30%, offering a glimpse into the crowd’s psychology. Finally, Bitcoin’s market dominance and Google Trends data for related search terms make up the remaining 20%, contextualizing Bitcoin’s role and overall public curiosity. This multi-factor approach aims to filter out noise and identify the underlying emotional trend. Index Component Weight What It Measures Volatility 25% Price swings and stability of major cryptocurrencies. Market Volume 25% Trading activity and liquidity on major exchanges. Social Media 15% Mentions and sentiment on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys 15% Direct polling of market participant sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Bitcoin’s market share relative to the entire crypto market. Google Trends 10% Search volume for cryptocurrency-related terms. Historical Context and Market Impact of Fear Readings To understand the significance of a reading of 26, one must examine historical data. The index has experienced dramatic swings since its inception. For example, it plummeted to single digits during major market capitulation events, such as the COVID-19-induced crash of March 2020. Conversely, it soared above 90 during the peak euphoria of late 2017 and again in late 2021. A sustained reading in the 20-30 range, as seen currently, typically indicates a market in a state of consolidation or cautious decline. Investors are often hesitant to commit new capital, and selling pressure may outweigh buying interest. This environment frequently follows a significant correction or precedes a period of accumulation by long-term holders. The practical impact of a “fear” reading manifests in several observable market behaviors. Trading volumes often contract as participants move to the sidelines. Furthermore, volatility can increase due to lower liquidity, amplifying price moves in both directions. News flow tends to be interpreted more negatively during these periods. Even neutral or slightly positive developments may fail to generate sustained bullish momentum. Market commentators, including analysts from firms like Glassnode and CoinMetrics, often note that prolonged fear can create a foundation for a healthier, less speculative market advance once sentiment eventually improves. Expert Analysis on Sentiment as a Contrarian Indicator Many seasoned traders and behavioral finance experts treat extreme sentiment readings as potential contrarian indicators. The underlying principle is simple: when fear becomes extreme and ubiquitous, most potential sellers have likely already sold. This dynamic can set the stage for a rebound when a catalyst emerges. However, analysts consistently warn that sentiment is a timing tool, not a valuation tool. A market can remain in fear or greed far longer than fundamentals might suggest. Therefore, professionals rarely use the index in isolation. They combine it with on-chain data, technical analysis, and macroeconomic factors to form a complete market view. The current climate suggests a need for disciplined risk management and selective accumulation of assets with strong fundamentals. The broader financial landscape also influences the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. In 2025, factors such as global interest rate policies, regulatory developments from bodies like the SEC, and traditional equity market performance continue to exert a strong pull on cryptocurrency sentiment. The index’s current level reflects not only internal crypto dynamics but also this interconnected financial reality. As such, monitoring shifts in the index provides insight into how the crypto market is digesting and reacting to wider economic news and geopolitical events. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index holding at 26 offers a clear, data-backed snapshot of prevailing market psychology. It confirms a cautious and fearful environment among cryptocurrency participants. This sentiment stems from a composite of volatility, trading activity, social discourse, and search trends. While historical patterns show that sustained fear can precede market recoveries, it is not a guaranteed signal. Investors and observers should view this tool as one critical piece of a larger analytical puzzle. Understanding the mechanics and history behind the Crypto Fear & Greed Index empowers market participants to navigate emotional extremes with greater discipline and perspective. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 26 mean? A score of 26 indicates the market is in a “Fear” state. This suggests investors are predominantly cautious, anxious, or pessimistic, which often correlates with falling or stagnant prices and reduced speculative activity. Q2: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and how often is it updated? The index is created and maintained by the data provider Alternative.me. It is updated daily, typically based on a 24-hour rolling window of data from its various source components. Q3: Is the index only about Bitcoin? While Bitcoin’s market dominance is a direct input (10% of the score), the index is designed to reflect sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market. Factors like volatility, volume, and social media sentiment encompass the entire digital asset space. Q4: Can the Fear & Greed Index predict market bottoms or tops? The index is best used as a gauge of crowd emotion, not a precise timing tool. Extreme readings (near 0 or 100) have historically coincided with major market turning points, but they do not guarantee an immediate reversal. Markets can remain at extremes for extended periods. Q5: How should a retail investor use this information? Retail investors can use the index as a reality check against their own emotions. A high “Greed” reading might suggest excessive optimism and a time for caution, while a deep “Fear” reading could indicate potential long-term buying opportunities, though thorough individual research remains essential.

57550064,660099,1769646605,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57550064.jpeg,Ethereum And Solana Are Flashing Caution Signals With Negative Buy/Sell Pressure Data – What This Means,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-solana-caution-signal/,"Ethereum and Solana are gradually demonstrating bullish movements following a rebound on Tuesday, but the broader outlook still appears to be bearish. On-chain metrics are flashing caution as selling pressure continues to dominate among investors of ETH and SOL, suggesting an extension of the ongoing volatile market. Market Balance Tilts Bearish For Ethereum And Solana While the broader cryptocurrency market has faced steady downside pressure over the past few weeks, the market dynamics of both Ethereum and Solana are undergoing a crucial shift. This shift is being reflected in the Buy/Sell Pressure Delta for ETH and SOL, which has recently turned negative. The Buy/Sell Pressure Delta is a key metric that measures the imbalance between buying and selling forces in the market. It is worth noting that when the delta goes negative, it indicates a lack of bullish momentum since selling pressure is greater than purchasing pressure. According to Alphractal, an advanced on-chain data analytics platform, the metric flipping negative suggests that Ethereum and Solana sellers are gaining control of the market. With buying momentum currently fading, the risk of short-term downside or consolidation becomes high. This shift typically points to trend exhaustion, not necessarily an immediate reversal. It also points to a cooling phase after periods of stronger momentum and buying activity. In some scenarios from the past, the platform highlighted that a negative Buy/Sell Pressure Delta has also led to price bottoms. However, this is mostly common when selling pressure starts to lose strength again, with capital flows favoring accumulation over distribution. Furthermore, Alphractal noted that for this ongoing trend to signal a potential bottom in Ethereum and Solana prices, it is critical to monitor whether the delta is exhibiting stability or a recovery, rather than expanding further into negative territory. In the meantime, analyzing the lower timeframes would aid in spotting early signs of a shift back toward buying pressure. At this point, it is not a standalone signal, and context matters. Price action, volume, and broader on-chain data must confirm whether the market is transitioning into a period of continuation or accumulation . As this imbalance develops across the two networks, it increases the downside risk and emphasizes how crucial it is to keep an eye on whether demand can stabilize or keep declining in the upcoming sessions. ETH Position Inside A Dense Basis Cluster Ethereum remains capped by the growing volatility across the crypto market, hovering below the $3,000 price mark. After delving into ETH’s recent price action, Chris Beamish has outlined that the leading altcoin is trading on a dense cost basis cluster. The positioning carries significance as it represents a breakeven zone for many ETH holders . As ETH holds this zone, the market is leaning toward absorption and the formation of a base.

Silver’s search interest peaked on Jan. 22. Reports note people were searching for phrases like “Silver price today,” “best crypto,” and “Bitcoin price.” That mix suggests casual users and new traders are toggling between simple how-to queries and price checks, depending on which asset is making headlines. Silver’s Wild Ride Warns Of Hype Santiment’s team pointed to a dramatic move in silver where prices briefly jumped above $117 and then plunged to below $102 within a couple of hours. That kind of swing is a classic sign of strong FOMO followed by fast selling. Retail excitement can lift a price quickly. It can also reverse it just as fast. Many traders who piled in at the peak likely felt the sting when the pullback came. Parallels Between Metals And Crypto Coach JV, a popular XRP commentator, argued that the forces acting on silver and gold could also shape Bitcoin and XRP when the same pressures build in those markets.

With logistical hurdles, such as severe weather , mostly cleared and some of the bill’s more contentious provisions removed, the legislation appears poised to pass Thursday’s committee vote with little disruption. However, other provisions on ethics, consumer protection, governance, and national security could continue to shape the bill’s path as lawmakers begin discussions on whether to send it to the full Senate. There are a few recent surprises: the Senate Agriculture Committee’s markup of the crypto market structure bill should run fairly smoothly. The recent heavy snow that blanketed Washington, D.C., has largely cleared, easing concerns about attendance and missed deliveries. Even more importantly, though, Senators Roger Marshall of Kansas and Dick Durbin of Illinois have indicated they would not pursue a proposed amendment on credit card swipe fees in the markup. Supporters of the crypto bill have embraced that move. Lawmakers advocate for ethics and consumer protections via amendments Markup is expected to last approximately two hours. In this time frame , senators will consider and vote on a few modifications before deciding whether to send the bill to the Senate floor. Although the process may be orderly, the political calculus is not quite certain. It also aims to limit or regulate the use of digital assets by public officials and close relatives, as described in other statements, a provision reflective of broader fears about the role-play of conflicts of interest in emerging markets. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, ranking Democrat on the Agriculture Committee, submitted two amendments. Both proposals would also delay the bill’s passage into law until the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has at least 4 confirmed commissioners. That would involve two appointees from the minority party, who were selected through consultation with the committee’s ranking minority member. Proponents of this move assert that a fully staffed, politically balanced regulator is required to justify the CFTC’s expansion of jurisdiction over crypto markets. Klobuchar’s second amendment concerns retail participation and consumer advocacy. It would expand the meaning of a “retail participant” and define the function of a proposed Digital Commodity Retail Advocate. Rather than merely supervising and overseeing registered intermediaries, the advocate’s role would be more precise, thereby better protecting the average person in the crypto market. National security concerns shape broader crypto debates Security measures were proposed to combat hostile states or other actors using digital asset platforms to compromise economic or national security interests. Ultimately, it is not clear which of these amendments will be debated or passed. Some are to be postponed to expedite the process, and some are to be included to reach wider backing. Meanwhile, activity is also picking up in the Senate Banking Committee. Senators have returned from recess, and cryptocurrency executives have returned from the World Economic Forum in Davos to the United States. It is unclear whether Coinbase’s chief executive officer has made any headway with major bank executives on stablecoin-related yield issues.

57550421,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=904097,1769647273,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57550421.jpeg,Robinhood eyes role in potential SpaceX mega IPO,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/robinhood-eyes-role-in-spacex-mega-ipo/,"Robinhood Markets Inc. is positioning itself as a central retail distribution channel in what could become one of the largest initial public offerings (IPOs) in history — that of spaceflight and satellite giant SpaceX. According to reports published this week, the US‑based online broker is competing with traditional Wall Street banks to secure a significant block of SpaceX shares to sell directly to its millions of retail investors. Reports indicate that Robinhood is in talks to obtain a large allocation of SpaceX stock that it would distribute through its IPO Access platform — a feature designed to let users buy IPO shares ahead of public trading. This move would put Robinhood alongside major investment banks, which typically handle such allocations. Concerning Robinhood’s commitment to acquire a high-level position in the SpaceX IPO, sources close to the situation, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, revealed that the fintech company seeks to secure a large amount of SpaceX’s highly sought-after stock to foster direct engagement with its retail investors with the sale of these shares. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the firm prefers to offer the shares through the Musk-led aerospace firm’s IPO Access platform. This is because the platform will enable users to buy stock at the IPO price before it begins trading in the open market. Robinhood seeks to participate in SpaceX’s significant listing Reports disclosed that Elon Musk’s rocket and satellite company is currently weighing setting aside a large number of shares , particularly for retail investors, citing sources familiar with the situation. Notably, while the listing is anticipated for mid-2026, these sources noted that the timing might change. In response to Robinhood’s efforts, top Wall Street banks responsible for retail allocations during an IPO raised concerns, sparking heated discussions among individuals. Even with these concerns raised, the fintech company, which reported approximately 27 million funded customers on November 30, still upholds its goal of participating in this significant listing. On the other hand, several analysts weighed in on the banks’ concerns. They acknowledged that this move illustrated the retail trading app’s influence on Wall Street over the past ten years with its mobile-first, commission-free trading model. The firm’s efforts also demonstrate that Musk supports retail traders. This allegation aligns with his viral tweet “Stonks,” which he posted on his X account during the meme-stock craze. In the meantime, SpaceX made clear its intention to pursue an IPO that could raise over $30 billion, potentially boosting the company’s valuation to around $1.5 trillion. In light of the company’s strong desire to initiate an IPO, analysts predicted that SpaceX might seek a June listing conveniently scheduled around Musk’s birthday. Moreover, they anticipated that this listing could raise up to $50 billion; if successfully executed, it could mark the largest IPO in history. Some of the leading banks expected to play a crucial role in this process include Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Morgan Stanley. Robinhood’s CEO calls for improved regulatory clarity while SpaceX IPO nears Earlier, a report from a reliable source hinted at the possibility of an IPO for SpaceX, citing Musk’s suggestion of setting the timing. This report further highlighted that this listing process will coincide with a planetary event and his birthday in June. Following this announcement, sources noted that retail traders have been occasionally disregarded in the Initial Public Offering process. To further explain this point for better understanding, they alleged that major firms typically prefer to sell their stock to institutional investors first, before anyone else. Afterwards, these investors set the price before the company goes public. While this situation ignites debates among individuals, recent reports indicate that Vlad Tenev, the CEO of Robinhood, has called for improved regulatory clarity and renewed efforts to effectively back tokenized stocks to prevent another incident such as the “ GameStop freeze.” This news was made public after Tenev shared an X post dated Wednesday, January 28, stating that, “Five years ago today, Robinhood and other brokers had to stop people from buying several popular stocks, especially GameStop, during one of the oddest and most obvious failures in the stock market in recent times.” Get seen where it counts.

57550548,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=266567,1769648111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Altcoin Season Index Surges 7 Points: A Crucial Signal for the 2025 Crypto Market,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/altcoin-season-index-surges-32/,"BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index Surges 7 Points: A Crucial Signal for the 2025 Crypto Market Global cryptocurrency markets witnessed a notable shift on March 21, 2025, as CoinMarketCap’s pivotal Altcoin Season Index climbed seven points to reach a reading of 32. This significant movement provides a crucial, data-driven signal for investors navigating the complex digital asset landscape. The index serves as a primary barometer for identifying whether capital is flowing into Bitcoin or diversifying across the broader altcoin universe. Consequently, this recent jump warrants a detailed examination of its mechanics, historical context, and potential implications for the coming quarter. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index Surge CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index functions as a sophisticated market diagnostic tool. Fundamentally, it measures the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. The calculation specifically excludes stablecoins and wrapped assets to ensure it tracks genuine speculative and investment flows. A reading closer to 100 strongly suggests an altcoin season is underway. This occurs when at least 75% of the monitored altcoins outperform Bitcoin over the previous three months. Conversely, a low reading indicates Bitcoin dominance, where the pioneer cryptocurrency outshines its peers. The seven-point ascent to 32, therefore, represents a meaningful, though not yet decisive, tilt toward altcoin strength. Market analysts immediately scrutinized the underlying data. The increase suggests a growing number of altcoins within the top 100 are beginning to close the performance gap with Bitcoin. This often precedes more pronounced rotational trends. Historically, such movements correlate with increased trading volume across decentralized exchanges and a rise in project-specific developments. For instance, the index’s movement aligns with recent protocol upgrades and mainnet launches scheduled for Q2 2025. This context transforms a simple metric into a narrative about evolving investor confidence and sector rotation. Historical Context and Market Cycle Analysis Understanding the index’s current position requires a review of past crypto market cycles. The Altcoin Season Index last peaked above the critical 75 threshold in late 2023, coinciding with a broad-based rally. Subsequently, the market entered a prolonged period of Bitcoin dominance throughout much of 2024. During that phase, investors favored Bitcoin’s perceived stability amid macroeconomic uncertainty. The current rise from 25 to 32 breaks a multi-month pattern of stagnation. It echoes similar inflection points observed in early 2021 and 2017, where initial altcoin strength eventually cascaded into full-fledged altcoin seasons. The following table compares key index readings and subsequent market phases: Index Reading Market Phase Indicated Typical Investor Behavior 0-25 Strong Bitcoin Season Capital flight to safety, ETF focus 26-50 Transition / Accumulation Early altcoin research, portfolio rebalancing 51-74 Altcoin Momentum Building Increased altcoin allocation, sector betting 75-100 Full Altcoin Season Broad altcoin rallies, high risk appetite This historical lens shows the market currently resides in a transitional accumulation phase. The recent seven-point gain is a momentum signal that active traders and algorithms monitor closely. It does not guarantee an imminent altcoin season, but it reliably flags a change in market structure. Past data indicates that sustained movement above 50 often requires several weeks of consistent altcoin outperformance. Expert Analysis on the Current Shift Financial analysts emphasize the index’s role in risk assessment. “The Altcoin Season Index is a lagging indicator, but its trends are invaluable,” notes a report from a major blockchain analytics firm. “A move of this magnitude in a single day typically reflects coordinated buying pressure across multiple altcoin sectors, not just isolated pumps.” Experts point to concurrent developments driving this shift: Institutional Product Development: New regulated altcoin investment vehicles announced for Q2 2025. Layer-1 & Layer-2 Activity: Several major networks have reported a spike in daily active addresses and total value locked (TVL). Macroeconomic Factors: Changing interest rate expectations can alter capital allocation strategies within crypto. This expert perspective grounds the index movement in tangible on-chain and institutional realities. The analysis avoids speculation, instead linking the metric to verifiable ecosystem growth. The rising index coincides with measurable increases in developer activity and venture funding flowing into altcoin projects, suggesting a foundation beyond mere price speculation. The Mechanics of Market Transitions A rise in the Altcoin Season Index directly results from capital rotation. Investors often take profits from Bitcoin after major rallies and seek higher returns in smaller-cap assets. This process unfolds in stages. Initially, capital flows into large-cap altcoins like Ethereum. Subsequently, it trickles down to mid-cap and finally small-cap projects. The index captures the early phase of this rotation across the top 100 assets. The current increase to 32 suggests this rotation is beginning, albeit cautiously. Monitoring trading volume distribution confirms this trend. Volume share for non-Bitcoin assets has increased proportionally over the past week. Furthermore, the index rise impacts market sentiment indicators. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index often becomes more volatile during such transitions. Investors should note that these phases increase overall market correlation temporarily. Most altcoins tend to move in unison against Bitcoin during a transition, reducing the benefits of diversification until a clear leader emerges. This period demands careful research into project fundamentals rather than momentum chasing alone. The data advises a strategic, not reactive, approach to portfolio management. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index’s seven-point ascent to 32 marks a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency markets in early 2025. This movement signals a potential early-stage rotation of investor interest from Bitcoin toward alternative digital assets. While the index remains below the 75 threshold defining a full altcoin season, its directional shift provides a critical data point for market participants. Historical analysis shows such transitions can develop into sustained trends, though they require confirmation from continued outperformance and fundamental growth. Ultimately, the index serves as an essential tool for gauging market structure, reminding investors that cryptocurrency cycles are driven by measurable capital flows and rotating investor sentiment. FAQs Q1: What exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric created by CoinMarketCap. It tracks whether the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins) are outperforming Bitcoin over a 90-day window. A reading above 75 indicates an altcoin season is active. Q2: Does an index reading of 32 mean it’s time to buy altcoins? Not necessarily. A reading of 32 signals a potential shift in momentum but remains in a transitional zone. It suggests monitoring the trend for consistency and conducting fundamental research on individual projects before making investment decisions. Q3: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? CoinMarketCap updates the Altcoin Season Index daily, providing a near-real-time gauge of market performance dynamics between Bitcoin and major altcoins. Q4: What are the main limitations of this index? The index is a lagging indicator, reflecting past 90-day performance. It also only covers the top 100 assets, potentially missing early trends in smaller-cap cryptocurrencies. It should be used alongside other on-chain and fundamental metrics. Q5: Has a full altcoin season been officially triggered? No. As of March 21, 2025, with the index at 32, a full altcoin season has not been triggered. That official signal requires the index to sustain a reading above 75, indicating 75% of top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over three months.
