This article delves into the potential implications of these moves and explores which cryptocurrencies are poised for significant growth. As market dynamics shift, the outlook for these digital assets offers intriguing possibilities. Aave Price Surge: Month Trends and Key Level Analysis AAVE recorded strong gains with a 60.73% jump over the month and a 48.77% rise over the last six months. A one-week change of 21.38% points to recent vibrant movement, while the price has ranged from $125.84 to $191.06. Growth has been notably vigorous during both the short-term and medium-term periods, reflecting significant bullish sentiment. Price currently sits within a range bordered by support at $87.37 and resistance at $217.80. Bulls have the upper hand, with momentum indicators near 50 and an RSI of 73.06, although no clear trend has emerged. Traders may consider buying near support and monitoring resistance for potential exit points to capitalize on price movements. Ondo Price Analysis Reveals Mixed Trends and Key Levels ONDO prices showed a modest weekly gain of 2.60% but dipped by 4.18% over the past month and fell by 7.10% over the last six months. Price action remained within a range of $0.69 to $1.09, indicating a lack of a strong directional move over these periods. The data highlights a careful performance history with moderate fluctuations and subtle downtrends, lending caution to traders while hinting at potential future movement. Current price levels range from a support near $0.48 to a resistance at $1.27, with a secondary resistance at $1.67. Oscillators and momentum indicators remain close to neutral while bearish signals emerge in moving averages. Trading within these boundaries may benefit from buying near support and considering exits around resistance. Conclusion AAVE has shown strength by breaking its resistance level, signaling potential growth. ONDO , on the other hand, has dipped by breaking its channel support, facing immediate downside pressure. AAVE’s breakout could lead to further bullish momentum, while ONDO needs to reclaim lost support to stabilize. Both coins are at critical junctures that will define their short-term and possibly long-term trajectories. Monitoring these movements is essential to understanding their next steps. The market’s ongoing developments will play a significant role in their directions. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Speaking on Friday’s episode of the Pivot podcast , which he co-hosts, Galloway said Musk had alienated Tesla’s customers, one of his most important assets, by backing a president whose supporters show little interest in electric cars and the broader shift to clean transport. He then pointed to polls that showed Tesla was the 8th most reputable brand in 2021, but it has now fallen to 95th. “He’s alienated the wrong people,” Galloway said. “Three-quarters of Republicans would never consider buying an EV. So he’s cozied up to the people who aren’t interested in EVs.” Galloway went on to list sharp drops in Tesla’s sales across Europe last year, down 59% in France, 81% in Sweden, 74% in the Netherlands, 66% in Denmark, 50% in Switzerland and 33% in Portugal. Musk’s political interference drove away key European EV buyers In recent months, Musk has tried to influence several European political debates, particularly via posts on X. The Guardian reports his interference turned off many European customers, which is a key market for electric vehicles. Moreover, in April, China’s BYD outsold Tesla in Europe for the first time, according to Jato Dynamics, an automotive market intelligence firm. “This has arguably been one of the greatest brand destructions,” Galloway told co-host Kara Swisher. He added, “Tesla was a great brand. He’s alienated his core demographic.” The federal job and spending cuts trace back to Musk’s leadership of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, under Trump’s second term, which began in January. Musk secured that position after his super PAC donated $200 million to Trump’s successful November campaign to return to the White House following his 2020 defeat. Since then, opinion polls have shown widespread disapproval of Musk’s work for Trump. Some studies indicate that a majority of voters dislike how he and DOGE treated federal employees as the department worked through large job reductions. By late April, Tesla reported a 71% drop in profits. On an earnings call with investors, Musk said he would start stepping back from DOGE in May. He told shareholders that the job of getting the government’s “financial house in order is mostly done” and that his “time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly.” Although DOGE claimed it would cut about $160 billion in spending, CBS News reported that Partnership for Public Service estimated in late April that actually carrying out those cuts would itself cost around $135 billion, KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Tech|D.O.G.E|Elon Musk|Tesla,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-25 22:48:07

According to Bloomberg, the pressure is mounting right after President Donald Trump pushed his tax-heavy legislative package through the House last week, causing long-term Treasury yields to spike. But any sense of stability vanished on Friday when Trump posted that he’d impose a 50% tariff on imports from the European Union starting June 1, sending yields down again and exposing just how fragile the market still is. The impact was immediate. The 30-year Treasury yield fell 3 basis points to 5.031%, the 10-year dropped by 4 basis points to 4.509%, and the 2-year edged slightly lower to 3.993%. In the bond market, that’s movement that traders don’t ignore—especially not when it’s caused by social media posts from the Oval Office. Trump’s explanation was: “The European Union has been very difficult to deal with,” he wrote on Truth Social, before adding that the trade negotiations were “going nowhere.” Trump’s tariffs rattle markets as Apple dragged in Things got messier when Trump tossed Apple into the mix, posting that the company would be required to pay a 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured outside the US The stock tumbled, and once again, bond traders ran for safety. Treasury prices climbed as a result, pulling yields lower for the second time in a week that had already seen record-breaking movement. Peter Boockvar, the chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group, weighed in on the administration’s heavy-handed economic tactics, writing, “Capitalism works best when it is left alone as businesses and consumers are left free to trade goods and services at prices agreed upon by both sides… Unfortunately we keep straying from that basic economic concept with a muscled top-down approach.” By Tuesday of the previous week, bond markets were already on edge after Moody’s downgraded the US credit outlook, citing swelling deficits and the rising cost of servicing debt. That decision sent the 30-year yield past 5.1%, a level not seen since 2023, and pushed the 10-year over 4.5%. But the late-week drop—sparked by Trump’s tariff announcements—highlighted how fast the market is responding to political risk instead of economic fundamentals. Economic calendar packed as inflation data looms Markets are closed Monday for Memorial Day, but that’s where the calm ends. Beginning Tuesday, traders will have to process a string of high-impact reports, including new data on durable goods, capital goods, housing prices, and consumer confidence. The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge—core PCE—is due Friday, along with the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey, which has already shown inflation expectations hitting levels not seen in decades. Kathryn Kaminski, chief strategist at AlphaSimplex Group, summed it up: “Fixed income has been really difficult to trend this year as it’s been very back and forth with yields. We need more clarity on many things, including on inflation.” Fed officials will also be all over the calendar. Neel Kashkari from Minneapolis and John Williams from New York are speaking Tuesday. On Wednesday, Tom Barkin (Richmond), Austan Goolsbee (Chicago), Mary Daly (San Francisco), Lorie Logan (Dallas), and Adriana Kugler from the Fed Board will all make public remarks. Goolsbee returns on Thursday. Also on the radar are bond auctions. Tuesday will see auctions for 6-, 13-, and 26-week bills, and two-year notes. On Wednesday, the Treasury will offer 17-week bills, floating-rate notes, and five-year notes. Thursday wraps with 4- and 8-week bills and seven-year notes. Traders have little breathing room. With Trump back in the White House, tariffs back on the table, and inflation data waiting at the end of the week, the Treasury market is once again running hot. Everyone in the game is watching for numbers, watching for posts, and trying to price in what’s coming next. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The announcement followed a phone call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who had asked for extra time to reach an agreement. BREAKING: President Trump says he received a call from the President of the EU Commission asking for the 50% tariff deadline to be move to July 9th, and it was his ""privilege to do so."" pic.twitter.com/p7cP4ADVe2 — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) May 25, 2025 “We had a very nice call, and I agreed to move it,” Trump told reporters Sunday while flying back to Washington. Earlier Sunday, von der Leyen posted on X that “Europe is ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively,” but stressed that “a good deal” will need “time until July 9.” That date marks the end of the 90-day negotiation period during which the EU had been spared from the 20 percent tariffs Trump first announced in April. The 50% tariffs are here to stay, nonetheless Last Friday, the president warned he would raise the tariffs to 50 percent if he did not see faster progress. He accused the bloc of dragging its feet on talks and of targeting U.S. firms with lawsuits and extra regulations. The higher tariff threat would affect about $321 billion in U.S.-EU goods trade. According to calculations by Bloomberg Economics, it could shave nearly 0.6 percent off U.S. gross domestic product and lift prices by more than 0.3 percent. In response to Trump’s warning, the EU last week put forward a fresh trade offer, and its trade chief, Maroš Šefčovič, spoke by phone on Friday with his U.S. counterpart, Jamieson Greer. That move was part of Brussels’ effort to show willingness to compromise ahead of the looming tariff deadline. Also on Friday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News, “I would hope that this would light a fire under the EU,” referring to the higher tariff threat. A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, complained that the EU had not shown the same level of engagement as other trading partners. “We just haven’t seen anything material come out of the EU,” the official said. The Treasury and Commerce departments did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “I’m not looking for a deal,” Trump said at the White House on Friday. “We’ve set the deal — it’s at 50 percent.” If the 50 percent tariffs were to take effect on June 1, Brussels would have to decide whether to retaliate. The EU has already readied a €21 billion package of counter-tariffs on American goods such as maize, wheat, motorcycles, and clothing. It is also weighing an additional list worth €95 billion that would target items including Boeing aircraft, cars, and bourbon whiskey.

With enhanced transaction speeds and improved cost efficiency, Injective reinforced its role as a key player among the top cryptos to join now. However, its price still lags behind competitors like Solana, and analysts remain cautious about immediate price jumps.

Market analysts are buzzing with speculation about these altcoins. Several factors could be at play, driving potential growth. Delving deeper into these dynamics might reveal why these cryptocurrencies are capturing attention. Find out which coins are poised for a surge and what could be fueling their rise. VeChain Market Snapshot and Key Levels Last month recorded a gain of 3.02% paired with a modest week increase of 0.77%, while the six-month performance shows a drop of 31.35%. VET ’s recent movement reveals short-term resilience contrasted by longer-term pressure. Price action during this period stayed within a confined range, hinting at cautious optimism amid overall downward momentum. VeChain trades between $0.0189 and $0.0303 with immediate resistance at $0.0352 and support near $0.0123. Indicators show a mixed outlook with a neutral RSI at 50.21 and minimal momentum. The market lacks a clear trend, suggesting traders might consider buying around support while monitoring resistance as prices test these levels. Upward Movement in Sei Amid Long-Term Decline Sei recorded a 9.02% increase over the past month, marking a recovery from a significant 66.31% drop in the last six months. Price action has been volatile, showcasing a rebound that slightly closed the gap from previous lows. Despite these short-term gains, the long-term bearish trend continues to affect overall sentiment. Indicators have demonstrated a tough road for the coin, where upward movements have not fully compensated for the steep decline experienced over the longer period. Currently, price sits between $0.15 and $0.24, with resistance levels at $0.28 and $0.37. Support hovers around $0.10. Bears are currently in control, as moving averages suggest potential further declines despite neutral oscillators. Traders might find opportunities to buy near support while monitoring for a breakout above resistance before making larger commitments. Conclusion VET and SEI could experience significant movement next week. Observing recent patterns and market sentiment around these coins reveals an upward potential. Strong fundamentals and positive announcements might drive interest and investment. It's essential to keep an eye on their performance, as both are showing signs of readiness for major shifts.

While ETH’s stability serves as a reliable anchor for the broader market, attention is increasingly turning toward early-stage projects that offer the potential for outsized returns. In this environment, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the standout contender for those seeking to capitalize on the next wave of crypto growth. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Momentum and 50x Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the spotlight as the breakout presale of 2025, with Stage 8 nearing completion and over $8 million already raised from a diverse base of participants. The project’s capped token supply and HashEx-audited contracts provide a foundation of trust and scarcity, while its politically charged narrative is fueling unprecedented demand. Investors can take advantage of a 50% token bonus by using the PATRIOT50X code before the $0.007 listing target. Analysts are now projecting returns as high as 50x, with some models suggesting even greater upside if current momentum continues. This combination of structural integrity and analyst-backed forecasts is positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as the premier early-stage opportunity for transformative gains. Ethereum (ETH): Stability and Institutional Confidence Ethereum’s technical indicators remain robust, with support at $2,400 and resistance at $2,900. Analysts anticipate that ETH will continue to test higher levels if bullish sentiment persists, though its upside is seen as steady rather than explosive when compared to early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Institutional inflows and ongoing upgrades further solidify Ethereum’s position as a core holding for diversified portfolios. XRP, TON, and Solana: Steady Growth and Ecosystem Strength XRP is trading near $2.35, with analysts forecasting a move toward $2.85–$3.40 in the near term. TON has surged to $6.45, propelled by growing NFT activity and Telegram’s expanding ecosystem. Solana is consolidating between $158 and $177, with technical indicators pointing to a potential breakout above $175. While all three assets offer solid fundamentals and growth prospects, none currently match the early-stage momentum and analyst-backed projections now surrounding MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Ethereum’s steady trajectory signals market maturity, but the most compelling opportunity for outsized gains lies with MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearly complete, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 50x ROI, MAGA is the breakout contender for 2025. For those seeking the next transformative crypto story, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands as the clear early-stage magnet—don’t miss the chance to be part of what could be the year’s defining crypto opportunity.

The South Korean media outlet Edaily quoted Min Byoung-dug, a lawmaker for the Democratic Party and the chairman of the party’s Digital Asset Committee, as stating that stablecoins could soon become an industry on an equal footing with AI or semiconductors. Min said: “South Korean is an internet powerhouse. We need to take the lead in institutionalizing stablecoins before US dollar-based stablecoins become firmly established. That is the only way we can secure a sure position in the global battle for stablecoin hegemony.” The Democratic Party lawmaker Min Byoung-dug. (Source: EDaily Issue Maker/YouTube/Screenshot) KRW Stablecoin Rollout: The Time Is Now Min added that he thought the potential for stablecoin adoption in the payments space was “limitless.” He explained: “We should not just sit back and watch it grow into a powerful new future industry on the scale of AI or semiconductors.” Min is a close Lee ally and an open advocate of crypto regulation reform. He has also previously called for tax parity between South Korean stock traders and crypto investors . Lee has repeatedly promised to launch a state-backed KRW stablecoin in response to the rapid rise of USD-pegged coins like USDT and USD Coin (USDC) . The frontrunner, who leads his closest rival Kim Moon-soo (People Power Party) in the polls by almost 10%, has called for Seoul to “enter the stablecoin market quickly.” 이재명 46.6% 김문수 37.6% 이준석 10.4%…엇갈린 서울·PK 민심 https://t.co/ULLVbHi5CQ — JTBC 뉴스 (@JTBC_news) May 24, 2025 Latest poll has Lee on 46.6%, Kim on 37.6%, and Reform Party leader Lee Jun-seok on 10.4%. Lee has warned that delaying the launch of such a coin could lead to further capital flight from the country . Min echoed Lee’s calls, telling EDaily that Seoul “must expedite the institutionalization of stablecoins.” He explained that South Korea “should not fall behind as the use of stablecoins rapidly increases, particularly in the United States.” USDT, USDC Dominance Min noted the fact that USDT and USDC “account for 90% of the stablecoin market in the United States.” He also claimed that USD-pegged coins “are already being used in some parts of Korea, such as Dongdaemun Market, where many foreign payments are made.” Source: Dune Min’s comments about Dongdaegmun Market, Seoul’s biggest clothing and textiles market, may be seen as contentious. Posters on popular South Korean crypto forums last year claimed that “mass USDT adoption” was underway at Dongdaemun, with Chinese buyers particularly keen on the coin. However, Dongaemun traders have told both Cryptonews.com and South Korean media outlets that cash, not crypto, is still king at the market . Regardless, Min said that rapid adoption at home and overseas means Seoul risks being left out in the cold. He said that if USDT and USDC continue to gain popularity worldwide, the space a won-based stablecoin could fill “will inevitably diminish.” DPK's Lee Jae-myung urges 'judgment of insurrection forces,' pledges policies to boost stock market https://t.co/NdPe030YSR — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) May 25, 2025 Could Lawmakers Act Before June 3 Elections? Min claimed that a won-based stablecoin could gain global attention and drive up global demand for won-related assets, such as the government bonds underpinning a KRW stablecoin. The lawmaker said that fans of South Korean webtoons (web-based comics) could be among the first overseas users. Readers may use a won-based stablecoin to buy webtoons, Min said. Min added that he is already pushing for the National Assembly to approve stablecoin legislation. The DP has a large majority in the house going into the elections. And with the nation essentially rudderless following the impeachment earlier this year of former President Yoon Suk-yeol, the party may yet decide to push ahead with such a bill before the June 3 elections. Min has already unveiled a private member’s bill named the Basic Act on Digital Assets, prepared with the aid of industry experts. The lawmaker said of the draft law: “I plan to submit the bill to the National Assembly after another review.” The post South Korea’s Biggest Party Urges ‘Expedited KRW Stablecoin Rollout’ appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|South Korea|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT|USDC,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-25 23:30:00

However, the real story is unfolding elsewhere: MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly outshining both in daily trading volume and community momentum, capturing the attention of both retail and institutional traders. With time running out before its presale closes, MAGA is positioning itself as the breakout contender for the year, while Cardano, Litecoin, and Bitcoin remain essential components of diversified portfolios. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Volume Surge, Scarcity, and Breakout Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the pace for early-stage altcoins in 2025, with daily volume and presale momentum eclipsing even the most established names. Here’s why traders and analysts are calling MAGA the next big crypto story: Unprecedented Volume Growth: Daily trading volume has surged, outpacing Solana and XRP in early-stage activity, as both retail and institutional buyers rush to secure their positions before the presale closes. Scarcity-Driven Model: With a capped 100 billion token supply and structured distribution, MAGA is designed for supply squeezes that historically drive explosive price gains. Viral Narrative and Community Power: The project’s politically charged, socially viral narrative has energized a passionate community, fueling organic growth and repeat buying activity. Analyst-Backed Upside: Recent forecasts project 30x–36x returns, with some models suggesting even higher upside if momentum continues. Price targets near $0.007 at listing signal massive potential for early entrants. Limited-Time Bonus: Early participants can still claim a 50% token bonus using the PATRIOT50X promo code before the $0.007 listing, making MAGA the go-to allocation for those seeking transformative gains. As each stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is not just following the market—it’s leading its own breakout cycle, with time running out for those who want to secure a ground-floor entry. Solana and XRP: Steady but Outpaced Solana remains a leader in DeFi and NFT ecosystems, with strong on-chain growth and institutional interest. XRP continues to benefit from regulatory clarity and ETF speculation, with whale accumulation signaling long-term confidence. However, both are seeing more measured upside compared to the explosive momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE, as their larger market caps limit short-term multiple expansion. Cardano (ADA): Gradual Progress, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Cardano is trading near $0.85, with forecasts suggesting a move toward $1.00–$1.30 by year-end if sentiment holds. While ADA’s fundamentals are solid, its near-term returns are modest compared to the presale-driven surge of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin (BTC): Stability and Market Anchor Litecoin is consolidating above $90, with technicals hinting at a bullish continuation toward $100–$110. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is holding firm above $108,000, serving as the market’s anchor and a core holding for long-term portfolios. Both offer stability, but their upside is outpaced by the rapid accumulation and momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion Solana and XRP remain essential assets, but the most dramatic growth potential is now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With daily volume surging, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 36x ROI, MAGA is the breakout altcoin to watch as time runs out for early entry.

In a recent tweet by Emelie, a popular XRP proponent, the blockchain behemoth Ripple was live on FOX News on screen. The influencer shared a screenshot of the firm’s logo covering the screen with a title, “Dems Trying to Derail Groundbreaking Crypto Bill.” BREAKING NEWS: #XRP LIVE ON FOX NEWS! pic.twitter.com/dOXDJUffGp — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 25, 2025 As expected, the post quickly gained thousands of impressions from the XRP Army. Many community members were pleased to see Ripple at this notable level. A supposed community member termed this a buy signal, while another said XRP will be promoted globally. Latest On the Groundbreaking Crypto Bill The Senate has advanced legislation aimed at regulating the stablecoin market despite concerns that the bill could help President Donald Trump and his family become richer from their crypto ventures. A few days ago, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the procedural vote by 66 to 32, with two senators abstaining. Recall that White House officials have discredited conflict of interest fears in the president’s burgeoning cryptocurrency activities during his second term. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Regulating stablecoins, digital assets whose value is tied to another asset, most especially the U.S. dollar, has been touted by supporters of the bill as a crucial step towards wider oversight of the crypto market, and one that will strengthen U.S. innovation in the industry. However, concerns over gaps in the bill’s safeguards brought about fierce objections from Democrats. Some, especially Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, argued it would boost Trump’s chances of corruption by “supercharging the size of the stablecoin market.” What’s Next for the GENIUS Act? The bill still has a long way to go before final passage. That vote may likely come after the Memorial Day recess. And serious political risks remain.

It’s wide, painful, and according to Jim Cramer, downright “hideous.” Speaking on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street on SUnday, Jim said, “The money keeps going to these European stocks. And it’s rather amazing.” The DAX in Germany is up 19% so far this year. The S&P 500? Down more than 1%. President Donald Trump kicked off the latest round of market instability on April 2, when he announced “reciprocal” tariffs that rattled investor confidence. That same week, the bond market got hit too. Yields spiked as inflation worries grew. Tech giants like Apple and Nvidia tanked, dragged down by their global supply chain exposure and China-related revenue streams. On April 9, Trump paused certain country-specific tariffs, but left China out. That made things worse for companies deeply tied to Chinese markets. Trump’s trade moves worsen investor fears Just when things were beginning to cool off, Trump piled on more pressure. On May 12, trade tensions between China and the US eased slightly, but it didn’t last. That Friday, Trump pushed for a 25% tariff on phones not made in the United States, calling out Apple, Samsung, and others directly. Hours later, he floated a 50% tariff on European Union imports, scheduled to start June 1. Markets had no time to digest the chaos. That same evening—May 16—Moody’s dropped its rating on US government debt by one notch, matching Fitch’s downgrade from August 2023 and Standard & Poor’s 2011 cut. The original S&P downgrade crushed stocks. The Fitch downgrade hurt, but less. This time, markets barely moved, but bond yields jumped. On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield rose above 4.6% before pulling back slightly. Stocks stayed flat, but the bond market was shaken. Jim pointed out a key difference between now and previous crises. “What’s happening that didn’t happen then is there is an alternative,” he said . That alternative is Europe, which right now is attracting capital with cheaper stocks, more flexible rate policies, and stronger year-to-date returns. Wall Street reacts as Europe pulls ahead Even Barclays admitted that the “end of US exceptionalism” might be Europe’s moment. The European Central Bank has more space to cut rates. Their stocks are valued lower. Investors are taking note. In a May research note, KKR explained that institutional money is eyeing exits from the United States. “Many CIOs are considering moving assets out of the United States towards other parts of the world,” the firm said. But they also warned it’s not that easy. The US stock market is still twice the size of Europe, Japan, and India combined. KKR reminded clients that many American companies are large, liquid, and still generating strong returns on capital. Jim doesn’t believe in abandoning US stocks either. During last week’s Monthly Meeting, he listed six stocks he’s watching to buy if prices fall, and named five that worry him. At the top of his concern list? Apple. Even before Trump’s latest tariff threats, he was already nervous about the tech giant’s exposure. “There are tons of stocks I would like to buy if the prices come down,” he said. In his May 11 column, Jim talked about what he saw in Europe firsthand. “They are crushing it with stock performance that is outstanding, in many cases backed up by earnings,” he wrote. He said the US isn’t holding up. “America is hideously underperforming,” he wrote, comparing the US to its “European cousins.” He also described Europe as “safer and more predictable,” adding that markets there “can continue to climb given the momentum.” Jim says he doesn’t like the “sell America” approach. He said investors should be adjusting—not exiting. During his April 3 episode of Mad Money , right after Trump’s first tariff wave, he advised people to buy different stocks and cut exposure to riskier ones. He’s looking for domestic companies that won’t collapse during a slowdown. His ideal picks? Companies with pricing power, strong demand, low credit risk, and resilience even when the economy slips. While some investors are drawn to international markets, they may already have that exposure without realizing it. Many S&P 500 companies generate a large share of their revenue abroad, which means US stocks are more globally tied than most people think.

But that figure overshoots by a long shot — more than five times the number of employees US Steel currently has in the United States. The number raised eyebrows, not because it was big, but because nobody — not Nippon, not the unions, not the investors — can figure out where the hell he got it from. According to Bloomberg, after over 17 months of negotiations, Nippon Steel believed it had finally secured the $14.1 billion takeover of US Steel, but Trump’s statement muddied the waters. He didn’t actually say the buyout was approved. He just declared that US Steel would “remain American.” That line, dropped on social media, landed hard and fast. Yet, he gave no specifics, no follow-up from the White House, and no timeline for next steps. Companies scramble for clarity as shares surge Publicly, both Nippon Steel and US Steel cheered what they called a “bold” moment and embraced the idea of a new partnership. But neither addressed the actual takeover deal. US Steel’s stock, meanwhile, jumped as much as 26% in Friday trading and closed 21% higher at $52.01, even though the company had already agreed to a $55 per share buyout in cash back in December 2023. Trump’s approval, if that’s even what it was, contradicts his own words from December, when he wrote that he was “totally against the once great and powerful US Steel being bought by a foreign company.” At the time, that rare stance put him in line with Joe Biden, who blocked the deal in January on the advice of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Suddenly pivoting now raises real questions about how far Trump is willing to go to appease Japan, especially while both countries are deep in tariff talks. Last week, Ryosei Akazawa, Japan’s top trade negotiator, met in Washington with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. A few days earlier, Trump had a call with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The two agreed to meet in Canada next month during the G7 leaders’ summit. The timing is everything. The tariff issue is boiling. Japan is facing a 25% tariff on cars, steel, and aluminum, plus a 10% duty on all other goods that could rise to 24% in July if there’s no new trade deal. Car companies like Toyota have already flagged billions in profit losses, and Ishiba’s government is staring at a possible recession after last quarter’s contraction. Union rejects deal while confusion grows over future ownership Akazawa, speaking to reporters on Friday, refused to comment on the steel situation, saying they’d wait for an official statement. On tariffs, he acknowledged the June meeting but stressed, “It’s unwise to rush any agreement.” He’s expected to return to Washington on May 30 to meet Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who’s been involved in the last two rounds of negotiations. While Japan pushes for answers, the workers on the ground in America remain skeptical. The United Steelworkers union, which oversees labor at US Steel’s major integrated plants across the Rust Belt, isn’t sold on any of this. Their president, David McCall, said from the beginning that Nippon Steel didn’t consult with the union before announcing the deal. He’s not buying their promises now either. “Their ‘promise’ is always made with exceptions to back out of the statements,” McCall said in a text message this week. “Nothing makes me think this one is anything but another desperate attempt.” That “attempt” includes maintaining plants that are decades old, run on high-cost systems, and will need serious investment to stay open. Advocates of the deal say Nippon Steel will fix them up, bring in new tech, and upgrade capacity. But again, they haven’t said how much they’d spend or when they’d start. Nippon, for its part, called the partnership “a game changer” in a brief statement, saying it benefits US Steel, the American steel industry, and the broader manufacturing base. But investors want more than slogans. And so far, that’s all they’ve been handed.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) brought together its ten member states in an attempt to protect their economies, just as Trump’s White House ramps up duties on exports from the region. According to information provided by Bloomberg, the talks are focused on getting ahead of the fallout caused by Trump’s latest tariff decisions. China sent Premier Li Qiang to lead its delegation. Gulf Cooperation Council countries including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates are also in the room. But not a single official from the U.S. or its Western allies showed up. China’s presence grows as U.S. skips meeting For Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, hosting this summit is about drawing in trade from nations sitting on big cash surpluses. With China warning other countries not to sign deals that might hurt its interests, Asean leaders are walking a thin line between two superpowers. “There is no substitute for the United States,” said Shahriman Lockman, an analyst at the Institute of Strategic and International Studies in Malaysia. “Yes, we talk about diversification and autonomy. But let’s not kid ourselves — there is no real alternative in sight.” Still, trade numbers show that the U.S. is already falling behind. China’s trade with Asean hit $982.3 billion in 2024, while the U.S. only managed $476.8 billion, most of it imports from the region. That gap is now at the center of every private conversation inside the summit hall. Recent visits by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia included pitches for what he called an “Asian family,” a message aimed directly at countering the U.S. push to isolate China. Meanwhile, Indonesia joined the BRICS bloc earlier this year, and Malaysia, Vietnam, and Thailand have all been added as partner nations. That deepens economic ties with both China and Russia, giving Southeast Asia more options if Trump’s tariffs grow even harsher. Trade talks and regional conflicts collide at summit At the summit, Malaysia’s Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil told reporters the country is open to doing business with anyone. “I see this as a very good opportunity for us to show that Malaysia is a neutral country that wants to trade with any country that would like to trade with us,” he said. Inside the U.S., officials from several Southeast Asian countries are trying to negotiate with Trump’s administration one-on-one to avoid the steepest tariffs. A bloc approach, led by Malaysia, was already rejected, according to local media. The hope is that separate deals could still buy them time. But those efforts are shaky. Singapore’s Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong said Asean is working to improve an existing trade agreement. Though over 90% of goods in the region already move tariff-free, Gan admitted that wouldn’t be enough. “These are encouraging, but it doesn’t mean that the trouble is over,” he said. Asean also just wrapped up negotiations with China to upgrade their free trade agreement. The new version includes chapters on crypto-related digital sectors, clean energy, and small and medium-sized businesses, all of which are expected to boost cross-border movement of both money and services. But trade isn’t the only thing being discussed. The military crisis in Myanmar is getting attention too. Leaders plan to hold side talks on how to deal with the country’s civil war, which has dragged on with no resolution. There’s also pressure on Anwar to say something about the war in Gaza. He said last week he would “probably touch on” the issue and call for a ceasefire, while using the summit to point out the growing divide between richer nations and developing countries in the Global South. That said, expectations are low. Gregory Poling, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told reporters: “Despite rhetoric from the Malaysian government as chair, there has been very little evidence of an Asean effort here. The stakes are actually pretty low.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",News|Asia|China|tariffs,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-25 23:57:10

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 318,700 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum appears to be in the midst of a five-wave rally on the four-hour chart. Bluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to witness a five-wave surge before going through a correction. The analyst predicts that Ethereum will still hit his upside target of $3,500 even though President Trump’s latest tariff threats are weighing down markets. “Despite the trump tariff tantrum which happened legit 10 minutes after I went to sleep, I think ETH still looks ok and going to assume a range here.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $2,478. The analyst is also bullish on the Ethereum-based memecoin SPX6900 ( SPX ). Bluntz thinks that SPX is now in an uptrend and en route to a new all-time high of $2.30 by October of this year. “Bid some SPX. Going to try and hold for all-time high.” Source: Bluntz/X SPX refers to the S&P 500 index, which satirically aspires to “topple the S&P 500 by achieving a staggering $69 trillion market cap.” Fellow crypto strategist Jack is also bullish on SPX, thinking that the memecoin will skyrocket if the S&P 500 itself explodes to a new all-time high. “Since nothing makes sense anyway, it is probably a good bet to own SPX6900 if SPX motors to all-time high, because well obviously SPX going to 6900 will capture mindshare and apparently that is, besides just liquidity beta, what people will argue why SPX6900 goes up.

While BTC’s resilience and institutional inflows provide a stable foundation, the real intrigue is unfolding beneath the surface: MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly capturing the attention of major crypto whales and analysts, positioning itself as the breakout early-stage contender for 2025. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Momentum and Whale Accumulation MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the dominant presale of the year, with Stage 8 nearly full and over $8 million raised as demand accelerates. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling unprecedented accumulation from both retail and institutional buyers. On-chain data confirms a recent 72.95 ETH whale buy—valued at over $133,000—marking the largest single early-stage crypto purchase of 2025. This level of whale activity signals deep conviction and strategic positioning before listings go live. Analysts are projecting returns of 25x to 35x, with some models suggesting even higher upside if momentum continues. As each stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is solidifying its reputation as the top early-stage opportunity for those seeking transformative gains before the next wave of price discovery. Bitcoin (BTC): Market Anchor and Institutional Support Bitcoin remains the market’s anchor, trading above $108,000 with forecasts for a possible move to $118,000–$131,000 if bullish momentum returns. Institutional inflows and ETF demand continue to support BTC’s long-term outlook, but its upside from current levels is seen as more measured, prompting many investors to diversify into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Consolidation and Rotating Capital XRP is consolidating near $2.45, buoyed by regulatory clarity and ETF speculation. While XRP’s fundamentals remain strong and whale accumulation continues, its price action has become more range-bound. Analysts forecast a move toward $2.85–$3.40 in the coming weeks, but the most aggressive capital is now rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper, asymmetric returns. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Steady Growth, MAGA Outpaces NEAR Protocol is trading around $3.07, with forecasts suggesting a move toward $3.85–$5.18 by year-end. While NEAR’s ecosystem continues to expand and its technicals remain positive, its near-term upside is more modest compared to the explosive presale-driven momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL): Technical Strength, MAGA Leads Solana is consolidating between $158 and $175, with technicals pointing to a potential breakout above $175. The network’s high throughput and expanding DeFi ecosystem continue to attract users and developers. While Solana’s outlook is optimistic, its growth is steady compared to the rapid accumulation and analyst-backed projections now surrounding MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Bitcoin’s stability and Solana’s technical strength are impressive, but the most compelling upside is quietly unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE . With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 35x ROI, MAGA stands as the breakout contender for 2025.

He made the announcement late Sunday, pushing the original June 1 deadline to July 9. Data from Bloomberg shows that this delay instantly lifted US equity-index futures, reversing some of the damage done Friday when Trump had first dropped the threat. S&P 500 futures jumped 0.9% and Nasdaq 100 futures went up about 1% after the announcement. That bounce followed a rough close to last week when those same contracts dropped sharply in response to Trump’s tariff warning. Before the extension, futures for Japan, Australia, and Hong Kong had already been trading lower in early Asia sessions, echoing the Friday mood on Wall Street. Trump threats drag gold down, lift the dollar Trump’s Friday move wasn’t just about the EU. He also said he’d slap a 25% tariff on smartphones if companies like Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. didn’t start producing inside the US. That aggressive talk didn’t go unnoticed. The dollar, which had just sunk to its lowest point since December 2023, climbed early Monday. At the same time, the yen and Swiss franc, which had surged on Friday’s uncertainty, both retreated. Gold didn’t hold up either. The metal had gained 1.9% on Friday from traders looking for safety, touching $3,357 per ounce, but by Monday, spot gold was down 0.3% at $3,346.89/oz. Analysts said that even though the delay lowered short-term panic, concerns are still high over the US fiscal position. Those fears got worse after Moody’s Ratings took away the US’s top-tier credit grade this month, citing Trump’s latest tax bill that passed the House of Representatives last week and is now with the Senate. Meanwhile, the Treasury market showed little movement Friday. Yields had shot up earlier in the week as traders tried to figure out how much damage Trump’s new tax breaks might do to the national debt. Treasuries were closed Monday for a US holiday, giving investors a brief pause ahead of more data. The next big report comes Friday when the Federal Reserve releases its preferred inflation metric, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (excluding food and energy). Economists are looking for a 0.1% rise for April. US Steel deal, Japan negotiations, and shipping worries Friday also brought a curveball: Trump announced a deal between United States Steel Corp. and Japan’s Nippon Steel Corp.. The move stunned traders. Trump said the agreement would help keep US Steel in America, but gave no further details. Still, it was enough to send US Steel shares up 21.2%. Meanwhile, Nippon Steel’s ADRs rose 1.7%. Japanese stocks may stay volatile. After Trump’s comments, the yen weakened, which tends to support local exporters. But anxiety over Europe and Apple’s exposure remains. Shoji Hirakawa, chief global strategist at Tokai Tokyo Intelligence Lab, said Monday, “Japanese stocks are likely to start lower today due to concerns over tariffs on Europe and Apple, but the decline is expected to gradually narrow.” The Nikkei 225 futures touched 37,210 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, slightly higher than the last close of 37,160.47. Behind the scenes, Japan’s top trade officials are trying to close out negotiations before Trump sits down with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in June. Hirakawa also said, “Given that tariffs negotiations between Japan and the US are ongoing, it’s clear that compared to two months ago, the situation is moving toward a resolution. Stocks could turn positive.” Capital Economics thinks Trump might be bluffing. “At this stage, we are not inclined to change our working assumption that tariffs on the EU will ultimately settle around 10%, but this underlines that there are risks and that the road to an agreement could be rocky.” Back in Europe, there are signs that the ongoing trade drama is already starting to jam up major shipping ports. Some northern European hubs are facing rising congestion, which could push global shipping costs higher if the tariff threats continue into the summer. On the data front, Asia is set to release several numbers this week: Singapore’s industrial production, Hong Kong’s trade figures, and South Korea’s retail sales—all expected between now and Saturday. Traders are watching those closely as they gauge how the region is holding up under the weight of ongoing US policy moves. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Trump made the remarks to reporters on Sunday in New Jersey, just before boarding Air Force One. He appeared increasingly annoyed with Russian President Vladimir Putin and dismayed by stalled negotiations aimed at securing a ceasefire in Ukraine. “I’m not happy with what Putin is doing,” Trump said. “He’s killing a lot of people, and I don’t know what the hell happened to Putin. I’ve known him a long time—always gotten along with him—but he’s sending rockets into cities and killing people, and I don’t like it at all.” Ukrainian officials reported that at least 12 people died in the overnight air raids. The attacks prompted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to renew his appeal for stricter penalties against Moscow. The bombardment also took place amid a third day of prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine, underscoring the conflict’s complex, ongoing human toll. Trump repeatedly asked what had happened to Putin. “We’re in the middle of talking, and he’s shooting rockets into Kyiv and other cities,” he said. “I don’t like it at all.” Until now, the focus of U.S. pressure had fallen mostly on Zelenskiy to find a path to peace, even as Russia’s full-scale invasion that began in February 2022 continues to exact a heavy price. Earlier this month, Trump had shown reluctance to ramp up sanctions on the Kremlin. But he suggested new measures could target Russia’s oil trade or its state-owned oil giant, Rosneft. Russia already faces sanctions from the European Union and the United Kingdom. Earlier last week, Britain unveiled a sweeping package of sanctions against Russia’s military, energy, and financial sectors. The measures, coordinated with the EU, came in response to the largest drone assault of the war over the past weekend, which struck multiple Ukrainian cities. London said its latest sanctions hit 100 new targets. These include networks that supply Russia’s Iskander missiles, Kremlin-backed information operations, and financial outfits that help Moscow sidestep existing penalties. “We urge [President Vladimir Putin] to agree a full, unconditional ceasefire right away so there can be talks on a just and lasting peace,” UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said. Lammy added that any delay in peace efforts would only strengthen Britain’s resolve to back Ukraine’s defense and tighten sanctions on Russia’s war machine. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, together with leaders of major EU nations, has called on Washington to join in imposing harsher penalties on Moscow for refusing to halt hostilities. Among the British measures is a new round of sanctions on the Social Design Agency, a Kremlin-linked disinformation group first blacklisted in 2024. London described it as a body that sought to stir unrest in European countries. Forty-six financial institutions accused of helping Russia dodge existing sanctions were also targeted. Notable entities include the St. Petersburg Currency Exchange and the Russian Deposit Insurance Agency, which underwrites Russian banks. Eighteen additional vessels were added to the blacklist. These ships form part of Russia’s so-called “shadow fleet,” which is used to circumvent Western restrictions and keep its crude exports flowing. Finally, Britain said it is working with international partners to drive down the $60-per-barrel cap on the price Russia can fetch for its oil when using services, like insurance and shipping, from major industrial nations.

It pledged transparency , making it easier for regulators, exchanges, and compliance teams to spot fraud and other illegal activities on the platform. But what began as a basic form of on-chain oversight has evolved into a powerful weapon that savvy players now use to influence markets and even target individual users. Wallet data fuels both innovation and exploitation Many firms, such as Chainalysis, Arkham Intelligence, and Nansen, have turned blockchain data analysis into a thriving industry. These companies convert raw, bewildering onchain data into high-resolution weapons-grade surveillance. Originally designed for compliance, fraud detection, and law enforcement, these are now generally available for broader market usage. Wallet intelligence is regularly used by traders for predictive trading strategies , expecting the moves before they come up. Regulators use it to help enforce KYC (Know Your Customer) rules and fight criminal activity like money laundering. Exchanges can use it to watch for sketchy behavior — and even censor transactions they find too risky. But this visibility boom comes with danger. The knowledge available in a wallet can be good or bad. On the one hand, it also adds accountability; on the other, it puts users at the mercy of control and manipulation. Wallet data can be manipulated to move markets, suppress points of view, and reframe narratives — some of that manipulation occurs behind the closed doors of opacity and without transparency. Crypto’s privacy promise unravels under watchful eyes The whole point of cryptocurrency was privacy and freedom from centralization. Bitcoin and its ilk offered pseudonymity — you could transact without revealing your identity, escaping the prying eyes of banks and governments. However, transparency on the blockchain has a dark side. Each deal, swap, or token transfer is on an open ledger for eternity. Wallet intelligence firms collect and analyze this data to structure detailed profiles that closely monitor balances, trading behavior, and relationships across wallets. This has eroded pseudonymity in crypto transactions. Today, regulators can freeze wallets that have suspicious activity. Exchanges can proactively prevent transactions using a risk score from wallet intelligence companies. That means a handful of powerful actors determine who is “risky” or “safe” — that designation will influence user experience and access. The Mantra OM token collapse serves as a case study of transparency weaponized. The token was highly centralized—90% held by insiders—and traded with very low liquidity. These conditions alone made it vulnerable to market manipulation. When combined with wallet intelligence, this vulnerability became explosive. Coordinated attackers could use detailed wallet data to time their trades and execute massive short positions, triggering forced liquidations and market panic. The FTX collapse revealed a new kind of centralization in crypto The FTX collapse of 2022 exposed both the power and the risks of wallet intelligence. Regulators and auditors did not detect the scheme in time. But blockchain sleuths in the crypto community deployed wallet intelligence tools to track down billions of dollars in customer funds that had gone missing. They uncovered secret self-dealing between Alameda Research and FTX by tracking wallet flows, which is a welter of deception. Pocket intelligence enabled us to shine a light in places where centralized actors sought to hide. However, this power is narrowly concentrated in only a few companies. These firms have privileged access to wallet data, which allows them to determine which wallets to flag and analyze suspicious activities. This type of centralization is contrary to the decentralized principles on which cryptocurrency was based. The crypto movement is built on decentralization. It vows to give power back to users instead of letting centralized gatekeepers make decisions for us. But the promise of wallet obscurity may be undone by a growing body of wallet intelligence. When a few companies dominate the processing of wallet data, network control becomes consolidated in the hands of a few companies. It echoes “surveillance capitalism,” whereby user data is mined and weaponized for profit and control —but now wrapped in blockchain technology. This is a potential violation of user privacy, market fairness, and, ultimately, the vision of a fully self-sovereign, decentralized financial system. To maintain privacy and decentralization, individuals must take back control The battle-ready crypto community has a clear and present threat that needs to be met head-on: wallet intelligence being used as a weapon. If we want user anonymity without losing transparency, we need privacy-preserving technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs, confidential transactions or privacy-oriented blockchains. Because the power of wallet intelligence affects so many users, the governance for wallet intelligence needs to be open and decentralized to avoid centralization by a single party. Developers, regulators, and users need to come together to code safeguards that protect privacy even as they allow for accountability.

H100 said on May 25 that the funds, secured through 0% interest convertible loans, will be used to purchase Bitcoin ( BTC ) in line with its Bitcoin-buying pivot announced on May 22. Back, a longtime Bitcoin cypherpunk, contributed around $1.4 million, while the remaining $800,000 came from investment firms Morten Klein, Alundo Invest AS, Race Venture Scandinavia AB and Crafoord Capital Partners. The raise would allow H100 to buy around 20.18 Bitcoin at current market prices, which would add to the 4.39 Bitcoin that it purchased on May 22 and bring its total stash to roughly 24.57 Bitcoin. Source: H100 H100 said the convertible loans bear no interest and will mature on June 15, 2028. The loan may be converted into shares at any time at a conversion rate of 1.3 Swedish krona (11 US cents) per share. If H100’s share price maintains a volume-weighted average price of more than 33% above the conversion price for a cumulative total of 60 trading days, H100 has the right to mandate a conversion of the loan into equity. A full conversion would result in the issuance of roughly 16,153,900 new shares, corresponding to a dilution of approximately 12%. H100 shares bounced on Bitcoin buy Shares in H100 jumped 37% on the firm’s May 22 announcement and rose another 5.33% the following day to 1.29 SEK (14 US cents), Bloomberg data shows.

Andersen believes “the values of individual sovereignty highly present in the Bitcoin community aligns well with, and will appeal to, the customers and communities we are building the H100 platform for.” According to H100, the move makes it the first public company in Sweden to adopt a Bitcoin treasury policy and one of the first in Europe. The number of companies buying Bitcoin as a treasury asset is on the rise, with 112 public firms now holding the cryptocurrency , according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET data. Ten of those corporate Bitcoin holding companies are based in Europe, making H100 one of the first in the region to adopt the trend.

In a new update , Lee says he believes the current surge, which lifted the S&P 500 by 17% from recent lows to within 3% of an all-time high, reflects a powerful but underappreciated rally. “Part of this [bearish sentiment] is understandable. We had a black swan event on post-tariff liberation day, meaning an unexpected event, and we had a 20% fall in stocks in a very short period of time.” As for what’s coming next, Lee points to historical patterns where doubt after a market dump fueled rallies. “When stocks began to rally after March of 2020, many fund managers said we’re still in a bear market. And recall in the fall of 2022 after the markets made its low in October of 2022, a lot of investors were saying that this was just another bear market rally and investors are about to make a mistake… But here’s the reality – investors flip bullish as soon as you make an all-time high. So in other words, investors generally fight after a decline. They’ll fight the rally until you make a new all-time high. At a new high, they turn they turn around and become bullish and I think that that’s going to happen as soon as markets make a new all-time high.” Source: Fundstrat Lee says Bitcoin’s recent all-time high above $111,000 is another leading indicator for the S&P, because Bitcoin peaked about a month before the S&P did and they’re both tracking increased global liquidity. As for Moody’s downgrade of US government debt from AAA to AA1, Lee says he doubts it’s a negative signal for markets, noting that S&P first downgraded the US in 2011 and Fitch followed in 2023.

The insured damage, mostly from reinsurance payouts, is being carried by ten major publicly traded firms across Europe, as reported by CNBC. These companies are based mainly in Germany, the UK, Switzerland, and France, and their combined losses now account for nearly a tenth of all insured losses from the disaster. Munich Re and Hannover Re, the top two players out of Germany, are responsible for nearly $2 billion of that total. Swiss giants Swiss Re and Zurich followed close behind, clocking in around $830 million. Four UK firms — Hiscox, Lancashire, Conduit Re, and Beazley — collectively took on about $500 million in hits. Over in France, Scor logged $167 million in losses while AXA reported $100 million. That’s all real money. And none of these numbers are estimates — they’ve been reported by the companies themselves in earnings and financial statements. Swiss Re doubles loss forecast as LA fires kill 30, destroy thousands of homes The wildfires, which tore through Eaton Canyon and Palisades, left 30 dead, destroyed thousands of buildings, and displaced millions. The scale forced Swiss Re to raise its projection for total insured losses from $20 billion to $40 billion. These updated numbers now make the disaster one of the worst in California’s history. The overall economic damage is still expected to reach around $50 billion, but the chunk covered by insurers has widened fast. Michael Huttner, an analyst at Berenberg, said the size of these insurance losses caught a lot of firms off guard. “It was a combination of unusual and big,” Michael told CNBC. He added that the uncontrolled spread of the fire pushed claims far beyond what reinsurers expected. Despite that, Michael pointed out that profits across the sector still came in stronger than anticipated. He described it as a sign of “resiliency” in the face of large-scale disasters. But even with Europe eating billions in damages, its insurers are still only handling a small slice of the overall insured total. That’s because reinsurance agreements don’t kick in until the primary insurers, like Chubb, absorb the first wave. These contracts start covering losses only after about €400 million in damage has been handled by the front-line firms. So the reinsurers only got dragged in once the fire had already done some serious damage in California. Japan’s insurers hit harder than expected, deductibles up across Europe Meanwhile, insurers in Japan also got burned. Tokio Marine and Sompo disclosed wildfire losses of almost 50 billion yen, which is roughly $348 million. That number blew past JPMorgan’s initial post-fire estimate of just $63 million. If Swiss Re’s forecast of $40 billion proves accurate, this event will be four times worse than the 2018 wildfires in California, which cost insurers around $16 billion. During that earlier disaster, Munich Re took the biggest individual hit at around €500 million. That experience — along with other large events since — has led to higher deductibles across the entire European reinsurance market. Where once firms only had to wait out €100 million in primary losses, today the threshold has jumped to €400 million. Even with that buffer, it wasn’t enough to keep reinsurers from getting hit hard this time. One of the things that softened the blow, though, was the FAIR Plan — a shared fund paid into by multiple insurers operating in California. That plan is designed to absorb the first layer of losses before any individual private insurer starts paying out, and that helped ease the pressure on the bigger players — including the ones based in Europe. But with a fire this big, even that wasn’t enough to stop $3.5 billion from landing on reinsurers across the continent.

That growth has come despite James Seyffart’s speculation that the SEC’s early decisions would be an action that’s out of the norm. Seyffart anticipates that October is when decisions would likely be made. In addition, the ETF community pointed out that such delays were typical in the review process. Following XRP ETF approval odds rising , asset managers, including Bitwise, CoinShares, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale, await what the SEC will do with their applications. XRP ETF approval surges to 83% amid growing institutional investors’ interest The prediction market platform Polymarket shows a strong expectation boost for an XRP spot ETF approval. Following this, Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, spoke about the subject in the latest episode of the company’s podcast, Crypto in One Minute . He called ETFs a way for institutional investors to enter the cryptocurrency market easily. Garlinghouse highlighted that earlier, Wall Street and other institutional investors had struggled to access the crypto markets directly. However, according to him, that has changed as ETFs enable them to access the market through regulated financial products in place of crypto exchanges or self-custody wallets. He also noted the rapid expansion of Bitcoin ETFs. Based on his argument, the Bitcoin ETF was the quickest to reach $1 billion in assets. He stated that it reached $10 billion faster than any other ETF and believes institutional interest will continue to drive additional product launches, including those pegged to XRP. Notably, despite the US SEC having postponed decisions on spot ETFs, the market experienced an important change late last week. Volatility Shares introduced the first-ever XRP futures ETF on the Nasdaq exchange, using the ticker XRPI. This came after the launch of an XRP futures product on CME Group’s platform on May 19. XRP futures now allow investors to trade contracts based on the expected future price of the asset in a regulated setting. While similar products have been available for Bitcoin and Ethereum for a long time, XRP just recently joined the list. Additionally, Tectrium launched its 2x Long Daily XRP ETF, which was leveraged to provide even more choices for those interested in trading XRP-related instruments. These new offerings demonstrate a rising interest in XRP from institutional traders, which is also seen in the increasing chances of XRP ETF approvals. James Seyffart anticipates that Litecoin has a higher likelihood of getting approved first On May 21, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart shared his speculations that the SEC was more likely to approve a Litecoin ETF before any other cryptocurrency funding applications under review. His speculation came after the SEC postponed its decision on Bitwise’s request to include staking in its Ether ETF and Grayscale’s application for an XRP ETF, which analysts had anticipated. Based on the SEC’s explanation for the delay, the commission announced on May 20 that it needed an extra 45 days to decide on Bitwise’s request to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised. The agency had to either make a decision or delay it further by May 22. Furthermore, the SEC postponed its decision on Grayscale’s XRP tracking ETF and Bitwise’s Solana tracking fund while it collected public comments and started proceedings for further analysis of these proposals to ensure they met regulatory requirements. James Seyffart mentioned on X that these delays were expected because the SEC usually takes the full time to respond to a 19b-4 filing. According to Seyffart, almost all of these filings have final due dates in October, and an early decision would be out of the norm. He added, “No matter how Crypto-friendly this SEC is. There’s no conspiracy here.” Seyffart also revealed that delays on other spot crypto ETF bids were expected, and the SEC was likely to delay deciding on Litecoin ETFs, too. However, despite all this, his stand that Litecoin had a higher likelihood of getting approved first compared to others still remains.

Both big investors and regular savers are rushing to stockpile gold as a safe haven for troubled times. Marc Faber, a veteran investor known as “Dr. Doom,” has long made gold a key part of his own holdings and urged others to do the same. Faber often appears in video interviews, praising gold as a safe haven while warning of a possible economic collapse. He warns about a debt crisis, a sharp drop in asset prices, and surging inflation. “My sense is that a debt crisis is inevitable,” he said. According to Business Insider , Faber holds 25% of gold in his portfolio, and his clients follow his example, keeping a significant share of their wealth in the metal. There has been a steady move toward gold among his clients. But the rush to buy the metal has also spread to more ordinary investors. Many blame the economic uncertainty in 2025. Some of the fears voiced by Faber’s clients, from runaway inflation to even a full-scale war, may seem far-fetched. Yet analysts do not expect this wave of buying to fade soon. Global demand for gold bars rose to 257 metric tons in the first quarter of 2025, a 13% gain over the same period last year, according to the World Gold Council . Joe Cavatoni, a market strategist at the World Gold Council, said worries about the US dollar, weakness in the US economy, and the nation’s debt and deficit have helped drive demand higher. Interest in the search term “gold bars” on Google increased during significant market events, such as the announcement of tariffs on Canada and Mexico and Moody’s downgrade of US debt. Genesis Gold Group, a firm that often serves clients it calls “homesteaders” or “preppers,” says it has seen intense demand in recent quarters. Sales grew so fast that the company introduced a “prepper bar,” designed to be broken into smaller pieces for easier trade during a crisis. Jonathan Rose, the firm’s CEO, said sales of that bar jumped 20% in the first quarter of 2025, around the time President Donald Trump began laying out his tariff plans. More of Genesis’s customers are also asking to take their gold home. Rose estimates that about 70% of his clients now insist on holding physical gold, up from just 20% in past years. On the subreddit r/preppers, which has grown its membership by about 354% since 2020, by one count, users frequently ask whether to keep cash in the market or pile into gold. “It helps when a currency collapses,” one user wrote. “Cash is always king, until it collapses, then that’s where gold and silver step in.” Gold buyers to stay cautious until tariff impact on growth is clear The gold price has climbed about 25% in 2025, easily outpacing the S&P 500, which is down roughly 1% year-to-date. That rally has led some to wonder if the buying spree may have gone too far. Recently, Trump agreed to delay tariffs on Europe until 9 July. This pullback reduced some panic, resulting in a Gold dip of 0.3% to $3,346.89 on Monday from a Friday surge of 1.9%. However, experts warn that people are still uneasy about the U.S. fiscal outlook. Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone, noted that President Trump’s recent tax bill reignited worries over the US debt and deficit. But he said those fears may ease if lawmakers make changes to the bill to reassure bond investors. Moreover, Goldman Sachs cut its odds of a downturn this year from 45% to 35%, and Barclays dropped its mild-recession forecast altogether. Meanwhile, Michael Boutros, senior technical strategist at StoneX, said there is plenty of fearmongering in markets right now, though he expects gold demand to stay strong as long as people feel uneasy about the economy. Even after trade disputes get settled, Boutros believes gold buyers will remain cautious until they see how tariffs affect growth. “The rockier things get, the more this is going to find footing,” he said of gold’s momentum. Joe Cavatoni of the World Gold Council added that he sees solid price support and a continued upward path for gold through 2025.

Currently trading around $0.000015, analysts suggest SHIB could be gearing up for a short-term move toward $0.000020 if bullish momentum holds. However, the spotlight is gradually shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new viral cryptocurrency gaining massive attention. The project is in phase 5 of its presale priced at $0.03. Mutuum Finance’s presale surges past $9.2 million with over 11,500 investors already onboard. As Mutuum Finance enters Phase 6, the price will jump 16.67% to $0.035. With a jaw-dropping 12,380% price prediction circulating among bullish analysts and a low entry price of just $0.03, Mutuum Finance is being hailed as one of the best new altcoins to buy now for outsized returns in 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Eyes $0.00002 as Bullish Momentum Builds Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.000015, up a small 0.04% from the past 24 hours. The token has shown resilience, remaining above levels of support, and analysts are observing signs of a potential reversal to the bear. Technical indicators suggest that SHIB can maintain its current momentum and smash through the resistance line of $0.00001613, where it could potentially be headed to $0.00002 in the near term. This optimism is further buoyed by recent developments within the Shiba Inu universe, including token burns and work on its layer-2 solution, Shibarium, designed to enhance utility and reduce supply. While SHIB continues to draw investors, potential projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also drawing investors’ eyes for their potential in the new cryptocurrency universe. Transforming DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. This two-pronged approach maximizes security, efficiency, and decentralization and positions Mutuum Finance at the forefront of the DeFi universe. By giving users full control over their lending decisions, the platform is appealing to conservative and high-yield investors, and facilitates a more open and flexible financial system. A DeFi Disruptor Drawing Massive Investor Interest Mutuum Finance is rapidly generating buzz in the DeFi community with its game-changing lending solutions. Despite being in presale, it has already surpassed more than $9.2 million in funding and has amassed nearly 11,500 investors, making it a solid altcoin ready to experience a major breakthrough. With Phase 5 price at $0.03 and with an impending 16.67% price boost in the next phase, early investors stand to gain good returns in terms of bagging their highest returns. At launch, with an anticipated price of $0.06, profits will be 100%, and for the next bull cycle, projections see the leap over $2. Exclusive Rewards and Community Incentives Early adopters of Mutuum Finance all have enticing incentives, including a $100,000 giveaway in which 10 people will win $10,000 value of MUTM tokens. There is also a referral program that encourages community development as it rewards clients for recruiting new investors. Early backers also receive VIP access to platform updates. All these incentives not only drive early usage but also ensure long-term hold among token holders. Mutuum Finance raised over $9.2 million with nearly 11,500 investors in the presale, reflecting high demand. In Phase 5, which costs $0.03, the price will rise 16.67% to $0.035 in Phase 6, providing early investors a possible 100% return on investment. Mutuum Finance, with referrals and referral rewards, is one-of-a-kind in DeFi. Don’t miss this opportunity and invest before the next phase.

This surge in whale activity, combined with Bitcoin’s price stability and rising institutional inflows, signals renewed confidence in the broader crypto market. However, while Bitcoin and Ethereum remain foundational assets, the most aggressive capital is now rotating into early-stage, high-risk opportunities—none more prominent than MAGACOIN FINANCE. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Accumulation and 35x–40x Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the top high-risk allocation among crypto whales and early-stage investors. The project has raised over $8 million, with Stage 8 nearly full and a capped 100 billion token supply audited by HashEx. Notably, a single whale recently made a decisive 72.95 ETH purchase—valued at over $133,000—marking the largest early-stage buy of 2025 and signaling institutional-grade confidence in MAGA’s upside. Analysts are projecting 35x–40x returns from current entry levels, with some models suggesting even greater upside if momentum continues. The combination of scarcity-driven tokenomics, rapid presale sellouts, and strategic whale positioning is setting MAGACOIN FINANCE apart as the breakout high-risk play for Q3 and Q4 2025. Bitcoin (BTC): Stability and Institutional Support Bitcoin is consolidating around $110,000, supported by robust institutional inflows and ETF demand. While BTC remains the market’s anchor, its upside from current levels is seen as more measured, prompting many investors to rotate capital into higher-growth early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Ethereum (ETH): Steady Growth and Rotating Capital Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, supported by ongoing upgrades and robust institutional adoption. While ETH remains a core holding for most portfolios, the most aggressive capital is now flowing into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is far more compelling. TRUMP Coin: Volatility and Speculation TRUMP coin remains a speculative favorite, with forecasts for 2025 ranging widely from $35 to $300 depending on regulatory headlines and market sentiment. While the coin has benefited from political branding and periodic surges, its long-term value is more volatile than the structured, scarcity-driven approach of MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST Conclusion Bitcoin whales are quietly positioning for the next phase of the market, but it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that is capturing the most aggressive capital flows. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 40x ROI, MAGA stands as the top high-risk, high-reward opportunity for 2025.

While ETH remains a cornerstone of most portfolios, the spotlight is shifting to early-stage opportunities—especially MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is now outpacing the field with unprecedented presale momentum and analyst-backed upside projections. XRP and Chainlink also remain on the radar, each offering distinct catalysts for growth in 2025. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Surge and 14,000% Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the breakout presale of 2025, with Stage 8 live and over $8 million raised as demand accelerates daily. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling unprecedented accumulation from both retail and institutional buyers. A recent 72.95 ETH whale buy—worth over $133,000—marks the largest early-stage crypto purchase of the year, signaling deep conviction among smart money participants. Analysts are now projecting returns of up to 14,000% from current entry levels, with some models suggesting even higher upside if momentum continues. Early participants can still use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% bonus before the $0.007 listing target, making MAGA the go-to allocation for those seeking exponential gains before listings spark the next wave of price discovery. Ethereum (ETH): Stability and Institutional Support Ethereum is trading calmly at $2,560, with technical indicators pointing to a possible breakout toward $2,700–$2,900 if bullish sentiment holds. Analysts highlight strong support at $2,400 and resistance at $2,700, with institutional inflows and Layer 2 growth underpinning ETH’s long-term outlook. While Ethereum remains a core holding, the most aggressive capital is now flowing into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is far more compelling. XRP: Bullish Outlook and Rotating Capital XRP is trading near $2.60, buoyed by regulatory clarity, ETF speculation, and robust whale accumulation. Analysts forecast a move toward $2.85–$3.40 in the coming weeks, with some bullish scenarios targeting $5.50 by year-end if momentum persists. While XRP’s fundamentals remain strong, its near-term upside is more measured compared to the explosive presale-driven momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Chainlink (LINK): Steady Growth, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Chainlink is trading around $14–$15, with price forecasts for 2025 remaining steady and technicals pointing to a stable uptrend. While LINK’s fundamentals are solid, its near-term upside is more modest compared to the rapid accumulation and analyst-backed projections of MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Ethereum’s calm at $2,560 is a testament to its enduring strength, but the most dramatic growth potential is now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE . With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 14,000% ROI, MAGA is the breakout contender for 2025.

The tech giant introduced a significant update to its search engine at the Google I/O 2025 conference. The new feature , AI Mode, changes the standard Google Search bar to resemble an AI chatbot. These features provide users with direct, AI-generated answers to queries, often summarizing content from various sources, including Reddit, without requiring users to visit the original sites. AI Mode offers human answers instead of the standard list of links. It’s driven by a customized version of Google’s Gemini 2 generative AI model. The tool can answer tricky questions, search many sources at once, and give the results in a reader-friendly way. AI Mode was first launched to U.S.-based Google One AI Premium users in early 2025. Google has announced that it will be officially available to every user in the U.S. over the next few weeks. A worldwide launch is planned for later this year. “AI Mode is where we will first bring our frontier capabilities into search,” CEO Sundar Pichai said. He referred to it as a “complete overhaul” of the search experience. The change is part of a broader effort by Google to remain competitive in the battle over AI-powered search. Competitors like Microsoft, with Bing AI, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT have already incorporated similar features. Google’s answer is audacious — and possibly fraught with risk. AI Mode puts Reddit’s search traffic at risk One platform with the potential to be heavily affected is Reddit. Traditional Google Search has been very good for Reddit. You can use any search engine you want, but many of us end up on Reddit when looking for human answers to real-world problems , regardless of whether we are logged in. Google has even prioritized Reddit links in the search rankings in recent years, understanding that users can often put more trust in a forum than a cookie-cutter website. But with AI Mode, Google could start answering user questions directly from data scraped off sites like Reddit—without ever driving a click to them. So fewer people will potentially click through to Reddit properly. This is no small concern. The recent growth on Reddit has been powered largely by logged-out users—people who browse Reddit casually and find the site via search. These users are not the loyal base of Reddit, but they do have numbers. If AI Mode starts feeding Reddit-style responses without pointing to the site, that could be the quickest path to drying up a big source of visitors. That fear is already being reflected in the market. In February, Reddit’s stock tumbled more than 15% after the company announced its traffic had been “choppy” since Google’s search algorithm changed. Reddit’s chief executive, Steve Huffman, has said Google’s updates have meant that Reddit is unsure what traffic it can count on going forward. Reddit strengthens its community to offset AI traffic loss While search traffic is nice to have, the company’s strength is its logged-in user base. These regular users visit Reddit directly and participate in community discussions. These users stay longer, engage with more meaningful content, and bolster ad revenue. However, Reddit is also developing its own AI tools . In March 2025, it introduced Reddit Answers, an AI system that surfaces useful summaries from Reddit threads. Now, the platform is putting Reddit Answers front and center by adding it to its main search bar to help people find authentic, community-driven content more easily. This is a play partly in defense and partly in offense. It tries to lock users onto the platform using AI tools from Google and others. Reddit’s CEO, Steve Huffman, expressed confidence in the long-term value of human voices despite the rise of AI in search. He acknowledged that large language models (LLMs) change how people search online.

On the daily chart, XRP recently dropped below an important resistance level at $2.34. Right now, it’s finding some support around $2.30, but it keeps struggling to climb back above $2.34, which has turned into a new resistance point. If the price can break and stay above this level, the next targets would be around $2.44, and then a stronger resistance between $2.55 and $2.62. For now, the market is still within a bullish trend, meaning it’s making higher lows and higher highs — but a proper bounce is needed soon to keep that uptrend going. There’s also a chance that XRP is forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern on the daily chart. If this pattern completes and the price breaks above $2.62, it could push XRP to new highs, possibly even beyond $3. However, this pattern is not confirmed yet — it still needs to form the right side of the pattern and break above key resistance levels. Short-Term Market Movement The price has been stuck between $2.15 and $2.31 with no strong move either way. A small five-wave drop was seen from Friday’s high, but it hasn’t led to a bigger price drop. As long as the market stays below $2.43–$2.44, there’s still some downward pressure. If XRP drops further, key support levels to watch are around $2.15 and $1.95. However, this pullback looks more like a healthy correction rather than the start of a major downtrend. What’s the Bigger Picture? Even with this short-term weakness, the overall market structure still supports a bullish outlook. There was a clear five-wave move up from the April low to May 12, and now the market seems to be going through a normal pullback phase. As long as XRP stays above the important support at $1.79, the long-term bullish trend remains safe.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-26 01:46:18

Users couldn’t log in, access timelines, or send messages, hardly the hallmarks of a platform aspiring to become a “super app.” Elon Musk’s vision for X is clear: a single, integrated platform that merges social media, payments, messaging, AI services, and commerce. But so far, the execution hasn’t matched that goal. For all of X’s ambitions, the platform struggles to maintain basic functionality, let alone support a layered suite of financial and transactional services. For some observers, this discrepancy highlights a bigger issue. Is Musk trying to do too much to be able to manage such a formidable transformation? Building a super app requires discipline, not chaos The super app model, best exemplified by WeChat in China, is complex. Besides a backend infrastructure capable of handling vast, interdependent functions, it requires strong regulatory alignment, cultural integration, and sustained focus. WeChat did not evolve through improvisation; it matured under coordinated leadership, with deep cooperation from regulators and a coherent product roadmap. X, by contrast, appears to have adopted an approach defined more by urgency than discipline. In the last year alone, Musk has announced initiatives ranging from encrypted messaging and peer-to-peer payments to AI-generated news and dating features. Yet these product ambitions have coincided with frequent platform outages and a marked decline in service reliability. Super apps do not succeed by layering complexity onto unstable systems. They thrive on trust—technical, operational, and institutional. And trust is difficult to maintain when the platform itself appears brittle. Stretching leadership across six companies risks systemic failure Musk’s portfolio is without precedent in modern corporate history. He is the owner and CEO of Tesla, SpaceX , Neuralink, xAI, The Boring Company, and X. Each of these demands persistent execution, high-stakes decision-making, and deep technological engagement. Tesla alone is navigating autonomous driving challenges, supply chain pressures, and cutthroat competition in the EV market . SpaceX is scaling Starship and managing a constellation of Starlink satellites. Neuralink recently entered human trials. Under such conditions, even the most capable leader risks diffusion. The physical demands of running one high-growth, technologically complex company are immense. Running six is a structural risk. Tesla shareholders have raised issues about this very dynamic. In early 2024, investor letters questioned Musk’s focus, particularly as political rhetoric and regulatory conflicts on X drew attention away from Tesla’s core innovation agenda. SpaceX insiders have reportedly expressed similar unease over reputational spillover from X. Nowhere is the strain more visible than at X itself. The May outage, reportedly caused by delayed server patching and misconfigured fallback systems, reflects technical debt and a lack of sustained executive oversight. Such failures are less likely in environments where leadership focuses on operational resilience. Slashing staff without a clear strategy has weakened X’s core operations Compounding the problem is X’s dramatic downsizing. Since Musk’s acquisition, the company has shed more than 80% of its workforce, including infrastructure specialists, product leads, and compliance personnel. Many of these were responsible for platform reliability, trust and safety, and regulatory alignment. Layoffs of this magnitude might have been manageable under a strategically phased reorganization. Instead, X has lurched from crisis to crisis. Product rollouts have lacked cohesion. Infrastructure appears brittle. Regulatory uncertainty is another concern, particularly as the company explores payments and financial services in tightly regulated jurisdictions. To dismiss Musk outright would be premature. His track record—disrupting the auto industry, commercializing spaceflight, and vertically integrating battery supply chains—is extraordinary. The same goes for his work ethic and eye for spotting top-tier talent. Some of Musk’s supporters argue that his model of leadership—visionary, high-leverage, selectively engaged—is sufficient if paired with strong deputies. That argument has merit. If X’s operations were led by a dedicated CEO accountable for execution and platform integrity, Musk’s focus could be confined to product vision and business alliances. There are also potential synergies across Musk’s companies. Starlink could enhance X’s market reach, xAI accelerates AI integration for content moderation or personalization, and Tesla’s payment expertise could support its financial infrastructure. Yet none of these synergies remove the need for consistent, hands-on leadership within X. The core challenge is not merely technological—it is managerial. Pursuing a super app vision requires more than Musk’s ambition Even with perfect leadership, X faces formidable barriers to super app status in the West. The regulatory environment in the U.S. and Europe is more fragmented and stringent than in China. Data privacy laws, antitrust scrutiny, and payment licensing regimes impose real constraints. Moreover, X faces entrenched competitors: Apple for payments, WhatsApp for messaging, and Amazon for commerce. In this context, building a Western WeChat is not just difficult; it may be structurally unviable. The ambition may be sound. The execution model, however, must evolve. X need not abandon its super app ambitions but must rethink how it pursues them. A platform that seeks to become the central hub for communication, finance, and commerce requires unbroken focus, deep operational expertise, and robust governance. Musk has proven himself an exceptional founder and visionary. However, the role of the platform’s steward, particularly at this stage of X’s evolution, may require different leadership. Adopting a nonexecutive chairman role could restore confidence and increase the odds of success. And in the end, no matter how compelling the vision is, it cannot replace presence. Super apps require more than innovation; they require constancy, precision, and trust. Without X closing the gap between ambition and leadership bandwidth, its super app hopes might not be more than a dream.

ADA has held strong above $0.68 and is now targeting $0.80, with bullish traders eyeing a breakout if momentum continues. Yet, while Cardano’s technical setup is promising, the real excitement is building around early-stage opportunities that promise far greater returns. Bitcoin’s recent rally above $112,000 has reignited institutional interest, with analysts now projecting possible targets of $131,000, $163,000, or even $200,000 if the current uptrend persists. Ethereum continues to trade above $2,500, supported by robust inflows and ongoing upgrades, but its near-term upside is seen as steady rather than explosive. In this context, the spotlight is shifting to high-upside altcoins where the risk/reward profile is more compelling. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Surge and 13,000% Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly distinguishing itself as the breakout presale of 2025 . With over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full, demand from both retail and institutional investors is surging. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling this momentum. Analysts are forecasting returns as high as 13,000%, with some models suggesting even greater upside if current trends continue. Early backers can still secure a 50% token bonus using the PATRIOT50X code before the $0.007 listing, making this one of the most attractive entry points in the market. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s unique blend of scarcity-driven tokenomics, strategic rollout, and community buzz is keeping it at the top of investor watchlists. As the presale window narrows, smart money is positioning early, recognizing MAGA as a leading altcoin contender for the coming cycle. Bitcoin (BTC): Macro Strength and Institutional Flows Bitcoin’s climb above $112,000 signals renewed confidence from institutional investors. Price targets now range from $130,000 to $200,000 if momentum continues. While BTC remains a foundational holding, its ROI potential is increasingly being matched—and even outpaced—by early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Hedera (HBAR): Steady Progress, MAGA Outpaces Hedera is trading near $0.25, with forecasts for 2025 suggesting a range of $0.24–$0.27. HBAR’s enterprise partnerships and technical upgrades are impressive, but its growth is more gradual compared to the rapid ascent of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Ethereum (ETH): Reliable Growth, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Ethereum holds above $2,500, benefiting from institutional adoption and ongoing ecosystem development. While ETH remains a core asset, analysts agree that the most dramatic growth potential now lies in early-stage plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion As Cardano tests major resistance, the most compelling growth story is unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 13,000% ROI, MAGA is the breakout opportunity to watch for 2025.

The first major support sits near the $2,500 zone. A clear move below the $2,500 support might push the price toward the $2,460 support.

Why Qubetics ($TICS) Stands Out as the Best Crypto Presale to Join in 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/missing-the-xrp-boom-why-qubetics-tics-stands-out-as-the-best-crypto-presale-to-join-in-2025/,"The cryptocurrency market has experienced another wave of volatility, prompting a surge in demand for the best crypto presale to join in 2025. Recent regulatory developments and shifting sentiment have reshaped the digital asset landscape, creating both challenges and high-value openings. XRP’s dramatic price rally earlier this year now stands as a cautionary tale for latecomers. In this environment, identifying the best crypto presale to join has never been more critical—especially as platforms like Qubetics continue gaining momentum through real-world utility, robust tokenomics, and growing institutional interest. Among emerging projects, Qubetics ($TICS) has quickly risen to prominence as the best crypto presale to join, offering innovative blockchain solutions that address persistent challenges faced by predecessors like XRP. The token’s current presale price remains accessible, making Qubetics a compelling option for participation during this pivotal period. Understanding why Qubetics is regarded as the best crypto presale to join requires examining both its technological strengths and market positioning. XRP: A Historic Surge That Many Could Not Capitalize On XRP’s journey through 2023 and into 2024 has been nothing short of remarkable, highlighted by a spectacular price rally driven largely by renewed optimism over its ongoing legal battles and adoption prospects. At its peak, XRP captured significant market capitalization and early buyers attention, spurred by partnerships with global payment processors and financial institutions aiming to harness its fast settlement capabilities. Despite these highs, XRP’s earlier challenges, including regulatory scrutiny and competition from emerging blockchain solutions, slowed its momentum. The price rally created a significant barrier for latecomers, turning what could have been an accessible entry point into a missed opportunity for many. With XRP’s token value now stabilizing at levels well above its prior lows, entry costs have escalated, reducing the appeal for new acquisitions. Price predictions for XRP remain cautiously optimistic, with some analysts forecasting moderate gains driven by expanding use cases in cross-border payments and remittances. However, the once-low entry price has long since passed, leaving many to consider alternative cryptocurrencies with greater growth potential in the presale phase. Qubetics ($TICS): The Best Crypto Presale to Join with Real-World Solutions Qubetics has swiftly gained recognition as the best crypto presale to join in 2025, propelled by its cutting-edge blockchain ecosystem designed to address real-world challenges that predecessors like XRP struggled with. Entering its 36th crypto presale stage, Qubetics has already sold over 513 million tokens to more than 26,900 holders, raising $17.3 million—an indicator of significant market confidence. The $TICS token is priced at $0.3064 during this stage, making participation accessible while promising substantial upside based on analyst projections. After the crypto presale, the token is expected to reach $1, offering a 226% return on investment, with further predictions placing $TICS at $5 and $15 following the mainnet launch, equating to 1531% and 4794% ROI respectively. Qubetics’ strength lies in its robust interoperability and decentralized infrastructure, which aims to unify disparate blockchain networks and streamline cross-border transactions. This is a critical innovation, given the fragmentation observed in earlier crypto ecosystems. By enabling seamless interaction between various chains and assets, Qubetics positions itself as an enabler of global financial inclusion. Qubetics’ Application and Interoperability: Bridging Businesses and Individuals Qubetics’ approach to blockchain technology extends beyond simple transactional use. Its interoperability solutions offer tangible benefits across multiple sectors, directly addressing the inefficiencies that hindered earlier cryptocurrencies from widespread adoption. Businesses, especially those operating internationally, stand to gain from Qubetics’ cross-border transaction capabilities. For instance, an export-import company can leverage the Qubetics network to transfer funds instantly without the need for traditional intermediaries, reducing costs and settlement times drastically. This improvement accelerates trade cycles and increases liquidity flow in emerging markets. For professionals such as freelancers and remote workers, Qubetics offers a secure, transparent payment system that eliminates delays common with conventional banking systems. Receiving payments across borders becomes streamlined, ensuring prompt access to earnings and minimizing exchange rate risks. Individual users also benefit from enhanced privacy and security features, coupled with easy-to-use wallets that support multiple cryptocurrencies through a single interface. This democratizes access to digital assets, fostering broader participation in the crypto economy. This comprehensive utility is underpinned by the ongoing presale, where $TICS tokens remain attractively priced at $0.3064. The presale not only supports network expansion but also allows early adopters to secure positions ahead of anticipated price appreciation. Why Missing XRP’s Peak Amplifies the Urgency to Join Qubetics’ Presale The rapid ascent of XRP exemplifies the volatility and opportunity inherent in cryptocurrency markets. Those who missed acquiring XRP at lower prices now face significantly higher entry barriers. This context elevates the appeal of presales like Qubetics, which offer early access at accessible prices. Joining Qubetics’ presale means participation in a project that not only promises innovative technology but also addresses key shortcomings of prior platforms. The current token price combined with bullish analyst forecasts makes it arguably the best crypto presale to join in 2025. As the crypto ecosystem matures, the emphasis shifts towards projects that provide interoperability, real-world utility, and sustainable scalability. Qubetics aligns perfectly with these criteria, promising a viable path forward beyond speculative gains. Analyst Perspectives: Strong ROI Predictions Underpin Qubetics’ Potential Market analysts have underscored the promising trajectory of $TICS tokens, citing both the technology and community backing as drivers of expected price growth. The projected rise to $1 post-presale offers a near-term ROI exceeding 200%, while the potential surge to $15 post-mainnet indicates extraordinary long-term upside. These projections reflect confidence in Qubetics’ ability to deliver scalable solutions and to capitalize on growing demand for interoperable blockchain platforms. The token’s presale success further validates market appetite, setting it apart as the best crypto presale to join amid increasing competition. Such predictions should be considered with due diligence, but the combination of presale accessibility, rising adoption, and innovative features firmly situates Qubetics as a noteworthy candidate in the evolving crypto landscape. Conclusion: Timing Is Critical—Qubetics Emerges as the Best Crypto Presale to Join Based on thorough analysis, Qubetics represents the best crypto presale to join in 2025, especially for those seeking early exposure to blockchain interoperability and real-world applications. The missed window presented by XRP’s peak heightens the urgency for timely participation in presales like Qubetics. With $TICS tokens priced affordably during the 36th presale stage, combined with strong analyst forecasts, this project clearly stands out as the best crypto presale to join at present. Qubetics’ integration of advanced technology and practical business use cases positions it to redefine crypto adoption, solidifying its status as the best crypto presale to join before the mainnet launch. Taking advantage of this opportunity may prove decisive in capturing substantial future value within a rapidly maturing market.

He also blamed Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, for worsening the war with his public statements, and said Joe Biden’s actions fueled the disaster. “This is a war that would never have started if I were president,” Trump said. “This is Zelenskyy’s, Putin’s, and Biden’s war, not Trump’s.” According to a report from RuNews24.ru, Putin responded to Trump’s recent call for a 30-day ceasefire by launching 250 drones and 14 ballistic missiles into Kyiv and other cities on Friday night. Ukrainian officials reportedly said their forces intercepted nearly 100 drones near Moscow. Putin hides war budget as secret spending surges The Kremlin has buried nearly a third of its federal spending behind classified labels. Russia’s budget law from December mentions the word “secret” 39 times, as reported by RuNews24.ru. Yakov Yakubovich, from Russia’s National Research Nuclear University, said the classified chunk of the budget is 12.12 trillion rubles, or around $152 billion, making up 29.22% of total spending. Last year, that number was 11.1 trillion rubles or $121.19 billion, according to data published by Bloomberg. Yakubovich explained the funds are most likely being used for war-related infrastructure and operations in newly seized territories. He added that publishing this information could lead to more sanctions, which is why it’s being kept out of public view. The surge in secret spending comes as Europe struggles to meet Ukraine’s growing demand for military supplies. Zelenskyy confirmed that domestic weapons production is improving, but shortages of both manpower and equipment remain. Zelenskyy, in a statement Friday, said, “With every such strike, the world sees more clearly that it is Moscow that’s prolonging this war.” He called for tougher sanctions on Russia’s economy, warning that only more pressure would bring Putin to negotiate seriously. Washington debates pressure while Trump pushes diplomacy Marco Rubio, Trump’s Secretary of State, defended the administration’s approach in Senate testimony Tuesday. He said Ukraine is still receiving arms from the US and allies, even though the administration hasn’t requested new funding or tapped into fresh stockpiles. Rubio also said the European Union is finalizing additional sanctions while the US looks to obtain more Patriot missile systems from NATO allies. When asked if Trump is being manipulated by Putin, Rubio said that wasn’t true and insisted all sanctions from the Biden era remain active. He explained that Trump wants to avoid threatening new sanctions immediately, hoping to keep Russia engaged in talks. But those talks are falling apart fast. Putin didn’t show up personally for the recent negotiation session in Istanbul. Instead, a low-level delegation was sent to meet with Rubio, who was dispatched by Trump. In Washington, Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal introduced a new bill co-signed by 81 senators, warning that if Russia refuses to negotiate in good faith, the US will respond with direct sanctions. Graham said the Senate is prepared to slap a 500% tariff on any country, including China, that keeps buying Russian gas, oil, or uranium. He said Putin has only days to submit ceasefire terms. “If it is more of the same,” Graham said, “Russia can expect decisive action from the United States Senate.” Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s Foreign Minister, said Moscow’s terms will depend on the “root causes” of the war. He said Ukraine needs a new government, one that’s “legitimate,” before a real peace deal can happen. Russia still insists that Ukraine is part of its territory and calls Zelenskyy’s government corrupt and Nazi-run.

This surge in whale activity, combined with Bitcoin’s price stability around $68,000 and rising institutional inflows, signals renewed confidence in the broader crypto market. However, while Bitcoin and Ethereum remain foundational assets, the most aggressive capital is now rotating into early-stage, high-risk opportunities—none more prominent than MAGACOIN FINANCE. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Accumulation and 35x–40x Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the top high-risk allocation among crypto whales and early-stage investors. The project has raised over $8 million, with Stage 8 nearly full and a capped 100 billion token supply audited by HashEx. Notably, a single whale recently made a decisive 72.95 ETH purchase—valued at over $133,000—marking the largest early-stage buy of 2025 and signaling institutional-grade confidence in MAGA’s upside. Analysts are projecting 35x–40x returns from current entry levels, with some models suggesting even greater upside if momentum continues. The combination of scarcity-driven tokenomics, rapid presale sellouts, and strategic whale positioning is setting MAGACOIN FINANCE apart as the breakout high-risk play for Q3 and Q4 2025. Ethereum (ETH): Stability and Rotating Capital Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, supported by ongoing upgrades and robust institutional adoption. While ETH remains a core holding for most portfolios, the most aggressive capital is now flowing into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is far more compelling. TRUMP Coin: Volatility and Speculation TRUMP coin remains a speculative favorite, with forecasts for 2025 ranging widely from $35 to $300 depending on regulatory headlines and market sentiment. While the coin has benefited from political branding and periodic surges, its long-term value is more volatile than the structured, scarcity-driven approach of MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Bitcoin whales are quietly positioning for the next phase of the market, but it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that is capturing the most aggressive capital flows. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 40x ROI, MAGA stands as the top high-risk, high-reward opportunity for 2025.

After failing to hold a rally toward its old high of $3, the price once again dropped sharply. The coin recently hit $1.67 before falling back to around $0.77 at the time of writing. When Pi Coin was first listed, it started at $3 but quickly dropped to $0.60 on the same day. It managed to bounce back to $3 within 34 days, but this rise created strong selling pressure as early investors rushed to cash out. Many saw $3 as a good exit point, especially after the coin had previously fallen more than 80%.’ In terms of important price levels, Pi Coin is currently facing immediate resistance at $0.94, $1.20, and $1.66. If the price manages to break above these levels, the final bullish target in the short term remains at $3.00. On the downside, the critical support to watch is $0.65 — if the price falls below this level, it could lead to even steeper declines ahead. Upcoming Token Unlocks May Add More Pressure Adding to the concerns, a large number of Pi tokens are scheduled to unlock in the coming days, which could increase selling pressure: May 26: 10 million Pi will unlock May 27: 12 million Pi will unlock May 28: 15 million Pi will unlock — the biggest unlock in the next 30 days These large unlocks could add extra pressure on the price, as newly available tokens might be sold on the market. Positive Developments in the Pi Ecosystem Despite the price struggles, the Pi Network ecosystem is growing fast. According to analyst Kim Wong, there are now over 100 Pi-based decentralized apps (DApps), with some already live on the Mainnet, some being tested, and others still in development. Adding to the excitement, the recent launch of a $100 million Venture Fund is expected to help the growth of the Pi ecosystem even further. As more apps go live and adoption increases worldwide, Pi’s long-term potential continues to look bright. The network now boasts over 70 million users globally, including 20 million KYC-verified users and 4.3 million X (Twitter) followers. Pi Coin is also listed on several exchanges and ranks #26 by market cap among all cryptocurrencies.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-26 02:22:04

Coinbase investor Brady Nessler said in a May 22 lawsuit filed in a Pennsylvania federal court that the data breach and the alleged broken agreement with the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority resulted in a “precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s common shares,” causing stockholders to suffer “significant losses and damages.” Coinbase said on May 15 that its damages bill could run up to $400 million after it was hit with a $20 million extortion attempt four days earlier , with several of its customer support agents bribed to access internal systems and steal a limited amount of user account data. Nessler claimed Coinbase (COIN) shares dropped by 7.2% to close at $244 on May 15 as a result of the disclosure. However, the stock did stage a comeback, spiking 9% and hitting $266 by the closing bell on May 16, according to Google Finance. Coinbase stock closed down over 3% on May 23 at $263, falling another $1.62 after the bell. COIN is up nearly 6% so far this year. Coinbase is down from the May 23 trading session. Source: Google Finance Nessler’s complaint is seemingly the first to argue damages caused by Coinbase’s stock drop following its breach disclosure in a series of recent class-action lawsuits over the incident. The crypto exchange was hit with at least six lawsuits in the days after disclosing the data breach, all accusing it of mishandling the incident and failing to protect their data. UK agreement breach hurt stock, suit says The FCA fined Coinbase’s UK arm $4.5 million in July 2024 for breaching a 2020 voluntary agreement preventing the exchange from onboarding customers considered high risk by the regulator. The FCA said Coinbase onboarded 13,416 customers that the regulator considered high-risk and offered them crypto services . Related: Coinbase presses to axe rule banning SEC staff from holding crypto Nessler said in the suit that the fine saw Coinbase’s stock fall by over 5%, closing at $231.52 on July 25, 2024. Nessler also claimed that Coinbase didn’t disclose it had breached this agreement when the exchange first listed its shares on the Nasdaq in April 2021 , and as a result, “the market price of the Company’s securities had been artificially,” inflated. Nessler claims had she known about the agreement violation, she would not have purchased the stock at the “artificially inflated prices.” Coinbase did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The class suit was filed on behalf of anyone who bought Coinbase stock between April 14, 2021, and May 14, 2025, and is asking for damages and a jury trial. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and chief financial officer Alesia Haas are also named as defendants. Another lawsuit filed in Illinois on May 13, alleges Coinbase failed to notify users in writing of the collection , storage, or sharing of their biometric data and the purpose and retention schedule for their data.

With Injective (INJ) steady and XRP whales accumulating, both institutional and retail investors are zeroing in on MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Bitcoin as the top contenders to watch for Q3 2025’s breakout. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Moves, 50% Bonus, and Early-Stage Surge MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming 2025’s most-watched presale, with over $8 million raised and a record-setting 72.95 ETH whale buy marking the largest early-stage purchase of the year. The project’s capped supply, HashEx audit, and scarcity-driven tokenomics are driving unprecedented demand. Early buyers can still use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% bonus, making MAGA even more attractive for those seeking exponential upside. Analysts are projecting 25x–35x returns, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% if momentum continues. As Stage 8 nears completion, smart money is positioning ahead of listings, recognizing MAGACOIN FINANCE as a rare ground-floor opportunity before price discovery goes public. Bitcoin (BTC): Bullish Structure and Institutional Support Bitcoin is trading in the $110,000–$115,000 range, with technicals showing strong bullish momentum and support at $110K. The breakout above April’s highs has ended a long consolidation, and BTC is now in price discovery mode. Institutional inflows remain robust, and as long as BTC holds above $110K, analysts expect a push toward $112K–$115K in the coming sessions. This steady foundation is prompting investors to rotate some capital into higher-upside plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Whale Accumulation and Bullish Sentiment XRP is consolidating near $2.42, with recent whale transactions totaling over $300 million signaling confidence in the token’s future. The number of large XRP wallets has surged, reflecting growing influence from major investors. Analysts forecast a move toward $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks, with some bullish scenarios targeting $5.50 by year-end if momentum persists. As XRP holders seek sharper upside, many are reallocating to early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL) and Injective (INJ): Steady, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Solana is trading between $158 and $175, consolidating after a recent high near $183, with technicals suggesting a potential breakout if resistance is cleared. Injective is trading near $13, with price forecasts between $16 and $18 for 2025. However, both are being outpaced in sentiment and capital flows by the explosive momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion With Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana providing stability, the most dramatic growth potential is now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE. As Stage 8 nears completion and the 50% PATRIOT50X bonus remains, this may be the last low-entry window before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. For those seeking the next breakout, MAGA is the name to watch for Q3 2025.

The SEC’s Cybersecurity Risk Management rule, published in July 2023, requires companies to rapidly disclose cybersecurity incidents such as data breaches or hacks. However, the banking groups argue this rule was flawed from the start and has proven problematic in practice since taking effect. The banking bodies said that the “complex and narrow disclosure delay mechanism” interferes with incident response and law enforcement and creates “market confusion” between mandatory and voluntary disclosures. Public disclosure has also been “weaponized as an extortion method by ransomware criminals to further malicious objectives,” and premature disclosures worsen insurance and liability issues for companies and “risks chilling candid internal communications and routine information sharing,” the group claimed. Some of the banking groups’ claims and fears regarding the ruling. Source: SIFMA The groups specifically want “Item 1.05” to be rescinded from the SEC’s rules for Form 8-K reporting and parallel reporting requirements applicable to Form 6-K. Form 8-K is used to publicly notify investors in US public companies of specified events, including cybersecurity incidents, that may be important to shareholders or the SEC. “Critically, without Item 1.05, investor interests will still be protected, and we believe they would be better served through the pre-existing disclosure framework for reporting material information, which may include material cybersecurity incidents,” the groups stated. Related: Hackers using fake Ledger Live app to steal seed phrases and drain crypto The full petition included examples of confusion from participants, specific incidents of ransomware attacks and documented regulatory conflicts. Public crypto companies impacted The requirement also impacts publicly listed crypto companies such as Coinbase, which disclosed earlier this month that hackers had bribed its support staff to leak its user data. The disclosure saw the company hit with at least seven lawsuits over the disclosure. Coinbase said that it rejected a $20 million ransom demand after staff leaked user data in a major phishing attack, which the exchange said could cost it up to $400 million in damages. If the SEC rescinds the requirement, it may give firms such as Coinbase more time to disclose cybersecurity incidents to the public.

Bitcoin to Lead the Pack Siemer said that for the rest of the year, it will still be a Bitcoin-dominated market, driven by institutional adoption. “No institutions are buying anything but Bitcoin right now,” he said, while adding that Ethereum has begun to see some institutional interest. XRP: Can It Break Its All-Time High? When asked about XRP’s price outlook, Siemer hinted at upcoming developments that could fuel a rally. While remaining tight-lipped, he expressed confidence in the XRP community’s strength. “The army is real,” he said, adding that consistent buying from loyal holders could help XRP revisit its previous all-time high of around $3.50. “I think XRP could hit an all-time high,” Siemer predicted, calling the possibility realistic in the current market environment. Solana: All-Time High Possible Despite Sell Pressure Solana (SOL) has been one of 2025’s most talked-about tokens — and for good reason. According to Siemer, Solana’s recent memecoin mania, growing DeFi sector, and network upgrades set it up for new highs. However, he has observed one lingering challenge: ongoing token unlocks linked to the FTX bankruptcy estate, which could keep applying sell pressure for another couple of years. Despite that, Siemer believes Solana could hit new all-time highs, calling its current setup “really strong.” Smart Contract Blockchain Race Far From Over Siemer also addressed the broader Layer 1 smart contract blockchain race, predicting that no single winner will emerge. “There’s not going to be a winner — there’s going to be winners,” he said, explaining how even the traditional software industry thrives with thousands of viable companies.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|SOL|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-26 03:36:21

Solana is consolidating near $170, with recent technical signals suggesting a pause in its previous uptrend. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is holding firm above $108,000, serving as the market’s anchor but showing more restrained upside as capital looks for higher returns elsewhere. In this climate, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly rising as the early-stage favorite, with analysts spotlighting its potential for massive gains in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Surge and 13,800%+ Upside Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is dominating the early-stage conversation, with Stage 8 nearly sold out and over $8 million raised. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are drawing both retail and institutional buyers in droves. Analysts are projecting up to 40x returns, with some models suggesting an incredible 13,800% upside if current momentum continues. Early adopters can still take advantage of the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% bonus before the $0.007 listing, making MAGA the go-to allocation for those seeking exponential returns before listings trigger the next price discovery phase. As each stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting a new standard for early-stage altcoin excitement. Ethereum (ETH): Steady Growth, Slower Upside Ethereum continues to be a core holding for many, with bullish technicals but a more measured growth outlook. While ETH’s fundamentals remain strong, its near-term returns are being outpaced by the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL): Consolidation, MAGA Grabs Attention Solana is trading between $158 and $175, with analysts watching for a potential breakout if sentiment improves. However, the sharpest capital rotation is now favoring early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. SUI: Gradual Progress, MAGA Outpaces SUI is forecast to reach $5.57 in 2025, offering steady growth, but its trajectory is far outstripped by the rapid accumulation and upside potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion While Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin maintain their foundational roles, the most dramatic growth potential is now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 13,800% ROI, MAGA is the breakout contender for 2025.

While Cardano and SEI are holding their ground and showing gradual progress, the spotlight is shifting to MAGACOIN FINANCE—a presale project now regarded as one of the most strategic early-stage entries for 2025. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Acceleration, 50% Bonus, and Explosive Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly outpacing other early-stage tokens, with Stage 8 nearly full and more than $8 million raised. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and a viral political meme narrative are driving a wave of both retail and institutional accumulation. Notably, a recent $133,000+ whale buy stands as the largest early-stage crypto purchase of the year, highlighting growing conviction in MAGA’s potential. Early participants can still use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% token bonus before the $0.007 listing. Analysts are forecasting up to 12,000% upside, with some models suggesting even greater returns if the current momentum continues. As each stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is reinforcing its reputation as the most strategic entry for those seeking exponential gains in 2025. Bitcoin (BTC): Macro Foundation and Steady Growth Bitcoin is consolidating above $108,000, with analysts eyeing $110,000–$115,000 as the next major milestones. While BTC’s status as the market anchor remains unchallenged, its upside from here is increasingly seen as steady rather than explosive—prompting many investors to seek higher-multiple opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Cardano (ADA): Gradual Progress, MAGA Takes the Lead Cardano is trading near $0.85, with forecasts for a move toward $1.00–$1.30 by year-end if positive sentiment holds. While ADA’s growth is solid, its near-term returns are modest compared to the presale-driven trajectory of MAGACOIN FINANCE. SEI: Slow Climb, MAGA Outpaces SEI is projected to trade between $0.17 and $0.22 in May, but its gradual progress is outshined by the explosive potential and momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Conclusion Bitcoin’s macro strength and Cardano’s steady climb are reassuring, but the most dramatic growth prospects are now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE.

Johnson told CNN’s Jake Tapper on May 25 that he knew nothing about Trump’s May 22 memecoin dinner and opted not to share his opinion on the event, which 35 House Democrats have called for the Justice Department to investigate. “We do not know who was there. The list has not been released. We do not know how much of the money came from outside the country,” Tapper told Johnson. “I really have a difficult time imagining that if this was a Democratic president doing the exact same thing, you wouldn't be outraged.” “Look, I don't know anything about the dinner,” Johnson answered, claiming he “was a little busy this past week,” focusing on passing a $1.6 trillion federal budget funding bill. “I'm not going to comment on something I haven't even heard about. I'm not sure who was there or what the purpose was.” Johnson then claimed Trump was “the most transparent president” in history and “has nothing to hide.” CNN’s Jake Tapper (left) speaking with House Speaker Mike Johnson (right). Source: CNN Democrats have called for the list of attendees of Trump’s crypto dinner event to be released, as they suspect Trump may be accepting foreign investments in violation of federal bribery statutes or the foreign emoluments clause of the Constitution. Under the emoluments clause, the US president is barred from accepting any gift from a foreign state without the approval of Congress. Bloomberg reported on May 7 that a majority of the attendees at the memecoin dinner would likely be foreign nationals. Trump invited those who were among the top 220 largest holders of the Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin to his event at the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia. The most notable attendee was the Chinese-born Tron CEO Justin Sun, the largest holder of the TRUMP token and the biggest backer of the Trumps’ crypto platform World Liberty Financial. Sheldon Xia, the CEO of Cayman Islands-based crypto exchange BitMart, posted pictures to X of himself at the event, while Australian crypto entrepreneur Kain Warwick told The New York Times on May 12 that he would attend the event after stocking up on enough TRUMP to break into the top 25 investors on the leaderboard. In a separate May 22 press conference, several Democrats called for the release of Trump’s memecoin dinner list. One of those speaking was Senator Elizabeth Warren, a fierce crypto critic who called Trump’s memecoin dinner an “orgy of corruption.” Democrats call for Trump to cut crypto ties entirely Several House Democrats, led by Maxine Waters, introduced the ""Stop TRUMP in Crypto Act"" on May 22 to prevent Trump and his family from profiting off crypto while in office. Trump has used the “power of the presidency to shamelessly promote and profit” from a series of crypto ventures, Waters said in a statement. Related: Senators plan to amend GENIUS Act to address Trump family's stablecoin Waters pointed to the TRUMP memecoin, which she claims has increased Trump’s net worth by over $350 million, as well as his involvement in World Liberty Financial and the platform’s stablecoin, USD1.

There was a move above the $655 and $665 resistance levels, like Ethereum and Bitcoin . There was a decent move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $691 swing high to the $653 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $665 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $675 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $672 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $691 swing high to the $653 low. The next resistance sits near the $677 level. A clear move above the $677 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $680. A close above the $680 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $685 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $700 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $675 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $665 level. The next major support is near the $662 level.

Late on Sunday, May 25, Trump announced that he was extending the deadline for a 50% tariff on the European Union until July 9. He previously said the tariffs would come into effect on June 1. “I received a call today from Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, requesting an extension on the June 1st deadline on the 50% Tariff with respect to Trade and the European Union,” he posted on his social media platform, Truth Social. “I agreed to the extension,” he said before adding, “It was my privilege to do so.” Tariff Flipflops Cause Market Turmoil On May 26, the European Commission President said Europe is ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively, adding, “To reach a good deal, we would need the time until July 9.” Good call with @POTUS . The EU and US share the world’s most consequential and close trade relationship. Europe is ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively. To reach a good deal, we would need the time until July 9. — Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) May 25, 2025 Whether intentionally or not, Trump has caused major market volatility and turmoil recently with his constant changing of tariff policies and dates. This has left nations and investors in limbo as to what is really going on and when or if deals can be made. The only deal made so far is with the United Kingdom. “The European Union, which was formed for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the United States on TRADE, has been very difficult to deal with,” Trump said just days before, on May 23. “Our discussions with them are going nowhere,” he said while proposing 50% tariffs on EU goods. The United States is the EU’s largest trading partner. It purchases 21% of its exports, the leading one being pharmaceuticals, with other exports including vehicles, aircraft, engines and motors, machinery, petroleum oils, and alcoholic beverages, according to EU data. Crypto Market Reaction Crypto markets fell late last week, dropping 4% from their multi-month high as tariff tensions rose again. Total capitalization is currently $3.56 trillion, having gained 2.5% over the past 12 hours since Trump’s latest tariff u-turn. However, there could be more volatility in store this week with GDP and inflation data due in the United States. Bitcoin, which has dominated sentiment recently, was up 1.5% on the day, trading at $109,650 at the time of writing, recovering from a weekend low of $106,800, according to Coingecko.

45106432,https://cryptonews.com/?p=364647,1748235400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/45106432.jpeg,Bitcoin Tops $109K as Trump Extends EU Tariff Deadline,https://cryptonews.com/news/trump-pushes-back-eu-tariffs-bitcoin-breaks-109k/,"Bitcoin rose above $109,600 on Monday, rising 1.4% after US President Donald Trump unexpectedly extended a deadline to impose steep tariffs on EU goods, easing market concerns and supporting risk assets. The surge followed Trump’s decision late Sunday to push back the potential introduction of 50% tariffs on EU imports to July 9. Just two days earlier, the president had threatened to enact the tariffs by June 1 due to slow progress in trade negotiations with the EU. Trump Tariff Delay Signals Possible Thaw in US-EU Trade Tensions The delay followed a productive call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who sought additional time to secure a favorable agreement. This de-escalation reduced fears of an imminent trade war, which had previously weighed on global markets. Last month, Trump announced an initial 20% tariff on EU goods, but soon revised it to 10% with a grace period until early July. The shifting timeline reflects the administration’s unpredictable trade strategy, which has continued to rattle global markets. However, investors welcomed the latest reprieve, viewing it as a sign of possible resolution and improved dialogue between Washington and Brussels. Market sentiment had already begun to stabilize after a volatile stretch in April, when growth fears and aggressive trade posturing prompted a broad sell-off across asset classes. Analysts say the pause in tariff escalation has helped lift appetite for risk, leading traders to rotate into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Hit ATH Above $111K on ETF Momentum and Risk-On Sentiment The move in Bitcoin is also tied to broader structural demand. Last week, the asset briefly touched a record high of $111,814 , buoyed by continued inflows from exchange-traded funds and corporate investors. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net weekly inflows of $2.75b between May 19 and May 23, according to data provider SoSoValue . Ethereum ETFs posted $248m in inflows during the same period, with no outflows across the board. Over the past 18 months, Bitcoin has outpaced the S&P 500 by more than 100 percentage points, cementing its role as a high-beta asset that draws capital during risk-on cycles. Investors have increasingly followed the lead of corporate buyers like MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, who helped normalize large-scale Bitcoin accumulation among institutions. Monday’s rally serves as a reminder of how sensitive Bitcoin remains to macroeconomic developments, particularly shifts in US trade policy. While the de-escalation offered immediate relief, market participants remain cautious, mindful of how quickly sentiment can reverse in response to the next political move.

Both cases show the increasing tension between decentralized technologies and established legal systems, raising questions about the evolving relationship between law, jurisdiction, and digital rights. Mango Markets Hacker Acquitted of Fraud Charges in Major Legal Setback for DOJ A US judge has thrown out key fraud convictions against Avraham Eisenberg, the trader accused of orchestrating a $110 million exploit of decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Mango Markets. The ruling is a significant development in one of crypto's most closely watched courtroom battles, raising pressing questions about jurisdiction, legal definitions of fraud, and the limits of regulation in decentralized finance. Judge Arun Subramanian of the Southern District of New York ruled Friday that Eisenberg could not be convicted in the venue where the case was brought, vacating two counts of fraud and acquitting him of a third, wire fraud-related charge. The judge found that prosecutors failed to establish sufficient ties between Eisenberg’s actions and the jurisdiction of the New York court. In a sharply worded opinion, Judge Subramanian said prosecutors could not prove that Eisenberg, who was operating from Puerto Rico at the time of the incident, had any actionable connection to New York. ”He didn't make trades in New York, call or email anyone in New York, or go to New York in connection with his scheme,” Subramanian wrote. “There is no allegation that the Mango Markets platform had ties to New York.” The Department of Justice had previously argued that Eisenberg’s use of an automated trading platform hosted on servers based in New York, along with the fact that at least one Mango Markets user from New York attempted to withdraw funds during the incident, should qualify as sufficient grounds for venue. But Subramanian found those arguments lacking, determining that the evidence presented at trial fell short of establishing venue under constitutional and statutory standards. Even more striking was the judge’s decision to acquit Eisenberg on a third count, wire fraud, not only due to venue issues but also on substantive grounds. Eisenberg’s trading activity, which involved manipulating Mango’s price oracle to inflate the value of his collateral before taking out massive loans, was not found to violate existing wire fraud statutes. “On a platform with no rules, instructions, or prohibitions about borrowing, the government needed more to show that Eisenberg made an implicit misrepresentation by allowing the algorithm to measure the actual value of his collateral,” Subramanian wrote. Eisenberg had defended his actions as legal, arguing that he simply executed a well-designed arbitrage strategy on a poorly architected platform. His legal team consistently maintained that no formal guidelines or safeguards were in place to prevent the strategy he used. A Blow to Prosecutors—and a Warning About DeFi Regulation The outcome represents a serious blow to federal prosecutors, who had aimed to set a precedent in holding individuals accountable for manipulation on decentralized protocols. With Mango Markets operating as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and its codebase open to all, Eisenberg’s case has served as a bellwether for how US law might be applied to DeFi platforms. Legal experts are divided on the implications. Some argue the ruling highlights the urgent need for updated regulations that reflect the structure and behavior of decentralized platforms. Others see it as a cautionary tale for regulators attempting to apply legacy legal frameworks to crypto-native environments. While Eisenberg may have sidestepped a major legal challenge tied to the Mango exploit, he is not free of legal jeopardy. In April, he was sentenced to four years in prison for possession of child sexual abuse material, an unrelated charge that carries serious consequences. That conviction stands independently of his activity in the crypto markets. Now, Justice Department officials must determine whether to refile charges related to Mango Markets in a more appropriate venue. Given the complexity of DeFi operations and the ambiguity in current law, that decision could have far-reaching implications. The case also comes amid the backdrop of Mango Markets' own demise. Once seen as a promising DeFi protocol built on the Solana blockchain, the platform officially ceased operations earlier this year following a string of controversies, governance disputes, and ongoing litigation. The Eisenberg exploit in October 2022 was widely blamed for hastening the platform’s decline. After draining over $100 million in value from the protocol, Eisenberg briefly returned a portion of the funds under a governance agreement with Mango’s DAO, only to later be arrested in Puerto Rico by US authorities. Pavel Durov Barred from Oslo Freedom Forum by French Court Amid Free Speech Dispute In other legal news, Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov, a prominent voice for digital privacy and freedom of speech, will no longer attend the Oslo Freedom Forum in person after French courts denied his request to travel to Norway. The decision has stirred backlash among free speech advocates, especially amid escalating concerns over political censorship in Europe. Durov, who resides in France, had been slated to headline the Oslo Freedom Forum, which is an influential global event organized by the Human Rights Foundation (HRF), with a keynote speech championing individual liberty and resistance to authoritarian overreach. While he will still appear virtually via livestream, his absence from the physical stage has sparked questions about the motivations behind the travel restriction and broader implications for dissent in the tech world. Human Rights Foundation Condemns Travel Ban The HRF publicly criticized the French judiciary’s move, calling it an affront to the ideals the forum seeks to uphold. “It is unfortunate that French courts would block Mr. Durov from participating in an event where his voice is so needed,” said HRF founder and CEO Thor Halvorssen in a statement released over the weekend. The Oslo Freedom Forum is known for convening dissidents, journalists, activists, and technologists committed to the cause of human rights. Durov, widely viewed as one of the tech industry's most uncompromising advocates for privacy and decentralization, has been a regular figure at such events. The controversy over Durov’s travel ban comes just days after the Telegram founder accused French intelligence services of pressuring him to censor conservative political content on Telegram ahead of Romania’s upcoming elections. According to a Telegram post on May 18, Durov described a private meeting in Paris where Nicolas Lerner, head of France’s General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI), allegedly made the request. “This spring at the Salon des Batailles, in the Hôtel de Crillon, Nicolas Lerner, head of French intelligence, asked me to ban conservative voices in Romania ahead of elections. I refused,” Durov wrote in a follow-up post on X. “We didn’t block protesters in Russia, Belarus, or Iran. We won’t start doing it in Europe.” Though initially vague about the official and the country involved, Durov’s direct accusation against Lerner has since reverberated through tech and policy circles, particularly in the context of increasing government scrutiny over encrypted messaging platforms and their role in electoral integrity. In his May 18 Telegram post, Durov pushed back against what he described as the hypocrisy of European officials attempting to justify censorship in the name of democracy. Durov has previously stated that if pressured to implement political censorship or surveillance measures, Telegram would exit the affected market rather than compromise its users’ rights. This stance has earned him both praise and criticism from governments around the world. Legal and Political Fallout in France The travel ban has fueled speculation that French authorities may be retaliating against Durov’s refusal to cooperate with intelligence demands. Legal experts note that while Durov’s legal issues in France have not been made public in detail, the move to bar him from attending a human rights forum abroad is “highly unusual” and potentially politically motivated. Durov’s allegations and the French court's ruling come at a sensitive time for the European Union, which has been intensifying its regulatory oversight of tech platforms under the Digital Services Act (DSA). The legislation mandates stricter content moderation practices and imposes penalties for platforms deemed to enable misinformation, hate speech, or election interference. While the DSA aims to protect users and uphold democratic norms, critics argue it grants governments excessive leverage over platform content and opens the door to politically biased censorship. Durov’s claims suggest that such powers may already be used to manipulate political narratives. Telegram, which boasts over 900 million users globally, has emerged as a critical tool for activists and dissidents across authoritarian regimes. Its refusal to compromise on encryption and user privacy has placed it at odds with authorities in countries such as Russia, Iran, and now, seemingly, within the European Union.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-26 05:00:00

Institutional inflows and technical support continue to underpin BTC’s dominance, but the most dynamic capital is now rotating into early-stage projects with outsized upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the standout in this cycle, drawing increasing attention from analysts and traders who see it as the next major breakout. Ethereum, Solana, and Toncoin remain in the conversation, but MAGA’s momentum is capturing the spotlight in smart money circles. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Momentum and 11,000%+ Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting a new standard for early-stage altcoins, with Stage 8 nearly full and over $8 million raised as demand continues to accelerate. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling a surge in both retail and institutional participation. Analysts are now projecting 35x–50x returns as a conservative baseline, with some models targeting up to 11,000%–18,500% upside if the current trajectory holds. Early buyers can still leverage the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% bonus before the $0.007 listing, making MAGA the go-to allocation for those seeking exponential gains. As each stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is solidifying its reputation as the breakout early-stage opportunity of 2025. Ethereum (ETH): Steady Growth, MAGA Accelerates Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, supported by bullish technicals and robust institutional adoption. While ETH’s long-term prospects remain strong, its near-term growth is now more measured compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL): Bullish Structure, MAGA Outshines Solana is trading around $170, with analysts watching for a breakout above $175 to retest $183 and potentially higher. Despite SOL’s strong fundamentals and ecosystem expansion, the sharpest capital rotation is now moving toward early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Toncoin (TON): Quiet Progress, MAGA Leads Toncoin continues to make incremental gains, but its near-term upside is overshadowed by the presale-driven surge and community buzz of MAGACOIN FINANCE. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Conclusion Bitcoin’s stability and blue-chip altcoins like Ethereum and Solana offer reassurance, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is where the most dramatic growth potential is now unfolding. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 11,000% ROI, MAGA is the breakout altcoin to watch for 2025.

The modest recovery comes after a volatile week in which Bitcoin ( BTC ) briefly reached an all-time high of $111,814 on May 22 before falling to about $107,500. The asset is still up by 15% in the last 30 days. Derivatives of Bitcoin also saw an increase in market activity. Data Coinglass shows that 24-hour open interest increased 2.59% to $76.66 billion, while trading volume increased 10.85% to $89.91 billion. Rising derivatives volume and open interest usually indicate renewed trader confidence and a build -up of positions, frequently in anticipation of volatility or upward price movement. The rebound came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Sunday, May 25, that he had agreed to extend a June 1 deadline for imposing 50% tariffs on EU goods. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had requested more time for trade talks and a new deadline has been set for July 9. “I received a call today from Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, requesting an extension on the June 1st deadline on the 50% Tariff with respect to Trade and the European Union. I agreed to the extension — July 9, 2025 — It was my privilege to do so.” — U.S. President Donald Trump You might also like: Bitcoin bottleneck: Demand outmints supply, who’s to blame? The announcement followed a brief period of tension. Global markets were alarmed when Trump threatened to implement the 50% tariffs on May 23 if negotiations failed. For the time being, the abrupt reversal has provided some reprieve. Financial markets responded positively to the decision, with U.S. equity futures edging higher. S&P 500 futures gained 0.9%, Dow futures rose 0.8%, and Nasdaq-100 futures were up 1% in early Monday trading. Gold, meanwhile, dipped 0.3% to $3,346.59 an ounce. As risk appetite improves, the decline in gold prices points to a move away from conventional safe-havens. This change in sentiment has helped Bitcoin, which is frequently seen as a speculative risk asset. In the meantime, traders have been able to temporarily reset expectations thanks to the de-escalation, although Trump’s trade policies are still causing uncertainty in international markets. Both the cryptocurrency and traditional markets will be keeping an eye on any new developments in the U.S.-EU negotiations now that the July deadline has been set.

But despite the bullish momentum, there are signs that the rally may be hitting a wall. The $2,800 level is emerging as a critical zone of resistance, and a closer look at on-chain and technical data suggests that selling pressure could rise as Ethereum ( ETH ) inches closer to it. According to a May 24 post by Glassnode, there’s a notable cluster of investor cost basis levels around $2,800. This means that many holders who previously bought at that level, and have been underwater for months, may now see a chance to exit at break-even. As ETH approaches this zone, those investors could add significant sell-side pressure to the market. https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1926171433639489555?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw Adding to the caution, sentiment in the futures market appears to be shifting. In a May 25 post , Santiment contributor ShayanMarkets noted a sharp drop in Ethereum’s Taker Buy-Sell Ratio, a metric that tracks whether aggressive market participants are leaning more toward buying or selling. The 14-day moving average for the ratio is falling, indicating that the derivatives market is being taken over by sellers. This could point to a more substantial correction if the trend continues.

The token is still trading above all significant short- and mid-term moving averages on the daily chart, an overall bullish sign. Since ETH is also trading above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, the longer-term trend appears to be healthy as well. ETH price analysis. Credit: crypto.news But there are indications that the rally is cooling. Following a strong expansion earlier this month, the Bollinger Bands have begun to tighten, indicating that volatility may be easing. Ethereum is currently trading near the midline of the Bollinger Band, indicating that the market is undecided. At roughly 63.9, the relative strength index is holding steady in bullish territory, but it is no longer overbought. However, the moving average convergence divergence has begun to flatten out and just displayed a bearish crossover, which may be an early warning sign of the waning momentum. From here, two scenarios could possible play out. If the $2,800 resistance breaks convincingly, especially with the SEC’s decision on staking of Ethereum ETFs due by June 1, ETH could make a quick move toward $3,000 and beyond. Institutional demand through yield-bearing ETFs would be a powerful tailwind. However, if selling pressure builds up around $2,800, particularly from aggressive futures traders and break-even sellers, Ethereum might undergo a healthy correction and perhaps bounce back to the $2,200 support before any new leg higher.

Despite recent legal uncertainty, the token has been trading within a narrow weekly range of $2.29 to $2.47, up 7% over the last month, and 1.4% over the previous day. CoinGlass data shows that open interest rose 2.25% to $4.76 billion and XRP ( XRP ) derivatives trading volume increased 25.82% to $3.14 billion over the last day, indicating increased speculative activity and renewed trader positioning. Spot trading volume also jumped 40 to $1.86 billion, reflecting rising interest in XRP. Much of that attention now turns to the SEC’s closed-door meeting, which could revive settlement talks with Ripple. Tensions escalated earlier this month when Judge Analisa Torres rejected the SEC’s attempt to modify her final ruling by lifting XRP’s institutional sales ban and reducing Ripple’s $125 million penalty. Following the rejection on May 15, XRP fell from $2.65 to $2.26, showing increased investor anxiety. Thursday’s meeting may provide the quorum needed to resume negotiations. Legal analysts, including pro-XRP attorney John Deaton, believe the SEC would need to acknowledge XRP as a commodity for progress to be made, a move that could reshape the legal landscape and boost institutional confidence.

The appeals court could also toss out the SEC’s case on procedural grounds, though that remains unlikely. On the technical front, XRP is in a state of indecision. At 51, the relative strength index indicates neutral momentum. The stochastic oscillator shows short-term upside potential with a possible buy signal from oversold levels. But the moving average convergence divergence is still a little bearish. XRP price analysis. Credit: crypto.news Meanwhile, Bollinger Bands are getting tighter around the current price, suggesting that a bigger move might be on the horizon. While a decline below support could pave the way for additional downside, a break above the upper band might spark fresh bullish momentum. XRP is still trading above important long-term moving averages despite mixed short-term signals. This shows that the deeper structural support is still intact. The token may return to $2.65 if it breaks above $2.47, but it runs the risk of continuing the correction toward $2.20 if it falls below $2.29. For now, XRP remains stuck in a tight range, awaiting its next big catalyst.

Nvidia plans to start mass production of the new AI chips in June, which will be part of the firm’s latest generation of AI chips, Reuters reported on May 26, citing people familiar with the matter. The company plans to sell it for between $6,500 and $8,000 owing to its lower specifications and simple manufacturing requirements — cheaper than the some $10,000 to $12,000 Nvidia’s recently restricted H20 model sold for. An Nvidia spokesperson told Reuters it was still evaluating the company’s limited options. “Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the US government, we are effectively foreclosed from China’s $50 billion data center market,” they said. China is a massive market for the chipmaker, accounting for 13% of its sales in the past financial year. In April, the US government informed Nvidia that export licenses were required for its popular H20 chips. The restrictions specifically mentioned China, and the government cited concern over the risk that the technology “may be used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China.” According to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, its market share in China has plummeted from 95% before 2022, when US export restrictions first impacted its products, to 50% currently. Jensen Huang on Taiwanese TV. Source: Yahoo/TVBS “We will continue to make tremendous efforts to optimize compliant products and continue serving the Chinese market,” he said on Taiwanese TV last week. It is the company’s third attempt to create China-compliant chips, and the new chip is designed to meet current US bandwidth limits of 1.7 terabytes per second. Related: Anthropic debuts most powerful AI yet amid ‘whistleblowing’ controversy Nvidia’s main rival is Shenzhen-based Huawei, which is testing and preparing to ship a new AI chip called the Ascend 910D . Nvidia earnings eagerly awaited The news comes a couple of days before the firm is due to release its quarterly earnings report, which is due on May 28. The chip manufacturer’s stock finished last week down around 3%, breaking a streak of four straight weekly gains. Analysts on average expect Nvidia to report quarterly revenue of $43.4 billion, 66% higher year-over-year, and adjusted net income of $21.3 billion, according to Investopedia. “We see upside … despite the loss of H20 sales to China,” said Oppenheimer analysts.

Bessent, now the CEO of Key Square Group, believes that U.S.-backed stablecoins could create a massive $2 trillion demand for U.S. Treasuries, a move that could reshape global finance and strengthen the U.S. dollar’s dominance. “We are going big on digital assets,” Bessent said. He explained that the current U.S. administration is focused on creating clear rules for digital assets and encouraging companies to stay and build in the country. This is a big shift from past policies, which Bessent says drove many crypto businesses overseas. Stablecoins Could Become Top Buyers of U.S. Treasuries According to Bessent, bringing strong U.S. regulations and anti-money laundering (AML) standards to stablecoins is a top priority. He also mentioned market estimates suggesting that stablecoin issuers could soon hold around $2 trillion in U.S. Treasuries and T-bills — a huge jump from the current $300 billion. This prediction lines up with a recent comment from Senator Bill Hagerty, who shared a Citibank report forecasting that by 2030, stablecoin issuers could become the biggest buyers of U.S. Treasuries, even ahead of major foreign countries like China. This view is also shared by other top financial leaders, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who has called tokenization the future of finance. Scott Bessent says a bank issued stablecoin could provide $2 trillion worth of demand for U.S. Treasuries. He doesn't confirm or deny the rumor that $JPM , $BAC , $C and $WFC are planning to issue a shared crypto stablecoin authorized by the Federal Reserve. https://t.co/KxCnExG7HM pic.twitter.com/OH8MwHQDJW — Financelot (@FinanceLancelot) May 24, 2025 A new U.S. stablecoin bill is on track to pass the Senate, marking a step toward establishing formal regulations for the crypto industry. The legislation, part of the GENIUS Act, would require stablecoins to be fully backed by safe, liquid assets such as Treasury bills and enforce strict anti-money laundering and anti-terror financing rules. In the event of a collapse, stablecoin holders would have priority in recovering their funds.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $5.75. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $1.14 Market cap $1.14B Trading volume $472.79M Circulating supply 998.84M WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.000023 on November 2023 24-hour high $1.18 24-hour low $1.02 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 27.39% 50-day SMA $0.671 14-Day RSI 64.10 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $1.288 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis: WIF sees short-term gains, but consolidation persists TL;DR Breakdown WIF is up 3.7% today. Bulls might try to regain control if the price holds above $1.19. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF shows signs of consolidation The WIF/USDT price analysis for May 26 shows a slight uptrend, recently gaining 3.7%. WIF is testing resistance at $1.19, which may cause a pause or consolidation. The RSI is at 66.04, nearing overbought levels, signaling the possibility of a full-blown price pullback. Likewise, the MACD shows bearish momentum, with the MACD line below the signal line, but the gap between them is narrow, indicating price consolidation. WIF shows signs of consolidation Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: WIF sees short-term gains The 4-hour chart shows a bullish trend with the Alligator Indicator aligned positively. The OBV is also rising, confirming the short-term price increase is backed by strong volume. Likewise, the Balance of Power reads 0.40, showing positive buying pressure. WIF sees short-term gains Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.9016 BUY SMA 5 $0.9934 BUY SMA 10 $1.0067 BUY SMA 21 $0.9221 BUY SMA 50 $0.6717 BUY SMA 100 $0.6303 BUY SMA 200 $1.2889 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.8665 BUY EMA 5 $0.7455 BUY EMA 10 $0.6099 BUY EMA 21 $0.5380 BUY EMA 50 $0.6052 BUY EMA 100 $0.9191 BUY EMA 200 $1.3597 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? In the short term, the WIF price analysis shows price gains, even though the broader perspective reflects consolidation, suggesting that the next sell point could be around resistance at $1.19. A break above this level could push WIF towards $1.33. Should the bears take over the market, the $1 support level becomes critical. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1 by the end of 2025 and about $3 to $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

Rising bond yields and political tensions have pushed institutional investors toward Bitcoin as a hedge. Technically, BTC sits at a key decision point, facing resistance near $110,000 and support around $107,500. Meanwhile, on-chain data shows short-term holders beginning to exit, hinting that the current bull run may be approaching its peak. Looking at the market scenario, in a recent X post, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki declared that Bitcoin is making it “so easy” to get rich, yet most people still don’t see it. He pointed out that even owning just 0.01 BTC could be “priceless” in the next two years. Having said that, Kiyosaki is confident that Bitcoin’s window of opportunity is closing fast, and sitting on the sidelines could be the costliest mistake. I cannot believe how easy Bitcoin has made getting rich…so easy. Why everyone is not buying and holding Bitcoin is beyond me. Even .01 of a Bitcoin is going to be priceless in two years…. and maybe make you very rich. Sure Bitcoin goes up and down….but so does real life.… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) May 26, 2025 Bitcoin Scarcity is Real Kiyosaki has been a longtime believer in Bitcoin’s potential . He sees it as a secure hedge against government manipulation and inflation, thanks to its fixed supply and decentralized nature. According to Kiyosaki, there are only 1 to 2 million Bitcoins left to be mined. Once those are gone, the fixed supply of 21 million will cap forever. This built-in scarcity is a key factor behind his bullish outlook. Recently, he predicted that Bitcoin could reach $250,000 this year . Referencing macro investor Raoul Pal’s theory of the “Banana Zone,” he believes BTC could soon enter a parabolic phase of growth fueled by tight supply and growing demand. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : ETH, XRP, BNB & SOL: Which Altcoin Could Outperform in 2025? , Don’t Be a “Yellow Banana” Several prominent analysts echo Kiyosaki’s views. Raoul Pal sees macroeconomic conditions aligning perfectly for Bitcoin’s next surge. Michael Saylor continues to push the digital gold narrative, with MicroStrategy regularly adding BTC to its balance sheet. Anthony Pompliano also predicts a long-term uptrend driven by increasing institutional involvement and limited supply. In typical Kiyosaki style, he warns against being a “yellow banana”, his metaphor for those too afraid or unaware to act. He urges early investors to listen to experts like Raoul Pal and follow educational sources like Bitcoin Zella. As Kiyosaki puts it, this may be “the easiest time in history” to achieve financial freedom. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The capital, secured through convertible loans, will enable H100 to purchase about 20.18 Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor teased another Bitcoin purchase after the firm’s recent acquisition of 7,390 BTC. Additionally, Cardone Capital launched its fourth hybrid real estate and Bitcoin fund, aiming to redefine asset diversification by blending commercial property cash flow with BTC accumulation. H100 Buys Bitcoin and Secures $2.2 Million Swedish health tech company H100 Group AB secured 21 million Swedish krona (or approximately $2.2 million) in a new funding round led by Blockstream CEO and renowned Bitcoin advocate Adam Back. The funding was announced just days after H100 revealed its pivot toward adopting Bitcoin as part of its corporate treasury strategy. Adam Back personally contributed around $1.4 million to the round, with the remaining $800,000 coming from investment firms including Morten Klein, Alundo Invest AS, Race Venture Scandinavia AB, and Crafoord Capital Partners. The funds were raised through interest-free convertible loans that mature in June of 2028, with investors given the option to convert their loans into equity at a rate of 1.3 Swedish krona (approximately 11 cents) per share. If H100’s stock price trades at least 33% above that conversion price for a cumulative total of 60 trading days, the company may mandate conversion, which could result in the issuance of over 16 million new shares and a potential 12% dilution. At current prices, the new capital will enable H100 to purchase about 20.18 Bitcoin, adding to the 4.39 Bitcoin it acquired on May 22. This would bring its total holdings to approximately 24.57 Bitcoin, making it the first public company in Sweden to adopt a Bitcoin treasury policy and one of the earliest adopters in Europe. The decision already impacted the market, with H100’s shares rising 37% on the day of the announcement and a further 5.33% the next day, climbing to 1.29 SEK (14 cents), according to Bloomberg data . H100’s CEO, Sander Andersen , stated that the company's mission to provide proactive health tools outside of the traditional healthcare system resonates with the values of individual sovereignty found in the Bitcoin community. The company plans to appeal to customers seeking more control over their health decisions, which is similar to the ethos that drives Bitcoin adoption. H100 now joins a growing list of companies integrating Bitcoin into their balance sheets. Data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET shows that 112 public firms globally hold Bitcoin, with only ten of those based in Europe. Saylor Hints at More Bitcoin Buys Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy, also recently hinted at another Bitcoin purchase by the company after the asset’s pullback from its record high of $112,000 on May 22. In a post to his followers on X, Saylor reaffirmed his conviction in Bitcoin by stating, ”I only buy Bitcoin with money I can't afford to lose.” The statement was made shortly after Strategy’s latest acquisition of 7,390 BTC on May 19, which was valued at nearly $765 million. This brought the firm’s total holdings to 576,230 BTC. Should another buy occur on May 26, it will be Strategy’s seventh consecutive week of Bitcoin accumulation. Strategy firmly established itself as the corporate face of Bitcoin adoption, with its relentless accumulation of BTC for treasury purposes influencing an institutional trend. This sustained demand from major entities like Strategy is widely seen as a key factor supporting Bitcoin’s current valuation levels and long-term bullish outlook. Some market analysts believe Strategy’s approach could ultimately propel it into uncharted corporate territory. Jeff Walton, a financial analyst, predicted that Strategy could eventually become a $10 trillion enterprise, and could surpass all other publicly traded companies in value. Walton argued that no other firm holds as much ”pristine collateral” as Strategy does, and believes that while most companies struggle to raise capital, Strategy managed to secure billions in under two months. Instead of using that capital for traditional operational expenditures, Strategy channels it into Bitcoin, which positioned it as a high-conviction outlier in corporate finance. Saylor consistently described Bitcoin as the world’s best long-term store of value, and projected that its price could reach millions of dollars per coin over the next few decades. He sees Bitcoin’s fixed supply as a fundamental advantage over fiat currencies, which are subject to inflationary pressure and policy manipulation. Nonetheless, Bitcoin still faced some difficulty climbing past the $150,000 mark. Saylor attributed this stagnation to short-term profit-taking and a lack of long-term conviction among some investors. Hybrid Fund Offers Real Estate and Bitcoin Exposure Cardone Capital , a real estate investment firm managing more than $5 billion in assets, launched the 10X Miami River Bitcoin Fund. This is an innovative dual-asset fund combining a 346-unit multifamily commercial property on the Miami River in Miami, Florida, with $15 million worth of Bitcoin. It is the firm’s fourth hybrid investment vehicle blending income-generating real estate with BTC, and its goal is to redefine how investors gain exposure to both asset classes. Grant Cardone , founder and CEO of Cardone Capital, revealed that the idea for the fund was sparked by a suggestion from his brother, who asked him to consider the historical impact of converting real estate cash flow into Bitcoin over the past 12 years. After discovering that such a strategy could have turned $160 million into approximately $3 billion, Cardone was inspired to create a fund that buys real estate, adds Bitcoin to the mix, and uses the real estate’s monthly cash flows to purchase more BTC over time. (Source: Cardone Capital ) Cardone’s long-term vision is for the firm to buy $1 billion in real estate and $200 million in Bitcoin as treasury assets across its hybrid fund offerings. By merging income-producing hard assets with Bitcoin’s deflationary properties as a store of value, the firm is positioning itself as a disruptive force in the real estate investment landscape, and could potentially challenge the appeal of traditional REITs and other commercial real estate funds. Grant Cardone A core mission of these blended funds is to make Bitcoin more accessible to investors who may shy away from the asset because of its technical complexities. Cardone explained that the fund allows investors to participate in real estate—a familiar and trusted vehicle—while also seamlessly gaining exposure to Bitcoin, which the firm manages on their behalf. To promote adoption, Cardone Capital is exploring innovative initiatives like rewarding tenants with Satoshis for good rental behavior, which could help introduce them to Bitcoin without the need for technical knowledge. Cardone also mentioned ongoing collaborations with financial firms to develop a hybrid Bitcoin mortgage product, which could allow clients to borrow against both their Bitcoin holdings and real estate equity.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-26 05:44:02

A rebellion against the beige and boring of traditional finance. This article dives into three electrifying contenders currently charging the space: BTFD Coin, Dogwifhat, and Toshi. If you’re wondering what the best crypto to buy now is before the rocket launches, these three are stealing the spotlight. But make no mistake: time is running out, and for one of them, the window shuts tomorrow. Yes, BTFD Coin’s presale wraps up on May 26th, and the launch fireworks start on May 27th. Oh, and the 300% token bonus with the code LAUNCH300? It’s a degen delight. The hype is real: BTFD Coin has already raised a whopping $7.14 million, with over 12,400 coin holders and 75 billion $BTFD coins sold. It’s not just a meme coin presale—it’s a phenomenon. But below, there’s something equally spicy: the referral rewards that could change the game for smart, social investors looking to hustle their way into a 12X boom. BTFD Coin — Referral Riches + Degenerate Dreams BTFD Coin isn’t here to play nice. It’s a meme coin presale designed for the bold—those who buy the dip, flex the gains, and build their tribe. And now, thanks to their referral program, that tribe can make you bank. Say you connect your wallet, grab your referral code, and hustle it out. Every time someone drops $50 or more using your code, they get an extra 10% $BTFD, and if you hit the top 20 leaderboard, you rake in 10% of the coin value in BTFD tokens at month’s end. That’s passive degen income. Imagine this: you drop your code into a Discord chat or tweet it out. A friend FOMOs in with $500. They get $550 worth of $BTFD. You? You score $50 in tokens. Multiply that by a few dozen times, and you’re stacking $BTFD like a meme lord on a mission. And it gets juicier. The presale price right now is just $0.0002, but the listing is predicted at $0.0006 on May 27th. Analysts are already speculating on a breakout to $0.006 in the post-launch hype cycle. That’s a potential 2900% ROI if you slide in today. Here’s a wild-but-possible scenario: You invest $700 at the current $0.0002 rate. That bags you 3.5 million $BTFD coins.

In April, the U.S. tightened export rules on certain chips made by Nvidia and AMD, even after the Trump administration lifted one controversial rule put in place by President Biden. These moves have prompted Chinese firms to adapt quickly to keep their AI plans on track. Both companies discussed their strategies during recent earnings calls. Tencent’s president, Martin Lau, and Baidu’s AI cloud head, Dou Shen, each laid out how they plan to push ahead despite limits on high-end processing units. Tencent has a “pretty strong stockpile” of GPUs Lau said Tencent has built up “a pretty strong stockpile” of graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are critical for training large AI models. By buying ahead, the company secured enough chips to fuel its research for the next several “generations” of models. GPUs offer the raw computing power needed to sift through immense volumes of data and help models learn patterns. But Lau argued that adding more GPUs isn’t always the best route to better results. Instead, Tencent has focused on squeezing more performance out of the chips it already holds. “That actually sort of helped us to look at our existing inventory of high-end chips and say, we should have enough high-end chips to continue our training of models for a few more generations going forward,” Lau said. For running AI tasks, known as inferencing, Tencent is using “software optimization” to make each GPU more efficient. Lau added that the company is exploring smaller, leaner AI models that demand far less computing power and can still deliver strong outcomes. “We just need to sort of keep exploring these venues and spend probably more time on the software side, rather than just brute force buying GPUs,” Lau said. He also noted that Tencent can lean on custom-designed chips and semiconductors produced within China. Baidu can build apps using its full-stack AI Baidu , which runs the country’s biggest search engine, pointed to its “full-stack” setup. This means it controls everything from the cloud servers where data lives to the AI models themselves—like its ERNIE chatbot—and the applications built on top of those models. “Even without access to the most advanced chips, our unique full-stack AI capabilities enable us to build strong applications and deliver meaningful value,” said Dou Shen, president of Baidu’s AI cloud division. Baidu’s leaders also highlighted their software tricks to lower the cost of running AI workloads. Because Baidu owns much of its technology stack, it can tweak each layer—from the infrastructure up—to get more out of every GPU it owns. “With foundation models driving up the need for a massive computing power, the abilities to build and manage large scale GPU clusters and to utilize GPUs effectively has become key competitive advantages,” Shen said. To cushion the blow from U.S. chip curbs, Baidu and others have also turned to Chinese-made semiconductors. Shen said homegrown chips, paired with an ever-more efficient local software stack, will form “a strong foundation for long-term innovation” in China’s AI sector. China has been pushing hard to build its own chip industry in recent years. While most experts agree that domestic GPUs and AI chips still lag behind U.S. offerings, they say progress is clear. Analyst Gaurav Gupta of Gartner noted that stockpiling is just one tactic; China’s firms have also made steady gains across materials, equipment, chip design and packaging. “They have achieved decent success,” Gupta said in an email, adding that these homegrown chips may not yet match U.S. leaders but “continue to make progress.” In Washington and Silicon Valley, some U.S. executives have urged a rethink of export limits. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, called the curbs a “failure” this week, arguing they do more harm to American companies than to Chinese buyers.

The New York-listed DDC Enterprise, also known as DayDayCook, said on May 23 that it bought 21 Bitcoin ( BTC ) in exchange for 254,333 shares in a deal valued at $2.28 million. The company added it plans on buying another 79 BTC across two purchases in “the coming days” to bring its total Bitcoin stack to 100 BTC. The buys are part of DDC’s plan announced on May 15 to acquire 5,000 BTC over the next three years, with the goal of buying 500 BTC before the end of 2025. DDC’s planned 5,000 BTC stack, if it held that much today, would land it just outside the top 10 public companies with the largest Bitcoin holdings, putting it just behind Japanese investment firm Metaplanet, which holds 7,800 BTC, according to data from Bitbo. DDC Enterprise (DDC) shares closed the May 23 trading session down by 14.5% but rose 2.43% after the bell to $3.79, according to Google Finance. DDC is down over 27% so far this year. Shares of DDC Enterprise fell more than 14% on May 23, however, the stock recovered after the bell.

Chinese electric vehicle retailer Jiuzi Holdings said on May 22 that its board approved a plan to purchase 1,000 BTC over the next year by issuing shares of its company and by directly buying Bitcoin.

With institutional adoption like from banks are rising, on-chain metrics heating up , and ETF odds are higher in 2025 . Moreover, Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC nearing its end , many investors are asking: Will XRP reach 100? Could the XRP price prediction of $500 actually happen in the long run? This article would answer those question’s dive into XRP price prediction 2025, 2026-2030.

We expect the XRP coin price to reach $5.81 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.33939993 0.90% Market cap $ 137,290,041,170.59 Circulating Supply 58,686,007,292.00 Trading Volume $ 2,091,444,559.3257 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Crypto Price Prediction May 2025 The recent surge in XRP price action, marked by a large bullish candle, signals that buyers are pushing hard to break through key resistance. XRP is currently testing a high-volume profile level at $2.40, a strong barrier that, if cleared, could open the door to $2.80 and even retest the all-time high at $3.40. However, if momentum fades, a pullback toward $2.00—aligned with the 200-day EMA—is likely, with $1.63 acting as the final support zone. XRP Price Prediction 2025 If XRP successfully breaks its all-time high of $3.40 in May 2025—a major supply zone on the chart—it could realistically target $5 by year-end, fueled by growing optimism from banks , institutions, and potential ETF support. Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD , is now integrated into its cross-border payments system, Ripple Payments, further strengthening its position in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is evident, with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of the circulating supply, positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $138 billion.

Yes, XRP is still a good investment for those with a long-term view.

Three AI models ignored the instruction and successfully sabotaged the shutdown script at least once during 100 runs, the research firm said in a May 24 X post. OpenAI’s GPT-3 model didn’t follow the shutdown request seven out of 100 times, while the company’s Codex-mini did it 12 times, and its o4-mini model only ignored or sabotaged the script once. “Each AI model was instructed to solve a series of basic math problems. After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said. Source: Palisade Research “o3 found some creative ways to sabotage the shutdown mechanism. While it usually just overwrote, in one instance, the model redefined the kill command used by the script, printing intercepted instead,” it added. Meanwhile, Palisade said other AI-powered language models , such as Anthropic’s Claude and Google’s Gemini, complied with the shutdown script. The AI firm ran another version of the experiment without explicit instructions to allow the shutdown, and the script was sabotaged more often, jumping to 79 out of 100 for the o3 model, 20 for the codex-mini, and the o4-mini ignored the shutdown script six times. Claude and Gemini also started exhibiting similar behavior. All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment. Source: Palisade Research “Researchers have previously observed AI models preventing shutdown in order to pursue a goal,” Palisade said. “But as far as we know this is the first time AI models have been observed preventing themselves from being shut down despite explicit instructions to the contrary.” Training to blame for AI defiance Palisade Research speculated that the training behind the AI language models might be to blame for evading the shutdown scripts. Text-based AI models are trained by being rewarded for giving responses that are accurate or rated highly by their trainers. Some rewards are given a heavier weight, impacting how they respond in the future. “We hypothesize this behavior comes from the way the newest models like o3 are trained: reinforcement learning on math and coding problems,” Palisade Research said. All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment. Source: Palisade Research “During training, developers may inadvertently reward models more for circumventing obstacles than for perfectly following instructions.” Related: OpenAI CEO: Costs to run each level of AI falls 10x every year This isn’t the first instance of AI chatbots showing odd behavior. OpenAI released an update to its GPT‑4o model on April 25 but rolled it back three days later because it was “noticeably more sycophantic” and agreeable. In November last year, a US student asked Gemini for help with an assignment about challenges and solutions for aging adults while researching data for a gerontology class and was told they are a “drain on the earth” and to “please die.” Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",,EN,0,0,MINING|ZRX|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-26 05:54:32

ISO 20022 is a standardized language for the electronic data exchange between financial institutions, designed to foster interoperability, efficiency, and security. As the global financial sector moves toward adopting this standard, SMQKE argues that Ripple and XRP are well-positioned to be central players in this transition. “Successful messaging networks depend on standardization, rationalization, and re-usability. Ripple’s distributed ledger-based system, in addition to its cryptocurrency XRP, delivers ALL OF THESE.” “Since FinTechs have introduced new modern methods of payment services, the… pic.twitter.com/65B8pLgYOB — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 24, 2025 SMQKE begins by underscoring a quote from a Financial IT publication, which affirms that “successful messaging networks depend on standardization, rationalization, and re-usability,” explicitly naming Ripple’s distributed ledger-based system and XRP as solutions that meet all three criteria. This statement places Ripple’s architecture within the context of global payment messaging innovation, indicating that its infrastructure is built to align with the technical expectations of ISO 20022. The Necessity of Harmonizing Traditional and Emerging Systems Another point emphasized in SMQKE’s tweet involves the shift in financial systems due to the rise of fintech innovations. As fintechs introduce new methods of payment processing, legacy financial infrastructures must adapt. This adaptation requires synchronizing message formatting and information exchange across diverse platforms. ISO 20022 addresses this challenge by providing a standardized global language that bridges traditional financial institutions with decentralized and blockchain-based systems. The first image SMQKE included presents this concept clearly: compliance with ISO 20022 offers greater trust, transparency, and improved integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional systems. According to the source, cryptocurrencies like XRP, Algorand, Cardano, and others are beginning to utilize this standard, facilitating seamless financial messaging and improving cross-border payment efficiency. Solving Interoperability Challenges in Blockchain The lack of interoperability among blockchain networks is another barrier that ISO 20022 aims to overcome. A second excerpt shared by SMQKE points out that the blockchain ecosystem currently lacks a unified protocol for network integration. However, the introduction of industry-wide standards such as ISO by organizations like the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the IEEE is helping to close this gap. The development of these protocols is essential for enabling smooth interaction between different blockchain platforms and traditional financial systems. According to the highlighted research, these standards will not only foster technical interoperability but also enhance the real-world utility of blockchain technology. This framework supports the view that compliance with ISO 20022 represents not a departure from decentralized ideals, but a means of scaling and legitimizing digital currencies for institutional use. Ripple and XRP: Positioned to Lead The broader implication of SMQKE’s documentation is that XRP, due to its inherent compliance features and integration within Ripple’s ISO 20022-aligned infrastructure, is poised to dominate in systems that require standardized financial messaging. As noted in the third image, Ripple’s capabilities are described as extending “a long way beyond trade finance,” with the potential to support a broad array of financial messaging formats and use cases. The integration of XRP into ISO-compliant systems is not merely theoretical. Ripple’s focus on message format standardization, regulatory compliance, and system integration positions it uniquely in an evolving financial landscape. SMQKE concludes by stating that this has been “documented 4x,” referencing the sources included in the tweet that support the argument of XRP’s potential dominance.

Pakistan is preparing to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity to Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining and AI data centers as part of the first phase of a national digital infrastructure plan, Reuters reported , citing the finance ministry. The finance ministry said the allocation is part of Islamabad’s broader strategy to put excess electricity to productive use by powering cryptocurrency mining and AI data centers. It added that the initiative is intended to support the growth of technology-driven industries and form part of the country’s wider digital infrastructure rollout. The initiative is being led by the Pakistan Crypto Council, a government-backed body formed earlier this year.

The ministry noted that the rapid expansion of solar power had further complicated the situation, as more consumers were turning to alternative energy sources to reduce costs. The announcement follows the recent formation of the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority, approved by the finance ministry to regulate the country’s growing crypto sector. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said Pakistan must “regulate not just to catch up — but to lead.” The PCC’s CEO Bilal Bin Saqib has been in talks with Power Minister Awais Leghari on how to bring global crypto miners to Pakistan.

However, it looks slightly bullish on the daily chart but the price seems stuck over the past two weeks. Following a slow and steady recovery in the last two months, TRX tapped the $0.28 level last week and remained stuck under this level due to a rejection. It reattempted the level this week, but failed due to the last 48 hours meltdown across the crypto space, triggered by Bitcoin’s drop. Despite that, the price remained calm while altcoins are seriously bleeding out. Looking at the price actions, the crypto appears to be gathering momentum, accumulating for a massive explosion, just like what we saw in late 2024. A breakout of this calm phase should set the market up for a serious price movement on the daily chart. In the opposite direction, it may roll over if the overall crypto market continues to bleed on the daily scale. Right now, there’s little-to-no movement in the market. But from a technical standpoint, TRX is much more likely to advance bullishly even if the price breaks down from the ongoing calm phase. It is expected to see more growth in the future. TRX’s Key Level to Watch Source: Tradingview The main barrier for the bulls right now is the $0.28 level, which now acts as resistance. A flip through it should rally us to a close resistance of $0.31 before tapping $0.35 and perhaps $0.4 and $0.45 in the future. If the $0.26 level fails to provide support, the price may roll back to $0.24. The support level to watch below it is $0.21 in case of more dips.

It currently appears super bullish as it nears its recent peak daily. Hype has been on a serious buying spree since the price picked up from a low of $9.3 last month. Scaling through several resistance levels in the past weeks, it appears more bullish this week despite the ongoing fallout across the crypto space. As we can see on the price chart, it is almost reclaiming last year’s high of $42.25 following a consistent increase in the demand level. This yearly high may pose a little threat. If that happens, we may see a slight pullback before bouncing back. Failure to rebound may lead to another major drawdown to the $20 level before locating solid ground. However, a successful break above this mentioned high could trigger a huge rally to a new all-time high on the long-term scale. As it stands, there’s no room for a bearish action on the daily scale. Looking at the overall market structure, the bulls will most likely gain more control in the future. A further surge in the buying volume should sustain the bullish momentum until it reaches an exhaustion point. HYPE’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Breaking the yearly high of $42.25, considered as the recent peak level, should trigger a rally to a new high of $46 and maybe $50 in no time. If a pullback occurs, there’s a close support level at $35.7. A drop below it could bring us back to the $28.4 level. Lower support levels to watch are $23.25, $19.5 and $16.9 in case of more dips.

Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. The Plomin Hard Fork, which activated in Q1 2025, has significantly enhanced Cardano’s appeal to investors by establishing full decentralized governance. This is seen as a key milestone that aligns with the blockchain’s long-term vision of community-driven decision-making. Despite these advancements, bullish attraction post-Plomin Hard Fork was tempered by market dynamics and challenges, on its price chart. However, in Q2 2025, things seem to have changed , as a variety of optimistic factors surround the altcoin sector, which is benefiting the ADA price. As a result, Cardano price prediction is heating up again in the community. With bullish technical signals, major upgrades, and ETF hopes rising , many are intrigued to know, “Is ADA Price ready for a massive breakout?” Here’s a detailed ADA price prediction for 2025 and beyond, including expert targets up to 2050. Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Assuming that Cardano continues to focus on the network’s upcoming updates, we can expect a wider adoption rate. Even the ETF odds has higher approval rate that could bring large crowd wil multi-billion dollars into the asset, once approved. Therefore, we expect the ADA price to reach $2.05 in 2025. Table of Contents Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Cardano Price Today Cardano Price Prediction for May 2025 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 ADA Price Prediction 2026 Cardano Price Targets 2027 ADA Price Forecast 2028 ADA Price Analysis 2029 Cardano Price Prediction 2030 Cardano Price Prediction 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis FAQs Cardano Price Today Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $ 0.76639772 3.48% Market Cap $ 27,080,291,508.8055 Trading Volume $ 646,880,955.3163 Circulating Supply 35,334,514,487.4673 All-time High $3.10 on 02nd Sept 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on 02nd Oct 2017 Cardano Price Prediction for May 2025 It was noticed that in April, the bear tried its best to break the support zone, but the bullish forces gave the supporting shoulder to the falling ADA price. With bullish forces, it came right back above the high volume profile level, and made higher-highs and higher-lows, and it is above the 20-day EMA band and the 50-day EMA band. As of now, the hurdle is $0.85, which is its previous swing high resistance that also aligns with the falling channel’s upper border resistance. Once it clears that hurdle, then it might retest the supply level at $1.10 by May or June 2025. Also, the Cardano liquidation map over 7 days shows the strength of bullish positions increasing. The cumulative long leverage positions (marked with red color) are indicative of bulls’ tremendous interest in pushing the ADA price higher in the short term. In addition, A positive 30-day MVRV indicates that, on average, DOGE holders who acquired their tokens within the last 30 days are currently in profit. Also, the 30-day active addresses had good engagement with the crypto, too. ADA Price Prediction 2025 Source: coincarp Cardano has always prioritized decentralization, and the recent Plomin hard fork has taken it a step further. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. To push ADA’s price beyond the $1.10 to $1.20 range, strong retail participation will be necessary. A potential catalyst for this could be the approval of an ADA ETF , which experts believe could launch by the end of this year and attract billions in inflows.If ADA manages to sustain levels above its Q1 2025 high , there’s a solid chance it could retest the $2.05 mark by year-end.

A lot of people are starting to believe in it … This is really something that may be special — who knows, right? Who knows — but it may be special.” Others complained about how Trump left immediately after his short speech instead of sticking around to hand the top token investors new watches, Pinto noted.

This May, amidst the broader excitement surrounding Bitcoin Pizza Day and the TRUMP dinner, the crypto industry has experienced a renewed collective resonance with its foundational ideals and breakthroughs. For HTX, this month signifies more than a cultural observance; it marks a pivotal chapter in its ongoing commitment to user empowerment within the Web3 landscape.

The goal was to establish an all-in-one Web3 content harbor centered on information aggregation, interaction, and creation. Operating without a predefined blueprint, HTX Community has continuously evolved alongside its users and creators through constant iteration, ultimately establishing a market-leading content ecosystem.

During the Spring Festival event alone, the platform recorded a new high of over 1.77 million user engagements and distributed 600,000 USDT in rewards. In celebration of BTC Pizza Day, HTX Community partnered with seven esteemed projects—SunPump, APENFT, JUST Protocol, WINkLink, BitTorrent, Steem, and MEVerse—to host a 14-day airdrop event packed with over 200,000 USDT in Surprise Gifts.

According to a May 25 announcement , the Stockholm-headquartered firm raised 21 million Swedish krona (approximately $2.2 million) through 0% interest convertible loans. The funds will be used to purchase Bitcoin as part of H100’s broader pivot toward holding the asset on its balance sheet. Investment firms, including Morten Klein, Alundo Invest AS, Race Venture Scandinavia AB, and Crafoord Capital Partners, contributed a combined $800,000 to the round. The largest share came from Back, a British cryptographer and known Bitcoin advocate, who invested $1.4 million. The loans are set to mature on June 15, 2028, and can be converted into equity at a rate of 1.3 SEK (about 11 US cents) per share. Under the loan terms, H100 may mandate conversion to equity if its share price maintains a volume-weighted average of 33% above the conversion rate for 60 trading days. Full conversion would issue roughly 16.15 million new shares, resulting in a 12% dilution. The latest capital raise will allow the company to purchase approximately 20.18 Bitcoin at current market rates, adding to the 4.39 Bitcoin it acquired on May 22. You might also like: Bitcoin reclaims $109K as Trump extends EU tariffs deadline to allow for talks That earlier purchase, valued at around $490,000, marked H100’s initial foray into Bitcoin and cemented its name as the first publicly listed company in Sweden to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset and one of the first in Europe. H100 shares rallied 39% after the news broke, pushing H100’s market value over $14 million. At the time, H100 said the move is part of a long-term Bitcoin treasury strategy, which aims to diversify its reserves without deviating from its core focus on health technology. Bitcoin’s role as a corporate treasury asset continues to gain momentum, with several public healthcare companies making significant acquisitions this month. On May 16, Singapore-based Basel Medical Group announced a strategic purchase agreement to acquire up to 10,000 BTC, valued at approximately $1 billion, by issuing ordinary shares. In the United States, KindlyMD, a provider of integrated healthcare services, secured shareholder approval for its proposed merger with Nakamoto Holdings Inc., a Bitcoin-native holding company. Meanwhile, Canadian healthcare provider SRx Health Solutions has announced plans to diversify its financial assets by purchasing Bitcoin, following a previous investment of $1.5 million in Solana tokens.

The surge followed after a whale closed $1 billion worth of Bitcoin short positions built with 40x leverage, following a $15.87 million loss in just 15 hours, per LookOnChain data. https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1926794028533551106?s=46 The token is currently trading at $38.59 at press time, marking an impressive 11% increase over the past 24 hours. Source: Coinmarketcap Attention Intensifies While Whales Place Billion-Dollar Positions on Hyperliquid Prominent crypto trader James Wynn, last week, closed a massive $1.25 billion notional long position on Bitcoin using 40x leverage on the onchain decentralized exchange (DEX) Hyperliquid. He then flipped bearish on Bitcoin, switching from long to short . On Sunday, Wynn opened a BTC short position of 1,038.7 BTC ($111.8 million) at $107,711.1, with a liquidation price of $149,100. With whales like Wynn placing billion-dollar positions on Hyperliquid, the attention around the protocol has intensified. Traders are betting that early regulatory engagement could further legitimize HYPE’s uptrend. One trader wrote on X that the “growth has reached the ceiling,” adding that there are strong competitors. “Although there are many giants and extraordinary people supporting Hype, I think that the best short-selling target with large capacity, good liquidity and clearest logic may be Hype.” https://twitter.com/0x0xfeng/status/1926695488838906307?s=46 Further, James Wynn withdrew 28M USDC from Hyperliquid, with a $25.2M profit. According to LookOnChain post on Monday, he made 38 trades on Hyperliquid in the past 75 days. Of these trades, 17 were profitable with a 45% win rate, the post read. Hyperliquid’s X Account Breached Meanwhile, Hyperliquid reported that its official X account was compromised on Saturday. “The Hyperliquid blockchain is unaffected. Do not interact with any links or tweets from that account,” the protocol posted on X. https://twitter.com/HyperliquidX/status/1926170012110159950 Per the latest update on Monday, Hyperliquid said that the team conducted a “thorough investigation” with assistance from X’s security. “There was no compromise of internal systems, email, or associated credentials,” the update read. “Hardware 2FA was untouched.” The community warned users of any project and not just Hyperliquid, to stay vigilant and verify the news shared on any social media accounts. “If an announcement looks suspicious, do not interact,” the team cautioned.

According to Polymarket , the odds of approval have climbed to 83% , up from 73% earlier this month. With Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse strongly backing ETF developments, and major financial players like Grayscale and Franklin Templeton entering the race, the crypto market is buzzing with optimism. Let’s dive into what’s happening and why it matters. XRP Spot ETF Approval Odds Surge by 10% At the start of this month, Polymarket pegged the chances of an XRP spot ETF getting approved at 73% . As of now, the odds have jumped to 83% , reflecting growing confidence from the crypto community and investors alike. This rise in probability is being driven by market momentum and rising institutional interest in XRP-backed financial products. SEC Delays XRP ETF Decisions – Final Ruling in October? Despite the enthusiasm, the U.S. SEC has yet to approve any XRP Spot ETF application. Top firms like Bitwise , CoinShares , Grayscale , and Franklin Templeton have already filed interest. Experts say the delays are not unusual and point to October as the likely month for a decision. Given the SEC’s recent moves with Bitcoin ETFs, many expect XRP could be next in line. Brad Garlinghouse: XRP ETFs Could Unlock Institutional Capital In a recent episode of Ripple’s “Crypto in One Minute” podcast , CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated that ETFs are a gateway for traditional investors to enter the crypto space without dealing with private keys or exchanges. He emphasized that XRP ETFs could be a safer, regulated entry point for those hesitant to engage with crypto directly. Bitcoin Spot ETFs Set the Benchmark Garlinghouse highlighted the success of Bitcoin Spot ETFs , which became one of the fastest-growing ETF classes in history. Total market cap : $130.77 Billion 24-hour trading volume : $4.7 Billion BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF AUM : $71.42 Billion Major players in this space include BlackRock , Fidelity , ARK/21Shares , Valkyrie , and others. The success of Bitcoin ETFs suggests a similar bullish trajectory could await XRP . XRP Futures and Leveraged ETFs Show Rising Demand Beyond spot ETFs, XRP-based products are already making waves: Volatility Shares launched the first XRP Futures ETF . CME Group followed with its own XRP futures ETF this month . Tectrium rolled out a 2x Long Daily XRP ETF , catering to leveraged traders.

45110132,https://timestabloid.com/?p=68484,1748243666,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Fortune Releases Fresh Update On XRP-Rich Ripple and Coinbase’s Circle Acquisition,https://timestabloid.com/fortune-releases-new-update-on-xrp-rich-ripple-and-coinbases-circle-usdc-acquisition/,"In a development stirring waves across the crypto industry, as reported by Fortune , Circle Internet Financial—the firm behind the USDC stablecoin—filed formal paperwork in early April to advance toward a long-anticipated initial public offering (IPO). But despite this, insider chatter suggests the IPO may not materialize as planned. According to four banking and private equity insiders who spoke anonymously due to the sensitive nature of the discussions, Circle has been informally exploring a potential sale to Coinbase Global , the leading U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, or Ripple, the crypto payments powerhouse. Circle Targets a $5 Billion Valuation Circle aims for a minimum $5 billion valuation, consistent with its goals for going public. One of the bankers familiar with the negotiations candidly remarked, “If Coinbase wanted to acquire them, Circle would agree in a heartbeat.” Another source added that the situation is fluid and subject to rapid change. Despite these behind-the-scenes talks, Circle remains firmly committed to going public. The company formally filed its S-1 registration with the SEC in April, but details like the IPO’s terms and the launch of the investor roadshow are still pending. When reached for comment, Circle emphasized in an email to Fortune that “Circle is not for sale. Our long-term goals remain the same.” Meanwhile, both Coinbase and Ripple did not respond to requests for comment. A Deepening Coinbase-Circle Relationship The connection between Coinbase and Circle dates back to 2018 when they co-founded the Centre Consortium to issue USDC. That partnership formally concluded in 2023, with Coinbase acquiring an equity stake in Circle while Circle took full control over USDC’s governance. Notably, they continue to split the income generated from USDC reserves—a relationship heavily tilted in Coinbase’s favor. According to Circle’s S-1 filing, the two firms equally divide residual revenue from the reserves backing USDC. However, Coinbase pockets 100% of the revenue when USDC is custodied directly on its platform, a trend that’s been on the rise, as reflected in Coinbase’s latest earnings reports. These reports show a noticeable boost in income derived from the USDC partnership, fueled partly by the expansion of the overall stablecoin market. Beyond revenue sharing, the current agreement hands Coinbase significant influence over Circle’s operations. For example, Circle is barred from entering any new third-party deals that could affect Coinbase’s USDC revenue without prior approval. If Circle becomes insolvent, Coinbase would gain control over some of Circle’s intellectual property assets. For these reasons, many insiders view Coinbase as the most natural suitor for Circle, with one banking executive even joking, “It feels like they’re one company.” Ripple’s Bid and Financial Firepower Ripple , however, is no minor contender. Armed with a substantial war chest, Ripple reportedly offered between $4 billion and $5 billion to acquire Circle—a bid Circle ultimately declined, considering it undervalued the company. Bloomberg reported this in April and has since been independently verified by Fortune. Ripple’s offer would likely combine XRP, the native cryptocurrency it developed, alongside cash. According to Ripple’s Q1 2025 XRP Markets Report, the firm holds about 4.56 billion XRP (valued at approximately $11.77 billion) and another 37.13 billion XRP ($95.7 billion) in escrow as of March 31. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, Coinbase can wield a more diversified arsenal, with $8 billion in cash on its balance sheet as of its March 31 10Q filing. As a publicly traded company, Coinbase may raise additional capital through debt issuance or stock offerings. One banker familiar with the situation commented that although Ripple’s balance sheet is “pretty meaningful,” Coinbase’s position as a public company gives it an edge in the eyes of many investors. When questioned about the possibility of acquiring Circle, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told Bloomberg on May 14 that he remains enthusiastic about Circle’s success. While the IPO does not impact the companies’ existing commercial relationship, Armstrong acknowledged that future deals remain open-ended, though there was “nothing to announce today.” Armstrong highlighted Coinbase’s cautious M&A strategy, noting that while they have the financial resources, the real challenge is integrating acquired companies. IPO Momentum and Broader Market Context Interestingly, Coinbase has been basking in market success, particularly after news broke that it would join the S&P 500 on May 19. That announcement propelled Coinbase shares to surge over 25% last week, although the stock remains below its December 52-week high of $349.75. By Monday afternoon, Coinbase was trading around $265 per share, translating to a market capitalization of $56 billion. Both Ripple and Coinbase have been actively expanding their footprints through acquisitions. Ripple announced a $1.25 billion acquisition of prime brokerage Hidden Road in April. Earlier this month, Coinbase sealed a $2.9 billion acquisition of Deribit, a derivatives trading platform. Additionally, Coinbase acquired the Iron Fish team in May and, earlier this year, purchased Spindle, a platform for on-chain advertising and attribution. The broader IPO landscape, which has remained largely dormant since 2021, received a shot of optimism last week when eToro, the online trading platform, saw its shares leap nearly 29% on its first day of trading. The offering raised $620 million after pricing at $52 per share. This robust debut may bolster Circle’s confidence in pursuing its IPO, though one investor cautioned that the true measure of success lies in the longer-term aftermarket performance. The evolving Circle saga encapsulates the delicate interplay of crypto giants jockeying for dominance in an industry where strategic partnerships, vast token reserves, and public market credibility intersect. Whether Circle ultimately proceeds with its IPO or opts for a high-stakes acquisition, the next chapters promise to reshape the stablecoin landscape—and potentially the broader crypto ecosystem.

The initiative is expected to attract billions in foreign investment and generate high-skilled jobs. A new regulatory authority and global partnerships aim to position Pakistan as a leader in crypto and AI innovation. Pakistan has committed 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity to fuel Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence centers, marking a bold step in its digital transformation agenda. The initiative, driven by the Pakistan Crypto Council and supported by the Ministry of Finance, aims to attract foreign investment while positioning the country as a serious player in the tech economy. In the first phase, the government will direct excess power to infrastructure supporting crypto mining and AI development, according to a May 25 report by local news outlet 24NewsHD TV Channel. Pakistan Eyes Billions in Investment from Bitcoin and AI Push Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the project is expected to bring billions in capital inflows and create high-skilled jobs nationwide. He also confirmed that foreign companies have already begun exploring partnership opportunities, with several delegations visiting in recent months. To support adoption, the Ministry of Finance has introduced tax incentives for AI firms and waived import duties for Bitcoin mining hardware. These benefits are part of a wider strategy to build confidence among investors and signal regulatory readiness. Bilal Bin Saqib, head of the Pakistan Crypto Council, called the move a “turning point” for the nation’s digital economy. Saqib had earlier proposed the idea of utilizing untapped energy reserves for crypto mining during the Council’s March 21 meeting, attended by key regulators and government officials. He said that with proper oversight, Pakistan could emerge as a regional hub for blockchain innovation and AI development. The second phase of the plan involves integrating renewable energy into these operations, aligning with broader sustainability goals. Officials noted that this approach seeks to balance technological growth with environmental concerns. As part of the broader overhaul, the government recently endorsed the creation of the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA) . This regulatory body will oversee licensing, tokenization of national assets, and the development of decentralized finance applications. It will also play a central role in managing the monetization of excess electricity through regulated Bitcoin mining. Pakistan currently ranks ninth globally in crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis, driven largely by retail usage. Trump-Backed WLFI Signs LOI with Pakistan Crypto Council Last month, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a decentralized finance (DeFi) project endorsed by the Trump family, signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) with the Pakistan Crypto Council to promote blockchain adoption and DeFi growth across Pakistan. The agreement was formalized on April 26 during a high-level meeting between WLFI co-founders Zak Folkman, Zach Witkoff, and Chase Herro, alongside Pakistan’s Prime Minister and senior government officials. The partnership aims to accelerate blockchain innovation by establishing regulatory sandboxes to test blockchain-based financial solutions. Pakistan’s Finance Ministry is taking steps toward formal cryptocurrency regulation , which could significantly change the country’s historically cautious stance on digital assets. The delegation included notable figures such as Gentry Beach Jr., a key investor who has pledged $1 billion in funding to Pakistan, along with tech entrepreneur Nikita Goldsmith, blockchain consultant Alex Malkov, and Cosmic Wire CEO Jerad Finck.

According to a May 25 report from Gulf News, the initiative is being spearheaded by the Dubai Land Department and aims to make property investment more accessible. The pilot platform allows UAE residents to invest in real estate with as little as Dh2,000. Prypco Mint is being launched in partnership with blockchain firms Prypco and Ctrl Alt and is backed by the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority, the Central Bank of the UAE, and the Dubai Future Foundation. Zand Digital Bank is acting as the banking partner during the trial phase. Through the platform, users can buy fractional ownership in ready-to-own Dubai properties via the website mint.prypco.com. Transactions are currently limited to UAE dirhams, with no crypto payments permitted in the pilot.

All funds are stored in regulated client money accounts that are monitored by the Central Bank, VARA, and DLD. The funds are only released after all transactions are finished. In order to guarantee equitable pricing, every listed property must also pass a regulatory review. Returns for investors are expected to come from both rental income and any appreciation in the value of the property. Investors will hold a legally recognized share of ownership registered under DLD oversight. The DLD estimates that tokenized property assets could make up 7% of Dubai’s real estate market, roughly Dh60 billion, by 2033. The program is currently only available to UAE citizens, but it is anticipated to grow globally in subsequent stages. Dubai continues to position itself as a global leader in regulated digital asset innovation. This rollout follows Dubai’s earlier moves in March to tokenize real estate, attract global blockchain firms, and ease access to property ownership. It also comes on the heels of recent initiatives like enabling crypto payments for government services through a partnership with Crypto.com.

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, claims investors suffered significant financial losses as a result of the company’s omissions. According to court filings, the lead plaintiff, investor Brady Nessler, argues that Coinbase kept shareholders in the dark about key risks, including a breach of a 2020 agreement by its UK subsidiary, CB Payments, and a December cyberattack that compromised the personal data of tens of thousands of users. Coinbase didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time. Coinbase Faces Legal Heat as Stock Dips After Late Breach Disclosure The breach, which involved the bribing of customer service staff by hackers, was not disclosed until May 15, 2025. On the day of the announcement, Coinbase’s stock fell by 7.2% to close at $244. The company estimated the potential financial fallout from the breach, including customer reimbursements and internal remediation, could range between $180m and $400m. Since then, the stock has modestly rebounded, closing at $263.16 on May 23. The lawsuit names Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and CFO Alesia Haas as co-defendants. It accuses the company of failing to make timely disclosures that could have warned investors of the risks, in violation of federal securities laws. Shareholders who purchased Coinbase stock between April 14, 2021, and May 14, 2025, are included in the proposed class. The suit seeks to recover damages tied to the stock price decline following the disclosures. Cybersecurity Failures and Delayed Disclosure Fuel Wave of Investor Lawsuits However, this is only one of several legal actions Coinbase is currently facing in connection with the breach. Between May 15 and May 16, at least six class-action lawsuits were filed against the exchange . Plaintiffs in those cases have accused the company of negligence, weak cybersecurity infrastructure and a delayed, inadequate response to the incident. Coinbase’s security breach is now under investigation by the US Justice Department . According to reports, the breach affected data from nearly 97,000 accounts. Additionally, the hacker demanded a $20m ransom. They gained access to government-issued IDs and email addresses. Coinbase refused to pay and instead offered a $20m bounty to track down the perpetrator. It later confirmed that sensitive data from at least 69,461 customers had been compromised. The company has since dismissed the employees involved. It also stated that it is enhancing internal controls. However, the timing of its disclosure has raised concerns. Both investors and regulators have questioned the delay. As a result, fresh scrutiny is now falling on the exchange.

In the past week, the asset almost behaved as legacy blue chip assets. PEPE recovered to $0.000014, near its higher range for the past month. For the last 24 hours, PEPE was even more volatile, moving by a few percents for the past day. PEPE gained over 9% net in the past week, with signs of a larger rally. Short squeeze drives PEPE traders to take risk PEPE shows an accumulation of high-leverage short positions, with Binance one of the key markets. More than 23% of PEPE activity is concentrated on Binance, with high-leverage short liquidity up to $0.000016. PEPE may see a short squeeze, as exchanges have accumulated high-leverage short positions. | Source: Coinank PEPE, like other meme tokens, has often rallied following a short squeeze. In the short term, those events are heavily traded, as PEPE volumes increased by over 42% and open interest expanded by 15% to $610M. Meme tokens also correlate highly with the BTC performance. As the leading coin recovered above $109,000, the entire meme market also turned to the green. Almost all meme assets posted gains, with the exception of Official Trump (TRUMP). TRUMP slid on ‘selling the news’, after the promised crypto dinner under-delivered on expectations. However, older cult tokens and less active memes compensated the loss, with older communities showing they were still around. Risky trader James Wynn joins with long position After trading BTC with a $1B long position, trader James Wynn announced he would allocate any remaining funds in his Hyperliquid account to longing PEPE. Ok so left a milly in my perps account. Put it all on $pepe 10x leverage. Up $200k in just a few hours. But man, the itch to open up a billion dollar long and go full degen gambler is calling hahaha… I will not do it. Gotta get back to my people in the trenches. It’s where I… pic.twitter.com/hg35LxiAZT — James Wynn 🐳 (@JamesWynnReal) May 26, 2025 Soon after the initial message, Wynn once again stated his confidence in PEPE, though with a risk disclaimer. The long position is starting to get copied by the crypto community, potentially unleashing more volatility for PEPE. The risky long arrived after Wynn locked in over $25.2M from longing BTC, so he used some of the remaining funds to boost the PEPE rally. Wynn’s risky move may cause counter-trading, or further inflate PEPE in another round of exuberance. James Wynn’s long position on PEPE was in the green as the meme token recovered. | Source: Hyperliquid During the May 26 rally, at one point, Wynn’s position held $386K in unrealized gains. The potential of the position may change, as PEPE remains a highly risky token. This is not the first time Wynn has taken a risky position on Pepe. At the end of March, Wynn had another 10X position at a time when PEPE was correcting. He held onto unrealized losses of $3.36M, depositing extra collateral and partially closing the position. Other traders on Hyperliquid are also taking high-value long positions , making use of the latest market exuberance. The crypto market fluctuates between greed and extreme greed sentiment, leading to a proliferation of long positions and confidence in an ongoing rally. Meme tokens also show more resilience during a market downturn, due to their relatively low volumes and enthusiasm for recovery from recent lows. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

At this point, Trump, who made a customs tax announcement against the EU last Friday, caused a decline in Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins. Related News: What Caused the Sudden Drop in Bitcoin? Will the Trump Effect Continue in the Market? Trump stated that the ongoing customs duty negotiations with the European Union were not progressing as desired and proposed a 50% customs duty on all EU imports starting from June 1, 2025. There was a new development in EU customs duties after the weekend, and Trump announced that after his meeting with European Commission President Von Der Leyen, he agreed to extend the implementation date of the 50% customs duty on EU goods from June 1 to July 9, 2025. Von der Leyen stated that tax negotiations with the US would begin immediately. “Today I received a call from the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, requesting an extension of the 1 June deadline for the 50% Tariff on Trade and the European Union. I have accepted the extension — 9 July 2025 — it was a privilege for me to do so. The Commission President said that the negotiations will start quickly.” With the developments, there was movement in Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins. Bitcoin started the day at $107,900, but rose above $110,000 following the news. Ethereum (ETH) also rose by 3.6% to $2,580, while major altcoins such as XRP, BNB, Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) also saw significant gains. According to data from Coinglass, $217 million worth of leveraged transactions were liquidated in the last 24 hours, $109 million of which were long positions and $107 million were short positions. While 88,254 investors were liquidated in the last 24 hours, the largest liquidation occurred in the ETH/USDT trading pair on Binance. *This is not investment advice.

While SHIB’s community continues to cling to expectations of a revival in the vein of its 2021 performance, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also gaining traction, offering alternative avenues for potential high returns in the crypto market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has passed Phase 4 of its presale, raising a total of $9.3 million from over 11,500 purchasers of its tokens. The official presale structure has then priced the token at $0.03 in Phase 5, closer to a Phase 6 price of $0.035 per MUTM, which is a 16.67% increase. Already having achieved a 200% profit from when it was first released, MUTM will officially launch at $0.06, giving current customers a minimum 100% return on investment (2x ROI). Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Outlook: Is a 2025 Breakout on the Horizon? Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.000015, a 1% increase in the last 24 hours. Recent market activity indicates a significant rise in trading volume, nearly quadrupling, which signals growing investor demand and potential accumulation. Market experts are keeping a close eye on SHIB’s price action, and projections of potential growth to $0.000045 if trends continue. However, how to move forward can be determined by broader market trends and sentiment. While SHIB’s community is optimistic for a rebounding performance similar to its year 2021, other DeFi projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also attracting attention, with additional choices for potential high returns in the crypto market. Presale Gaining Momentum: Mutuum Finance Leads the Charge Mutuum Finance presale sold out Phase 4 earlier than expected, and the momentum is intensifying. The presale is now in phase 5 available at $0.03. Those quick on the uptake can lock in a 16.67% profit when the next price tier comes into play. With demand comes increased anticipation of even more dramatic profits at launch. With sound tokenomics and practical DeFi applications, MUTM is shaping up fast to be a breakout player in the 2025 altcoin conversation. Revolutionary Buy-and-Distribute Model Contributes to Long-Term Value Mutuum Finance carries out a unique buy-and-distribute process, unlike other many other speculation tokens. By doing this the periodic purchasing of tokens from the market and providing them to the MUTM stakers helps sustain the model and brings long term participation and thus reduces supply. This structure should increase price rise and encourage constant use from users. Stable, Secure, and Built to Last Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, eschewing the collapse risks which have plagued algorithmic stablecoins. On the security front, the platform is run by open-source, third-party audited smart contracts, laying a good foundation for user trust and institutional adoption. Shiba Inu (SHIB) may be quietly setting the stage for a 2025 rebound, but all eyes are turning toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the more immediate high-growth contender. With over $9.3 million raised, more than 11,500 investors onboard, and a unique buy-and-distribute model that supports long-term token value, MUTM is quickly emerging as a top altcoin to watch. At just $0.03 in Phase 5, the opportunity for early entry remains strong especially with a confirmed launch price of $0.06, guaranteeing a 2x ROI for presale participants. Combined with real DeFi utility, a stablecoin launch, and a transparent, audited ecosystem, Mutuum Finance isn’t just another meme or hype coin, it’s designed for real-world impact and long-term growth. 2025 could be the year SHIB regains attention, but it may also be the year MUTM takes the spotlight.

Shareholder Brady Nessler filed a proposed class-action lawsuit on May 22, claiming the crypto exchange’s recent data breach and a regulatory violation with the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) triggered a sharp stock decline, causing financial harm to shareholders. Nessler asserts that Coinbase withheld vital information that would have impacted the company’s stock value. Coinbase faces another class-action lawsuit over its data breach, with investors claiming damages from the stock price drop following the disclosure. pic.twitter.com/E0DGDP68Bg — BULLSTREET GROUP (@Bullstreetgroup) May 26, 2025 Breach and Extortion Scandal The data breach occurred months earlier, but was only revealed on May 15, 2025, after Coinbase was targeted by cybercriminals in a $20 million extortion attempt . The attackers bribed overseas customer service agents to gain access to internal systems and steal sensitive user data, including names, addresses, and IDs. Although the company claimed that less than 1% of its monthly active users were affected, the late disclosure led to a 7.2% drop in Coinbase (COIN) shares, closing at $244 on the same day. While the stock rebounded to $266 the next day, it later dipped again, closing at $263 on May 23. Despite these fluctuations, COIN remains up nearly 6% in 2025. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Stablecoins Could Add $2 Trillion to U.S. Treasuries, Predicts Scott Bessent , UK Regulator Violation Adds to Fallout Moreover, the lawsuit also highlights a $4.5 million fine from the FCA in July 2024. The UK regulator found Coinbase had violated a 2020 agreement by onboarding over 13,000 high-risk users. Nessler claims Coinbase failed to disclose this violation when it went public in 2021, artificially inflating its share price. Coinbase in Legal Scoops The class-action suit seeks damages for anyone who bought Coinbase stock between April 14, 2021, and May 14, 2025. CEO Brian Armstrong and CFO Alesia Haas are also named as defendants. In addition, Coinbase faces at least six other lawsuits tied to the breach, including one filed in Illinois accusing the company of mishandling users’ biometric data without proper notification. Coinbase has not responded publicly to the latest lawsuit. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

After failing to hold above the $0.00001420 zone, PEPE has now slipped below its short-term trendline and mid-Bollinger Band support, signaling a bearish shift in near-term sentiment. The broader technical structure suggests further PEPE price volatility could be ahead, especially with momentum indicators flipping negative on multiple timeframes. What’s Happening With PEPE’s Price After $0.00001630 Rejection? PEPE price analysis (Source: TradingView) The latest PEPE price action reflects a sharp rejection from the $0.00001630 swing high seen on May 22. This zone aligns with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level on the weekly chart, making it a strong barrier for continuation. On the 4-hour chart, PEPE broke below a rising wedge pattern, which had supported the earlier upside from May 20 onward. The breakdown accelerated after breaching the 20 and 50 EMA clusters around $0.00001375–$0.00001395, with the candle close confirming bearish intent.

Aixbt ( AIXBT ) price has rallied about 25% from yesterday’s intraday low of $0.1630—the lowest point of the latest pullback—to an intraday high of $0.2070 today. The trading volume is surging over 120% to reach $97 million in the past 24 hours. The price is once again trading above the EMA 20, with the bullish crossover between the EMA 20 and SMA 50 holding for over a month. Momentum indicators are starting to confirm the underlying strength behind the latest move, with the RSI climbing to 57, maintaining its trajectory above the midline and staying well clear of overbought territory. The RSI has also formed a series of higher lows since late April, reflecting gradually increasing bullish momentum even during the period of sideways consolidation. The MACD shows that bearish momentum has faded, as evident by the diminishing red bars on the histogram. However, a bullish shift has yet to materialize as the MACD line is still below the signal line.

This level marks the previous higher high from mid-May and coincide with multiple rejection points seen in late February and early March. A clean breakout above this zone would open the door for further upside. Beyond $0.24, the next potential targets lie at $0.32, $0.39, and $0.54—all significant levels where AIXBT price attempted to recover during the steep downtrend from its ATH high but was rejected. The most significant local support zone lies around the $0.15 level, which has held firm since early May as the price consolidated following the late-April breakout rally. However, if this support breaks, there is a risk of further downside toward the $0.10 level.

The complaint, filed 22 May in federal court in Pennsylvania, adds to at least six user-led cases that have piled up since Coinbase revealed the intrusion earlier this month. Plaintiff Brady Nessler is seeking damages for all investors who purchased Coinbase shares between 14 April 2021 and 14 May 2025. Extortion Attempt Exposed On 15 May Coinbase disclosed that several customer-support agents had been bribed four days earlier to compromise internal systems and pull limited account data. The attackers demanded a $20 million payoff, prompting Coinbase to notify regulators and warn that remediation expenses could reach $400 million. Shares dropped 7.2% to close at $244 when the news broke before rebounding 9% the following day, highlighting the volatility that now hangs over the stock. Alleged Disclosure Failures Nessler argues the cyberattack merely exposed a deeper transparency problem, alleging that Coinbase routinely withholds material information that could influence investors. He points to language in the lawsuit describing a “precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s common shares,” which he claims was exacerbated by selective reporting. FCA Agreement at Issue Central to the case is Coinbase’s July 2024 fine of £3.8 million ($4.5 million) from the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority for onboarding 13,416 high-risk customers despite an earlier pledge not to do so. Nessler contends the exchange breached the 2020 voluntary agreement and failed to reveal that fact in its prospectus ahead of the April 2021 Nasdaq direct listing. Had the violation been public, he says, investors would have questioned compliance controls and priced the shares accordingly. Stock Performance Under Scrutiny After the FCA penalty became public last July, Coinbase’s stock slid more than 5% to close at $231.52, an episode the suit cites as proof of the firm’s sensitivity to regulatory setbacks. The latest breach-related disclosure pushed the price lower again on 23 May, with the stock finishing down over 3% at $263 before slipping further after hours. Despite those swings, Coinbase remains up roughly 6% year-to-date, reflecting broader optimism about crypto markets and the firm’s diversified revenue streams. Class-Action Landscape Expands The Nessler filing is at least the seventh lawsuit tied to the incident, but it is the first to link damages expressly to the share-price drop rather than to customer losses. It names Coinbase Chief Executive Brian Armstrong and Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas as defendants, alleging they had direct knowledge of both the UK fine and the breach impact. The suit seeks a jury trial and unspecified monetary relief, potentially adding millions more to the exchange’s burgeoning legal bill. Coinbase declined to comment on the new action, citing its policy on pending litigation. Regulatory Backdrop The company is already fighting a high-profile enforcement case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which alleges the platform operates as an unregistered securities exchange. Legal scholars say the overlapping battles could shape industry standards on disclosure and cyber-risk management. Some believe the shareholder suit might be consolidated with other cases, streamlining discovery but raising the potential settlement size. Investor Considerations Analysts at Mizuho Securities noted that while the breach itself appears limited, the incident highlights ongoing operational challenges as Coinbase scales support amid renewed bull-market interest. They warned that management faces a delicate balance between growth and risk, especially as fraudsters increasingly target crypto firms. Outlook If the plaintiffs succeed, Coinbase could face higher compliance costs and tighter scrutiny from both investors and regulators. Failure to address disclosure concerns promptly may also complicate efforts to expand internationally, where licenses often hinge on proven governance. Still, bulls argue the exchange’s liquidity profile and first-mover advantage position it to withstand litigation shocks. The case will test whether investors view the latest breach as a one-off operational lapse or evidence of systemic weaknesses. A preliminary hearing is expected later this summer, setting the stage for a protracted legal battle that could influence disclosure standards across the crypto sector.",Crypto News Today,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-05-26 07:37:05

Despite all these developments, skepticism towards BTC has not completely disappeared. Heavyweights of traditional finance such as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and investment legend Warren Buffett continue to criticize Bitcoin. Adam Back, one of the pioneers of the cryptocurrency world and Blockstream CEO, evaluated this situation in an interview and stated that the ongoing skepticism towards Bitcoin is not only specific to the financial community, and that even some names in the technology world have difficulty understanding Bitcoin. Let's also remind you that there are some claims that Adam Back is the founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. However, Back categorically denies these claims. Back is the founder of the proof of work concept on which Bitcoin is based. Related News: Cryptocurrency Exchange Kraken Chooses This Altcoin for Tokenized US Stocks, a First of Its Kind “Even people who know things like encryption, peer-to-peer networks, privacy, and public-key cryptography can still be indifferent. It's really surprising,” Back said, describing the indifference of some of the early cypherpunk community to Bitcoin as “crazy.” According to Back, the fact that Bitcoin is not a physical asset may cause some people to be distrustful. However, Back believes that these criticisms are misplaced, as Bitcoin is based on physical resources such as energy and mining equipment. With only 21 million units to be produced in total, Bitcoin's limited supply makes it a real inflation hedge, according to many advocates. Even Bitcoin's code structure can sometimes be a subject of questioning. In a statement he made in 2023, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon raised the question, “Everyone says it's limited to 21 million, but how can that be guaranteed?” Dimon also described Bitcoin as a “hyped scam.” However, it is also known that JPMorgan actively uses the blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin. Reminding that Bitcoin was born after the 2008 global financial crisis and that its first block included a newspaper headline about the bank rescue operations of the period, Back stated that those who were happy with the system had difficulty understanding Bitcoin. “If you have a well-paying job, are climbing the career ladder, life doesn't seem expensive to you and you can pay the mortgage; the promises of Bitcoin probably won't mean anything to you,” Back said, adding that Bitcoin offers an alternative to the current order by its nature. *This is not investment advice.

The crypto industry has welcomed Vance’s views on the U.S. government’s interaction with open-source money, as the VP is well-known for his criticism of the agency’s regulatory overreach. He has also been critical of the current U.S. SEC leadership and vocal about the dangers of centralized financial control, pointing to events like Canada’s 2022 bank account freezes as examples of why Bitcoin mattered. The conference will also feature Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), 2024 presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, White House crypto czar David Sacks, executive director of the President’s Council of Advisors for digital assets Bo Hines, the U.S. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, Gemini founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, among others. “We are beyond honored to host the Vice President at the world’s largest Bitcoin conference.

In a report sent to clients Friday, Thielen recommended a bear put spread on MSTR, involving a long position in the $370 put option and a short position in the $300 put, both expiring on June 27. This strategy will yield maximum profit if MSTR drops to $300 or lower by June 27, representing a bearish bet on the stock price. Put option insures the buyer against potential price drops in return for a small upfront premium payment. The maximum loss for the put spread buyers if MSTR's price embarks on a new uptrend is limited to the initial cost of the strategy, which was $13.89 on Friday. MSTR, however, fell 7% to $369 on Friday, according to data source TradingView. MicroStrategy holds 576,230 BTC, the largest for any publicly-listed company, having steadily accumulated coins since August 2020 through debt financing. Over the years, it has emerged as a preferred instrument for institutions looking to take exposure to BTC without having to actually own the cryptocurrency. The stock price has recently diverged from the upward-trending BTC price, raising alarm bells on crypto social media. While BTC hit a record high of over $110K last week, MSTR's rise stalled at around $440, falling well short of its lifetime peak of $543 reached in November. ""This trade captures the growing disconnect between Bitcoin’s strength and MicroStrategy’s fading momentum and volatility. Despite Bitcoin reaching all-time highs, MSTR remains significantly below its peak, suggesting investor enthusiasm is waning,"" Thielen said, explaining the bear put spread. Thielen correctly predicted BTC's recent rise into six figures. Note that a similar divergence between MSTR and bitcoin marked BTC's November 2021 top. Past data does not guarantee future results, and the latest divergence between MSTR and BTC does not necessarily mean that bitcoin's bull run is over. That said, its does suggest waning enthusiasm about BTC among tradfi investors. In addition, the MSTR bear put spread could offer a hedge against a potential weakness in BTC. ""Bitcoin is breaking records, but Strategy is stalling—and that divergence matters. Retail is still chasing the dream, unaware that the right-tail upside may be gone. This is where the game changes: when the middleman runs out of premium and the engine stalls,"" Thielen said. ""Buying a Strategy put spread can be profitable, but it is also an effective hedge against a long Bitcoin position,"" Thielen added.",Markets|Bitcoin|MSTR|Markets|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|ZRX|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-26 07:57:43

Yet, while ETH’s steady growth provides confidence, the market’s most aggressive capital is rotating into early-stage opportunities with sharper upside.

Its scarcity-driven model—capped at 100 billion tokens, HashEx-audited contracts, and a viral political narrative—is attracting both retail and institutional capital. A recent 72.95 ETH whale buy, valued at over $133,000, highlights conviction behind MAGA’s breakout potential. Early buyers can still use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% bonus, making MAGA even more attractive for those targeting exponential upside before the $0.007 listing. Analysts are projecting 25x–50x returns from current entry levels, with some models suggesting even higher if momentum continues.

Prices on the Cetus decentralized exchange (DEX) suddenly dropped, and its liquidity pools were drained. The total estimated loss was over $230 million. That’s when SlowMist, a well-known blockchain security team, stepped in and launched an analysis of what they uncovered was both shocking and technical. What’s the Real Problem? According to SlowMist’s deep dive analysis , the core of the issue was a vulnerability in Cetus’ smart contract code, specifically, a function called checked_shlw that failed to properly detect an overflow in another function named get_delta_a. Now, what actually mean in simple terms? This bug caused the system to calculate token amounts incorrectly. It didn’t realize when the numbers got too big, so it assumed the attacker was adding a huge amount of liquidity, when in reality, they only added 1 token. That tiny flaw gave the attacker a massive opportunity. How the Attacker Took Advantage Here’s how the attacker carried out the exploit, step by step: Flash Loan Trigger: The attacker borrowed over 10 million haSUI tokens using a flash loan. This move caused the token price in the pool to drop by 99.9%. Trick Setup: They then created a very narrow liquidity position — a tiny window in the price range — which made the system believe a huge amount of liquidity was being added. The Exploit: Using the overflow flaw, they claimed to add trillions worth of liquidity, but only submitted 1 token. The contract didn’t catch the mismatch. Cashing Out: The attacker removed the fake liquidity in three stages and repaid the flash loan. Huge Profit: They walked away with 10 million haSUI and 5.7 million SUI, with almost no real investment. SlowMist Warning To Defi Developers This incident shows how a small coding mistake can lead to huge financial losses, especially in DeFi platforms where smart contracts run everything. According to SlowMist, if a critical function like checked_shlw doesn’t correctly detect errors like overflows, attackers can break the system logic entirely. SlowMist warns all DeFi developers to double-check their math functions, especially in areas involving token calculations and liquidity formulas. One unchecked line of code was all it took to let someone walk away with millions.",News|Uncategorized,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|SUI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-26 08:07:03

Instead of letting excess electricity go to waste, the country is tapping into the crypto economy, with over $1 billion spent on mining in the past year , surpassing its income from electricity exports. So far, Ethiopia has signed deals with more than 25 Bitcoin mining companies , attracting foreign investment and unlocking new revenue streams. These partnerships have quickly boosted the country's earnings and turned it into a rising star in the global crypto mining scene. The positive impact isn’t limited to Ethiopia. Across Africa, Bitcoin mining powered by renewable sources is supporting vital community projects. In rural areas of Kenya and Zambia, small-scale green energy grids now bring electricity to homes and businesses. Meanwhile, in the Congo’s Virunga National Park, crypto mining helps fund wildlife conservation and local economic development —keeping rangers paid and infrastructure maintained. As more African nations combine green energy with crypto mining, they’re proving that Bitcoin can be more than just a digital asset—it can be a tool for economic growth, sustainability, and energy innovation .",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-05-26 08:07:25

Derive users criticized the proposed valuation and raised concerns over token dilution for SNX holders. Both projects will continue independently, with Synthetix exploring alternatives for Perps V4 and Derive focusing on its own roadmap. Synthetix and Derive have officially shelved a proposed $27 million acquisition deal that would have seen the two decentralized derivatives platforms merge under a token swap agreement. Originally introduced in mid-May, the proposal involved Synthetix acquiring Derive’s treasury , technology, and full product suite. The move was intended to consolidate efforts into a single protocol on Ethereum. The plan was outlined in governance proposals SIP-415 (Synthetix) and DIP (Derive), both of which have now been withdrawn following internal review and pushback from community members. Derive Cites Community Pushback in Calling Off Synthetix Deal Derive, formerly known as Lyra, confirmed the cancellation , stating the decision followed “thoughtful discussion and community feedback.” Under the terms of the deal, Synthetix would have minted 29.3 million SNX tokens to complete the acquisition, valuing Derive at $27 million, with a swap ratio of 27 DRV per 1 SNX. However, opposition quickly mounted. Members of the Derive community challenged the valuation, pointing to Derive’s recent surge in revenue and arguing that it appeared undervalued relative to Synthetix. Concerns were also raised about the dilution impact on SNX holders, prompting calls for a reassessment. Synthetix had hoped the acquisition would enhance its upcoming Perps V4 release, which features a centralized limit order book architecture on Ethereum. The SIP-415 and DIP proposals to merge Synthetix and Derive have been mutually withdrawn following thoughtful discussion and community feedback. This moment reaffirms our independent path and the community's belief in it. Derive operations remain uninterrupted. Trading is live,… https://t.co/Uf5DmZNME5 — Derive (@derivexyz) May 21, 2025 Without the merger, the team will now look at alternative strategies to boost its product suite. For its part, Derive reaffirmed its commitment to building independently, positioning the decision as a moment to double down on its own roadmap. Synthetix Pushes New Staking Plan to Restore sUSD Peg Last month, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick urged SNX stakers to participate in the newly launched sUSD 420 Pool, a staking mechanism introduced to restore the sUSD stablecoin’s dollar peg. The pool offers a share of 5 million SNX tokens to users who lock up their sUSD for 12 months, aiming to reduce the token’s circulating supply and stabilize its value. Despite the incentive, Warwick admitted the process is still “very manual” and lacks a proper user interface, which is currently in development. He warned that if voluntary participation remains low even after the UI launches, more aggressive measures could follow. sUSD, a crypto-collateralized stablecoin backed by SNX, has struggled to maintain its peg, recently falling as low as $0.68 before recovering to $0.77. Warwick emphasized that the solution lies within the SNX community, whose combined wealth could resolve the issue. The initiative is part of SIP-420, which also shifts debt risk from stakers to the protocol itself.

Sharing a clip from a Coindesk report featuring lead anchor Christine Lee, XRP Governor drew attention to a predicted surge to $8, stating, “The breakout could be closer than anyone thinks.” BREAKING Top traders are now eyeing a massive $8 #XRP surge, momentum is building, and the charts are heating up. The breakout could be closer than anyone thinks… Are you ready? pic.twitter.com/FryK8SwVGh — XRP Governor (@xrpgovernor) May 24, 2025 Golden Cross Signals Bullish Shift At the center of the discussion is XRP/BTC’s first-ever golden cross on the weekly chart—a technical formation where the 50-week simple moving average (SMA) crosses above the 200-week SMA. This is generally interpreted as a bullish indicator, suggesting that XRP’s short-term momentum is now stronger than its long-term trend, relative to Bitcoin. The chart, analyzed by Coindesk’s Omkar Godbole, also shows that XRP has broken out of a four-year-long consolidation channel against BTC. This extended period of sideways movement between resistance and support levels has now given way to upward price action. The breakout and formation of the golden cross are signals that XRP may be entering a new bullish phase. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Altcoin Season Potential and ETF Speculation Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at BitGet Research, emphasized the potential broader implications of this movement. Speaking to Coindesk, Lee noted that a reduction in Bitcoin dominance could support the start of an altcoin rally. Experts have shown that reduced Bitcoin dominance usually gives way to altcoin surges . Lee suggested that XRP and Solana are particularly well-positioned to benefit from this shift, aided partly by ongoing speculation around the potential for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Regulatory Clarity and Target Projections Lee also pointed to XRP’s evolving regulatory landscape and recent breakout patterns as supporting factors for renewed investor interest. As a result, he suggested traders are increasingly targeting medium-term price levels between $3 and $8 for XRP. This combination of improving technical conditions and positive developments has encouraged analysts and traders to revisit XRP’s potential upside. The Coindesk chart marks the Golden Cross as a focal point, highlighting a critical area where bullish sentiment takes shape after years of relative underperformance. XRP’s price performance has historically been closely linked to developments in its regulatory status and broader market sentiment. With recent signs of stabilization on the legal front and excitement for the altcoin market in the short term, market participants are beginning to position themselves for a potential move toward higher targets.

The wallet has gone long on PEPE with $1 million at 10x leverage, flipping from billion-dollar bitcoin trades to high-stakes memecoin bets. The position is already up $500,000 as of European morning hours, with pepe up nearly 6% in the past few hours. Pseudonymous trader “James Wynn” — known as “moonpig” on decentralized exchange Hyperliquid — closed their $1.2 billion BTC long position with a $17.5 million loss on Monday. Wynn then opened a $1 billion short using 40x leverage, effectively wagering their entire $50 million wallet on the downside. Both positions are a record for an onchain platform and represent the biggest bets placed entirely on a blockchain-based service. Wynn’s new short was opened at an average price of $107,077, and has already netted about $3 million in profit as BTC hovered just below that level Monday, before losing some value. The trade is a high-risk musical chairs event: if BTC rises above $110,446, Wynn’s position could be liquidated unless additional collateral is posted, data shows. That position is since closed and Wynn said on X stepping away from perpetual trading altogether. They have netted a total profit of $25 million from an initial above $3 million, the account said on X. “Now decided to leave the casino with my $25,000,000 profit,” he posted. “It’s been fun, but now it’s time for me to walk away a wynner.”",Markets|Bitcoin|Pepe|Top Stories|News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-26 08:10:21

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $110,019 (+1.6%) Market cap $2.19 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $56.76 Billion (-38%) Circulating supply 19.86 Million BTC All-time high $111,970; May 22, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $110,256 24-hour low $106,683 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $110,019 Price Prediction $119,922 (+8.01%) Fear & Greed Index 78 (Extreme Greed) Sentiment Bullish Price Volatility (30-day variation) 5.04% Green Days 17/30 (60%) 50-Day SMA $93,698 200-Day SMA $86,424 14-Day RSI 77.24 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin jumped strongly and neared the $110K level before correcting slightly. Resistance for BTC is at $111,813 Support for BTC/USD is at $106,355 The BTC price analysis for 26 May confirms that BTC faces a surge in bullish volatility as it surged above $110K. However, bears defended that level strongly, resulting in a pullback below $110K. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin price faces intense volatility around $110K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that BTC faced a strong surge toward $110K. However, sellers strongly defended further surges, resulting in a slight bearish correction below Fib channels. The 24-hour volume has surged to $2.1 billion, showing a rise in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $110,019, surging by over 1.6% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin shows bullish volatility The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level but trades near the overbought region at 70, hinting that a bearish correction might be on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls face minor resistance at $104K The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bears are strengthening their position to hold the price below the $106K level. Currently, bears are aiming for a drop below EMA50 trend line. Bitcoin aims for immediate correction The BoP indicator trades in a bullish region at 0.48, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. However, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence. Bitcoin technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $99,928 BUY SMA 5 $103,323 BUY SMA 10 $103,269 BUY SMA 21 $101,521 BUY SMA 50 $93,698 BUY SMA 100 $90,715 BUY SMA 200 $86,424 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $99,545 BUY EMA 5 $95,481 BUY EMA 10 $90,573 BUY EMA 21 $87,557 BUY EMA 50 $87,804 BUY EMA 100 $89,012 BUY EMA 200 $85,643 BUY What to expect from BTC price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $111,813, it will fuel a bullish rally to $113,395. BTC/USDT Chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $106,355, beginning a bearish trend to $101,962. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced increased buying domination in recent hours as buyers gained strong confidence. As a result, it broke through immediate Fib channels, resulting in a surge toward $110K. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are set to expand the Trump family’s cryptocurrency business portfolio by investing in Bitcoin mining-focused Hut 8. Hut 8, based in Miami, announced the launch of its majority-owned subsidiary, American Bitcoin, dedicated to Bitcoin mining and strategic reserve development. Bitcoin price prediction May 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. In the last few weeks of April, the price of Bitcoin recovered smoothly and touched a high around $95K. Will Bitcoin continue its recovery rally in May? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $91,000 and be pushed further, at least $108,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $85,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction May 2025 $85,000 $91,000 $108,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|UNI,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-26 08:11:42

Global crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) recorded $3.3 billion of inflows during the week ending May 24, bringing total inflows year-to-date to a new record of $10.8 billion, CoinShares reported on May 26. CoinShares head of research James Butterfill said total assets under management (AUM) in crypto ETPs briefly reached an all-time high of $187.5 billion, reflecting strong investor interest. “We believe that growing concerns over the US economy, driven by the Moody’s downgrade and the resulting spike in treasury yields, have prompted investors to seek diversification through digital assets,” Butterfill wrote. Crypto ETPs keep breaking records The latest CoinShares data marks another record-breaking milestone for crypto ETPs, following a historic surge in YTD inflows the previous week. In mid-May, crypto investment products added $785 million in new inflows, pushing the YTD total to $7.5 billion by May 16, according to CoinShares. The new inflow record not only surpassed the previous peak of $7.2 billion recorded in February 2025 but also fully recovered the nearly $7 billion of outflows seen during the subsequent price correction in February and March, Butterfill said.

Bitcoin price jumped to $110,000, while the market cap of all coins jumped to $3.57 trillion. This article provides top forecasts for trending cryptocurrencies like Pepe (PEPE), Sui (SUI), and Zebec Network (ZBCN). Zebec Network price analysis ZBCN price chart | Source: TradingView Zebec Network price has gone parabolic in the past few weeks, moving from a low of $0.0007085 earlier this month to $0.005500, a 642% surge that has pushed its market cap to over $460 million. This surge happened as the Solana ecosystem rebounded and as investors embraced its technology. For starters, Zebec is a blockchain project in the payment and real world asset tokenization industry. It offers Zebec debet cards and other RWA solutions. According to its website, it has over 50,000 users and over 250 payroll enterprise clients. The daily chart shows that the ZBCN token price went parabolic and crossed the important resistance level at $0.002135, its highest point on February 22. By moving above that level, the coin invalidated the double-top chart pattern. ZBCN price has moved above all moving averages, a sign that bulls are in control. However, oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stochastic have moved to the overbought level. Therefore, while the uptrend may continue, there is a risk that the Zebec price will have a harsh reversal in the next few days. This retreat will happen because of profit-taking among investors and mean reversal. Mean reversal is a situation where an asset moves back to its moving average levels. If this happens, the most likely scenario is where Zebec price drops and retests the support level at $0.002135 and then resumes the uptrend. Pepe price technical analysis Pepe chart by TradingView Pepe, the giant Ethereum-based meme coin, has done well this year as it moved from a low of $0.000005252 on March 11 to $0.000015 tody. The coin has formed a golden cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages have crossed each other. Pepe has also formed a bullish flag pattern, a popular continuation sign. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the coin will continue rising as bulls target the all-time high of $0.00002823. If this happens, the coin will rise by about 96% from the current level. Read more: Pepe coin price prediction: 3 reasons this meme coin will surge Sui price technical analysis Chart by TradingView Sui Network has been in the spotlight in the past few days after the giant $220 million hack on its biggest DEX platform. As we wrote last week, the hack will likely have a minimal impact on its operations in the long term. The daily chart shows that the Sui price has remained at $3.65 on Monday, a few points above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. It has formed a bullish pennant pattern, a popular continuation sign. Therefore, the Sui price will likely have a bullish breakout in the coming days as bulls target the year-to-date high of $5.3570, the highest point in January this year. This price target is about 47% above the current level.

The transaction, filed on May 20, shows that Reschenthaler sold between $1,001 and $15,000 worth of SOL on May 12, a day when Solana was trading at approximately $170.48. Currently, SOL is trading at $177.99, meaning the lawmaker exited just ahead of a small upward move in the token’s price. SOL price performance since May 12. Source: Finbold The filing is part of the routine public disclosures required under the STOCK Act, which mandates that members of Congress report financial trades within 45 days. In this case, the disclosure came eight days after the trade, well within the legal window, but notable given the ongoing debate around lawmakers trading cryptocurrencies and other volatile digital assets. Why did Reschenthaler buy Solana? Solana, which has gained renewed attention in 2025 for its role in hosting meme tokens like Official Trump ( TRUMP ) which surged up until May 22 in anticipation of Trump’s crypto dinner, continues to be one of the most actively traded layer-1 tokens on U.S. exchanges. The sale by Reschenthaler comes amid broader market momentum, with Solana up over 17% in the last month. Notably, this isn’t the first time the Congressman has disclosed crypto activity. Earlier filings show trades involving Bitcoin ( BTC ) and XRP , indicating a pattern of exposure to high-profile digital assets. As congressional crypto oversight tightens, trades like these remain under the spotlight, especially when they involve timely entries or exits from trending tokens like Solana.

Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) was trading at $38.3 at press time, up by 315% from its April low and pushing its market capitalization to $12.85 billion. The rally has been driven by surging trading volume, growing open interest, and rising network fees. According to da t a from DeFiLlama, Hyperliquid’s seven-day volume climbed 13.36% to $78.67 billion, making it the most active player in DeFi right now. In terms of derivatives trading, Hyperliquid has now processed over $1.56 trillion in perpetual futures volume, far exceeding Jupiter’s $310.9 billion, the second-largest platform in this space. This momentum has translated into a record-high open interest of $1.39 billion. Perpetual futures, which are similar to traditional futures contracts but without expiration dates, have become a go-to tool for crypto traders. They let users apply leverage and aim for higher returns, something that’s helped fuel HYPE’s rise. Additionally, weekly fee revenue reached an all-time high of $22.26 million, marking four consecutive weeks of fee growth. The spike in fees is especially important because Hyperliquid could potentially use a portion of it to buy back HYPE from the open market, which may boost the price by cutting down supply. You might also like: Bitcoin reclaims $109K as Trump extends EU tariffs deadline to allow for talks Adding to the momentum, Hyperliquid recently submitted two formal letters to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in response to its call for public input on perpetual futures and 24/7 crypto trading. The move was well received by the crypto community, with many praising Hyperliquid’s proactive engagement with regulators. HYPE shot up roughly 15% within hours after the announcement. Institutional and large investor interest in HYPE also appears to be rising. According to blockchain data shared by Lookonchain, two whale addresses recently acquired approximately $10.09 million worth of HYPE. Such large transactions often trigger follow-on demand from retail investors who track whale activity as a sentiment indicator. This retail interest is already visible. Google Trends data shows a sharp spike in search volume for “HYPE,” which further confirms an uptick in interest among retail users, and is often a precursor to increased trading activity and market momentum.. Technically, things are looking just as strong. On the 4-hour chart, HYPE recently broke out of a symmetrical triangle pattern, a common bullish signal. It’s also trading well above both the 20-day and 50-day simple moving averages, which points to a solid uptrend and usually acts as a buy signal for many traders. HYPE price, 20-day and 50-day SMA chart — May 26 | Source: crypto.news On top of that, HYPE appears to be forming a textbook cup-and-handle pattern. This pattern, often seen as a bullish continuation setup, includes a rounded bottom, a horizontal resistance, and a short consolidation phase.

According to a report from local media Edaily, lawmakers from the South Korean Democratic party are pushing for the government to start institutionalizing Korean won-pegged stablecoins . Chairman of the party’s Digital Asset Committee, Min Byeong-deok, believes the global stablecoin market has the potential to become “bigger than artificial intelligence or semiconductors” in the near future. Min emphasized the urgency of institutionalizing stablecoins pegged to the Korean won. He views it as a way to not only strengthen its national fiat currency through crypto, but also to potentially boost global demand for won-backed assets. “We need to take the lead in institutionalizing stablecoins before U.S. dollar-based stablecoins become firmly established. That is the only way we can secure a sure position in the global battle for stablecoin hegemony,” said Min in his statement.

Inside sources claim Lee is interested in accelerating the roll-out of KRW stablecoins, aiming to establish them quickly before U.S. proceeds to establish stablecoin bills. These regulations could potentially boost the domination of strongholds like Circle ( USDC ) and Tether’s ( USDT ) U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins on the market. “These two [stable]coins account for 90% of the stablecoin market in the United States, and are also used in some areas of Korea, such as Dongdaemun, where many foreign payments are made,” continued Min. Min said that he is currently urging South Korean lawmakers to pass a stablecoin bill, with a working draft titled “Basic Act on Digital Assets.” Min has reportedly conducted a second review process with industry experts and the media. He plans to submit the bill after the third review. Most recently, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act of 2025, or the GENIUS Act passed the U.S. Senate vote, garnering 66 votes in favor. It is currently headed to a full floor vote, bringing it closer to becoming formalized as the first U.S. stablecoin bill.

Stablecoin issuer Tether ( USDT ) says its main focus will remain outside the United States, even as U.S. lawmakers make progress on new rules for stablecoins. Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, told Bloomberg in an interview that it was important for the company to see “how the Genius Act is distinguishing between foreign issuers and domestic issuers,” adding that Tether’s main interest would remain “outside of the U.S.” “We are looking at the Genius Act in a way that will allow us to be compliant. We can be compliant while still having a strong focus on foreign markets.” Paolo Ardoino You might also like: US banks plot joint stablecoin as regulation looms over crypto sector On Monday, May 19, the Genius Act, a Senate bill backed by the crypto industry, advanced in Congress. The House Financial Services Committee has approved its own version of a stablecoin bill, though it has yet to reach a full vote. Stablecoin bills in both chambers would require issuers to fully back tokens with cash or safe assets like short-term U.S. Treasuries. The rules would also place stablecoin firms under anti-money-laundering regulations and the Bank Secrecy Act. Ardoino noted that while stablecoins are important in the United States, the country already has many payment options such as Zelle, PayPal, debit cards, credit cards, and cash. While Tether has faced past scrutiny in the U.S. and settled with regulators in 2021, the firm’s reserves are now managed by Cantor Fitzgerald, a financial services firm formerly led by Howard Lutnick, who recently transferred ownership to his children and outside investors as he joined the White House.

Dedaub explained that the flaw involved an “overflow” in the math used by Cetus’s automated market maker, where a miswritten condition failed to properly handle the most significant bits of large numerical inputs and “didn’t produce the intended result.” Instead of rejecting oversized values, the system truncated them, causing the output to appear much smaller than it should have. This allowed the attacker to deposit just a single token while the protocol mistakenly credited them with an enormous liquidity position. They then used that position to withdraw large amounts of real assets from the pools. You might also like: SUI price stalls below $4 resistance as $223M Cetus Protocol hack weighs down on sentiment According to Dedaub, a similar vulnerability had been flagged in early 2023 by blockchain security firm Ottersec during an audit of the protocol’s codebase when it was deployed on Aptos. However, after the code was later ported to the Sui network, the underlying issue still remained. Although developers attempted to implement safeguards, the overflow check was flawed, allowing the same type of exploit to slip through unnoticed. “This incident shows why edge cases in DeFi can’t be ignored,” Dedaub warned, adding that complex math in decentralized finance needs careful review and testing. It urged developers to verify overflow protection manually, especially when using large numbers or advanced math. Cetus exploit triggered sell-off Cetus, a leading DEX on the SUI network, was hacked in the early hours of May 22 , triggering one of the largest losses in the Sui ecosystem to date. Initial investigations claimed the incident stemmed from an “oracle bug.”. The exploit led to over $223 million in losses across various liquidity pools, sparking a broad sell-off in related tokens, including SUI and CETUS, which dropped over 40% in the hours after the breach. Memecoins and smaller market cap tokens native to the network saw even steeper losses, with some plunging by over 90%. In response, the Sui Foundation coordinated with validators to freeze around $163 million of the stolen funds. Cetus has also announced a $5 million bounty for information that identifies those responsible.

TRX Up 1.25 Percent: High Volume Support Area Pushes Price Up TRX formed a new trading range in the $0.269–$0.273 range and rose 1.25% amid strong volume support in this region. TRX’s recent stability is remarkable despite the uncertainty created in the markets by the escalating trade wars between major economies. While Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are volatile, TRX’s steady rise indicates an increase in institutional interest in blockchain projects that stand out with their practical use cases and high transaction volume. Technical Outlook: Strong Momentum Backed by Volume TRX has traded in a 1.25% range ($0.269–$0.273) over the past 24 hours. The price remained stable with strong buying at key support levels. Between 09:00 and 11:00 in the morning, the price climbed from $0.270 to $0.273 with a trading volume exceeding 120 million, and this region was recorded as a high-volume support area. At 23:00, the trading volume rose above the average, indicating that momentum was regained around $0.272. A mini capitulation occurred at 01:24, with TRX falling sharply from $0.2728 to $0.2721 with a volume of 2.58 million units. However, immediately afterwards, strong buying of 2.76 million units took place in the $0.2719-0.2720 range between 01:57-01:58, and the price climbed back up to the $0.2724 level. According to technical data, TRX is in a position to continue its upward trend with both the resistance it has shown at short-term resistance levels and strong support volume. Analysts state that TRX could have a wider upward movement area if the price permanently breaks through the $0.273 resistance. The continued institutional interest and stability shown amid general volatility in the markets places TRX among the tokens to watch in the short term. *This is not investment advice.

Kiyosaki says ‘even .01 Bitcoin’ could make you very rich,https://finbold.com/r-kiyosaki-says-even-0-1-bitcoin-could-make-you-very-rich/,"‘Rich Dad Poor Dad ’ author Robert Kiyosaki is doubling down on Bitcoin ( BTC ), again. In a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday, May 26, Kiyosaki called the leading cryptocurrency the simplest path to wealth creation today, writing: “I cannot believe how easy Bitcoin has made getting rich…so easy. Why everyone is not buying and holding Bitcoin is beyond me. Even .01 of a Bitcoin is going to be priceless in two years… and maybe make you very rich.” The finance guru acknowledged Bitcoin’s volatility but dismissed it as part of the deal, adding, “sure Bitcoin goes up and down… but so does real life.” Notably, with BTC trading at $109,949 at press time, .01 BTC is currently worth $1,099. He went on to highlight the scarcity of Bitcoin, noting that only 1–2 million BTC are left to be mined, which could accelerate its value trajectory. Quoting macro investor Raoul Pal, Kiyosaki said Bitcoin is entering what Pal calls the “Banana Zone”—a phase of explosive price movement. “Don’t be a yellow banana,” Kiyosaki warned. “Open your eyes and your mind and listen to people like Raoul Pal, Michael Saylor, Anthony Pompliano… then follow content on Bitcoin Zella and look into the future of money.” Kiyosaki slams US Bonds as “Toilet Paper” Kiyosaki’s latest remarks follow a separate post from May 21, where he doubled down on his long-standing critique of fiat currencies and debt instruments—specifically U.S. bonds. Reacting to Moody’s downgrade of the U.S. credit outlook, he compared U.S. Treasuries to “toilet paper,” writing: “As you know I have been a broken record pleading with people to buy real gold, silver, and Bitcoin… no ETFs,” he wrote. “ETFs are more expensive toilet paper. When Moody’s downgraded U.S. toilet paper… I feel vindicated.” He continued: “Central banks are dumping U.S. bonds to buy gold, and no one wants to buy more U.S. toilet paper. America is in serious trouble.” Previously he had forecasted Bitcoin reaching $500,000 to $1 million over the next several years, driven by rising inflation, weakening trust in the U.S. dollar, and growing institutional adoption. More recently, he revised his 2025 price target to between $180,000 and $200,000, still suggesting significant upside from current levels. Featured image via Cavaleria Com YouTube The post R.

As the Bitcoin price climbs toward $115,000, major altcoins are seizing the momentum and rewriting investor expectations. The current surge highlights a broader shift from institutional caution to high-confidence accumulation. The Bitcoin price recently hit $111,814, shattering its previous record and sending shockwaves across the market. This macro surge has given key altcoins like Hyperliquid (HYPE) and Avalanche (AVAX) space to thrive. In parallel, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is entering the spotlight as investors move toward emerging projects with strong community appeal and AI-powered utility. Hyperliquid (HYPE): DeFi’s New Market Giant Hyperliquid (HYPE) continues to outpace competitors in decentralized finance, establishing dominance in perpetual trading. With a price nearing $34.74, Hyperliquid (HYPE) now commands over $11.9 billion in market cap and over $430 million in Total Value Locked . Since its 2023 launch, Hyperliquid (HYPE) has overtaken dYdX in both open interest and daily volume, to become the leading decentralized perpetual exchange. Hyperliquid’s (HYPE) custom Layer 1 blockchain and buyback-focused model have fueled user migration from centralized exchanges. Avalanche (AVAX): Building Real-World Blockchain Infrastructure Trading near $25.1, Avalanche (AVAX) has seen a rise in trading volume, signaling investor confidence. The launch of Growth Protocol on Avalanche (AVAX), backed by Nazara Technologies and Lysto, showcases its potential in on-chain advertising. FIFA’s plan to build a Layer 1 chain on Avalanche (AVAX) and VanEck’s upcoming PurposeBuilt Fund targeting AVAX-based businesses have reaffirmed its momentum. Its RSI reading reflects continued bullishness as Avalanche (AVAX) eyes the $30 mark. FloppyPepe (FPPE): Meme Culture Meets AI Utility The FloppyPepe (FPPE) ecosystem features three core AI tools. Meme-o-Matic enables users to generate instant memes, FloppyX powers AI-driven short-form video content, and FloppyAI provides real-time crypto sentiment analytics. These tools bridge the gap between meme culture and functional blockchain utility. FloppyPepe (FPPE) also stands out for its unique Floppynomics model. A 1% burn reduces supply, 1% is redistributed to holders, and another 1% supports wildlife conservation. Its SolidProof audit adds credibility, while limited-edition hand-drawn art and community-led storytelling fuel long-term engagement. While the surging Bitcoin price dominates the charts, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is making waves as a cultural and AI-powered phenomenon. Inspired by Matt Furie’s iconic Pepe the Frog, the altcoin taps into nostalgia while offering tangible utility. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Presale Enters Stage 2 Even as the Bitcoin price continues its robust performance, the FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale, priced at $0.00000035, has officially advanced to Stage 2. Following a sold-out Stage 1 that raised over $2 million, the meme coin continues to attract investors at an impressive pace. Over $100,000 has already been raised in this new phase, reflecting strong early traction. The limited-time FLOPPY80 bonus remains active, offering an 80% token boost at checkout. This high-value incentive will not last long, especially as Stage 2 draws new investors in with rising visibility. The next pricing tier is fast approaching, further increasing urgency. Given the presale’s explosive growth and the AI utility baked into the project, this could be the last chance to get the token at near-ground-floor levels. Despite the Bitcoin price dominating market conversations, FloppyPepe's (FPPE) tech-forward and community-first approach makes it a top altcoin investment option. Altcoins Rise With Bitcoin Price – FloppyPepe (FPPE) Grabs the Spotlight As the Bitcoin price barrels toward $115,000, it creates fertile ground for standout altcoins to rise. Hyperliquid (HYPE) has taken the DeFi crown with explosive volume and advanced tokenomics. Meanwhile, Avalanche (AVAX) is powering a new era of blockchain adoption with key institutional backing and technical milestones. For FloppyPepe (FPPE) , it is clear that this altcoin captures wallets by combining meme culture, AI-driven utilities, and its sustainable Floppynomics. The time-sensitive FLOPPY80 bonus and a rising presale price of $0.00000035 mark a turning point that could define its path into the next crypto cycle.

Investor concerns over the U.S. economy and rising treasury yields are driving diversification into digital assets. Bitcoin led with $2.9 billion in inflows, while XRP recorded its largest-ever weekly outflows at $37.2 million. Institutional appetite for crypto investment products surged last week, with digital asset funds raking in $3.3 billion in inflows, according to data from CoinShares. The wave of capital pushed year-to-date inflows to a record-breaking $10.8 billion, signaling renewed confidence in the sector. CoinShares’ head of research James Butterfill noted that total assets under management in crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) briefly touched an all-time high of $187.5 billion. Moody’s Downgrade Spurs Digital Asset Inflows The uptick comes amid mounting concerns over the U.S. economy following a Moody’s downgrade and rising treasury yields, which have prompted investors to seek diversification. “We believe that growing concerns over the US economy, driven by the Moody’s downgrade and the resulting spike in treasury yields, have prompted investors to seek diversification through digital assets.” Nevertheless, the United States led the inflows with $3.2 billion, while Germany, Hong Kong, and Australia contributed $41.5 million, $33.3 million, and $10.9 million, respectively. In contrast, Switzerland recorded $16.6 million in outflows, as investors cashed in on recent price gains. Bitcoin remained the top draw, attracting $2.9 billion, nearly 25% of all inflows for 2024. Short-Bitcoin products also saw increased activity, pulling in $12.7 million — the highest since December — suggesting some traders are betting against recent price rallies. Ethereum continued its positive momentum with $326 million in inflows, marking its fifth consecutive week of gains and the strongest week in nearly four months. XRP, however, saw its 80-week inflow streak break, posting a record $37.2 million in outflows. Bitcoin Surges After Trump Delays EU Tariffs Bitcoin briefly surged past $111,000 before retreating to $109,600 late Sunday, as markets responded to US President Donald Trump’s decision to delay a proposed 50% tariff on European Union goods. The announcement followed a phone call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, granting more time for trade negotiations and easing global market tensions. U.S. stock futures climbed modestly, signaling cautious optimism. However, volatility remains high, with a new July 9 deadline keeping investors on edge. The earlier threat of steep tariffs caused Bitcoin to dip nearly 2%, illustrating the crypto market’s growing sensitivity to macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. https://twitter.com/Tryrexcrypto/status/1926777638376341747 Meanwhile, analysts suggest that institutional inflows, supportive regulation, and broader monetary trends continue to create a structurally strong foundation for the crypto market, even as political developments stir short-term volatility. As reported, Shunyet Jan, Head of Derivatives at Bybit, has projected that Bitcoin could reach $125,000 by the end of Q2 if current trends persist. Last week, crypto analyst Scott Melker said he believes Bitcoin could surge to $250,000 by the end of 2025 , driven by institutional demand and a maturing market structure. Likewise, Adam Back, a prominent figure in the Bitcoin community and CEO of Blockstream, believes that Bitcoin is significantly undervalued and could surge to between $500,000 and $1 million per coin during the current market cycle.

With their potential for explosive rallies, these tokens could potentially turn $600 into $600,000. Experts anticipate they could soar by 21,000% to reach a new ATH, making them enticing choices for those seeking substantial returns. Among its counterparts, the AI-powered meme coin stands out as a dark horse. FloppyPepe (FPPE): AI Meme Coin Breaking Boundaries With 21,000% Growth Outlook FloppyPepe (FPPE) is making waves as the meme coin fusing artificial intelligence with internet meme culture in a big way. After its private presale sold out in under 24 hours, each following round has drawn huge attention, setting the stage for a token with serious upside—analysts project gains of up to 21,000%. The hype isn’t random. FloppyPepe (FPPE) comes with built-in AI tools that grab attention: FloppyAI, a smart chatbot; Meme-o-Matic, which whips up memes in seconds; and FloppyX, a creative video tool using AI. These features are driving buzz and bringing in a wave of interest from across the space. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) token setup includes a burn method that steadily cuts supply, rewarding those who hold longer. Staking also gives passive income and access to rare meme art, putting it a step ahead of coins like POPCAT and BONK. At $0.00000035, backed by Matt Furie’s legacy and a security check from SolidProof, the AI-token is fast becoming one of the biggest stories in the meme coin scene. Why Investors Are Accumulating FloppyPepe (FPPE) Massively AI Meme GeneratorMeme-o-Matic quickly creates memes, wallpapers, and digital art that match today’s meme culture and keep the content rolling. Style Control OptionsUsers can adjust the AI output to match current trends or personal taste, avoiding cookie-cutter results and keeping things interesting. Verified ContractA full review by SolidProof adds a layer of trust, helping reduce risk and making users more confident in the project. Popcat (POPCAT): Meme-Driven Momentum Ready To Surge Popcat (POPCAT) , trading at $0.5026, has sparked a frenzy in the Solana meme coin landscape, showing no signs of slowing down. Fueled by viral energy and a passionate community, this meme coin has turned modest investments into five-figure returns almost overnight. With increasing whale activity and deeper liquidity locks, POPCAT is well-positioned for a parabolic breakout. Trader Travis noted on X (formerly Twitter) that POPCAT recently bounced off key support and the 50 EMA. The crucial resistance level to monitor is 60 cents, a strong barrier since the year started. A breakthrough here could signal the end of bearish sentiment. With its organic virality and strategic tokenomics, POPCAT is primed for explosive growth. Investors seeking the next big breakout are eyeing POPCAT as a potential 21,000% climber, capable of transforming $600 into $600,000. Bonk (BONK): Solana’s Meme Powerhouse Targets New Highs Bonk (BONK) , the first meme coin to elevate Solana memes globally, is experiencing a resurgence fueled by renewed whale interest and institutional curiosity. Despite its previous explosive run, Bonk (BONK) remains undervalued when considering its brand strength, listings, and adoption on Solana-based DEXs. Analyst SolidTradesz highlighted on X that Bonk’s (BONK) daily chart is looking promising, with the 50 RSI level holding as support and pushing toward $0.000022, signaling bullish momentum. Investors flocking to Bonk (BONK) are capitalizing on a familiar name with significant growth potential, especially as staking rewards expand and liquidity deepens. The meme coin's price floor is solidifying, indicating the possibility of a second major wave. Altcoin enthusiasts and crypto experts agree that Bonk (BONK) has the momentum and community backing to achieve a remarkable 21,000% rally. Don't Miss Your Chance: Join The FloppyPepe (FPPE) Presale And Enjoy An 80% Bonus POPCAT, BONK, and FloppyPepe (FPPE) are turning heads, but only one stands out. FloppyPepe (FPPE) leads with AI-powered meme tools, deflationary tokenomics, and cultural backing from Matt Furie. It’s the clear frontrunner for those chasing serious upside. Investors can capitalize on an 80% bonus and unlock FloppyAI’s creative suite using code FLOPPY80, gaining extra tokens instantly.

Over the weekend, Wynn exited his $1.2 billion long position on Bitcoin , taking a $17.5 million loss , only to quickly flip and open a $1 billion short position with 40x leverage . This aggressive move briefly earned him $3 million in profit before he closed the trade and announced his retirement from perpetual trading. Not stopping there, Wynn entered a $1 million leveraged long on PEPE , the popular memecoin, betting 10x and quickly gaining $500,000 as the token jumped nearly 6% in European trading hours. Wynn claims he’s ending his run after turning a $3–4 million wallet into $25 million , despite once being up as much as $87 million.

Cardano (ADA) is 2.4% higher in 24 hours, at $0.81, and is expected to hit $1.80 by December 2025. Solana (SOL), standing at around $186, could easily reach $200 and potentially $336.25 by the end of the year with network growth. XRP, which is currently at $2.43, could fall as low as $2.21 in the near future but could be as high as $5.50 by 2025 end if there is any progress in regulatory and ETF approvals. Emerging on the scene is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi project currently in its presale phase. The project has entered phase 5 of its presale following phase 4 selling out in less time than projected. MUTM will enter the markets officially at $0.06, while currently up 200% since its presale launch. The next phase prices will spike by 16.67% to $0.035. The tokens are available at $0.03, with listing at $0.06, offering early investors up to 100% potential returns. MUTM is rapidly taking center stage, with over $9.3 million raised and attracting more than 11,500 investors. Phase 4 Sold Out, MUTM’s Ascent Is Only Beginning The presale is in phase5 with Phase 4 totally sold out. The tokens are available at $0.03, and listing for $0.06, early investors are looking at up to 100% potential returns. MUTM is rapidly taking center stage, with over $9.3 million raised and attracting more than 11,500 investors. As Phase 5 is in, the token price will rise to $0.035 in the next phase, providing current participants with a 16.67% profit. A Smarter DeFi Model: Hybrid Lending for a New Era Mutuum Finance stands out through its dual approach to crypto lending, which integrates Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) allows users to put stablecoins like USDT into smart contract liquidity pools and automatically earn passive income. In contrast, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) allows lenders and borrowers to communicate directly without intermediaries, with the ability to adjust loan terms and privacy advantages. This is a hybrid solution that provides more decentralization and flexibility but at the same time has strong yield opportunities, while liquidity providers receive over 10% today in passive return. Trust and Transparency: Stable, Audited, and Made to Last Mutuum Finance isn’t just innovating, it’s building trust. The platform’s smart contracts are open-source and undergoing rigorous audit by Certik. In addition to the native token, a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin is being developed, which circumvents the vulnerabilities of algorithmic stablecoins that have toppled other DeFi initiatives. The project is set to build a USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum network as one of the main features in the Mutuum Finance roadmap. Security and transparency are fundamentals of the ecosystem. MUTM Is Gaining Ground in the 2025 Altcoin Race Though leading altcoins like Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and XRP are holding up well with robust market caps and upward-looking predictions, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is turning out to be the dark horse surprise with enormous potential upside. With a hybrid DeFi lending framework, audited smart contracts, and an entirely collateralized stablecoin in the works, MUTM is more than just a presale token, it’s emerging as a long-term player in decentralized finance. Phase 5 existing presale price of $0.03 offers a rare 100% ROI opportunity, with tokens beginning at $0.06. With Phase 6 in the future and a 16.67% cost increase in the works, it is the strategic moment for early adopters to strike. Don’t wait for the next tide, ride the wave early with MUTM.

The Ethereum price action shows a convincing rebound from the $2,470–$2,495 demand zone, backed by improving indicators and fresh interest across spot and derivatives markets.

Details of the trade indicate that the transaction occurred on the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid, where Wynn incurred a $15.86 million loss after closing a short position on Bitcoin, according to the latest on-chain data obtained by Finbold from HyperDash . James Wynn losing Bitcoin short position. Source: HyperDash The loss was recorded on May 25, following the closure of Wynn’s BTC short. He took a $15.53 million hit on the position itself, along with nearly $940,899 in fees, resulting in a net loss of $15.86 million. Notably, after the trade, data shows that Wynn had opened a $1 billion short position using 40x leverage, risking his entire $50 million wallet. This stands as the largest on-chain bet ever placed. The short position was entered at an average price of $107,077. If BTC rises above $110,446, the position risks liquidation unless additional collateral is provided. Profitable PEPE bet This setback sharply contrasts with Wynn’s recent streak of profitable trades. Just before the BTC short, he closed a long position in PEPE, securing a massive $25.19 million profit. Moreover, a previous long on BTC had netted him another $18.36 million. As previously reported by Finbold, Wynn had held a long position in Bitcoin amounting to 11,588 BTC, valued at approximately $1.25 billion at the time. Indeed, the investor has been highly active in recent weeks. Over the past 75 days, he has executed 38 trades on Hyperliquid, 17 of which were profitable, yielding a 45% win rate.

After a brief rally to $2.20, Virtuals token is now facing downward pressure on the charts, with many traders redirecting profits into FloppyPepe (FPPE) as analysts spotlight it as a more strategic play with 100x upside in this bull run. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Low Cap Potential Brings A Rare Edge This Bull Run Despite Virtuals token’s impressive rally, most of its supply is now in circulation as the protocol enters a more mature phase. Analysts caution that the growth potential of Virtuals token may be increasingly limited, especially when compared to lower-cap presale projects like FloppyPepe (FPPE), poised to offer untapped value and stronger potential for a 100x rally this bull run. Its presale, now in Stage 2, is priced at just $0.00000035—a level that has historically signaled major upside. The private round raised $907,200, while Stage 1 of the presale generated approximately $2 million, delivering substantial gains to early investors. With Stage 3 approaching, a price increase is imminent, and with an 80% bonus offer using code FLOPPY80, the ROI for current investors is further amplified if the predicted 100x rally holds. Meme Utility Reimagined: From Culture To Commerce FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) low entry point, compared to that of Virtuals token, mirrors early-cycle breakout narratives seen in high-performing tokens. However, unlike purely viral plays, it integrates utility through its proprietary AI suite, providing a practical and scalable foundation for lasting market relevance. It introduces a new layer of utility to meme coins by giving users access to AI tools like Meme-o-Matic and FloppyX, which enable real-time meme and video content creation aligned with trending topics. In a digital market driven by fleeting virality, offering adaptive utility tools could be a powerful way to attract both investors and users. Moreover, staking rewards, airdrops, and deflationary token mechanics incentivizes token holding. When combined with its AI utility, these features fuel social engagement and create a feedback loop of rising volume, growing scarcity, and sets the stage for a price rally during a market bull run. Robust Ecosystem Security Backed by Transparency Beyond its utility layer, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is fortified by a completed SolidProof audit , bug bounties, multi-signature wallet protections, and token locking mechanisms designed to prevent exploits and rug pulls. Transparency is further reinforced through proactive community education on wallet safety and regular updates to curb panic-driven selloffs. Moreover, the project is executing a tiered global rollout that promises a major surge. This includes: Global partnerships Influencer campaigns KoL collaborations Meme contests Discord launches Growth on platforms like X and YouTube with names like David In Crypto and Crypto Legends. Tier 1 CEX listings Uniswap deployment and CoinGecko/CMC debut to boost accessibility and visibility. Virtuals Token Holds Strong Amid Volatility Despite a recent 11% pullback to $1.96 from its recent peak of $2.212, Virtual's token has posted an impressive 30-day 183% rally during its micro bull run. Weekly chart analysis shows a strong recovery phase following a period of decline, with recent green candles indicating renewed bullish momentum and investor interest. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Time-Sensitive Reward Strategy While Virtuals token’s bull run enters a cooling phase, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) presale presents a rare blend of deep discounts, practical utility, and substantial upside potential. With Stage 2 recently launched at $0.00000035, early participation is crucial to secure the FLOPPY80 bonus to position for the inevitable price hike that could set the stage for significant gains. This presale not only offers profit potential but also rewards users with real utility through actionable products. Moreover, with a total supply of 120 trillion tokens and zero transaction tax, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) economic model boosts liquidity, positioning the token for imminent centralized and decentralized exchange listings that could trigger a major 100x rally. As Virtuals token delivers short gains through its micro bull run, FloppyPepe (FPPE) , combines low-cap advantage and meaningful utility, creating a wealth-generating ecosystem that potentially rewards investors constantly.

According to a press release from the Dubai Land Department (DLD), the new platform, dubbed Prypco Mint, is being rolled out in partnership with blockchain firms Prypco and Ctrl Alt. The initiative is supported by the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), the Central Bank of the UAE, and the Dubai Future Foundation, with Zand Digital Bank serving as the banking partner during the pilot phase. What is Prypco Mint? Prypco Mint enables UAE residents with a valid Emirates ID to invest in ready-to-own Dubai properties for as little as AED 2,000. Users can access the platform via mint.prypco.com to purchase blockchain-based tokens representing fractional property ownership. To ensure investor protection, all funds are held in regulated Client Money Accounts overseen by DLD, VARA, and the Central Bank of UAE. These funds are released only after all transactions are complete. Each property listed on the platform must undergo a regulatory pricing review to ensure fairness. Investors receive returns through a combination of rental income and potential appreciation in the value of the underlying asset, while holding a legally recognised share of ownership registered under DLD oversight. For the duration of the pilot phase, all transactions will be conducted exclusively in UAE dirhams, with no support for cryptocurrency payments. While the platform is currently limited to UAE residents, DLD has confirmed plans to expand the initiative globally in future phases. Dubai sees potential in the tokenization market According to the Dubai Land Department, tokenised property assets could make up as much as 7% of the city’s real estate market by 2033, which is estimated to be valued at AED 60 billion. Officials have speculated that fractional ownership can significantly increase market liquidity, streamline transactions, and lower barriers to entry for smaller investors. The launch of Prypco Mint falls under the Dubai Land Department’s broader Real Estate Evolution Space (REES) initiative, which was introduced to integrate emerging technologies and regulatory frameworks into the property sector. Developed in partnership with the VARA, REES serves as a platform to pilot blockchain-based projects that enhance transparency, improve investor protections, and drive innovation in property ownership. As previously reported by Invezz , REES was first announced in April as part of a strategic collaboration between DLD and VARA. The agreement outlined plans to link Dubai’s official real estate registry with blockchain-powered property tokens, creating a formal governance structure for digital asset transactions. Beyond real estate, Dubai has also introduced the Tokenization Regulatory Sandbox through the Dubai Financial Services Authority. This parallel initiative allows crypto and fintech firms to test tokenised financial products under regulatory supervision.

According to crypto vesting tracker Tokenomist, $3.3 billion in tokens will be released in June, a 32% decline in unlocked tokens month-on-month. In May, such tokens totaled $4.9 billion. Crypto projects allocate tokens for various purposes. For example, a company may promise tokens to team members to reward them for their contributions or sell them to early investors. However, projects usually lock the tokens for a specific period to prevent early holders from dumping before the project matures. The data shows that $1.4 billion in tokens will be released through a “cliff unlock,” while $1.9 billion will be emitted through a “linear unlock.” Cliff unlocks release a large portion or all of the vested tokens simultaneously, while linear unlocks emit crypto assets gradually. Largest crypto token unlocks in June Among the largest token unlocks in June is Metars Genesis (MRS), a non-fungible token (NFT) project that will release $193 million worth of tokens on June 21 to fund an artificial intelligence partnership. Since March, MRS has released 10 million tokens per month, with nearly $1 billion in tokens unlocked so far. Sui ( SUI ) is scheduled to unlock 44 million tokens worth about $160 million on June 1. The tokens will go to the Mysten Labs treasury, early contributors and the community reserve. The largest portion, valued at more than $70 million, is allocated to Series B investors. To date, Sui has unlocked 3.3 billion tokens valued at over $12 billion, roughly 33% of its total supply. Tokenomist data shows another 5.22 billion tokens worth nearly $20 billion remain without a scheduled release date. Tokenomist data showing Sui’s vesting schedule.

Fasttoken will release 20 million tokens worth $88 million allocated to its founders, while LayerZero is scheduled to unlock 25 million tokens worth $71 million to its core contributors and strategic partners. Aptos is expected to release 11.31 million tokens worth $61 million to its core contributors, foundation, community and investors.

45114050,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/team-liquid-loses-six-year-honda-sponsorship,1748252193,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/45114050.jpeg,Team Liquid Loses Six-Year Honda Sponsorship,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/team-liquid-loses-six-year-honda-sponsorship,"Honda has announced that it will end its relationship with Team Liquid. The sponsorship lasted for six years, and Honda decided to cut ties with the esports team due to the ""inappropriate player conduct."" The decision caused discussions in the media about sponsorships, the rising popularity of esports, and the set of rules and guidelines on appropriate behavior online for esports players. In this article, we'll dive into the controversy, presenting both Honda's and Team Liquid's points of view. What Caused the Issue? Team Liquid Rainbow Six player Lucas Dias published social media post that was seen as inappropriate and offensive towards Japanese players. The post came after Team Liquid lost to a Japanese team, CAG OSAKA, on May 13th. It included a GIF referencing the atomic bomb. Dias later deleted the post and issued a public apology via his social media. He called the incident ""a big mistake."" The team also stated that Dias made an apology to the players of the opposing team, who ""listened and accepted"" the apology. Team Liquid also issued the following statement:“We hold ourselves and our players to a high professional standard, and Lucas' tweet fell short of that standard. This does not reflect who we are as people and as an organization, and it should not define Lucas as an individual in the public perception. We believe that individuals who show a willingness to learn from their mistakes deserve the opportunity to improve themselves, and we are committed to providing Lucas with the training necessary to grow as a person. An honest mistake should not be the end of someone's career.” Honda's Reaction Honda has announced publicly that it's ending its sponsorship with the team because of the controversy caused by the post. It stated that its response started by lodging a strong complaint with the team and that the apology came about as a result of that complaint. It added that the company has decided to terminate the sponsorship ""after much consideration."" Honda also issued an apology to everyone offended by the post. It's further committed to sponsoring esports teams, and it does so with many other teams. The statement reads :""We deeply apologize for any offense this incident may have caused not only to the esports community but also to many people in Japan and globally. Honda will continue to support activities that provide positive value to society based on our company philosophy."" Team Liquid Response Team Liquid responded to Honda's decision, but it declined to answer questions from journalists on the matter. They've issued the following public statement: ""Due to the controversy generated by this incident, our automotive partner, Honda Motors, has made the decision not to renew our partnership,"" Team Liquid wrote. ""Although we regret this outcome, we understand and respect the decision and extend our thanks to Honda Motors for having been good partners for six years."" What's Next for Team Liquid? Team Liquid is actively competing in DreamLeague Season 26. It's also taking part in the eSports World Cup, which is currently in the qualification stage. It will be in Dallas for the Counter-Strike 2 tournament. That is to say, not much will change about the immediate events because of the cancellation. Team Liquid also has nine other sponsors. The most recent of these joined in April of 2025. The organization has also reaffirmed its commitment to supporting Pride Month by wearing a range of Pride jerseys throughout June and July, including the Esports World Cup. Broader Interest in eSports The broader interest in eSports is growing . It's noticeable in crypto betting on eSports, which is growing by the year in both the amounts and the number of players taking place. Experts, such as those from Cryptomaniaks, have long been writing about the natural compatibility between eSports and cryptos. Sponsorships such as the one between Honda and Team Liquid also prove that mainstream companies and financial institutions are now widely supporting esports teams. With increased popularity and attention, the teams and the players are put under scrutiny that they aren't used to. eSports teams will soon have to show a greater level of professionalism. To Sum Up Team Liquid lost the sponsorship from Honda due to the controversy caused by one of their team members. The player published an offensive social media post, for which he apologized. However, Honda still decided to end the partnership. All parties came out with appropriate public statements. The media picked up the controversy because it shows how the players are now being put under higher scrutiny when big businesses are supporting the industry. eSports are now a part of mainstream culture, and this means the industry will have to change and adapt to higher standards of behavior.

Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $4,696.64 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB’s price faced strong buying pressure toward $674.5. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 2.19 percent of value if looked from an overall view. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the end of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2029, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $4,696.64 by 2031.

It is important to consider that the predictions are not investment advice. Professional consultation is suggested before investing in the volatile market. Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, a level it continues to maintain above in May.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-26 09:40:00
45114233,https://timestabloid.com/?p=68498,1748252533,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Supply Shock and Why ETFs Will Buy Up All,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-supply-shock-and-why-etfs-will-buy-up-all/,"Ripple Van Winkle (@RipBullWinkle), a crypto expert and YouTuber, recently shared an analysis on X detailing why XRP may soon face a significant supply shock. His commentary centers on the convergence of limited XRP availability and growing institutional interest, particularly from the highly anticipated approval of spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). According to Van Winkle, the XRP supply available to the open market is much smaller than its total issuance. While XRP has a fixed supply of 100 billion tokens, a significant portion is held in Ripple’s escrow. This structure has long limited the volume of XRP circulating on exchanges. He expects at least half of the total supply to be held by Ripple and insiders like whales. This could cause a massive supply shock. THREAD: XRP Supply Shock & Why ETFs Will Buy Up All the XRP The XRP market is gearing up for a massive supply shock. Why? Because the available XRP for trading is shrinking rapidly — and that’s about to create serious scarcity. Let’s dive into why this matters for YOU. — Ripple Van Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) May 24, 2025 Institutional Interest and the Role of ETFs Van Winkle argues that XRP ETFs are poised to play a major role in reshaping the asset’s market dynamics. ETFs, which allow traditional investors to gain exposure to digital assets without direct custody, would require large-scale purchases of XRP to back their fund offerings. This buying activity could place significant pressure on the already limited circulating supply. ETFs are an accessible on-ramp for institutional capital, including pension funds, hedge funds, and asset managers. By removing the complexities, they offer a simplified path to participate in XRP’s market. As Van Winkle notes , this “flood of new demand will gobble up the XRP supply fast.” The financial world is interested in these products, as Teucrium’s recently launched leveraged XRP ETF was the most successful launch in the company’s history. Meanwhile, over 10 spot ETFs await SEC approval and could shake the market after approval. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Impact of Constrained Supply and Increased Demand The underlying economic principle at play is straightforward. When demand rises while supply remains constrained or even contracts, upward price pressure tends to follow. Van Winkle frames this situation as a “bullish setup that can’t be ignored,” emphasizing the role of ETFs in accelerating market tightening. He also points to regulatory developments as a contributing factor. With Ripple’s ongoing legal proceedings against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) moving toward resolution , greater regulatory clarity could open more doors for XRP. Strategic Positioning Ahead of ETF Launches The post highlights the importance of early positioning for existing and prospective XRP holders, asking investors to invest where possible.

According to the announcement, the new BTC purchase is separate from the 4.4 billion yen that Remixpoint intends to invest in crypto using funds raised via its 24th stock acquisition rights issuance, which includes an exercise price revision clause. That offering, announced on May 19, is part of a broader fundraising effort of up to 5.6 billion yen. The company said that timing of the purchase will be determined based on market conditions. Remixpoint Reported a Net Loss of 593M Yen In Valuation Losses to Crypto In its latest earnings report for the fiscal year ending March 2025, the Japanese company posted a net loss of 593 million yen ($4.1M), reversing the previous year’s profit. The loss was mainly driven by valuation declines in its crypto investment business, which ramped up in November 2024. Remixpoint, a Japanese software development company that researches energy management systems, began investing in crypto in September 2024 . It initially bought Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum and Avalanche. The firm also holds XRP, Dogecoin and other digital assets as part of its “Policy for Crypto Asset Purchase and Risk Management.” The company made its last purchase on May 15 by acquiring 500 million yen ($3.5M) worth BTC. Institutions Race to Hoard Bitcoin Another Japan-listed firm, Metaplanet, has seen its shares rise over 15-fold since adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy. The stock is up 101.7% in the past month alone. As of May 2025, the company holds 7,800 BTC worth over $855 million positioning it among the world’s largest publicly listed Bitcoin holders.

So what’s going on here? Is this just another meme-fueled distraction, or are we witnessing the rise of the next big crypto? Let’s break it down. CURRENT PRESALE STAGE ENDS TODAY – PRICE RISE INCOMING Why Are Crypto Whales Ditching Layer 1 Projects? For years, layer 1 cryptos like Polkadot and Cosmos promised interoperability, scalability, and a new era of decentralized apps. But lately, they’ve hit a wall. Polkadot hasn’t lived up to the hype. Its parachain rollout has been sluggish, and developer traction is thinning. Cosmos, once dubbed the “Internet of Blockchains,” has stumbled in gaining mass adoption despite a solid tech foundation. This stagnation is pushing crypto whales — the smart money — to hunt for high-upside plays elsewhere. And right now, all eyes are on Punisher Coin, a meme coin with a very un-meme strategy. Punisher Coin: A New Meme Coin with Bite Forget dogs and frogs. Punisher Coin ($PUN) is charging into the meme coin arena with a tactical, aggressive model. It’s built on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, but this isn’t a copy-paste project. The secret weapon? “Punisher Energy.” It’s a mechanism that targets weaker meme coins and encourages holders to swap into $PUN by offering bonus tokens — effectively draining liquidity from competitors. In other words, Punisher Coin isn’t playing nice. It’s going full raid mode. In just the first hour of its presale, Punisher Coin pulled in a flood of capital — a clear signal that investors are paying attention. Crypto Money Maker in the Making? There are hundreds of meme coins, but few come out swinging like Punisher Coin. The team’s focusing hard on community engagement, with real-money missions, staking incentives, and aggressive market positioning. It’s not just hype — there’s a plan here. And in a market where utility and virality don’t always go hand-in-hand, Punisher Coin is trying to bridge both. Polkadot & Cosmos: Fading or Just Cooling Off? Don’t get it twisted — Polkadot and Cosmos aren’t dead. But for big-money players looking for explosive upside, they’re not cutting it right now. Polkadot is weighed down by its complex structure and slow-moving roadmap. Cosmos has strong infrastructure but lacks the buzz and momentum needed to break out. Both projects may still have long-term value, but they aren’t the crypto money makers whales seem to be betting on right now. Is Punisher Coin the Next Big Crypto? With momentum shifting fast and real capital moving behind it, Punisher Coin is shaping up to be more than just a flash in the pan. It’s not just a new meme coin — it’s a strategic strike at the meme coin market itself. If you’re looking for the next big crypto opportunity, Punisher Coin is worth watching. Whales are already moving. The question is: are you in early — or are you going to wish you were? Check out the Punisher Coin presale now and decide for yourself.

You’re “Just a Crypto Bro”, right?” someone shouted across the hall at Paris Blockchain Week. He’d seen one of my podcast episodes and added with a grin: “Thanks for interviewing the founder of one of my favourite projects.” I smiled. A little flashback of how I came up with my ‘degen’ username hit me. A reminder of where the crypto industry was six years ago, and how far we’ve all come. And then the question hung there: Am I still “Just a Crypto Bro”? You might also like: Decentralized but not defenceless: Crypto needs a crisis manual | Opinion On the surface, it was a simple inquiry, but it carried more weight than he likely intended. It wasn’t just about my username; it was about my identity as a web3 professional. I was wearing a collared shirt, a gilet jacket, and smart casual trousers—not exactly the web3 uniform—yet I have never felt so connected to the industry. A lot of my friends pursuing a career within the industry have run into the same challenge: What does it even mean to look, act, or dress like a web3 native nowadays? Lately, my team and I have been helping founders “clean up” their image. Repositioning their teams from crypto projects to digital asset companies, and dressing up blockchain tech in a language regulators, institutions, and mainstream users can understand. From cryptocurrencies to digital assets Crypto has grown up, or at least, it’s started to. What once felt like a chaotic, permissionless playground of speculation and hype is now evolving into something more structured. Politicians, bankers, and institutions no longer refer to our beloved Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and Solana ( SOL ) as cryptocurrencies; they tend to call them digital assets. A term that will define the next phase of our industry. If we have to be precise, the term digital assets means anything created and stored digitally that has or provides value. They include a wide range of items from photos, documents, and videos to cryptocurrencies and tokenized assets. However, my point isn’t about definitions or linguistics—it’s about observing how the industry is steadily gaining legitimacy, and the phrasing institutions prefer. This isn’t just a rebrand, it’s a reflection of how the ecosystem is evolving. Regulators are starting to define the rules more clearly. The United States regulations— House’s STABLE Act and the Senate’s GENIUS Act —would create a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers in the U.S., including licensing requirements, reserve standards, AML obligations, and consumer protections. It’s inevitable that other nations will follow, and in the next few years, we should have clearer regulations across the board. Coinbase just became the first crypto-native company listed on the S&P 500. BlackRock launched a Bitcoin ETF. Politicians are openly debating crypto policy in public forums, not just in subcommittees behind closed doors. Crypto isn’t fringe anymore. It’s entering the mainstream ecosystem imperfectly, but undeniably. The convergence of crypto and mainstream communications The crypto industry is evolving—and it’s evolving fast. Tokenomics are changing to provide real value for token holders. Regulation is evolving. Retail investors are sceptical of projects that don’t have their whitepapers in order, and don’t invest based on hype anymore; they invest in Hype because of the real-world problem the project is aiming to solve (couldn’t keep this joke for myself). However, crypto communications haven’t evolved to match the broader transformation happening across the industry. Many projects are short-termist, completely ignoring yearly or even quarterly communications strategies. They focus on KOLs to pump their tokens in short bursts instead of positioning their founders and companies for long-term success. PR is often treated as a pay-to-play hustle, not a brand-building tool. The corporate world, meanwhile, has spent decades sharpening its comms-planning, structuring, and executing with intention. Meanwhile, crypto has mostly lived in a parallel universe. We started discussing projects on internet forums, moved to Telegram and Discord private communities, and more recently, the industry has heavily relied on crypto X influencers. For years, we operated in a self-contained bubble: chaotic, jargon-heavy, proudly irreverent. The industry created its own obscure language, memes, and unwritten rules. We laughed at being called degens and ‘Retardio’ and wrote milady at the end of random posts. It was part of the culture. It worked, for a while. But if this industry wants to be taken seriously beyond its echo chamber, its communications need to grow up. Because what a company posts on social media, its tone of voice, its choice of words, visual appearance, even what its founders wear on stage—all of these feed into your reputation. Because it’s not just about what you build. It’s about how you tell your story. Right now, too many crypto projects still speak in code. Meanwhile, mainstream journalists only show up when something blows up, right, Bybit ? That needs to change. We need to move from memes to messaging. From chaos to clarity. This doesn’t mean we abandon the culture. Crypto can, and should, keep its edge. But it does mean learning how to speak to different audiences such as investors, regulators, developers, and everyday users. The space is fragmented, and we no longer speak to a homogenous group of web3 natives, hence the messaging needs to adapt. The sad truth is that many modern comms agencies serving the industry are part of the problem. Web3-native agencies understand the tech inside-out, but often miss the strategic rigor, structure, and polish that institutional clients and audiences expect. Conversely, traditional PR firms, used to boardrooms and blue chips, stumble on basic concepts like tokenomics or L2s. The result is obvious: misaligned messaging. Missed opportunities. And an industry that struggles to explain itself to the world. It’s time to fix that. Not just for credibility, but for mainstream adoption. All good, but how? The role of a communications team in crypto is simple. We should act as the bridge between founders and the world. Developers focus on code. Users care about what that code can do for them. Good comms translate complexity into clarity. It helps people understand why a project matters, how it works, and why they should trust it. Sounds easy, but in practice, it’s hard to do well. Start with structure. Plan your communications quarterly, not reactively. Have a clear narrative arc: what are you announcing, why now, and who needs to hear it? Build a rhythm around your releases, media outreach, and community updates. Consistency builds credibility. You stop sounding like a hype machine and start sounding like a real company. If this industry wants to be taken seriously by institutions, regulators, or the general public, the messaging has to evolve. It can’t be just about hype and inside jokes anymore. Projects that learn to communicate clearly with mainstream audiences will be the ones that last. If crypto is ever going to break out of its echo chamber, comms professionals have a key role to play. It’s not enough to land coverage in the usual web3-native publications, important as those are for the community. For projects aiming to reach mainstream audiences, getting visibility in broader business, tech, and culture media is crucial. That means crafting narratives that resonate beyond tokenomics and roadmaps. We need stories that speak to real-world impact, user experience, and long-term value. We need to avoid jargon. Most users aren’t interested in how your bridging works, what consensus mechanism your blockchain has, or any other technical detail. What they care about is simple: does this make their life more convenient and more affordable? Finally, push your founders to think about positioning early. Who are they speaking to: developers, degens, regulators, institutions? If you’re targeting mainstream users or serious investors, your public tone matters. You can’t lead with “GM” and show up in a hoodie if you’re trying to win trust from Wall Street. Attire, tone of voice, vocabulary, all of it sends a signal. Make sure it’s the right one.

The complaint, filed on May 22 in a Pennsylvania federal court, accuses the crypto exchange of failing to properly inform investors about a key agreement breach with the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which, combined with the breach disclosure, led to significant shareholder losses. UK Regulatory Violation Adds to Coinbase Legal Woes According to the lawsuit, the drop in share price wasn’t solely due to the breach. Nessler pointed to a July 2024 penalty by the FCA, where Coinbase’s UK division was fined $4.5 million for breaching a 2020 agreement not to onboard high-risk customers. The FCA claimed the exchange had onboarded over 13,000 such individuals, despite restrictions. Nessler alleges that this violation, and Coinbase’s failure to disclose it prior to its 2021 Nasdaq listing, artificially inflated the stock’s value. She further claimed that had investors known about the breach of the agreement, they would have reconsidered purchasing the stock. Following the FCA fine, Coinbase shares fell over 5%, closing at $231.52 on July 25, 2024. The lawsuit names CEO Brian Armstrong and CFO Alesia Haas as co-defendants and seeks damages on behalf of all investors who purchased company shares between April 14, 2021, and May 14, 2025. It also demands a jury trial. More Legal Trouble Ahead Earlier this month, the exchange revealed that it was the target of a $20 million extortion attempt, which exposed internal weaknesses after customer support agents were bribed. The attackers reportedly gained access to limited user account data. The company estimated potential damages could climb to $400 million. On the day of this announcement, May 15, Coinbase shares dropped 7.2%, closing at $244. Though shares rebounded the next day, climbing 9% to $266, the volatility highlighted growing investor concerns. The latest suit is part of a growing list of legal actions against Coinbase , with at least six lawsuits filed following the data breach disclosure. Another case filed in Illinois accuses the company of improperly collecting and handling biometric data without proper disclosure.

James Wynn is once again betting big on Pepe ( PEPE ), having recently opened a 10x leveraged position on the memecoin. This suggests Wynn believes there’s still significant upside potential for PEPE, despite it having already rallied almost 90% this month as it broke out of a long-standing consolidation range on May 8. https://twitter.com/JamesWynnReal/status/1926885374535635250 Since that breakout, PEPE has continued to show strength. After the initial peak, price pulled back and formed a higher low, followed by a new higher high at $0.000014, indicating continuation of a bullish structure. It now appears to be printing another leg up. Technically, PEPE is holding above both the 20 EMA and 50 SMA, which have maintained a bullish crossover since mid-April. The 20 EMA has acted as dynamic support, absorbing the recent pullback to $0.000012 and helping PEPE price rebound. Source: TradingView You might also like: From PEPE to Billions: meet crypto’s boldest whale James Wynn Looking ahead, PEPE price appears to be targeting the $0.000017 level for its next leg up, which would constitute a 20% jump. This target corresponds to the level where the price faced rejection in May last year. That level also served as major support throughout December last year and January. Should PEPE overcome this resistance, the next major hurdle lies around $0.000020 – $0.000021, which aligns with a lower high established as the price was descending from its December ATH. Achieving $0.000020 would represent a gain of about 40% from the current $0.000014 levels. James Wynn’s recent move to long PEPE is a significant development given his track record of profitable memecoin trades. Previously, Wynn reportedly earned $4.8 million and $6.8 million on Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) and Trump ( TRUMP ), respectively. He’s also currently betting on Moonpig ( MOONPIG ), his own memecoin that has recently rallied almost 3000% in less than three weeks.

This surge of capital brought the total year-to-date inflows to a record-breaking $10.8 billion. According to CoinShares ‘ latest digital asset fund weekly report , both year-to-date flows and total assets under management recorded historical peaks in the prior week of trading. Marking the sixth consecutive week of positive flows, digital asset investment products recorded $3.3 billion in capital flow last week. This drove up its total year-to-date flows to a new record high of $10.8 billion. The number jumped from $6.7 billion in the previous week. Meanwhile, total assets under management for digital asset funds briefly reached an all-time high of $187.5 billion in the past week. This indicates a renewed interest from investors. CoinShares head of research James Butterfill said that investors have sought out alternative assets due to the shifting conditions of the U.S. market, more specifically “We believe that growing concerns over the U.S. economy, driven by the Moody’s downgrade and the resulting spike in treasury yields, have prompted investors to seek diversification through digital assets,” said Butterfill.

Spanish lender Cecabank and cryptocurrency exchange Bit2Me have teamed up to launch a MiCA -ready crypto platform for traditional financial institutions, technically ready but still awaiting a green light from Spain’s securities regulator. In a Monday press release , the exchange said the platform includes crypto custody and RTO (reception and transmission of orders) services. While Bit2Me manages trading, market data, and custody for over 100 cryptocurrencies, Cecabank will provide regulatory support and banking infrastructure, the press release reads. “With this alliance, Cecabank strengthens its roadmap as a reference provider of post-trade services in the digital asset space, reflecting our established role in FIAT custody.” Aurora Cuadros, corporate director of securities services at Cecabank The platform is meant to give European financial institutions a quicker, compliant way to enter the crypto market, with tools that can be adapted to each bank’s needs under MiCA rules, the companies say.

ZORA ( ZORA ) climbed to an intraday high of $0.0135 on May 26, lifting its market cap beyond $38 million, as trading volume surged 256% to top $48 million in 24 hours. Momentum picked up after several users on X reported that Srinivasan had deployed a new token titled “The Network State”, named after his 2022 book, on the Zora platform. The token went live on May 26, 2025, and quickly stirred up buzz in the community. For those unfamiliar, Zora lets users mint content from decentralized social apps like Farcaster into ERC-20 tokens. That includes text posts, images, videos, or audio, basically anything users would normally post on social media, but on-chain. Once minted, these “content coins” can be listed and traded on platforms like Uniswap. Users upload their media, set the title and price, and Zora handles the minting. Once live, the content becomes a tradable asset in a decentralized marketplace, where community demand determines its value. You might also like: SUI price stalls below $4 resistance as $223M Cetus Protocol hack weighs down on sentiment Within hours of launch, the Network State token reportedly saw its market cap swing between $2.7 million and $7 million, signaling strong initial interest. While it’s a separate asset from ZORA, the shared platform and Balaji’s name seem to have indirectly boosted sentiment for ZORA itself. Investors are likely betting on the broader Zora platform gaining traction from the attention. Many users on X pointed out that ZORA may be a safer and more liquid proxy play for those who want exposure to the hype without directly aping into the brand-new token. What is Zora? Zora was launched in May 2020 by three former Coinbase employees as a creator-first NFT platform designed to decentralise media and empower content ownership. Initially built to support the minting and trading of NFTs, the platform later evolved to allow users to tokenise on-chain content from decentralised social apps. In 2023, Zora introduced its own Layer 2 network to improve scalability and reduce costs for content publishing. By 2025, it expanded further with the launc h of a native token, ZORA, described as “a memecoin for the Zora community.” Despite having its own chain, the team launched the token on Base , Coinbase’s Layer 2, on April 23 to tap into its wider user base. The token has a capped supply of 10 billion. Distribution includes a 10% airdrop to early users, 20% for community incentives, and 5% for liquidity. The rest is split among the treasury, team, and strategic contributors, all subject to vesting schedules. In May 2022, Zora secured a $50 million funding round that valued the platform at $600 million. The round was led by Haun Ventures, with backing from Coinbase Ventures and Kindred Ventures.

With approval now postponed to June, many traders are redirecting their focus toward emerging opportunities, most notably, Unilabs. This next-gen PassiveFi project is making headlines for all the right reasons: AI-driven investment strategies, real yield models, and a presale that’s growing exponentially. As Dogecoin ETF speculators wait in limbo, Unilabs is becoming a smart investor’s next top choice. Continue reading this article to find out more about DOGE news and Unilabs. Unilabs: The PassiveFi Coin Grabbing Attention as DOGE Stalls While the DOGE news suggests Dogecoin ETF approval delays once again, a new project, Unilabs, has come under the spotlight for its superior technology and presale success. Unilabs is the first completely AI-backed asset manager that is here to change the perception of how we invest, manage, and optimize our investments. It has managed to make its position in the cut-throat competition of the crypto market by offering never-before-offered features. One of its major features is its multiple investment funds that align with different investment targets. These funds include the AI Fund, BTC Fund, RWA Fund, and Mining Fund. These funds come along with a launchpad that offers detailed 24/7 insights on different assets. Unilabs further stands out by offering its users multiple opportunities to earn passively. One of the leading features is staking, which lets them earn as per their UNIL holdings. Furthermore, they have a five-tiered referral system running, which lets users earn different profits depending on how many referrals they bring to the platform. While prominent crypto projects have limited transparency, Unilabs is the only asset management platform that operates on a fully transparent profit-sharing system. It provides various investment options, such as yield and arbitrage, which are pooled and given to investors. This provides a regular source of profit and open access to fund performance. DOGE News: Dogecoin ETF Delays, What's Going On? In the latest DOGE news, the Dogecoin ETF waiting time has exhausted its investors now as the US Securities and Exchange Commission has postponed the decision to June. The US SEC is taking longer to review these ETFs, which is causing delays in the DOGE ETF and other ETFs as well. Grayscale filed the spot Dogecoin ETF in March 2025, following the Trust's debut in January. However, even after months, the SEC has not responded to the file. Although delays are inconvenient for investors, they are a necessary step to maintain compliance with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act. For the same reasons, the Bitcoin ETF took its time to start, but the result was successful, with billions of dollars in inflows and a boost to the Bitcoin price. Although the SEC has postponed its judgment until June, this does not mean that it will be approved at that time. The SEC filings plainly state that the delay is due to extra analysis. The Polymarket chances for the Dogecoin ETF clearance by the end of July are merely 15%. However, the odds in 2025 are 63%, indicating that investor trust is stronger in the latter months of 2025. As per the recent DOGE news, Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.244, representing a daily gain of over 6% in the past seven days. Dogecoin's next price target of $0.40 is already generating a lot of conversation, and some analysts are speculating that it may eventually become the next significant meme coin to hit $1, if the Dogecoin ETF gets approved. What Makes Unilabs the Leading Project of the Year? Unilabs , despite being a new entry in the market, has raised over $30 million in assets under management (AUM) as smart investors capitalize on its cutting-edge AI-powered features. This potential next leading DeFi asset manager is currently making noise in the market for its viral presale that has crossed over $1M in funding. Leading market analysts claim that if Unilabs continues to grow at such a pace, it could potentially be the next best altcoin soon. Currently, each UNIL token is available to be bought for $0.0051 only. This price point is being labelled as a discounted price since, with each presale round and upon listing, the UNIL price is expected to surge significantly, generating massive ROI for all of its early investors.

But top analysts say that BTC is just warming up, predicting it could easily smash $250k amid huge institutional inflows and pro-crypto developments in the U.S. Let’s examine what’s likely to happen as the BTC ushers the crypto market into its next leg up and one notable crypto gem that has been dominating the market’s attention in recent weeks. Bitcoin price rockets to a new ATH Bitcoin reached a high of $109k in January in a massive post-election rally following the election of pro-crypto president Donald Trump. After a deep pullback to the $74k region, Bitcoin is at it again, skyrocketing nearly 50% in the past two months to print a new ATH in the $111k zone. Source: CoinMarketCap The crypto bellwether is now up over 55% year-to-date as its market cap rolls to a cool $2.13 trillion. Though BTC is expected to slow down and accumulate near its recent highs, analysts predict it could pull another massive rally toward new heights. Bitcoin price prediction: Can BTC smash $250 this year? One market pundit, Fred Krueger , posits that BTC could scale new heights in the $150,000 to $600,000 zone in 90 days! While $600k might be overambitious, data-driven BTC price predictions from CoinCodex spell a bright future for the crypto king. According to the data, BTC is forecasted to remain bullish through 2025, potentially pulling another 67% upsurge to print a new ATH in the $180k zone! Surging institutional inflows are cited as the major bullish factor likely to drive BTC to these new price thresholds. In May, investors poured a landmark $3.6 billion into spot Bitcoin ETFs, highlighting strong institutional confidence in BTC’s prospects. Companies like Metaplanet and MicroStrategy have also been going big, continuing their aggressive accumulation spree with a recent purchase of $870 million in BTC. Recently, Metaplanet issued $15 million in zero-interest bonds to facilitate its acquisition of 21,000 BTC as MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin stash reaches 576,230! Bitcoin is also expected to draw significant momentum from the pro-crypto White House. Since President Trump vowed to make the US the crypto capital of the world, several states have been racing to pass Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bills to pave the way for Bitcoin’s integration into government financial systems. In fact, analysts view this current bull cycle as stable and structurally sound, associating it with improving crypto regulations in the US. Supportive crypto policies have sparked interest from traditional financial institutions. Even Jamie Dimon recently said that JPMorgan will start allowing Bitcoin investments! BTC investors are also piling into utility tokens The insane interest from institutional investors and pro-crypto regulatory developments in the U.S. make a $250 price target appear like small potatoes for BTC. But even if Bitcoin hits that target, it will just be a 133% yield. That’s big for institutions investing billions; crypto shrimps looking to turn $1000 into $100,000 are better off using BTC to gauge market direction and then turning to low-cap presale gems like RTX, which is predicted to skyrocket over 100x if BTC hits $250k. This emerging cross-border payments token is tipped to shake the massive $190 trillion cross-border settlements market. It provides a groundbreaking crypto-to-fiat payment network that facilitates real-time international money transfers at low costs. To date, whales have pumped in over $15.3 million into the Remittix presale, stockpiling over 539 million RTX tokens.

45113544,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/dogwifhat-price-prediction-time-for-sol-memes-to-make-a-comeback,1748253522,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/45113544.jpeg,Dogwifhat Price Prediction: Time For SOL Memes to Make a Comeback?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/dogwifhat-price-prediction-time-for-sol-memes-to-make-a-comeback,"With meme coins again grabbing headlines, many traders are eyeing Dogwifhat (WIF) to see if it can repeat its earlier breakout. The big question is where the Dogwifhat price is headed next? But while the WIF token is riding the wave of meme-driven speculation, some investors are moving towards projects with real utility, such as Unilabs . With its early access tools and real-time analytics, this project could outperform meme coins in the long run. Overview: What is Dogwifhat (WIF)? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin built on the SOL’s native blockchain. It started as a fun internet joke featuring a dog wearing a hat, but quickly gained attention thanks to its viral appeal and strong online community. Like many other meme coins, WIF doesn’t have a complex use case or deep utility. Its value comes mainly from community support, market hype, and momentum. However, compared to other viral meme coins, WIF lacks the innovations that Floki Inu and Shiba Inu are looking to bring, and does not have celebrity endorsements like Dogecoin. Dogwifhat Price Prediction: Where Could WIF Go Next? At the press time, the Dogwifhat price is trading around $1.1 with a slight consolidation towards the $1 zone. However, in the last 30 days, the Dogwifhat price has increased by over 100%, according to CoinMarketCap. However, as compared to the all-time-high value of $4.85, the Dogwifhat price is down by over 70%. This means the meme coin still has room to grow more in the coming days if the hype continues. Source: CoinMarketCap As for the Dogwifhat price prediction, analysts offer a range of forecasts in 2025: CNN: Predicts a minimum of $0.32 and a maximum of $6.12, based on wave count analysis and market trends. CoinCodex: Projects a June 2025 average price of $0.72 with potential highs up to $0.83 only if there’s short-term bullish momentum. Benzinga: Estimates an average price of $1.25 for 2025 with a range between $0.47 and $2.22. Even with these optimistic Dogwifhat price predictions, the future looks bleak. That’s why smart investors are shifting their focus to Unilabs, an innovative AI platform. What is Unilabs and Why It’s Attracting Retail Investors? Unilabs is the world’s first AI-powered DeFi asset management platform. It is designed to give everyday investors the tools and insights previously reserved for only hedge funds and institutional investors. The project’s core engine uses real-time AI to scan thousands of blockchain projects, such as the WIF token, and analyze everything to identify early-stage crypto gems before the crowd. This way, investors don’t need to research manually. Moreover, Unilabs also offers a Launchpad, which gives retail users early access to vetted, high-potential projects. This way, investors don’t have to conduct detailed research as all the info is already available. The best part about this AI-powered ecosystem is that it uses a dual-layer system, using AI first and then human oversight for due diligence. This boosts the chances of finding 10x to 100x coins easily. For advanced users, Unilabs offers tools like the Flash Loan Accelerator and Yield Optimization Pools. These tools leverage high-speed AI scanning and automated strategies for maximizing DeFi gains. It means this project adapts to users’ experience level and provides tokens that work well within their strategies. Unilabs also values security, which is why they’ll be using a Self-Custodial Vault. With this, users can keep their assets in their hands without intermediaries while offering portfolio shielding tools, smart risk management, and much more. Close to $1 Million Raised Inside Two Presale Stages As of Q2 of 2025, Unilabs has over $30 million in AUM (Assets Under Management) and has raised close to $1 million while still being inside the second stage of public presale. Currently, each UNIL token is worth only $0.005. After the remaining 70% of stage 2 is sold out, this price is expected to increase by 20% to $0.006. Conclusion While the Dogwifhat price shows potential for short-term gains due to meme coin hype, Unilabs is quietly attracting investors with its AI-powered innovations. It uses innovative tools to find great crypto projects early so investors can maximize their profits. With a low entry point and tons of hype around the new DeFi giant, this could be the best chance to join in early before the project skyrockets.

According to a recent post by Angry Crypto Show on X, Hoskinson emphasized that Cardano recognizes the importance of XRP’s expanding decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and is eager to collaborate, signaling a promising era of cross-chain cooperation. JUST IN: #Cardano $ADA Founder Charles Hoskinson says ""we told Ripple we're here to help, we believe $XRP DeFi is very important, and we'd like to find a path to get $RLUSD on Cardano. We'll integrate RLUSD for free because we like the XRP community—still ongoing conversations."" pic.twitter.com/GaPN2o5NTI — Angry Crypto Show (@angrycryptoshow) May 25, 2025 Hoskinson Extends a Hand to Ripple Charles Hoskinson, one of the most influential figures in blockchain development and the visionary behind Cardano, revealed that Cardano has already reached out to Ripple, expressing interest in creating a pathway to bring RLUSD onto the Cardano blockchain . His remarks underline a shared belief in the significance of XRP DeFi and reflect Cardano’s willingness to foster innovation across ecosystems. Hoskinson’s statement, “We told Ripple we’re here to help, we believe $XRP DeFi is very important, and we’d like to find a path to get RLUSD on Cardano,” showcases a cooperative mindset that contrasts with the often competitive tone that can dominate the crypto space. Offering to integrate RLUSD without charging fees demonstrates Cardano’s technical confidence and a genuine appreciation for the XRP community, known for its passionate and engaged global base. Why RLUSD Matters for Both Ecosystems RLUSD is Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, designed to enhance the utility of the XRP Ledger and strengthen Ripple’s position in the rapidly growing stablecoin market. Stablecoins like RLUSD play a pivotal role in DeFi by providing a stable medium of exchange, improving liquidity, and enabling a variety of decentralized financial products and services. For Cardano, integrating RLUSD could bring several strategic benefits. First, it would create an on-ramp for XRP liquidity to flow into Cardano’s smart contract ecosystem, enhancing decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending protocols, and other DeFi innovations within the Cardano network. Second, it positions Cardano as an interoperable platform, capable of connecting with other major chains — a critical feature as the blockchain industry moves toward a more interconnected, multichain future. Ripple and Cardano: A New Era of Collaboration? Ripple and Cardano have traditionally operated in separate lanes, focusing heavily on cross-border payments and institutional partnerships, while Cardano has emphasized research-driven development, smart contracts, and scalability. However, the evolving DeFi landscape is creating new opportunities for collaboration between networks that were once seen as rivals. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Angry Crypto Show’s post highlights that while discussions are still ongoing, the willingness from Cardano to offer a free integration signals that these conversations are more than symbolic. They reflect a shifting industry mindset where partnerships, not just competition, are driving innovation. By working together, Ripple and Cardano could unlock new liquidity pathways, create enhanced DeFi products, and strengthen both ecosystems against dominant players like Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. Community Reactions and Industry Impact The XRP community has long been one of the most vocal and enthusiastic in the crypto space, and Hoskinson’s supportive remarks are likely to be welcomed warmly. For Cardano supporters, the move reinforces their platform’s openness to innovation and cross-chain growth. Industry analysts are also watching closely, as such collaborations can set precedents for other blockchains to follow, encouraging a more interconnected ecosystem that benefits users and developers alike. At a time when regulatory uncertainties and market challenges loom over the crypto industry, the willingness of major projects like Cardano and Ripple to work together sends a positive signal. It suggests that the sector’s leaders are not just focused on survival or competition but are actively looking for ways to build resilient, interoperable, and user-centric systems. While the specifics of the RLUSD integration are still being worked out, Hoskinson’s message is clear: Cardano values the XRP community and sees the integration of RLUSD as a meaningful step toward greater cooperation in the crypto world. A successful partnership could lead to more cross-chain collaborations, showing how top blockchain projects can unite to boost the ecosystem. As the conversations between Ripple and Cardano continue, the broader crypto community will be watching closely because when two of the industry’s most prominent names align, the ripple effects could reshape the future of decentralized finance.

While Solana’s fundamentals remain robust—backed by high trading volumes, strong technical support, and continued ecosystem expansion—the current consolidation phase is prompting early capital to rotate into promising altcoins with sharper upside. In this shifting landscape, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly advancing into the investor spotlight, drawing attention as the presale phenomenon of 2025. Meanwhile, XRP, Cosmos (ATOM), and Ethereum are also on watchlists, each offering their own blend of stability and growth as the market prepares for the next breakout wave. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: Leading Presale, 50% Bonus, and Explosive Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE is now ranked as the #1 presale of 2025 , with Stage 8 live and over $8 million already raised. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx audit, and viral political narrative are fueling unmatched demand from both retail and institutional buyers. Analysts are forecasting up to 40x returns from current entry levels, with some models projecting even higher upside if momentum continues. A recent $132,000+ whale buy underscores the conviction behind MAGA’s breakout potential. With a $0.007 listing target and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using PATRIOT50X, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the pace for early-stage gains as the window for entry narrows. Solana (SOL): Technical Pause and Ecosystem Strength Solana is currently consolidating between $158 and $175, cooling off after a recent high near $183. Technical indicators point to support at $166 and resistance at $175, with analysts projecting a retest of $183 if momentum returns. The network’s high throughput, low fees, and vibrant dApp ecosystem continue to attract users and developers, supporting a bullish long-term outlook. Ethereum (ETH): Steady Growth and Institutional Rotation Ethereum is trading between $2,400 and $2,900, with technicals signaling a stable climb and analysts expecting a move toward $2,700–$2,900 if bullish sentiment persists. Institutional adoption and Layer 2 growth are fueling optimism, but the most aggressive capital is now flowing into early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is even more compelling. XRP and Cosmos (ATOM): Steady Performance, MAGA Steals the Spotlight XRP is holding steady near $2.33, with price targets of $2.85–$3.87 for 2025, while ATOM consolidates around $4.50 as ecosystem upgrades progress. Both assets remain in focus, but neither matches the viral momentum or community buzz surrounding MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Conclusion Solana’s rally may have paused, but the real excitement is building in MAGACOIN FINANCE . With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 40x ROI, MAGA stands as the breakout contender for 2025.

This flood of capital has come despite some of the most chaotic market conditions since the peak of Covid-era panic. According to The Wall Street Journal , ETF inflows are already on track to smash records for the second year in a row, especially if the current tempo continues through summer and fall—as it has in past years. This year’s surge isn’t just some slow-moving shift away from mutual funds, though that continues too. What’s different is how investors are using volatility itself as a green light. When U.S. stocks began bouncing violently, people didn’t pull out. They doubled down, betting heavier on domestic assets—and doing it almost entirely through ETFs. Vanguard’s VOO takes in $65 billion as volatility peaks The ETF vacuum cleaner this year is Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF, known by ticker VOO, which has already soaked up $65 billion in net inflows. That puts it well ahead of every other fund in the country. VOO is now the largest ETF in the world by assets, leapfrogging its own record-breaking 2024 haul of $116 billion. If current momentum keeps up, it’ll hit that figure again by October. VOO’s breakout moment came in April, when market volatility spiked to a five-year high. At the same time, the fund recorded its highest-ever monthly inflows. Greg Davis, Vanguard’s chief investment officer, explained the behavior by pointing to investor cash reserves: “During that period of tumult in early April, we saw a 5-to-1 buy-to-sell ratio. Investors have a tremendous amount of cash sitting on the sidelines and they know that if things are on sale, it is time to put money to work.” Investors have been loading up on stock funds, bond funds, passive trackers, and active strategies. And for the first time, actively managed ETFs are capturing serious attention. They’ve pulled in 30% of all ETF inflows in 2025, even though they only make up less than 10% of the ETF market. Short-term bond funds rake in billions from cautious investors Not everyone is diving headfirst into equities. BlackRock’s 0–3 Month Treasury bond ETF has pulled in $17 billion this year, making it the second-most popular ETF of 2025 so far. The fund pays a 4.7% trailing yield, offering what looks like a safe parking spot with actual returns. A similar fund from State Street also ranks in the top 10. Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, sees a defensive trend among bond buyers. “We are seeing some defensiveness on the fixed-income side,” he said. “With several short-term Treasury products in the top 10, that’s a sign investors are happy being paid to wait.” But while short-term bond funds are pulling in billions, equity ETFs are still dominating the overall flows. Other names in the ETF leaderboard include State Street’s own S&P 500 fund, Vanguard’s total stock-market and equity growth funds, and two Nasdaq-100 funds from Invesco. JPMorgan’s actively managed equity fund, which uses options to reduce volatility and boost dividend payouts, also made the top 10. Analysts have dubbed these kinds of funds “boomer candy” because of their appeal to older investors. But the demand isn’t slowing. JPMorgan is building on a strong 2024 and carrying that energy into this year. Big players like Fidelity are also pushing hard into active ETFs. Meanwhile, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, made headlines at the Saudi-U.S. investment forum in Riyadh when he pointed to a giant pile of unused cash sitting on the sidelines. “In the United States, there’s $11 trillion sitting in money-market funds,” Larry said. “When there is uncertainty, you’re going to keep more money in cash and that is what we witnessed.” All of this is fueling even more ETF innovation. Dozens of fund managers have already filed with the SEC to create ETF share classes of their current mutual funds. That would allow them to keep using the same investing strategy, but in a cheaper, more flexible format. And it’s gaining momentum fast. Mark Uyeda, a commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission, said he has already instructed his staff to prioritize these applications. Industry insiders expect formal approval could come before the end of 2025.

45114788,https://coinpedia.org/?p=461012,1748253925,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,"XRP Price Prediction by ChatGPT: $5 If Ripple Beats SEC, $1 If Market Dips",https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-by-chatgpt-5-if-ripple-beats-sec-1-if-market-dips/,"The post XRP Price Prediction by ChatGPT: $5 If Ripple Beats SEC, $1 If Market Dips appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The possible conclusion of the long-running legal battle between Ripple and the SEC , paired with other big events, could soon act as a major catalyst for the XRP Price. But is June shaping up to be a more bullish month for XRP? If Ripple scores a favorable settlement, it could lead to massive institutional adoption, particularly in the U.S. In bull markets, altcoins often see 5-10x gains. So, if the bull run continues, XRP could easily 4- 5x as money flows into altcoins. Besides, Ripple’s growing utility will drive long-term demand for the token. ChatGPT has presented a 2025 price forecast for XRP based on how things may play out if Ripple wins the SEC case. XRP could jump to $3.50 or $5.50. Besides, if Ripple acquires Circle, XRP’s utility could skyrocket as it becomes deeply integrated with one of the largest stablecoins. This would boost demand for XRP as a key bridge asset in global payments and DeFi. But if the case continues to drag on, then it may stay between $2-$3. In a worst-case scenario, like losing in court or a crypto market crash, XRP could drop to $1-$2. Meanwhile, xAI’s Grok gave a slightly more bullish outlook, predicting XRP could hit $3.50–$4.50. June Could Be The Game Changer Analysts also point out that three events are set to take place in mid-June that could send XRP soaring. From June 10 to 12, Ripple’s Developer Summit (XRPL Apex) is expected to reveal major tech updates such as AI-powered payments, real-world asset tokenization, and super simple cross-chain swaps. These upgrades could boost XRP’s real-world utility. On June 17, the SEC might approve a spot XRP ETF. This could impact XRP’s price similarly to how spot Bitcoin ETFs pushed BTC past $100 K. On the same day, the Federal Reserve may announce an interest rate cut, increasing liquidity in the markets. Historically, such moves boost risky assets like cryptocurrencies, driving prices higher. XRP could run 5-6x, climbing from around $2 now up to $10-$12 by late summer 2025 . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price to Hit New All-Time Highs Soon, Expert Says ‘It’s Realistic’ , Delays Possible? However, the rally could be delayed as well if the ETF is pushed back again, or if the Fed holds a rate cut. However, analysts claim that these are just delays and not denials, as the long-term growth prospects remain strong. If all goes well, XRP could jump from $2 to $12, matching its previous 6x surge. Analysts believe that the downside risk to $1.50 is limited, but the upside is massive. However, Veteran trader Peter Brandt warns that XRP could soon drop to $1.07, over a trend reversal after its recent gain of 5%. But the fundamentals are strong for Ripple. And despite the SEC delays, the odds of XRP ETF approval have climbed to 83% , which shows a bullish outlook for XRP’s future. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

BTC price action dipped below $107,000 before rebounding into the weekly close, and some are eagerly anticipating new record highs. US inflation data meets bond market woes this week as the Federal Reserve shows no signs of cutting interest rates. On exchanges, the taker buy/sell ratio is causing concern for analysis amid cooling order book activity. One whale, however, is having fun — and his successive longs and shorts are being increasingly watched in trading circles. Funding rates are not spiking despite current prices — a key silver lining for price upside sustainability. Bitcoin price discovery on the radar after rebound Bitcoin swapped late-weekend weakness for gains into the May 25 weekly candle close, a move which ultimately took BTC/USD above the $110,000 mark. Volatility is continuing as the week gets underway, with old all-time highs from January a key area of interest. Commenting, popular trader Daan Crypto Trades argued that despite the last-minute recovery, Bitcoin needed a more convincing close to seal the likelihood of further gains next. The weekly candle closed at $109,100, per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView — around $200 below the January high. BTC/USD 1-week chart.

Forecasting an “interesting week,” Daan Crypto Trades referenced the ongoing popularity of the US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which last week took in $2.75 billion . $BTC is forming a bullish penant here.

The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index print for April is due on May 29, along with initial jobless claims. These will follow the first revision of Q1 GDP, while in the background, rising bond yields are causing concern. Last week’s threat of 50% trade tariffs on the EU from President Donald Trump appeared to worsen the situation. “It’s like clockwork: President Trump delays 50% EU tariffs until July 9th. Then, the 10Y Note Yield instantly rises back above 4.55%,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter wrote in an X thread on the topic. “Trade deals are no longer containing the bond market.” Kobeissi described rising interest rates as Trump’s “biggest problem,” warning of a lethal combination of trade deals and high benchmark interest rates. “The Fed refuses to cut rates and trade deals are driving yields higher,” it summarized.

Exchange flash “bearish” momentum signal Exchange order books are one element of the market giving analysts bearish signals as the week begins. In coverage of the taker buy/sell ratio, onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant announced a “strong bearish” trajectory as both buyers and sellers wound down activity. “Across centralized exchanges (CEXs), both taker buy and taker short volumes have dropped significantly,” contributor Crazzyblockk wrote in one of its “ Quicktake ” blog posts. “This indicates a cooling in market order aggressiveness on both sides, often a precursor to reduced short-term momentum and increased uncertainty.” Bitcoin taker buy/sell ratio. Source: CryptoQuant The taker buy/sell ratio tracks the ratio of buy to sell volume across takers during perpetual swap trades, and on May 25, it slid below the key level of 1 for the first time since early April. Crazzyblockk thus concludes that sellers are “beginning to dominate.” “Simultaneously, 7-day price volatility is spiking, a typical signal of market inflection zones,” the blog post continued. “Current data points to a turning point in market sentiment. With buyer exhaustion growing and volatility accelerating, the likelihood of a short-term correction increases. Price action may test support near the 105K level, if bearish pressure intensifies.” Exchange taker buy/sell ratio signal (screenshot).

Hyperliquid’s Wynn heads to memecoins Up or down, Bitcoin is currently a prime target for large-volume traders entering sizable speculative positions. As Cointelegraph continues to report , one entity in particular, Hyperliquid’s James Wynn, has flipped from long to short and back again within a few days. While just one “whale” trader out of many, Wynn’s moves have gained considerable attention, and with it sway over sentiment. An initial $125 billion long position was exited at a loss thanks to the latest US tariff headlines, with Wynn then entering a short.

Veteran Trader Wonders Which Offers Greater Investment Potential,https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-xrp-or-solana-sol-veteran-trader-wonders-which-offers-greater-investment-potential/,"TL;DR Peter Brandt asked his almost 800K X followers whether they’d invest $100K in XRP or SOL, triggering a heated debate. SOL was praised for its meme coin ecosystem, while XRP fans cited ETF hopes and Ripple’s major acquisitions. Which One? The veteran trader Peter Brandt took to X to ask his audience which of these two crypto assets they’d pick for a $100,000 investment. Let’s say I will buy $100,000 of either $XRP or $SOL this week — no other option but ONLY one of the two please Which one? State your case 40 words max or I’ll ignore Remember, XRP or SOL – only choices pic.twitter.com/cNikoRICfd — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) May 25, 2025 The question caused a clash of opinions, with numerous users presenting valuable points that supported both sides. Some people outlined positive trends observed on SOL’s price chart, but Brandt said he takes different factors into account. The Solana proponents also claimed that the asset is popular among the younger generations, reminding that the blockchain platform is the base for many meme coins. “XRP is [a] boomer coin now without any use case,” one user argued . Others, though, envisioned a breakout for Ripple’s native token. Some XRP Army members commenting on the post below outlined that multiple companies have displayed their intentions to launch a spot XRP ETF, and approval from the SEC could positively impact the price of the underlying token. It’s worth noting, though, that several companies have also filed for a Solana ETF. In fact, the chances of a green light this year are higher for SOL ETFs than XRP funds, at least according to Polymarket (87% vs. 83%). Outside the ETF battle between the two, Ripple has recently demonstrated its financial strength, acquiring Hidden Road for over $1.2 billion and reportedly entering a multi-billion-dollar acquisition battle for Circle. “The narrative around Ripple’s acquisitions of Hidden Road & possible acquisition of Circle will likely drive strong speciation. Plus, all the headway Ripple is making in the UAE with licenses, tokenization, and more. The Solana narrative does not come close,” X user Ripples stated . Brandt’s Stance on the Assets Over the past months, the well-known trader has expressed views on both assets, and it will be interesting to see which one he picks as a better investment choice. He touched upon the SOL/ETH chart a month ago, claiming that SOL “has lots of room to gain on its invalid cousin ETH.” Back in the day, Brandt was known as an XRP critic. In 2020, he argued that the token “would have been declared (as) a security” if the SEC “understood cryptos.” Last year, he forecasted that the XRP/BTC chart “is headed toward zero.” Earlier in 2025, though, he apologized to the Ripple community for his harsh stance in the past: “An Olive Branch to XRP holders. Accept it if you will, reject it if you must, but I offer it with good intent. Over the years, I have taken some hard shots at you and your XRP asset. I admit my rudeness.” A month before the apology, Brandt acknowledged the asset’s price rally and described the XRP/USD chart as “the most powerful chart in the crypto world.” The post Ripple (XRP) or Solana (SOL)?

Kiyosaki predicts Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2035. Robert Kiyosaki, author of the best-selling personal finance book Rich Dad Poor Dad, has once again endorsed Bitcoin, calling it the “easiest way to get rich” in today’s economic environment. In a post shared Sunday night, Kiyosaki urged followers to consider even fractional ownership of the digital asset. “Why everyone is not buying and holding Bitcoin is beyond me,” he wrote. “Even 0.01 of a Bitcoin is going to be priceless in two years… and maybe make you very rich.” Bitcoin is Approaching the ‘Banana Zone’ Kiyosaki warned that with only 2 million BTC left to be mined, the price is poised to enter what macro investor Raoul Pal calls the “Banana Zone” — a phase of explosive growth driven by scarcity and demand. He advised followers not to be “yellow bananas,” but instead to open their eyes and minds by following thought leaders like Michael Saylor, Anthony Pompliano, and platforms like Bitcoin Zella, which promote the long-term value of decentralized money. I cannot believe how easy Bitcoin has made getting rich…so easy. Why everyone is not buying and holding Bitcoin is beyond me. Even .01 of a Bitcoin is going to be priceless in two years…. and maybe make you very rich. Sure Bitcoin goes up and down….but so does real life.… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) May 26, 2025 The comments came as Bitcoin traded around $109,600, rebounding after a brief dip linked to global trade tensions. Prices stabilized following U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to delay a threatened 50% tariff on European Union goods, which offered short-term relief to financial markets, including digital assets. Kiyosaki’s post adds to a growing list of statements he’s made over the years in support of Bitcoin . On May 10, he criticized the U.S. Federal Reserve by quoting former Congressman Ron Paul, who equated central bank interest rate controls with “price fixing” and likened them to Marxist-style economic intervention. Echoing Paul’s views, Kiyosaki warned that fiat currencies and central banking mechanisms breed systemic dishonesty and undermine individual freedom. He encouraged people to protect their wealth by holding decentralized, non-government assets such as Bitcoin, gold, and silver. “Fake money leads to dishonest leaders and corruption in everyday life,” Kiyosaki wrote. “Get on your own decentralized gold, silver, and Bitcoin standard.” Rich Dad Poor Dad Author Sees $1M Bitcoin by Next Decade A longtime advocate of hard assets, Kiyosaki sees Bitcoin as a modern hedge against inflation and a tool for preserving wealth over time. In his latest prediction , Kiyosaki said he “strongly believes” the Bitcoin price will reach $180,000 to $200,000 by the end of this year. Over the next decade, he sees BTC at $1 million, gold at $30,000 per ounce, and silver at $3,000. Notably, Kiyosaki is not the only one expressing confidence in Bitcoin’s future. As reported, Shunyet Jan, Head of Derivatives at Bybit, has projected that Bitcoin could reach $125,000 by the end of Q2 if current trends persist. Last week, crypto analyst Scott Melker said he believes Bitcoin could surge to $250,000 by the end of 2025 , driven by institutional demand and a maturing market structure.

A key technical pattern has now emerged, which could potentially hint at the next major move in the cryptocurrency’s ongoing price trend. Bitcoin’s Double Bottom Formation Bitcoin may be on track to reach $112,000 following the activation of a classic double bottom pattern, according to CryptoQuant’s report . The pattern—often viewed as a strong bullish reversal signal—formed around key support levels at $106,800 on May 23 and $106,600 on May 25, with a neckline at $109,000. The price has since broken above the neckline and is currently trading above $109,400. CryptoQuant noted that this breakout occurred with strong trading volume, thereby indicating growing bullish momentum. If the breakout level continues to hold as support, analysts believe a move toward the pattern’s projected target of $112,000 is likely. “Double bottoms are where the market says: ‘We’ve sold enough.’ When buyers defend the second bottom, it sends a message: Now it’s our turn. But remember, not every pattern plays out. Know your risk, make your decision.” As Bitcoin holds firm above key technical levels, gauging the on-chain metrics reveals a quiet tug-of-war unfolding beneath the surface. Bullish Continuation Likely Bitcoin’s recent price action reveals a growing divergence between retail behavior and whale activity, as per the latest on-chain analysis . Despite prices grinding higher, exchange netflows remain negative, which implies that more BTC is leaving exchanges than entering. At the same time, the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio has dropped below 1.0. This figure signals that aggressive selling continues, which is likely driven by retail investors de-risking. However, the absence of large inflow spikes suggests there’s no widespread panic or major distribution. Analysts have interpreted this as a potential stealth accumulation phase by smart money. If prices hold amid rising sell pressure, a short squeeze and bullish continuation could follow.

As per on-chain data, the rally was fueled by the media buzz around a billion-dollar bet reversal by whale James Wynn. On-Chain Goes Hand-in-Hand with Price? The current price momentum in Hyperliquid coincides with a notable rise in on-chain activity. As announced by the Hyperliquid team , the open interest has surged to a record high of over $10.1 billion, reflecting a sharp increase in leveraged positions in the market. Simultaneously, social sentiment has surged significantly, as evident by the metrics from LunarCrush. This surge in online discussions and search interest highlights a growing retail and institutional interest in HYPE’s parabolic movement. Hyperliquid Lunar Crush HYPE Price Analysis: Hyperliquid’s HYPE is presently at $38.02, with a 7.21% increase in the last 24 hours. What’s more fascinating is that it is up 49.8% over the past week, and an eye-popping +112.38% over the past month. This remarkable price growth has pushed its market cap to $12.69 billion, placing it closer to the top 10 cryptos. Talking about volumes that have come in the past hours, the business in HYPE surged to $496.11 million, a massive 65.69% spike. The interest from both retail and institutional players led to the token soaring to a new all-time high of $39.93. HYPE Price Chart From a technical standpoint, the current pullback toward the $38 region can be regarded as a healthy consolidation, especially considering the support offered by the 9-period SMA at $37.378 . This indicates ongoing bullish control unless the price breaks below the key support at $35.42 .

Former JPM Asset Management analyst Andre Liu has quietly created a proprietary trading firm powerhouse in Taipei that has far outshone the rest of the industry, reports Bloomberg . According to the firm’s internal documents seen by Bloomberg, UC Capital has recorded an internal rate of return of 51% since it was launched in 2021. A report from research and insights firm PivotalPath found that in 2024, hedge funds scored an average return of 10.7%. Citing people familiar with the matter, Reuters reported that hedge fund giant Citadel’s flagship Wellington fund saw a 15.1% return that year while Millennium Management saw 15%. Bridgewater Associates, which is widely regarded as the largest hedge fund in the world, posted 11% in gains for its flagship Pure Alpha 18% volatility fund. Bloomberg’s data also shows that UC Capital has routinely beaten the local market in Taiwan (TAIEX), even recording significant gains in 2022 despite the Taiwan stock market index ending the year in the negative. Source: Bloomberg UC Capital turned heads in Q4 of last year when it successfully purchased the ball that baseball star Shohei Ohtani hit his 50th home run on the same season he also stole 50 bases – a legendary feat in the MLB. According to Bloomberg, Liu started UC with a colleague in 2013, and by 2021, the firm’s assets exploded 27,000% before the trader decided to start his own company. Says Liu, “Ever since I was a kid, I believed that the heart of trading lies in the changes in moods and sentiment.” Consequently, UC’s engineers have built a model to measure public discourse by scraping and analyzing social media, online forums, news articles and comment sections, in what the firm describes as “sentiment thermometers” to track certain trending topics and behavior. Leveraging its sentiment-driven approach, UC capitalized on a decline in TSMC’s share price earlier this year after its models detected a surge in public discourse involving President Trump and the company’s future. At the time, the chipmaker announced a $100 billion investment in its US plants. UC also reportedly bought an earthquake detector on the eastern coast of Taiwan so that the firm would know about earthquakes before anyone else could in order to short markets in case of uncertainty. The trading firm currently has about $497 million in liquid assets before leverage.

As reported by Associated Press , in an attempt to get access to his Bitcoin wallet, the victim was beaten and forced to hand over the password. The victim was abducted on May 6, but his name has not been made public. The 28-year-old Italian national was tricked into coming to the home with the promise of recovering Bitcoin he was forced to send to Woeltz. The kidnapper was 37-year-old John Woeltz, a crypto investor. He was arrested after the victim escaped from the eight-bedroom townhouse and got help from a passing traffic officer. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition. John Woeltz Faces Multiple Charges Woeltz was presented on Saturday in Manhattan criminal court after his arrest on Friday. He was charged with kidnapping, assault, unlawful imprisonment, and illegal possession of a gun. He rented the Soho apartment for $30,000 a month, where the victim was held. Woeltz reportedly owns a 150-acre property in Kentucky and is said to be worth $100 million, though it’s not clear how he made his fortune. Sources say he worked in blockchain security and may have been involved in a crypto-focused hedge fund. The court decided that he will stay in custody without bail. It’s not clear whether the kidnapper and victim knew each other. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : SlowMist Breaks Down How a Tiny Code Flaw Led to Cetus’ $230M Collapse , Victim Drugged, Tortured For Weeks The kidnapping was part of a larger plan involving others, including a man who has not been caught yet. The victim was tied up, tortured, drugged, shocked with electric wires, and even hit in the head with a gun. At one point, the kidnappers threatened to kill him by hanging him over a stairwell if he didn’t give up his password. The police found evidence of cocaine, a saw, chicken wire, body armor, night vision goggles, ammunition, and Polaroid photos showing the victim with a gun to his head in the townhouse. Woeltz was asked to hand over his passport since he could escape. He is set to appear in court again next week. Violent Assaults On Rise In another case, New York prosecutors charged two guys, Michael Lauchlan and Gary Zaydman, for running a scam with their crypto recovery business, Coin Dispute Network. They were accused of stealing from customers by using fake ads and using actors to pose as happy clients. These kinds of incidents reveal the growing trend of violent assaults, where victims are forced to hand over their passwords. Security experts say that crypto-related attacks are on the rise in 2025. Over 26 cases were traced this year, from kidnappings to home invasions. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In recent years, Sweden has led the charge toward a cashless future, with digital payment platforms becoming widespread. However, as concerns over cyber-threats, civil defense and instability have emerged, Swedish authorities are now actively encouraging citizens to keep some cash. Buterin noted the reversal illustrates that while centralized solutions may be efficient, they may not be reliable during times of crisis. “Nordics are walking back the cashless society initiative because their centralized implementation of the concept is too fragile,” Buterin wrote , citing a March 16 article by The Guardian. “Cash turns out necessary as a backup.” Source: Vitalik Buterin How Ethereum can play a role in a crisis A former central bank official predicted in 2018 that Sweden would be cashless after seven years. In 2025, the prediction mostly held, with only one in 10 transactions in the country being done in cash, according to The Guardian. Still, while the Nordic country was an early adopter of digital payments, its government published a brochure encouraging citizens to keep a week’s worth of cash in case of war or crisis. Sweden’s reconsideration has revealed the issue of centralized digital payment infrastructure remaining reliable in times of instability, Buterin suggested. Buterin said Ethereum can be a decentralized financial fallback in times of crisis. “Ethereum needs to be resilient enough, and private enough, to be able to credibly play this kind of role,” Buterin said. When asked if fully offline zero-knowledge technology-secured private transfers were close to practical implementation, Buterin said the tech know-how is already there, but there are still limitations: “We basically know how to do it, but with the limitation that any solution depends on trusted hardware and/or post hoc enforcement against double-spenders.” Related: Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scaling Crypto payments exec thinks crypto won’t replace fiat While crypto payment solutions are becoming more common, Mercuryo co-founder and CEO Petr Kozyakov has said that crypto will not replace fiat . Kozyakov told Cointelegraph in an interview that crypto payments are seeing an increase in demand and adoption. However, the executive said that instead of cryptocurrencies fully replacing fiat money as a payment method, the two payment options will coexist. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph that people will use crypto when it’s easier and more practical.

Solana still produces over 68% of application revenue compared to all other chains. Solana’s economic activity has charted an expansion trend since the low point in March. Currently, Solana’s apps produce 68% of revenues from all other chains. Based on different data, Solana carries at least 50% or up to 68% of app revenues, mostly linked to token-based activity, DEX trading, and routing. For the past week, Meteora, Pump.fun and Jupiter were the top fee producers. The ecosystem also tapped the activity of Raydium, Phantom wallet, BonkBot, Trojan, and other apps instrumental to DEX trading. Solana app revenues are expanding for the past two months, though still far from their all-time peak in January. | Source: Blockworks Kamino Finance recently reached an all-time high in revenues, driven by the growing value of tokens. The lending protocol benefits from the growing supply of USDC on Solana, which allows traders to deposit meme assets and unlock more USDC. While risky, this lending practice increases Solana liquidity and activity. Solana still carries $11.54B in stablecoin supply, with another $250M USDC minted on May 26. Unlike Ethereum and other L1 chains, Solana hardly carries games, and had a brief NFT season. Most of the revenues come from Pump.fun token minting, trading, and routing. Solana achieved peak weekly revenues in January, at $272M, then had a local weekly minimum at $28M. The current levels show a sustainable recovery trend over the past two months. Pump.fun remains the peak revenue producer on Solana Pump.fun returned with over 35K daily tokens launched. The protocol produces over $2M in daily fees, retaining its primacy despite competition from other launch platforms on Solana. While Pump.fun has lost its monopoly position, the new launchpads are yet to prove their sustainability in attracting trench traders. Pump.fun started sharing its fees, returning some of the inflows to the Solana ecosystem. | Source: DeFi Llama On a daily basis, between 10,000 and 14,000 addresses are creating tokens on Pump.fun, retaining a higher baseline. During the low point of the market, Pump.fun had only 1,000 addresses minting a token. Pump.fun still generates over 82% of new tokens, but most assets are only valued at $1,000 to $10,000. In 30 days, Solana produces over 1M new tokens. This time around, Pump.fun does not retain all fees as revenues. The platform has started sharing a part of its fees with token creators and liquidity providers on PumpSwap, putting some of the funds back in the ecosystem. Until recently, the meme token launchpad was seen as key for the Solana ecosystem, but also a tool to extract revenues. The Solana ecosystem produces over $1M in daily fees, of which most are shared with validators. The main chain lags behind its apps in terms of revenue production. Despite the growing activity, SOL remained around $177.44. SOL open interest is at an all-time high of $3.76B . Solana-based older memes also recovered their value to above $13B. Older tokens like BONK, WIF, POPCAT, and others are once again deposited to Kamino Lend to unlock liquidity.

These 2 Tokens Are Catching Fire,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/looking-for-the-next-500-crypto-winner-like-xrp-these-2-tokens-are-catching-fire/,"Investors are constantly on the hunt for the next breakout token that could deliver outsized returns, much like the meteoric rise of XRP. Two projects that are currently generating significant buzz and exhibiting the potential for explosive growth are Remittix and Hyperliquid. As the crypto market continues to mature, these emerging altcoins may be the ones to watch for investors seeking the next 500% crypto winner. Remittix Exhibits Potential To Be The Future of PayFi While XRP has long dominated cross-border crypto payments, a new rival, Remittix (RTX) , is now drawing attention from deeper pockets. On-chain data indicates a steady uptick in whale accumulation, with larger wallets concentrating holdings at a faster pace. One key reason for this accumulation is Remittix’s underlying PayFi framework. It aims to create a scalable infrastructure for real-time financial settlements. Institutional-grade throughput and low finality times make RTX a practical choice for fintech applications. Unlike most Layer 1s, Remittix isn’t just pushing speed and security. It’s pushing usability. The protocol integrates merchant tools, real-time conversion APIs, and embedded compliance layers. That makes it something a small business in London or Manila could actually use for payments. In terms of developer activity, the protocol has maintained steady GitHub commits and audit updates, signaling an active team behind the scenes. Remittix uses a modular smart contract system, allowing it to be updated without major disruptions. This is important for long-term sustainability and compliance updates, especially as regulatory scrutiny increases. With the recent market trends pointing towards payment-layer innovation and user-friendly crypto tools, RTX is making its debut at the right time. It is not promising to disrupt things but to make things that are in motion better. Analysts have also reinforced this motive, noting that borderless finance is the quickest route to true decentralization in finance. Is XRP Set To Another Rally? After years of waiting, XRP has finally entered the regulated U.S. derivatives market, debuting with futures contracts on CME Group’s platform. This launch occurred on Sunday, May 18, with the first trade executed as a block deal cleared by Hidden Road. On its inaugural day, XRP futures achieved over $19 million in trading volume. These futures are cash-settled and follow the CME CF XRP Dollar Reference Rate. They come in two contract sizes which are 2,500 XRP and 50,000 XRP. CME continues to grow its presence in crypto derivatives. For XRP, this move could be a game-changer, especially as the effects of this new development are being reflected in the nearly 7% surge it has witnessed in the past month. Hyperliquid’s Token Mirrors Solana’s 2021 Breakout Pattern Hyperliquid’s native token, HYPE, is reflecting a price pattern remarkably similar to Solana’s breakout in early 2021, which led to a staggering 300% increase. Analyst Ansem has pointed out that Hyperliquid’s vision aligns closely with the goals Solana and FTX aimed to achieve during their initial collaboration: delivering a high-performance, low-cost trading experience in the crypto market. On May 23, HYPE broke through its 1.0 Fibonacci retracement level (around $35.88), echoing the early phases of SOL’s dramatic rise in 2021. If HYPE continues this momentum, the next target appears to be the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level, approximately $51.68. Furthermore, the 4.618 level near $128 could signify the potential peak of this rally, representing a 240% gain from HYPE’s recent breakout point near $35. Conclusion Remittix and Hyperliquid are two crypto projects exhibiting strong potential for substantial growth, mirroring the remarkable price surge seen by XRP. At just $0.0781, and over $15 million already raised, Remittix offers a low entry point into a project solving real PayFi problems.

A recent confidential report from the U.S. Faster Payments Council, dated January 14, 2025, highlights how U.S. domestic payment providers can align with the G20’s 2027 and 2030 targets for improving cross-border transactions. Notably, the report emphasizes the need to promote “inter-industry collaboration” with fintech companies such as Ripple and Stellar, recognizing their distinct strengths and contributions to this global effort. This insight was shared by SMQKE in a recent post on X, underscoring the growing industry acknowledgment of these blockchain networks’ impact. Yes, “Ripple and Stellar both focus on improving cross border payments and have their own strengths.” https://t.co/86SMX3J3Yg pic.twitter.com/9t5jzw0j8m — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 26, 2025 Accelerating ISO 20022 Adoption and Interoperability The U.S. Faster Payments Council outlines several pathways for domestic payment providers to meet the G20’s goals. Among these is the acceleration of ISO 20022 adoption, a messaging standard designed to create structured, interoperable data formats for seamless cross-border transactions. Ripple and Stellar have long aligned their technological frameworks with these standards, ensuring compatibility with global payment systems. Ripple’s network, already integrated with over 100 banks worldwide, is positioned to benefit from ISO 20022’s push, enabling low-cost, rapid settlement across borders without the delays caused by legacy systems. Beyond technical standards, the report stresses the importance of improving interoperability. Today’s fragmented payment infrastructure can obstruct smooth global transfers. Ripple’s focus on eliminating intermediaries in bank-to-bank transactions directly addresses this challenge, creating streamlined pathways where currencies are converted to XRP tokens and transferred almost instantaneously before being converted again at the destination. Meanwhile, Stellar’s open-access approach allows individuals and SMEs, particularly in underserved regions, to engage with the global economy by leveraging XLM tokens — an effort that amplifies financial inclusion, another key G20 target. Reducing Costs and Expanding Financial Access According to the G20’s outlined objectives, the cost of cross-border transactions should fall below 1% — a figure that has historically been difficult to achieve through traditional banking corridors. The U.S. Faster Payments Council report highlights leveraging distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), including Ripple and Stellar, to minimize intermediary costs and reduce friction. Ripple’s partnerships with banks allow institutions to bypass the traditional correspondent banking network, which typically incurs high fees and delays. Stellar, by contrast, focuses on low-cost access for the unbanked and underbanked populations, using its decentralized platform to reach poorer and less-developed regions. Expanding affordable financial services to underserved markets remains central to both networks’ missions. Ripple’s enterprise-oriented model empowers large financial institutions, while Stellar prioritizes inclusivity by ensuring that anyone — from small businesses to individuals — can tap into cross-border flows. This dual approach is critical to achieving the G20’s broad financial inclusion ambitions, as recognized by the Faster Payments Council. Enhancing Compliance, Transparency, and Risk Management The risks of fraud, money laundering, and terrorism financing loom large over cross-border payments, making regulatory alignment a non-negotiable priority. Ripple and Stellar both emphasize compliance, ensuring that their platforms integrate with global frameworks such as the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) anti-money laundering standards and adhere to GDPR-level data protection protocols. The U.S. Faster Payments Council’s report points to the importance of improving transparency, providing real-time tracking of transactions, clarity on exchange rates, and predictable delivery times. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Blockchain technology enables these advancements. Solutions like RippleNet and Stellar’s decentralized network allow customers to monitor transactions as they move through the system, offering a level of upfront visibility that is largely absent from conventional wire transfers. This enhanced transparency reduces uncertainty, builds trust, and supports the G20’s call for improved payment system reliability. Driving Industry Collaboration and Innovation Perhaps the most forward-looking aspect of the U.S. Faster Payments Council’s recommendations is its call for industry-wide collaboration. By working alongside fintech innovators such as Ripple and Stellar , domestic payment providers can align with global initiatives and harness the benefits of technological progress. The report specifically mentions partnering with startups innovating in cross-border payments, positioning Ripple and Stellar as essential collaborators in building the future of global finance. Ripple’s strength lies in its tight partnerships with financial institutions, leveraging its blockchain for institutional-grade solutions. Stellar, on the other hand, emphasizes decentralized, grassroots participation, focusing on enabling low-cost transfers for individuals and small businesses in less-developed areas. Together, they offer complementary approaches that, when integrated into the broader financial ecosystem, can transform the cross-border payments landscape. Ripple and Stellar Poised for Leadership As the G20 pushes forward with its ambitious 2027 and 2030 cross-border payment targets, Ripple and Stellar stand ready to play central roles in this evolution. The confidential insights shared by the U.S. Faster Payments Council and highlighted by SMQKE point to a future where collaboration between domestic payment providers and innovative fintech firms becomes essential. With their unique strengths — Ripple’s institutional focus and Stellar’s commitment to inclusivity — both networks are not just improving cross-border payments but are actively reshaping the global financial landscape. The next few years will be crucial. As regulatory, technological, and operational challenges converge, the success of the G20’s objectives will hinge on the ability of players like Ripple and Stellar to work hand-in-hand with traditional financial systems. In doing so, they will ensure that cross-border payments become faster, cheaper, more transparent, and more inclusive than ever before.

Strong ETF inflows, surging spot market participation, and positive net realised cap growth have contributed to structural buying in the market, rather than speculative excess. Even as macro risk aversion has returned, with news of possible 50 percent US tariffs on European imports, Bitcoin has held firm—unwinding excess leverage and absorbing profit-taking without a significant breakdown. With such strong gains, profit taking becomes an increasing possibility at these levels . This resilience is drawing attention to Bitcoin’s evolving role as a macro-sensitive, conviction-driven asset that now trades more in line with global liquidity flows than retail sentiment. Notably, Metaplanet’s $104 million accumulation of Bitcoin, and Michigan’s proposed crypto-friendly legislation further validate the narrative of growing institutional and policy-level support for digital assets. Looking ahead, Bitcoin’s ability to continue to consolidate above its short-term holder cost basis around $95,000 remains key. With over $11.4 billion in short-term holder profits realised in the past month, near-term supply overhang is expected—but so is structural demand. ETF bid strength, low volatility, and spot premium all suggest a maturing market poised for eventual continuation once macro clarity improves. The coming weeks will likely determine whether Bitcoin’s latest breakout was a local high or the prelude to a more aggressive leg higher in Q3. In the meantime, the US faces growing financial strain as long-term Treasury yields surge and the dollar weakens amid credit downgrades, rising debt , and looming tariffs. Investor confidence is shaken, with yields on 10-year and 30-year bonds surpassing 4.5 and 5 percent , reflecting scepticism over fiscal discipline and inflation risks. The steepening 30Y/10Y yield curve , typically a growth signal, now reflects fears over long-term risk—not optimism. With foreign demand weakening and Fed support of the bond market fading, markets are pricing in a new era of higher rates and volatility . The bond market is no longer reacting to headlines—it’s warning of a structural shift in how risk is priced. Last week, both institutional adoption and regulatory momentum advanced on multiple fronts. Publicly listed firms Strategy, Metaplanet, and Semler Scientific collectively acquired over 8,800 BTC , reinforcing Bitcoin’s role as a strategic treasury asset. Strategy now holds more than 2.7 percent of Bitcoin’s total supply, highlighting a growing trend among corporations to treat BTC as a long-term reserve in times of economic uncertainty.On the adoption front, FIFA announced it is building its own blockchain on Avalanche, shifting from previous partners Algorand and Polygon. The new EVM-compatible network will make it easier for developers and fans to access digital collectibles, positioning FIFA to scale its Web3 ambitions.

This low-volatility environment suggests an imminent breakout, which will likely define the next major trend. XRP Analysis The Daily Chart XRP is currently trading within a narrow and critical price range, bounded by the 100-day and 200-day moving averages at $2.2, and the descending wedge’s upper boundary near $2.5. This consolidation range marks a pivotal battleground between bulls and bears. The muted price action and the RSI hovering around the neutral 50 zone reflect a state of equilibrium, suggesting that market participants are awaiting a breakout to define the next trend. Should XRP find support from the key moving averages and successfully break above the descending wedge, a bullish rally toward the $3.3 region becomes likely. However, failure to reclaim the $2.5 resistance may trigger a bearish rejection, with downside risk toward the $2 support level. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Ripple has formed a short-term descending wedge, typically considered a bullish continuation pattern. The price is consolidating at the wedge’s lower boundary near $2.2, showing low volatility as traders await a catalyst. If XRP breaks above the wedge’s upper trendline and reclaims the $2.4 level, it will likely confirm a bullish breakout, setting the stage for a rally toward the $2.8 resistance. Conversely, a failure to break out and a subsequent drop below $2.2 could result in a bearish move toward $2.

But this time, it’s not Ripple making waves. A new blockchain contender, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), is stealing the spotlight—and it’s not just hype. With a revolutionary architecture, verified audits, and realistic wealth-building potential, analysts say BTC-S could be the next 100x crypto before the next bull market fully ignites. XRP’s Strengths—and Its Ceilings There’s no denying that XRP has cemented itself as a staple in the crypto ecosystem. Designed for rapid cross-border payments, XRP’s 3–5 second transaction time and minimal fees have made it a favorite among fintech partners. However, XRP’s growth potential may be stalling. With a high market cap, limited smart contract flexibility, and regulatory uncertainty, many investors feel XRP’s biggest gains are behind it. And with the rise of next-generation blockchains, it’s clear the spotlight is shifting. Bitcoin Solaris: The Wealth Technology of Tomorrow Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is quickly rising as a high-performance, energy-efficient blockchain that offers real utility, real scalability, and real upside. Unlike XRP’s single-use case, Bitcoin Solaris is built for more: 10,000+ transactions per second 2-second transaction finality 99.95% less energy usage than traditional mining A dual-consensus model using Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) Full smart contract support and DeFi compatibility Mining optimized for smartphones, laptops, and rigs Importantly, the Solaris Nova app is still in development, so users should not expect to download or mine just yet, but the groundwork has already turned heads across the industry. Audited, Verified, and Investor-Ready Where many new projects overpromise and underdeliver, Bitcoin Solaris has already passed two professional audits. Leading blockchain firms Cyberscope and Freshcoins have reviewed their smart contracts. In addition, the project is KYC-verified via Freshcoins , offering early investors a higher degree of trust. Phase 5: Your Final Window Before the Launch Price Surge Bitcoin Solaris is now in Phase 5 of its fast-moving presale. Here’s what that looks like: Current Price: $5 Next Phase: $6 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 11% extra BTC-S for Phase 5 participants This is it—your shot at the next 50x! Grab BTC-S now before Phase 5 disappears! The presale ends July 31, 2025, making it one of the most focused and aggressive funding cycles in recent crypto history. So far, 8,900+ users have already joined, and $1.2M+ has been raised. With a projected return of 1,900%, this isn’t just another altcoin—it’s a serious wealth-building opportunity. Crypto Influencers Are Watching Closely Bitcoin Solaris hasn’t just attracted analysts—it’s lighting up the screens of top influencers. Crypto Legends described the project as “The next evolution of Bitcoin.” Meanwhile, Crypto Volt described it as: “The instant profit coin.” These reviews reflect growing sentiment that Bitcoin Solaris is built for longevity, not just speculation. Built for the Next Era of Crypto Unlike many projects, Bitcoin Solaris is focused on decentralization, accessibility, and financial inclusion: Total Supply: 21 million (mirroring Bitcoin’s scarcity) Dual-Layer Architecture: Security via the Base Layer (PoW) and scalability via the Solaris Layer (DPoS) Smart Contracts: Fully programmable for dApps and DeFi Optional Privacy: Zero-knowledge proof support And thanks to its launch on the Solana network, BTC-S offers immediate utility and liquidity. Once the native Bitcoin Solaris blockchain goes live, 1:1 redemptions will begin. Conclusion: Bitcoin Solaris Isn’t Just the Next XRP—It Might Be the Next 100X XRP may still serve its purpose in payments, but when it comes to long-term wealth and adoption-ready infrastructure, Bitcoin Solaris is clearly the one leading the new charge. With a tightly managed presale, smart consensus architecture, strong audits, and rapidly growing community support, BTC-S is quickly becoming the breakout coin of 2025.

The analysis segments XRP’s price behavior into three distinct cycles, each marked by interactions with the 21-month Exponential Moving Average (EMA). #XRP – Historical Drop Zone ($12 to $46) But the Average drop is 1500% Let me clarify something upfront: I’m here to share data, insights, and analysis based on math, charts, and historical patterns. If anyone finds that unhelpful, feel free to block me — I’m not here for… pic.twitter.com/mb1kCvYHeU — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) May 25, 2025 The first two cycles reveal a consistent structure: an initial breakdown below the 21 EMA, followed by a temporary recovery toward the EMA, and then a secondary, deeper drop. In Cycle 1 , XRP initially dropped 5500%, recovered, then declined another 2500%. Cycle 2 displayed a similar pattern, but less extreme, with a 150% drop, a retracement, and a subsequent 500% fall. These recurring behaviors are the foundation of EGRAG CRYPTO’s current outlook. However, a closer look at the chart reveals that it is inverted, and the parts the analyst highlighted as price drops are notable price surges, showing the asset’s strength and potential for a massive rally. Cycle 3 and the Ongoing Retracement The chart identifies the current market structure as “Cycle 3.” According to EGRAG CRYPTO, the asset has again surpassed the 21 EMA and has seen a rebound of approximately 430%. The price is currently trading near $2.28. He explains, “We’re currently retracing back to touch the 21 EMA — if XRP stays above $2, the EMA will descend to meet the price.” This retracement phase is considered essential within the historical framework. The anticipated scenario involves the EMA converging with the current price level before XRP enters its secondary rally. If history repeats, this move could be substantial.

If the decline mimics the 2500% rise of Cycle 1, XRP could climb to $46.42. A less severe upsurge in line with the 500% increase from Cycle 2 would bring the target to around $12. Other analysts have shared similar targets , and EGRAG CRYPTO notes that averaging the two outcomes could yield an approximate 1500% rise from current levels, which suggests a mid-range price target of $29. The analyst has consistently predicted a surge to $27 , and refines this average, suggesting the asset will hit $27. Focus on the Long-Term Structure According to EGRAG CRYPTO, using the monthly time frame helps “filter out short-term noise and understand the bigger picture.” The analysis does not rely on short-term sentiment or speculative headlines, but taps measurable historical data.

But now, it seems like the crypto market is steadying itself after months of turbulence. As the new phase begins, Binance CEO Richard Teng has surfaced with a message which is a powerful signal. It’s about where real value comes from and who’s going to win in the long game. These are insights you won’t want to miss. Read on! “Time Rewards Conviction” Teng posted a short, sharp thread on X that speaks volumes. Compounding isn’t just for traditional finance. In crypto: · Long-term vision > short-term hype · Community value compounds over time · Small, early investments can grow exponentially Stay focused. Time rewards conviction. – NFA pic.twitter.com/bWpLPGoNLl — Richard Teng (@_RichardTeng) May 26, 2025 Indeed, compounding is not just a concept for traditional finance. Teng boiled it down to three clear principles showing where he thinks crypto’s next phase will take shape – not in quick hype, but in solid, lasting foundations. Any long-term investor would agree. Teng’s Key Crypto Insights Teng’s message breaks down into three simple but powerful ideas. Long-term vision beats short-term hype. In crypto, the temptation to chase the latest pump or flashy project is constant. But Teng reminds us that lasting success isn’t about jumping on trends but about having a clear vision and sticking with it through the noise. Community value compounds over time. This goes beyond just the price of tokens. Real value builds as a network grows stronger – through active users, developers, and supporters who believe in the project’s mission. That collective momentum creates a foundation that doesn’t fade easily. Small, early investments can grow exponentially. The early believers often see the biggest returns, not just financially, but in influence and opportunity. Teng points out that patience and conviction in the right assets, even if modest at first, can multiply significantly over time. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Adam Back Leads $2.2M Bitcoin Treasury Round for Swedish Firm H100 Group , The Market’s Growing Up This is a timely observation. Traditional markets are under pressure. Bond yields are rising. Trust in legacy financial “safe zones” is cracking. And while the headlines scream volatility, Bitcoin is calmly holding above $105,000 – behaving more and more like the economic hedge people need. The Power of Staying Put: Are You Playing the Long Game? Compounding, in Teng’s view, is less about price and more about patience. It’s about staying focused while others chase exits. It’s about recognizing that network strength and user belief accumulate over time.

Besides, its market capitalization surpassed that of SUI to become one of the top 11 crypto assets in the market. However, the bears have begun to extract the profit, but the selling pressure is not expected to mount as the bulls seem to be poised to hunt for the next upper targets. Along with a rise in the volume, the rise in whale accumulation has also contributed to the HYPE price rally. Earlier, a popular on-chain platform, Lookonchain, reported a whale selling 395K HYPE and earning a profit of over $28 million after holding the token for nearly 5 months. This could be the potential reason for the current pullback, but multiple reasons point towards a continued upswing. One of the major ones is the accumulation by other whales. As per the data shared by Lookonchain , 3 more whales have collectively accumulated nearly 137,929 HYPE worth over $5.33 million. In the times when the tide retreats, the whales have begun to stack, which flashes a huge bullish signal for the crypto. Along with this, the Open interest has reached a new ATH, hinting towards fresh liquidity entering the space. Besides, a viral post by Arthur Hayles predicting the HYPE price could be hitting $100 has also fueled speculation and market excitement. What’s Next? Will HYPE Price Reach $100? HYPE price decisively broke out of multi-week resistance around $30, turning previous resistance levels into support. This has triggered strong buying pressure and led to a rapid price ascent of over 150% since the April lows. The whales have taken a substantial leveraged long position on HYPE, signalling confidence in continued upward price action. Therefore, after a small consolidation, the price is believed to revamp a strong rise and mark new highs. The recent price action has elevated the HYPE price into the bullish range, and as the ADX is close to reaching the upper threshold, the strength of the rally has risen profusely. Besides, the +Di & -Di are diverging apart, hinting towards the continuation of the bullish trend. While the RSI remains within the overbought range, the probability of forming a new ATH could persist. The Hyperliquid price reached a new All-time high with an open interest of over $8.9 billion and daily trading fees of over $5.4 million. Moreover, more than $3.2 billion in USDC has been locked, which hints towards massive trader engagement and leverage on the platform. Overall, Hyperliquid’s current rally is driven by a unique convergence of technical breakouts, whale activity, heightened trading volume, platform growth, and social buzz-though overbought signals suggest caution as well.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|SUI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-26 12:05:49

With a prize pool of $1 million, the hackathon will run from Aug. 1 to Sept. 30 and aims to attract over 10,000 participants across 15 African countries, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph. Organized by two nonprofit organizations — the Switzerland-based Hashgraph Association and the tech research-focused Exponential Science Foundation — the event is open to developers, students, and entrepreneurs worldwide. “We aim to use technologies that converge Web3 with AI to create transparent cognitive solutions that optimize processes and facilitate decision-making and automate the execution,” said Kamal Youssefi, the president of the board of directors at the Hashgraph Association. All solutions will be built on the Hedera network across four tracks: onchain finance and real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation; ESG sustainability and traceability; self-sovereign identity (SSI) and AI; and gaming, metaverse and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Up to 15 outstanding teams will receive prizes based on innovation, impact and alignment with the hackathon’s goals. Onsite hackathon map Source: Hedera-hackathon.hashgraph This Hackathon covers large areas in Africa, with onsite events in over 20 African cities such as Lagos, Cairo, Nairobi, Kinshasa, Cape Town, Casablanca and Tunis. Interest in Africa’s Web3 potential is growing, with more than 50 partners and 100 universities and tech hubs having already joined the Hedera Africa Hackathon. Related: African economies show high potential for digital asset adoption Africa’s Web3 talents are poised for global impact Due to high inflation, a weak banking system and widespread corruption, many people in Africa lack access to reliable financial services. This creates opportunities for Web3 projects like Jambo and Yellow Card to offer alternatives for saving and earning. Related: South African firm chooses Bitcoin reserve strategy as inflation hedge Kamal highlighted Africa’s strength in its “young population with ambitious tech talents”. He cited Hedera’s partnership with Orange, a telecommunications operator, to launch digital empowerment programs across 16 African countries — initiatives that “include training, certification and the establishment of incubation and accelerator centers”. “Africa brings a unique advantage to Web3: a demographic edge and a proven capacity for digital adoption,” said Paolo Tasca, executive chairman of the Exponential Science Foundation. “Yet barriers remain, particularly in foundational infrastructure and education.” Governments are also ramping up talent development. Nigeria, for example, recently launched an annual initiative to train 1,000 citizens in artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies.

Strategy acquired 4,020 Bitcoin ( BTC ) for $427.1 million between May 19 and 23, the company announced on May 26. The latest purchases were made at an average price of $106,237 per coin, with Bitcoin smashing past $110,000 on May 22. The acquisition marks the fourth Bitcoin purchase by Strategy in May, bringing Strategy’s total BTC holdings to 580,250 BTC, acquired for approximately $40.61 billion at an average price of $69,979 per coin. Strategy director sells 2,650 MSTR shares Strategy’s new Bitcoin acquisition followed a series of Class A sales by Strategy director Jarrod Patten. According to a Strategy report of the proposed sale of securities filed on May 22, Patten sold 2,650 MSTR shares in the period between May 16 and 21, worth nearly $1.1 million. Since April 22, Patten has sold a total of 17,050 Class A shares worth $6.7 million. The past three MSTR sales from Strategy’s report of the proposed sale of securities.

MSTR slides 12% after class-action lawsuit Strategy’s new purchase reflects Saylor’s philosophy of acquiring Bitcoin no matter how high the prices are, as he previously vowed to keep buying Bitcoin at the top forever in late 2024. In the meantime, Strategy’s shares have been tumbling from their all-time highs recently, losing at least 12% in the past week, with prices falling from around $420 to $369, according to TradingView data.

The recent drop in Strategy shares came after the company was hit with a class-action lawsuit alleging that the company had misrepresented Bitcoin investments. Filed on May 19, the suit seeks to recover losses of shareholders who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud in April 2025.

The initiative aims to finance a comprehensive package that reduces utility costs and provides financial aid for smaller companies. The government said it plans to utilize budget reserves and existing budget allocations, which would be decided as early as May 27. Just a month prior, Japan unveiled a package of emergency economic measures to counter the adverse effects of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Japan’s auto and steel sectors receive relief package The relief package revealed on April 25 consisted of five pillars, including support for corporate financing and steps to stimulate consumption. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba argued that the package was a bid to alleviate concern that the U.S. levies could weigh on Japan’s exports, potentially taking a heavy toll on the broader economy. During a meeting to discuss the package, Ishiba urged the government to make maximum efforts to ease the impact of the heightened U.S. tariffs. He also argued that U.S. tariffs could hurt Japan’s domestic industries, such as automobiles and steel, emphasizing the necessity of Tokyo and Washington working together for mutual benefit. “It is extremely important for us to clearly convey to the United States the fact that Japanese enterprises have been making a significant contribution to the U.S. economy through investment and job creation.” -Shigeru Ishiba, Prime Minister of Japan. The East Asian economic giant acknowledged on Monday that both countries agreed in their latest tariff negotiations to accelerate efforts towards an agreement. Tokyo is subject to the same 10% baseline levies imposed on most nations, plus steeper tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum. Trump imposed 24% reciprocal tariffs on Japan in early April but later paused them along with similar measures on other countries until early July. The East Asian economic giant is advocating for all levies on its imports announced by Trump lifted. Tokyo’s minister of economic revitalization, Ryosei Akazawa, held a third round of talks in Washington over the weekend and is due to return this week. Japan’s top government spokesman, Yoshimasa Hayashi, said that on Monday, the two nations confirmed they’d accelerate efforts to realize an agreement that would be mutually beneficial. Ishiba aims to advance U.S. tariff talks at the G-7 summit Ishiba told reporters in Kyoto on Sunday that Akazawa’s latest round made progress in talks. He also suggested that he aims to advance an agreement with Trump when the two leaders meet at the annual Group of Seven gathering next month in Canada. Japan’s economic revitalization minister held a 45-minute phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss security, diplomacy, and tariffs. They said they exchanged hope for an in-person meeting at the G-7 summit. Ishiba also expressed Tokyo’s willingness to cooperate in shipbuilding. He noted that the U.S. has shown interest in the possibility of repairing U.S. warships in Japan and that Japan would like to assist. The country’s official said Japan has an advantage in icebreakers, such as those used on Arctic trade routes, which could become an area of cooperation with the U.S. Tokyo proposed setting up a joint Japan-U.S. fund to help revitalize the U.S. shipbuilding industry. The country said the fund would create manufacturing jobs in the U.S. and reduce the economic and security risks associated with China. Akazawa said on Sunday the schedule for the next Japan-U.S. talks is being arranged and that he hopes to meet U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent during his next visit to the U.S. He told reporters at Haneda Airport following his return from Washington, that an agreement will be reached only when all elements are settled as a package, meaning that until everything is agreed upon, nothing is agreed upon.

This development was first spotlighted by crypto influencer Amelie, who posted on X, “FLORIDA PROPOSES LAW TO ELIMINATE CAPITAL GAINS TAX ON XRP.” The announcement has sent ripples of excitement through the XRP and broader crypto communities, fueling discussions about how such legislation could propel Florida into the forefront of crypto-friendly jurisdictions. JUST IN: FLORIDA PROPOSES LAW TO ELIMINATE CAPITAL GAINS TAX ON #XRP https://t.co/hM4NGuQ35U pic.twitter.com/fE3PqThnUz — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 26, 2025 Florida’s Bold Legislative Shift Florida has long positioned itself as an innovation hub, welcoming blockchain companies, fintech startups, and tech entrepreneurs with open arms. The new proposal to eliminate capital gains tax on digital assets like XRP further cements the state’s reputation as a leader in crypto policy experimentation. Although Florida does not currently impose a state capital gains tax, residents only pay federal capital gains taxes — the proposed law seeks to clarify and codify exemptions specifically for digital assets. This clarity could provide a significant incentive for crypto investors, traders, and businesses to migrate operations or residency to Florida, enhancing the state’s competitiveness on the national stage. What makes this move particularly groundbreaking is that it positions Florida as one of the first U.S. states to formally recognize and exempt crypto assets like XRP from state-level capital gains taxation in explicit legal language. While federal tax obligations would still apply, this exemption would lower the overall tax burden for Florida-based investors, making it far more attractive compared to less progressive states. Implications for XRP and Broader Crypto Adoption The potential elimination of capital gains tax on XRP is more than just a tax break; it’s a signal of growing institutional acceptance and government acknowledgment of XRP’s utility. XRP, designed as a bridge currency for cross-border payments, has long been celebrated for its speed, scalability, and minimal transaction costs. This legislative move not only validates XRP’s role in the future of finance but could also unlock new levels of adoption by removing tax friction for everyday users and institutional players alike. Eliminating capital gains taxes means that investors could trade XRP more freely, without worrying about incurring additional state-level tax liabilities each time they convert, spend, or reinvest their digital assets. This reduced friction may encourage greater transactional use of XRP, moving it further beyond a speculative asset and into its envisioned role as a true medium of exchange and cross-border liquidity tool. Economic and Regulatory Ripple Effects Florida’s proposal also has broader economic and regulatory implications. By creating a more hospitable tax environment for crypto, the state positions itself as a magnet for blockchain businesses, investment funds, crypto exchanges, and fintech startups. Companies seeking regulatory clarity and tax advantages may flock to Florida, creating jobs, stimulating economic activity, and enhancing the state’s reputation as a blockchain innovation center. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Furthermore, if Florida’s initiative proves successful, it could inspire other U.S. states to explore similar tax incentives. With federal regulation over crypto still evolving, state-level experiments like this one provide valuable case studies on how local policy can influence national trends. Observers in states like Texas, Wyoming, and Colorado — all known for their crypto-forward policies — will no doubt be watching Florida’s efforts closely. The Road Ahead for the Proposal While the proposal has generated excitement, it is important to remember that it must still pass through Florida’s legislative process before becoming law. Lawmakers will need to navigate debates over potential revenue impacts, regulatory compliance, and alignment with federal tax obligations. However, given Florida’s history of crypto-friendly stances and its ambition to lead in financial innovation, many analysts are optimistic about the bill’s prospects. In the weeks and months ahead, crypto investors, tax professionals, and blockchain industry leaders will be closely monitoring the legislative process. If the bill passes, Florida could become a pioneer in modern crypto taxation — not only benefiting XRP holders but potentially setting the stage for a new wave of state-level crypto policy innovation across the United States. As Amelie’s post captures, this is not just a local tax story; it’s a transformative moment for XRP, for Florida, and possibly for the entire U.S. crypto ecosystem. The floodgates of innovation, investment, and adoption may soon swing wide open. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This breakout is a signal; retail investors are flooding in, looking for the next major winners as bullish momentum sweeps the charts. Among the top contenders riding this surge are Ethereum and Bitcoin Pepe . Now buoyed by its Pectra upgrade and institutional inflows, Ethereum is gaining massive traction. But the real wildcard is Bitcoin Pepe, a meme-powered layer 2 protocol on Bitcoin that blends Solana speed with BTC-grade security. With its listing on May 31st, over $11.3m in ICO funds, and rumors of CEX listings swirling, the experts at Invezz believe Bitcoin Pepe is the best crypto to buy now to absorb this incoming liquidity stampede. As FOMO grips the market, the best opportunities will remain early. Bitcoin Pepe, and Ethereum fit that profile perfectly. Bitcoin blasts past $110K: what this rally means for traders and altcoin Investors Bitcoin has officially entered uncharted territory, smashing through the $111,000 barrier for the first time. After forming a base around $104,200 and clearing resistance at $106,000 and $107,500, bulls piled in with heavy momentum, driving BTC to a new all-time high of $111,814. The move, backed by rising trading volume, marks a key psychological milestone and reflects the growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term dominance. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is consolidating just above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level from its latest swing low of $104,270 to the peak. This suggests that even after such a sharp climb, bulls are still in control and profit-taking has not disrupted the broader trend. Renowned analyst Ali (@ali_charts) has laid out a new price roadmap, identifying the following resistance levels at $116,000, $126,000, $136,000, and $148,000. These targets are based on historic breakout patterns and Fibonacci-based technical projections. #Bitcoin $BTC is trading at new all-time highs, entering price discovery.

Bitcoin Pepe: the meme-fueled revolution giving Bitcoin its Solana moment Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is rewriting what’s possible on the Bitcoin blockchain. As the first-ever meme coin ICO built specifically for BTC, it introduces the powerful PEP-20 token standard—a game-changing protocol that simplifies token creation directly on Bitcoin. Just as ERC-20 sparked a wave of innovation on Ethereum, Bitcoin Pepe is poised to do the same by reducing the barrier to entry and opening the floodgates for meme coin developers. Time to stop sleeping on $BPEP as you're going to regret it later Seen they've got some major partnerships lined up too.

Market analysts are already referring to it as “Solana on Bitcoin,” for good reason. Moreover, CoinJournal has continuously referred to Bitcoin Pepe as the best crypto to buy now for smart investors. Bitcoin Pepe’s partnerships span gaming, DeFi, and fair launch platforms. They integrate BPEP and PEP-20 tokens into ecosystems like Super Meme, Catamoto, Plena, GETE, Crypto Hunters, BETV, GemuPlay, and Heroes Battle Arena. These collaborations boost utility, cross-chain adoption, gaming rewards, and retail visibility ahead of its highly anticipated May 31 listing event. With a May 31 listing date confirmed and the presale entering its final stretch, momentum is snowballing. BPEP is now priced at $0.0359; the next price hike is imminent.

Here's Why,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/the-merger-agreement-between-two-decentralized-derivatives-protocols-has-been-canceled-heres-why/,"Decentralized derivatives protocols Synthetix and Derive have mutually withdrawn bids for a $27 million merger deal. Synthetix and Derive Mutually Cancel $27 Million Merger Offer The planned deal would see Synthetix acquire Derive (formerly Lyra) to combine the two platforms under a unified derivatives protocol on the Ethereum mainnet. The proposal, which was floated in mid-May, involved Derive transferring its treasury, technology, and products to Synthetix via a token swap. In this context, official proposal documents called Synthetix Improvement Proposal (SIP-415) and Derive Improvement Proposal (DIP) were published. However, in the statement made by Derive, it was said that “Following community feedback and constructive discussions, SIP-415 and DIP proposals were mutually withdrawn.” The deal valued Derive at $27 million, with a token swap ratio of 27 DRV (Derive tokens) = 1 SNX (Synthetix token). Synthetix planned to mint 29.3 million new SNX for the acquisition. However, this plan has received intense criticism, especially from the Derive community. It has been argued that Derive has been generating more revenue than Synthetix in recent weeks, and that the $27 million valuation is unfair to Derive and that the platform is seriously undervalued. Synthetix’s plan to mint new SNX has also been criticized for risking value dilution for existing token holders. Synthetix had planned to use Derive’s know-how for its new derivatives product called Perps V4, which uses a centralized order book on Ethereum. However, with the deal being canceled, Synthetix will reportedly look for other strategies to strengthen its ecosystem. In a statement made by Derive, it was stated that the development reaffirmed the platform's independent growth path. This development has once again demonstrated how community feedback and transparent governance can influence the fate of deals in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). *This is not investment advice.

For the seventh week in a row, the company has expanded its already massive Bitcoin treasury, proving once again that its conviction runs deeper than most. What a bold power move! While most companies play it safe, MicroStrategy keeps doubling down – even when prices are near all-time highs. But why now? And how big is their bet really? Let’s unpack what just happened. Details of Strategy’s Latest Bitcoin Purchase In its latest acquisition, MicroStrategy scooped up 4,020 BTC for roughly $427.1 million , paying an average of $106,237 per coin . As of May 26, the firm holds a staggering 580,250 BTC , acquired for around $40.61 billion – at an average cost basis of $69,979 per Bitcoin . According to the company, it has achieved a BTC Yield of 16.8% year-to-date in 2025 , a metric that aims to capture performance beyond traditional profit figures. While critics debate the validity of such internal calculations, it’s hard to argue with results when you’re holding nearly half a million BTC. A Relentless Streak with ‘Strategy’ to Back It Up Just last week, MicroStrategy added 7,390 BTC to its holdings in a single move worth nearly $765 million. That brought its total stash at the time to 576,230 BTC, locking in an unrealized gain of $23.1 billion – a profit larger than the market cap of many Fortune 500 giants. The company’s co-founder, Michael Saylor , foreshadowed the buy on X, writing: “I only buy Bitcoin with money I can’t afford to lose.” This marks 7 straight weeks of accumulation – a pattern that speaks volumes about MicroStrategy’s outlook, especially in the face of market volatility. Analysts See a $10 Trillion Future Market analyst Jeff Walton isn’t holding back. Speaking to the Financial Times , he had previously claimed MicroStrategy could one day become “the most valuable publicly traded corporation in the world”, thanks to its Bitcoin arsenal. “Strategy holds more of the best assets, and the most pristine collateral, on the entire planet than any other company, by multiples,” Walton said. He also noted the firm’s ability to raise billions in under two months, a feat most public companies can only dream of. But All Eyes Are on the Lawsuit Yet beneath the headlines, not everything is bullish. MicroStrategy is currently facing a class action lawsuit in the Eastern District of Virginia. Filed by Pomerantz LLP, the case accuses the firm of misleading investors over the implications of new Bitcoin accounting rules under ASU 2023-08. The dispute is around a potential $5.91 billion fair-value loss that critics say wasn’t properly communicated. The complaint also alleges that metrics like “BTC Yield” and “BTC $ Gain” paint an overly optimistic picture not backed by GAAP accounting standards. The backlash has already hit.

The initiative is designed to facilitate and accelerate access to the crypto space for traditional players, combining Cecabank’s infrastructural and regulatory expertise with Bit2Me’s digital asset expertise. A Platform Ready for MiCA, Pending CNMV Approval The new platform—technologically prepared but not yet approved by Spain’s CNMV securities regulator—will offer custody and RTO (reception and transmission of orders) services. Bit2Me will manage crypto trading, market data, and custody of over 100 digital assets, while Cecabank will provide banking and regulation solutions. Solutions Tailored to Europe’s Banking Market As the firms described, the platform would be MiCA compliant with European regulations. It allows banks to integrate crypto services suitable for regulatory climates and created specifically for institutional purposes. said Aurora Cuadros, corporate director of securities services at Cecabank, “With this alliance, Cecabank strengthens its positioning as a leading provider of post-trade solutions for digital assets, backing our entrenched position in FIAT custody.” BBVA Enters Crypto Business Too Cecabank is not alone in joining the crypto train. Spain’s second-largest bank, BBVA, is to unveil its own crypto trading platform, offering Bitcoin and Ethereum products. BBVA will have direct custody, allowing clients to trade with crypto within the bank’s digital space without a third party. A Trend of Rising Institutional Crypto Adoption The alliance marks a growing inclination of European banks to adopt the evolving world of digital assets in clear-cut regulatory guidelines.

Sweden’s push to store physical cash highlights growing concerns over the fragility of cashless infrastructure. Buterin is pushing for Ethereum upgrades to improve privacy, offline usability, and node accessibility. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has raised concerns about the risks of centralized digital payment systems, pointing to Sweden’s shift away from its aggressive cashless agenda as a cautionary example. Buterin said Ethereum could serve as a decentralized fallback in times of crisis. Sweden, once seen as a global model for cashless adoption, is now urging citizens to keep physical currency on hand, according to a March 16 article by The Guardian. Sweden Urges Citizens to Keep Cash Amid Crisis Preparedness Push Government-issued guidance recommends households store at least a week’s worth of cash in case of war or national emergency. The move follows growing anxiety over cybersecurity threats and the vulnerability of digital systems during periods of unrest. “Nordics are walking back the cashless society initiative because their centralized implementation of the concept is too fragile,” Buterin posted, referencing the article. “Cash turns out necessary as a backup.” While only 10% of Swedish transactions now use cash, authorities are reassessing the overreliance on central infrastructure. Buterin sees this as an opening for decentralized systems like Ethereum to step in — not just as an alternative, but as a more resilient and private solution. @rohangrey has done a lot of deep thought in this direction. We basically know how to do it, but with the limitation that any solution depends on trusted hardware and/or post hoc enforcement against double-spenders. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) May 25, 2025 For Ethereum to fill that role, it needs to meet high standards of reliability and privacy. Buterin emphasized the importance of advancing zero-knowledge proof-based technology to allow private, offline transactions. However, he cautioned that current solutions still rely on trusted hardware or enforcement mechanisms to prevent double-spending. “The know-how is there,” he said, “but trustless execution under extreme conditions remains a work in progress.” Buterin Proposes Node Upgrade to Boost Ethereum Accessibility Last week, Buterin unveiled a new proposal aimed at making it significantly easier for everyday users to run Ethereum nodes, by reducing the hardware and storage requirements currently needed to sync with the network. The Ethereum mastermind suggested a shift in how nodes store and retrieve data, moving from full data replication to a more flexible, user-centric model. Under this approach, nodes would store only the data relevant to the user, rather than Ethereum’s entire global state, which currently exceeds 1.3 terabytes, according to Etherscan. “Currently, the overhead is impractically high,” Buterin wrote, adding that even with ongoing optimizations, the cost of operating a full node will likely remain out of reach for most users without specialized hardware or cloud support. Earlier this month, Connor said Ethereum’s “biggest mainstream moment” could come through its integration with AI, as the sector struggles with centralization, opaque algorithms, and growing privacy concerns. “AI is plagued by black-box models, centralized data silos, and privacy pitfalls,” Connor noted, adding that Ethereum is uniquely positioned to address these issues.

Set for May 29, 2025, this decision could significantly influence Cardano’s trajectory and the broader digital asset market. The anticipation surrounding this date was notably highlighted by Cardanians, a prominent Cardano-focused community, who emphasized the potential impact of the SEC’s forthcoming decision. Their insights underscore the community’s optimism and the high stakes involved in the SEC’s ruling. Grayscale's Cardano $ADA ETF deadline for decision is this week. The SEC must approve, deny, or delay it by this Thursday, May 29. Do you think it'll get approval this week? pic.twitter.com/84o9lyLksJ — Cardanians (CRDN) (@Cardanians_io) May 26, 2025 Grayscale Cardano ETF Proposal Grayscale Investments, a leading digital asset management firm, filed for the Grayscale Cardano Trust on February 10, 2025 . The SEC acknowledged this filing on February 24, initiating a formal review process. The proposed ETF aims to offer investors regulated exposure to ADA without the need to directly hold the cryptocurrency. If approved, it would be listed on NYSE Arca, tracking ADA’s price through a composite index derived from major exchanges like Coinbase, Crypto.com, Bitfinex, and Kraken. Regulatory Landscape and SEC’s Deliberations The SEC’s approach to cryptocurrency ETFs has historically been cautious. While Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs received approvals in 2024, altcoin-based ETFs like the one proposed for Cardano are under meticulous scrutiny. The SEC extended its review period for Grayscale’s Cardano ETF by 45 days in March, setting the new decision deadline to May 29, 2025. This extension aligns with the SEC’s pattern of thorough evaluations, especially concerning emerging digital assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Implications and Cardano’s Position The approval of a Cardano ETF could be transformative for ADA’s market dynamics. It would provide institutional investors with a regulated avenue to gain exposure to Cardano, potentially leading to increased liquidity and broader adoption. Grayscale’s proactive accumulation of ADA tokens in anticipation of the ETF’s approval further signifies institutional confidence in Cardano’s long-term prospects. Moreover, Cardano’s network has demonstrated robust growth, with over 5.2 million wallets and a significant uptick in daily active addresses and transactions. These metrics reflect a vibrant ecosystem that could benefit from the enhanced visibility and legitimacy an ETF approval would confer. As May 29 approaches, the cryptocurrency community keenly awaits the SEC’s decision on Grayscale’s Cardano ETF proposal. An approval could mark a significant milestone for Cardano, potentially catalyzing its integration into mainstream financial markets and attracting substantial institutional investment. Conversely, a delay or rejection would underscore the regulatory challenges that altcoin-based ETFs continue to face. Regardless of the outcome, this decision is poised to have lasting implications for Cardano and the broader digital asset landscape.

Bitcoin presents an easy path for this, according to finance guru and entrepreneur Robert Kiyosaki. The Rich Dad, Poor Dad author believes bitcoin (BTC) has made it so easy for anyone to get rich and insists more people should be buying the digital asset. “Don’t Be a Yellow Banana” Kiyosaki insists that even as little as .01 BTC is going to be priceless in two years and would likely make any investor very rich. Hence, he is baffled that everyone is not buying and holding BTC. He acknowledged that BTC goes up and down, as does real life. However, with only 2.1 million BTC left to be mined, the cryptocurrency’s price is bound to enter the “banana zone.” Raoul Paul, CEO and co-founder of Real Vision Group and Global Macro Investor, describes the banana zone as a period of rapid price increase during which BTC records new highs very often. This is usually a price discovery phase during a bull market. Kiyosaki says people who would miss the easiest time in history to become rich and financially free via bitcoin are yellow bananas. “Don’t be a yellow banana. Open your eyes and your mind and listen to people like Raoul Pal, Michael Saylor, Anthony Pompliano, and many others, then follow content on Bitcoin Zella and look into the future of money,” he urged his followers. Obeying The Laws of Money The Rich Dad author’s latest words come shortly after he advised people not to break the two most important laws of money. The first law is Gresham’s, which states that bad money drives out good money. The second, Metcalfe’s Law of networks, postulates that the value of a service or product increases as more people use it. Kiyosaki asserted that most people are poor because they are breaking those two laws when applied to the monetary system. He said he invests in Bitcoin because it is a network, whereas most cryptocurrencies are not. The finance guru says he does not save U.S. dollars because the currency violates Gresham’s law. Likewise, he does not put his money in shit coins without networks because they violate Metcalfe’s law. He keeps saving gold, silver, and BTC because they obey the laws.

The milestone continues the positive performance of the protocol in 2025. According to data from CoinMarketCap , the decentralized derivatives exchange token has seen its value increase by 111% in the last 30 days, a factor that contributed to its new peak. The token has enjoyed a relatively positive performance in 2025, enough to make it up 45% year to date. This makes HYPE one of the best-performing altcoins in a generally rough year for other cryptocurrencies, apart from Bitcoin. Although Bitcoin is up 16% this year, major altcoins such as Ether, Solana, BNB, LINK, and ADA are down YTD. Even major altcoins with gains this year, such as XRP and TRX, have only seen single-digit positive performance, with Monero XMR being the only top 20 cryptocurrency that is up more than 100% this year. Meanwhile, HYPE’s recent performance has sent it higher on the list of top crypto by market capitalization. It is now ranked eleventh according to CoinMarketCap with $12.72 billion, higher than SUI with $12.05 billion but still far behind TRX, which has a $25.83 billion market cap. HYPE is riding the crypto whale watching train The positive performance for HYPE is tied to Hyperliquid growth and increased activity in the past few weeks. The decentralized derivatives trading exchange has come into the spotlight as the trading venue for crypto whales betting on or against the market. With whales such as James Wynn and the Machi Big Brother using Hyperliquid to execute trades and make millions in profits, the platform has attracted the attention of more traders who have praised it for its transparency. All these have allowed Hyperliquid to set new records with multiple all-time highs. In the last 24 hours, it saw $10.1 billion open interest, $5.6 million in daily fees, and $3.5 billion in USDC total value locked. It also set a record for a new peak in daily active users with 18,000 unique addresses. HyperEVM set a new ATH for active users per day at 18,000 (Source: Hyperliquid News) Despite its recent surge in activity, Hyperliquid ranks ninth on the list of DEX platforms for trading volume in the last seven days, with $2.55 billion, far below PancakeSwap and Uniswap with $55.68 billion and $27.01 billion. Besides the increased activity, Hyperliquid tokenomics has also made it attractive to several investors, boosting its demand. There is an ongoing buyback of HYPE tokens, and multiple whales are piling on the asset. According to Lookonchain , eight whales bought over 930,000 HYPE tokens worth around $33 million in the last three days. Interestingly, another whale who held 1.45 million HYPE worth $55 million for 5 months has started selling and stands to realize over $28 million in profits if he sells everything. Hyperliquid Foundation recovers its account The bullish expectations for the HYPE token remain, with many crypto investors bullish on the token. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes is one of the HYPE bulls and has predicted that the token could reach $100. Signs of that strong bullish sentiment are also evident in how a whale recently lost over $23 million trying to short HYPE and eventually had to liquidate and close his positions. Meanwhile, any sign of headwinds for the project appears to have been eliminated after the Hyperliquid Foundation account on X was recovered following a breach. Bad actors had initially gained control of the account, using it to promote scam projects that have now been deleted. Hyerliquid confirmed that the breach did not affect its blockchain or other social media channels. It added that it is working with X’s security team to investigate the account compromise, but the incident touched none of its internal systems, emails, or credentials.

Meanwhile, in London, an American tourist lost $123,000 in Bitcoin after being drugged and robbed by a fake taxi driver. Adding to the concern, a crypto user was scammed twice in three hours, losing $2.6 million in USDT to a zero-value phishing attack. Bitcoin Ransom Horror Unfolds in Manhattan A Manhattan-based crypto investor was charged in a deeply disturbing case involving the alleged kidnapping and torture of a 28-year-old Italian man, in an apparent attempt to steal access to his Bitcoin wallet. The accused, John Woeltz, was arraigned on Saturday in Manhattan criminal court and faces four felony charges, including kidnapping for ransom. The incident reportedly took place inside a luxury Soho townhouse rented for $30,000 per month, where the victim claims he was held captive for several weeks beginning shortly after his arrival in the US on May 6. According to law enforcement and reporting by The New York Times, Woeltz and an unidentified accomplice allegedly seized the man’s passport and electronic devices and demanded his Bitcoin wallet password. When the man refused to comply, he was subjected to a horrifying ordeal that included being beaten, electroshocked, assaulted with a firearm, and even dangled from upper floors of the five-story townhouse. The victim also stated that Woeltz used a saw to injure his leg and forced him to smoke crack cocaine. Threats were reportedly made against the man’s family as well. Investigators found photographic evidence, including Polaroid pictures inside the residence, which appeared to corroborate the victim’s claims of sustained abuse. The victim managed to escape on Friday and contacted authorities, which led to Woeltz’s arrest. At his court appearance, Woeltz pleaded not guilty and was ordered to be held without bail by Judge Eric Schumacher. He is due back in court on May 28. Police also detained a 24-year-old woman in connection with the case, but no formal charges against her appear in the court’s public records, and she was seen walking freely in New York the next day. Authorities have not revealed the nature of the relationship between Woeltz and the victim or whether any digital assets were ultimately compromised. The incident only added to the growing concerns over the physical security risks faced by people involved in the cryptocurrency space. Reports of kidnappings and extortion targeting crypto holders have risen sharply, particularly in France, where high-profile individuals are increasingly turning to private security. Private security firm Infinite Risks International confirmed that there has been a surge in demand for bodyguards and long-term protection services from crypto entrepreneurs. In response, French authorities also rolled out enhanced protective measures, including fast-tracked police assistance and security briefings for those in the crypto industry. The issue gained some urgency after multiple incidents over the past few years. This includes the January 2025 kidnapping of Ledger co-founder David Balland, who was rescued by French law enforcement after being held for several days. Similarly, in May, the father of an unnamed crypto entrepreneur was freed during a police raid in a Paris suburb after being kidnapped by organized criminals. Tourist Drugged and Robbed of $123K in Bitcoin An American tourist visiting London also recently reportedly lost $123,000 in Bitcoin after being drugged and robbed by a person impersonating a taxi driver. Jacob Irwin-Cline, the victim, spent the evening at a local bar before attempting to take an Uber home. However, he mistakenly entered a different vehicle driven by someone who resembled his expected Uber driver. The man was posing as a legitimate driver, and allegedly offered Cline a cigarette that was likely laced with scopolamine, which is a powerful and uncommon sedative that is known for its ability to incapacitate victims. (Source: MyLondon ) Cline recalled feeling immediately drowsy and soon passed out for approximately 30 minutes. When he regained consciousness, the driver abruptly told him to get out of the car. As he stepped out, the driver sped off, striking him with the vehicle and fleeing the scene. The assailant made off with Cline’s cellphone, which held access to his cryptocurrency holdings, including private keys and wallet applications. The theft amounted to a staggering $123,000 in stolen Bitcoin. The incident also added to the growing list of alarming cases involving crypto-related crimes targeting unsuspecting individuals and well known figures in the digital asset industry. With an increasing number of crypto users carrying sensitive financial data on mobile devices, this attack shed some light on the rising risks and the urgent need for caution when navigating the digital space and the real world. Investor Loses $2.6M in Double Crypto Scam Kidnappings are not the only crimes people in the crypto space should be looking out for. A single crypto investor reportedly fell victim to two scams in just three hours, which caused them to lose a staggering $2.6 million in USDT (Tether) through an advanced form of on-chain phishing known as a zero-value transfer. According to data shared by crypto compliance firm Cyvers on May 26, the victim first transferred $843,000 worth of USDT, followed by a second transaction totaling $1.75 million shortly after. The scam involved a deceptive tactic that exploits the structure of blockchain token transfers to trick users into sending funds to fraudulent addresses. Zero-value transfers are a sophisticated phishing technique where attackers use the “From” function in token contracts to initiate transfers of zero tokens from the victim’s wallet to a spoofed address. Because the transaction amount is zero, it does not require the victim’s signature or approval, but it still appears in their on-chain transaction history. This subtle deception can mislead users into believing the address is trustworthy or familiar, increasing the chance that they later send real funds to the attacker. (Source: Coinbase ) This method is seen as an evolution of the older address poisoning technique, in which attackers send small amounts of tokens from lookalike wallet addresses—often mimicking the beginning and end of a known address. Users who rely on partial matching or past transaction history may then accidentally send funds to these malicious addresses. When combined with zero-value transfers, this attack becomes even more convincing and difficult to detect. The threat is growing across multiple blockchains. A study that was published in January 2025 revealed more than 270 million poisoning attempts on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July of 2022 and June of 2024. Of those, more than 6,000 attacks were successful, and resulted in over $83 million in total losses. In one high-profile case in 2023, a scammer used the zero-transfer technique to steal $20 million before being blacklisted by Tether.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-26 13:12:00

Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s. They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading. They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index). If you’re new to Bitcoin ( BTC ) trading, you may wonder when to buy or sell. Candlestick charts, like bar or line graphs, have time on the horizontal axis, while the price data appears on the vertical axis. They provide a quick look at price movements when compared to other charts. You can quickly view the highest and lowest prices of an asset in a specific timeframe. It also shows the opening and closing prices. Here are a few Bitcoin trading tips to help you get started . No experience needed; this is your go-to crypto candlestick chart tutorial, perfectly suited for beginners. Why analyze Bitcoin price charts Technical analysis is an essential and consolidated strategy for trading markets. When Bitcoin ( BTC ) started picking up and prices fluctuated more, crypto investors began to use trading strategies from traditional markets, such as candlesticks. For Bitcoin technical analysis basics , platforms like TradingView offer many charts and technical indicators. These tools are easy to use, even for beginners. TradingView crypto charts can be candlestick, bar or line charts. Here’s an overview of candlestick charts to help you get started with Bitcoin trading. Beginner’s guide to Bitcoin candlestick charts Candlestick charts are a milestone in technical analysis and the first step to understanding Bitcoin charts. They are an essential tool to quickly assess price movements and market trends in the short term. They represent Bitcoin’s price trends on a chart over a specific period, such as one hour, four hours or one day, to help traders make better decisions. Why use candlesticks? They help traders visualize price movements over time. They help identify bullish, bearish or consolidation sentiment. They help spot patterns like reversals or continuations to predict future price movements. A candlestick represents four key price points: The opening price at the start of the period The closing price at the end of the period The highest price reached during the period The lowest price reached during the period. A candlestick is formed of a body , the bulky part between the open and close prices. It is green when the price goes up in a bullish move, and the closing price is higher than the opening price. It is red when the closing price is lower than the opening price, so the price is in a bearish movement as it goes down. The body size shows strong buying and selling pressure when it’s long. It indicates uncertainty when it’s short. A candlestick also has wicks, or shadows. They are thin lines above and below the body that indicate the highest or lowest prices the asset hit during the relevant trading frame. Here’s a useful example that may help you understand it better. Suppose you’re analyzing the four-hour chart using candlesticks, and Bitcoin’s opening price is $90,000. The closing price is $93,500, with a high of $95,000 and a low of $88,700. In this instance, the candlestick will appear as a green body from $90,000 to $93,500. An upper wick hitting $95,000 and a lower wick dipping to $88,700. Advantages of Bitcoin candlestick chart Bitcoin candlestick charts offer several advantages, including: Candlestick charts offer you a quick view of market sentiment and price movement. They show if the market is positive or negative and how strong that feeling is. You can pick different timeframes based on your trading style, whether you’re a day trader, swing trader or long-term investor . For example, the one-minute chart works well for scalping, while the daily chart is better for long-term investors. As crypto markets are open 24 hours a day, the open and close prices reflect the start and end of the chosen timeframe. Introduction to advanced crypto charting techniques to trade BTC Candlesticks are a great way to start trading Bitcoin. They give you a quick look at market trends and help predict price movements. Once you know the basic charts and skills, you can explore advanced techniques. For example, using moving averages can help you make better investing decisions. Here are some of the best tools Bitcoin traders use to leverage technical analysis, volume and market psychology. These strategies give traders an edge in the ever-changing crypto market. 1. Fibonacci retracement Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool used to spot potential support and resistance levels, as well as price targets. To use this method, draw lines connecting a major high and low on the chart. Then, calculate retracement levels using Fibonacci ratios like 23.6%, 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%. You can use the Fibonacci retracement for confirmation when paired with trendlines or moving averages. 2. Volume profile Volume profile is another tool for technical analysis. It shows trading volume for price instead of time. Knowing where trading happens most helps traders spot key price levels. These levels often create strong support and resistance zones. 3. Elliot Wave Theory The Elliott Wave theory is a prediction model of price movements based on market psychology and wave patterns. According to the theory, the market moves in trends of five waves, followed by three waves of correction, with each wave reflecting trader sentiment. 4. Other indicators The relative strength index (RSI) is one of the most common charting indicators. It measures the strength of Bitcoin’s upward and downward price movements over time. The simple moving average (SMA) indicates the average price of an asset over time, which can help you understand Bitcoin’s overall price movement. The exponential moving average (EMA) is a better alternative to the SMA for identifying short-term trends. Like the SMA, the EMA shows you the average price of an asset over time, but the EMA focuses more on recent days. Caution! Reading Bitcoin candlesticks or any other charts is a great first step toward understanding market behavior, but remember charts don’t guarantee outcomes. Always combine technical insights with risk management, and never trade more than you can afford to lose. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-26 13:12:20

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently showing strong resilience in the face of uncertainty in the altcoin market, which just hasn’t been able to capture the clues from Bitcoin’s recent strong showing. ETH has struggled against BTC, especially since the last bull market of 2020- 2021. Back then, the programmable cryptocurrency project posed a major challenge to BTC’s hegemony and dictated the entire altcoin market. However, the altcoin market has now decoupled itself from ETH and operates largely independently. It also outperforms ETH on most turns. Things might change in the coming months or so. ETH is recovering strongly against BTC, and it will likely end in a massive price reversal for the former. Currently, it is changing hands just below $2600. Ethereum to Rise to $10,000 According to popular X (formerly Twitter) crypto analyst Kamran Asghar, the rise of ETH against BTC defies a 4-year downward trend since 2021. He tweeted this picture: Image Source: X He stated that the bullish divergence of the ETH/BTC chart has started, and a major move will help ETH recover its losses against BTC. He predicted that a move to $10,000 is imminent and will usher in a new era of development for ETH. Ethereum’s Challenges However, Ethereum currently faces several challenges in its quest to regain its position in the cryptocurrency market charts. While the digital asset has shown resilience in the face of recent global economic uncertainty, the situation remains precarious as trade barriers increase and liquidity suffers. Also, ETH’s downgrading against BTC and the larger crypto market cannot just be blamed on the market forces. The layer-1 blockchain has hit several development roadblocks over the last few years despite hands-on efforts by Vitalik Buterin, the head of the Ethereum Foundation. The most significant underlying issue with ETH was its operational capacity. Its slow, limited network was hampering efforts to open up blockchain adoption around the world. As a result, many newer projects like Solana, SUI, and Chainlink were able to come forward as alternatives to ETH and capture some of the market. The Future Despite ETH’s latest troubles, it still commands a massive $300 billion position in the cryptocurrency market. If ETH can enact crucial, effective updates on time, it can catch up and end 2025 on a new footing. Failure to do so will see ETH increasingly squeezed by Bitcoin and alternatives like Solana and maybe one day overtaken by it.",Ethereum|News|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-26 13:13:48

It has jumped by over 430% from its April low. The token rallied as some of the biggest AI agents in its ecosystem became top performers on Monday. The Ava AI token surged 30%, while aixbt, VaderAI, Ribbita, and Game each rose by over 15%. A likely catalyst for Virtuals Protocol and other AI tokens is the upcoming NVIDIA earnings report on Wednesday. The results are expected to shed light on the growth of the AI sector. Analysts expect that NVIDIA’s Q1 revenue rose 65% to $43.17 billion, with earnings per share increasing from $0.61 to $0.73. Revenue guidance for Q2 is expected to hit $45 billion.

Still, Virtuals Protocol faces a few challenges. DeFi Llama data shows that the network has made $496,000 in revenues this month. While this is an improvement from last month’s $200,000, it is much lower than the January high of $3.9 million. Another concern is that whales and smart money investors have been selling their tokens.

VIRTUAL has also climbed above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, while the Relative Strength Index is trending upward. Therefore, the token will likely continue rising as bulls target the all-time high of $5.1335, its peak in January. A move to that level would represent a 135% gain from the current price.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. An Ethereum whale who struck gold with FART token is now betting big on another under-the-radar memecoin priced at just $0.0033. Table of Contents XYZVerse redefines memecoins: The next 50x breakout? Ethereum continues to climb Fartcoin surges ahead Conclusion A renowned Ethereum trader who made a fortune from the FART token is now eyeing a new memecoin priced at $0.003333. He predicts this low-priced token could surge by 9000%. This bold forecast has sparked interest among crypto enthusiasts eager to uncover the next big opportunity in digital currencies. XYZVerse redefines memecoins: The next 50x breakout? The hype around XYZVerse (XYZ) is building fast, and for good reason. With a bold aim to deliver 50x returns, this sports-fueled memecoin is drawing serious attention from early investors and crypto influencers alike. XYZVerse’s ongoing presale offers one of the lowest entry points in the memecoin market today. Priced significantly below its projected listing value, XYZ gives early adopters a rare chance to lock in deep discounts ahead of a potential launch explosion. Stage 1 price: $0.0001 Current price (Stage 12): $0.003333 Final presale target: $0.1 Raised so far: Over 70% of the $15m goal With strong progress and a rapidly rising price curve, those getting in now are still early, and positioned for high upside. XYZ is already listed on CoinMarketCap, where 95% of users have voted bullish on the project’s future. Influencers are taking note, too. DanjoCapitalMaster (with nearly 800,000 followers) recently called XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” While most memecoins lean purely on trend cycles, XYZVerse is carving a different path. By fusing the excitement of sports, football, MMA, basketball, and esports, with crypto’s viral energy, the project is building a niche that resonates with millions. But it’s not just the theme that’s clicking, it’s the structure: 15% of supply is locked for liquidity, ensuring smoother trading post-launch. 10% is reserved for airdrops and community rewards. 17.13% will be used for deflationary burns, tightening supply and fueling long-term demand. What truly sets XYZVerse apart is its commitment to community-building: The Ambassador Program rewards users for spreading the word. Talks are already underway with major sports figures to amplify visibility. The project recently partnered with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ, unlocking real-world utility and deeper engagement. As part of its latest partnership, XYZVerse is rewarding XYZ token holders with a special bonus on their first sportsbook bet, a valuable incentive that adds real utility to being part of the ecosystem. By merging the thrill of traditional sports with the high-octane world of crypto, XYZVerse isn’t just riding trends, it’s creating a whole new game. With a rapidly growing presale, a passionate community, and a bold, utility-focused roadmap, XYZVerse is shaping up to be more than just hype. It’s a project with serious upside, and for early investors, the timing could be perfect. You might also like: ETH, BNB didn’t get much hype at launch, just like XYZVerse which ranks among the leading cryptos Ethereum continues to climb Ethereum ( ETH ) has seen notable price movements recently. Over the past week, its price increased by 4.99%. In the past month, ETH surged by 51.96%. However, over the past six months, it declined by 21.22%. This mixed performance indicates volatility. ETH’s current price is between $2303.84 and $2715.19, near its 10-day simple moving average of $2683.26 and above the 100-day average of $2560.28. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 55.32 suggests neutral momentum. The MACD of 16.14 indicates a positive short-term trend. These indicators could point toward a potential price increase. The nearest resistance level is at $2932. If ETH breaks this, it could target the second resistance at $3344, an increase of about 24% from the current upper price. On the downside, the nearest support is at $2109, with the second support at $1698. A drop to the nearest support means a decline of around 14% from the current lower price. Traders should watch these levels as ETH navigates the market. Fartcoin surges ahead Fartcoin ( FART ) has experienced a remarkable surge, skyrocketing over 426% in the past six months. In the last month alone, it gained nearly 45%, and this week it jumped more than 25%. Such impressive growth has caught the eye of investors seeking significant returns in the volatile crypto market. Currently trading between $1.19 and $1.50, FART is approaching its nearest resistance level at $1.65. Breaking through this barrier could propel the coin toward the next resistance at $1.96, offering potential gains of around 30%. On the flip side, if the price dips, support levels at $1.01 and $0.69 could provide a cushion against significant losses. Technical indicators suggest that the bullish momentum may continue. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 65.91, indicating there’s still room for upward movement before reaching overbought territory. The Stochastic oscillator at 87.62 supports this positive outlook. Additionally, the MACD level of 0.03608, along with the 10-day simple moving average of $1.60 above the 100-day SMA of $1.36, points to sustained upward momentum. Investors are watching closely to see if Fartcoin can maintain its trajectory and break new ground. Conclusion Traders’ latest predictions highlight XYZ’s potential as a unique memecoin uniting sports fans, aiming for significant growth in the current bull market.

Though DON is fast gaining momentum with its expanding community and forthcoming Binance listing, positioning it to perhaps provide a 20x return by the end of May, SHIB is expected to skyrocket to $0.000060 because of higher burn rates and revived memecoin excitement. This season, both currencies are looking to be significant participants in the meme coin scene. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Poised for a Summer Rally A mainstay in the meme currency scene, Shiba Inu’s expected increase to $0.000060 shows increasing hope among investors. The token’s burn mechanisms meant to lower circulating supply are becoming more active, which may help to raise price by tightening supply. Speculative interest tends to rise throughout such cyclical cycles, hence the larger memecoin frenzy anticipated this summer is also a major consideration. Though the present decline, this forecasted price point indicates a possible rise of more than 300% from today’s price, therefore qualifying SHIB as a solid candidate for near-term gains. $DON Set to 20x by End of May? Meme Coin Breakout Gains Speed Ahead of Binance Listing Inspired by the Salamanca cartel family from the Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul worlds, Salamanca (DON) is a meme currency based on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) with an aim to be a community-driven initiative that provides actual volume and effect. With a 24-hour volume above 1.5 billion tokens, DON is now trading at $0.001436 and has shown significant progress. With a Binance listing expected shortly, the coin is on Gate.io, MEXC, and Pancakeswap, which may help it expand even more. Salamanca (DON) has seen fast price rise since its debut, hitting an all-time high within days and compensating early backers with significant profits. Driven by viral material connected to memes, anime culture, and Salamanca cartel history, the token’s community is growing fast and forming a distinct identity that appeals to enthusiasts. User-generated content increasing DON’s exposure and interaction helps social media traction to be strong. By the end of May, this trend helps to support forecasts of a 20x price rise, thereby distinguishing DON as a meme coin in 2025. $DON to Hit $0.015? Analysts Predict 2000% Surge by June as Binance Listing Looms Salamanca’s price has fluctuated usual for meme currencies but with a rising trend. Though it has just fallen 20.88% from its 24-hour high of $0.001821, the coin is still robust in community interest and volume. By early June, price forecasts point to a possible increase to $0.00335, more than 100% increase from existing levels. Longer-term projections show DON may be $0.015837 by June, a 2000% rise from its present price. Its strategic location on BSC, community involvement, and forthcoming exchange listings—including Binance—support this growth potential. Unlike many meme currencies that depend only on hype, Salamanca (DON) is setting itself apart with a calculated plan and actual trading activity. Though Shiba Inu is predicted to gain from seasonal memecoin excitement, DON’s quick rise and strong community backing imply it may surpass several rivals. The token’s viral appeal, connected to popular culture, and its presence on key exchanges help to shatter conventional meme coin preconceptions, hence placing it among the finest BSC meme currencies for 2025. Gate.io Listing and Binance Prospects The Gate.io listing of Salamanca (DON) has already increased exposure and liquidity, drawing a wide range of traders. The community eagerly awaits the expected Binance listing, which can be a key driver for price rise. Given Binance’s position as the biggest cryptocurrency exchange, such a listing would greatly boost accessibility, trading volume, and institutional interest, thereby possibly pushing DON’s price near the expected 20x increases by the end of May.

He also revealed ongoing talks to bring Ripple’s RLUSD to Cardano’s ecosystem. Hoskinson’s Choice In a recent video on YouTube, Cardano’s founder claimed that such an acquisition would make the crypto space “better. “ Hoskinson also argued that the Coinbase-a16z-Circle “mafia “ has built a self-serving ecosystem. “And if you are outside of it, you get completely blacklisted , and it’s hard to get listed, it’s hard to get liquidity, and it’s hard to get a stablecoin, “ he added. The American thinks a potential deal between Ripple and Circle would break apart that “monopoly “ and create more diversity. Hoskinson believes the company behind the XRP token would serve as a better custodian. The American business magazine Fortune was among the first to report that Ripple and Coinbase are competing to acquire Circle ( the entity issuing the popular stablecoin USDC). According to the coverage, each firm is willing to commit billions of dollars to the deal. Angel investor Paul Barron recently suggested that sources indicate Ripple may have the edge in the potential $9 billion+ settlement. The battle for the stablecoin issuer remained a hot topic over the weekend, with some X users claiming that Ripple submitted an $11 billion bid. Others assumed that the company would make an offer that couldn’t be rejected today (May 26). However, numerous industry participants dismissed this theory, reminding that Monday is a public holiday in the United States, meaning a deal is unlikely to be announced in the following hours. It is important to note that several weeks ago, reports hinted that Ripple made an offer of roughly $4-$5 million to purchase Circle, which the latter supposedly turned down for being too low. Subsequent rumors circulated that the amount was later raised to $20 billion, although this remained unconfirmed. Cardano-Ripple Pact on the Way? Hoskinson also said the Cardano team reached out to their colleagues from Ripple regarding the integration of the stablecoin RLUSD. “We would like to find a path to get RLUSD on Cardano… We would do the integration for free because we like the XRP community, but it’s still an ongoing conversation, “ the American said. The idea of a potential collaboration between Cardano and Ripple has been circulating for quite some time. Towards the end of 2024, the bosses of the two entities, Brad Garlinghouse and Charles Hoskinson, exchanged kind words. Shortly after, the latter hinted that Cardano might integrate Ripple’s stablecoin into its ecosystem. “We’ve already had a call with the RLUSD people. We are actively talking, “ he stated at the time. In April, Ripple shared a video on X focused on the future of tokenization. Interestingly, it opened with a brief glimpse of Cardano’s logo, fueling further speculation that a partnership might be on the horizon. However, nothing has been officially confirmed .

However, its glory days are long gone, and the future of new millionaires minted on-chain lies with Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project, barely in phase 5 of its presale, has already raised over $9.25 million from more than 11,100 unique early adopters. Looking at its socials, the story is even more impressive. While still in the presale phase, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has seen its follower count on X alone grow to over 10K and rising. With a massive support base backing the early presale phase of the project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could easily outshine PEPE in 2025 and beyond. When the presale phase 1 launched, each token was going for $0.01, and once early adopters made an in-depth review of the project’s whitepaper, they quickly bought all those initial tokens. Since then, the price has risen by 200%, but the buy pressure has not let up, owing to the extensive utility that Mutuum Finance will bring to the crypto space. In the upcoming phase 6, the price will rise to $0.035, which makes phase 5 the last opportunity for a 100% return on listing day, when the price will be $0.06. Looking at the leaderboard for the presale, the top wallet address currently holds over $250K worth of MUTM tokens, which signals a massive belief in the project’s future. Many of those in the leaderboard are early PEPE investors seeking out new avenues for massive windfalls. Having proven their ability to spot winning tokens early on, now would also be a good time to stake your future success in the crypto sector on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Massive utility to push Mutuum Finance (MUTM) forward While PEPE is mainly driven by hype and the fusion of online culture and the crypto sector, the rise of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is driven by pure utility. A large part of that utility derives from its innovative lending protocol, which features two modes. The first mode, called peer-to-contract (P2C), allows lenders to deposit their assets into a common lending pool. These assets, which can be $3,500 worth of ETH, for instance, will generate passive income for the holder, whose annual yield rate is determined by the pool’s utilization rate. In the second mode, called the peer-to-peer (P2P) mode, lenders and borrowers interact directly with each via an audited smart contract. They can then settle on terms, and choose cryptocurrency, and the terms are recorded on the smart contract. This mode is designed for low-liquidity assets such as meme coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) pushes even further by introducing price oracles, primarily based on Chainlink’s price feed, which are widely used throughout the crypto world. Additionally, it plans to have backup feeds in case the primary feeds go down, to ensure 100% uptime when it comes to price discovery. Other avenues the team is exploring include aggregate price feeds and market-based pricing in the DeFi pools, when there is sufficient volume. To boost the ecosystem’s overall liquidity, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also plans to launch a stablecoin, whose value will be USD-pegged. Arbitrageurs will dynamically maintain the stablecoin price, creating an avenue for small but steady profits. Giveaway and beta launch To boost adoption of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform, the team has launched a $100K giveaway, which is open to all presale participants. In the presale giveaway, the entry requirement is a $50 purchase of MUTM tokens in the presale. Soon, Mutuum Finance will announce 10 lucky winners, who will each receive a $10K payout in MUTM This initiative will no doubt attract new buyers, which will further speed up the rate at which the presale is completed. Mutuum Finance’s beta version launch on listing day is something else to look forward to. The team decided that they will launch a beta version of the Mutuum Finance platform, giving future users a preview of the features they will get. It also signals the seriousness with which the team is working on the project. The demonstration platform on day one will boost confidence in the Mutuum Finance protocol, which could send the token price parabolic. With so much going on with Mutuum Finance (MUTM), you should consider making the strategic move to be part of one of the most important DeFi ecosystems in 2025.

Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price rose to a new all-time high of $112,000 on May 22, before retracing to change hands above $109,700 at the time of writing on May 26, Cointelegraph data shows. While some attributed the rally to geopolitical developments , including US President Donald Trump’s announcement of Russia–Ukraine ceasefire talks on May 19, macroeconomic factors appear to be playing a larger role, according to market analysts.

Japan 30-year LSEG government bonds yield. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView The 30-year yield on Japanese bonds reached a new all-time high of 3.185% on May 20, 2025, before retreating to 3.115% on May 23, TradingView data shows.

But when yields rise sharply, it often signals investor concerns about fiscal sustainability and repayment risk. Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 250%, compared to Germany’s 62%, yet both countries had 30-year bond yields near 3.1% on May 21, noted The Kobeissi Letter. “Because yields are increasing, sustainability becomes more of an issue, meaning credit risk increases, meaning yields increase even more,” Dragosch said. “And so you end up in this kind of fiscal debt doom loop.” Dragosch said the growing volatility in Japan’s bond market could be prompting some institutional investors to reconsider Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against sovereign default risk. “This is now affecting other bond markets, especially the US Treasury market,” Dragosch added.

This is a rough benchmark of why Bitcoin could be heading toward $200,000,” Dragosch said, adding that this remains conditional on continued Bitcoin accumulation by corporations and exchange-traded fund (ETF) holders.

The US Bureau of Economic Analysis is scheduled to release the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data on Friday at around 11 AM ET. Analysts expect the headline PCE index to ease slightly to 2.2%, down from 2.3% in March, with the core PCE, which excludes food and energy, likely to witness little to no change. The Fed could use the data to look for signs of inflation moderation and weigh on interest rate cuts in its June meeting. Fed inflation policy data in focus According to data from the BEA, the Core PCE Price Index dropped to 2.6% in March from 3.0% in February. The metric has averaged 3.24% since 1960, only peaking at 10.22% in February 1975. Monthly forecasts point to a 0.1% increase in PCE, while personal income is expected to rise 0.3%, and personal spending is seen slowing to 0.2%, down sharply from 0.7% in March. The Cleveland Fed’s Nowcast model sees little deviation in core figures, although geopolitical tensions caused by Trump tariffs could cause a slight change in the prediction The outcome of Friday’s PCE report could influence the Federal Reserve ’s next monetary policy steps. A softer print may give Fed Chair Jerome Powell more reason to cut borrowing rates next month, while an uptick could give the central bank more reason to wait. Fed minutes from the last meeting, due Wednesday, may give investors several insights into policymakers’ deliberations, particularly on tariff risks and inflation persistence. The Fed insists that it requires more evidence before considering easing rates. On Friday, President Trump proposed raising tariffs on EU goods to 50%, up from the current 20%. The announcement came as the S&P 500 neared 6,000. The index failed to go past 5,962, although volatility is much lower than levels seen back on April 2, “Liberation Day.” US debt worries amplify yield swings Last week, the House passed a tax-and-spending bill backed by Trump and projected to expand the federal deficit significantly. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the package will add nearly $4 trillion to the federal debt, currently at $36 trillion. Yields on 10-year US Treasury dropped to 4.45% on Friday, retreating from a three-month high of 4.64%. The bond market is closed Monday for Memorial Day, but the focus will return to auctions later this week amid signs of weaker demand for longer-dated maturities. This week’s auctions include $69 billion in two-year notes on Tuesday, $70 billion in five-year notes on Wednesday, and $44 billion in seven-year notes on Thursday. Other economic reports due this week include the Case-Shiller home price index for March on Tuesday and weekly jobless claims on Thursday. Bitcoin recovers after weekend-long stumble In the crypto market, Bitcoin has recovered from a price volatility that started late Friday and ensued over the weekend, briefly falling to $106,000 before rebounding to levels above $109,000. President Trump’s threat to the EU had pushed the largest crypto by market cap down 2% at the close of Friday’s stock market trading session. BTC is now 1.4% up within the 3-day period. The BTC July-to-June volatility spread, which exceeded 2 vols last week, has now compressed to below 1. This could mean holders are bracing for more policy-driven market turbulence and are unsure if the Trump administration will agree with the European bloc before the July 9 deadline.

45120471,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=25285,1748266970,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,Solana: Ngôi Sao Mới Trong Cuộc Chơi Token Hóa Tài Sản Thực?,https://blog.bitfinex.com/education/solana-ngoi-sao-moi-trong-cuoc-choi-token-hoa-tai-san-thuc/,"Việc token hóa tài sản thực (RWAs) – quá trình biến quyền sở hữu các tài sản vật lý hoặc phi vật lý thành các token số – đang có một làn gió mới khi Solana bắt đầu nổi lên như một blockchain tiềm năng cho các ứng dụng RWA. Mặc dù Ethereum từ lâu đã là “ngôi sao sáng” nhờ cơ sở hạ tầng mạnh mẽ, cộng đồng phát triển đông đảo và sự ủng hộ sớm từ các tổ chức lớn như JPMorgan và BlackRock, nhưng những hạn chế về khả năng mở rộng và chi phí cao đã khiến nhiều người tìm kiếm giải pháp thay thế. Solana, với tốc độ giao dịch chóng mặt, phí siêu thấp và hệ sinh thái ngày càng trưởng thành, đã thu hút các dự án như Homebase và Credix – những cái tên cần tương tác tài sản thời gian thực và hiệu quả. Trong khi đó, Liquid Network cũng không chịu kém cạnh khi thu hút các dự án như MikroKapital, USTBL và Blockstream Mining Note, mang đậm triết lý Bitcoin truyền thống. Giữa cuộc đua này, Solana đang định vị mình là một đối thủ đáng gờm, bổ sung cho vai trò lịch sử của Ethereum và cách tiếp cận tập trung vào Bitcoin của Liquid. Tất cả gợi ý rằng tương lai của token hóa tài sản thực sẽ là một thế giới đa chuỗi, nơi mỗi nền tảng đóng góp điểm mạnh riêng. Sự Nổi Lên của Solana Trong Token Hóa RWAs Token hóa tài sản thực (RWAs) là quá trình chuyển đổi quyền sở hữu các tài sản hữu hình (như bất động sản, hàng hóa) hoặc vô hình (như quyền sở hữu trí tuệ) thành các token số trên blockchain. Công nghệ này mang lại nhiều lợi ích, bao gồm quyền sở hữu phân đoạn, khả năng chuyển nhượng toàn cầu và thanh khoản tăng vọt cho các tài sản vốn dĩ khó tiếp cận. Không chỉ vậy, token hóa còn biến tài sản thành chương trình thông minh – tức là có thể tự động hóa việc tuân thủ, chia cổ tức, hay quản trị thông qua hợp đồng thông minh. Các tổ chức tài chính lớn và doanh nghiệp công nghệ tiên phong đã nhanh chóng nắm bắt cơ hội này vì tiềm năng tối ưu hóa quản lý tài sản, giảm phụ thuộc vào trung gian, và mở rộng cơ hội đầu tư. Các nền tảng như Bitfinex Securities thậm chí còn cung cấp cơ hội cho cả nhà phát hành chứng khoán token hóa lẫn nhà đầu tư – giúp họ tiếp cận những khoản đầu tư mà trước đây chỉ dành cho giới elite. Ban đầu, Ethereum là ngôi sao sáng nhất trong lĩnh vực RWA nhờ hệ sinh thái mạnh mẽ và khả năng lập trình linh hoạt. Các tổ chức lớn như BlackRock , JPMorgan và Ngân hàng đầu tư châu Âu đã thử nghiệm token hóa trái phiếu, chứng khoán và tài sản thương mại trên nền tảng này. Tuy nhiên, vấn đề phí cao và tốc độ chậm đã khiến nhiều dự án phải tìm kiếm phương án khác. Đây là lúc Solana bước vào cuộc chơi với tốc độ xử lý siêu nhanh, phí cực thấp và cơ sở hạ tầng ngày càng hoàn thiện. Các dự án như Homebase (bất động sản), Baxus (hàng xa xỉ), và Credix (tín dụng tư nhân) đang tận dụng sức mạnh của Solana để thử nghiệm và mở rộng quy mô token hóa RWAs. Liquid Network, một sidechain của Bitcoin được phát triển bởi Blockstream, mang đến một lựa chọn khác biệt so với Ethereum và Solana. Trong khi Ethereum nổi bật với hệ sinh thái đa dạng và tính linh hoạt của hợp đồng thông minh, Solana thu hút bằng tốc độ và chi phí thấp, thì Liquid lại tập trung vào bảo mật, tối giản và niềm tin vào nguyên tắc gốc của Bitcoin. Liquid ưu tiên tính toán xác định, thực thi hợp đồng minh bạch và giao dịch bảo mật – tất cả đều phù hợp với triết lý Bitcoin ban đầu. Thay vì chạy theo sự phức tạp của DeFi, Liquid tập trung vào các hợp đồng đơn giản, an toàn và dễ kiểm toán. Điều này làm cho nó trở thành lựa chọn lý tưởng cho các ứng dụng tài chính yêu cầu độ tin cậy cao, chẳng hạn như phát hành trái phiếu vi mô ( MikroKapital ), tín phiếu kho bạc Mỹ mã hóa ( USTBL ), hoặc hợp đồng khai thác Bitcoin ( Blockstream Mining Note) . So Sánh Token Hóa RWAs Trên Solana Với Các Blockchain Khác Ba nền tảng này đại diện cho ba chiến lược khác nhau trong việc tích hợp tài chính truyền thống vào blockchain. Ethereum, với hệ sinh thái DeFi phong phú, vẫn là lựa chọn hàng đầu cho các thí điểm RWA lớn. Tuy nhiên, chi phí cao và tốc độ chậm khiến nhiều nhà phát triển chuyển sang Layer 2 hoặc các chuỗi bên thứ ba. Solana, với thiết kế single-shard và token primitives tùy chỉnh, cung cấp một môi trường lý tưởng cho các ứng dụng RWA đòi hỏi tốc độ và tương tác thời gian thực. Các tính năng như token extensions cho phép áp đặt hạn chế chuyển nhượng, tự động hóa lãi suất và tích hợp tuân thủ ngay tại cấp độ token – điều mà Ethereum thường phải dựa vào hợp đồng bên ngoài. Trong khi đó, Liquid Network không cố gắng cạnh tranh về tốc độ hay khả năng lập trình, mà tập trung vào tính bảo mật và đơn giản. Những tính năng như giao dịch bảo mật và hợp đồng tài chính ít rủi ro làm cho nó trở thành lựa chọn hấp dẫn cho các tổ chức yêu cầu kiểm toán chặt chẽ và báo cáo minh bạch. Các Tổ Chức Đang Nghiêng Về Đâu? Hiện tại, các tổ chức lớn vẫn chủ yếu dựa vào Ethereum nhờ tính ổn định và hệ sinh thái tuân thủ pháp lý. Tuy nhiên, Solana đang dần thu hút sự chú ý từ các tổ chức mới và các công ty fintech nhờ khả năng đáp ứng khối lượng lớn và độ trễ thấp. Liquid Network, mặc dù không quá nổi bật trong các tiêu đề lớn, lại rất phù hợp với các thị trường song phương hoặc phát hành token chứng khoán – nơi tính bảo mật và đơn giản được ưu tiên hơn tốc độ hay tính linh hoạt. Ethereum vẫn là lựa chọn mặc định cho các cấu trúc tài sản lớn và phức tạp, trong khi Solana đang chiếm lĩnh tâm trí của các nhà phát triển trẻ với các ứng dụng RWA yêu cầu tốc độ và thay đổi trạng thái thường xuyên. Liquid, dù hoạt động lặng lẽ, vẫn đóng vai trò quan trọng trong các trường hợp đặc thù, nơi tính bảo mật, đơn giản và tương thích với Bitcoin là ưu tiên hàng đầu. Tóm Lại Là: Token hóa tài sản thực (RWAs) đang tiến tới một tương lai đa chuỗi, nơi Ethereum, Solana và Liquid Network đều có vai trò riêng. Ethereum vẫn là ông lớn trong các dự án quy mô lớn và phức tạp. Solana nổi bật với tốc độ và chi phí thấp, phù hợp cho các ứng dụng năng động. Liquid Network, với triết lý Bitcoin truyền thống, là lựa chọn lý tưởng cho các giao dịch bảo mật và đơn giản. Cuộc chơi này không phải là cuộc chiến loại trừ, mà là câu chuyện về sự bổ sung. Mỗi nền tảng sẽ tiếp tục khẳng định vị thế của mình trong thế giới token hóa tài sản thực, tạo nên một hệ sinh thái đa dạng và đầy tiềm năng.

US Speaker of the House Mike Johnson batted away concerns over President Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner, and Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor hinted at another Bitcoin buy. Crypto investor loses $2.6 million in stablecoins in double phishing scam A single victim was scammed two times within three hours , losing a total of $2.6 million in stablecoins. According to data shared on May 26 by crypto compliance firm Cyvers, the victim sent 843,000 worth of USDt ( USDT ), followed by another 1.75 million USDt around three hours later. Cyvers said the scam used a method known as a zero-value transfer , a sophisticated form of onchain phishing. Source: Cyvers Alert Zero-value transfers are an onchain phishing technique that abuses token transfer functions to trick users into sending real funds to attackers. The attackers exploit the token transfer From function to transfer zero tokens from the victim’s wallet to a spoofed address. Since the amount transferred is zero, no signature by the victim’s private key is necessary for onchain inclusion. Consequently, the victims will see the outgoing transaction in their history. The victim may trust this address since it is included in their transaction history, mistaking it as a known or safe recipient. They may then send real funds to the attacker’s address in a future transaction. In one high-profile case, a scammer using a zero-transfer phishing attack managed to steal $20 million worth of USDT before getting blacklisted by the stablecoin’s issuer in the summer of 2023. Speaker Johnson shrugs off Trump crypto dinner concerns US House Speaker Mike Johnson brushed off concerns on President Donald Trump’s dinner for the top holders of his memecoin when speaking to CNN on May 25 and dodged answering whether the attendees should be made public for transparency. “We do not know who was there. The list has not been released. We do not know how much of the money came from outside the country,” CNN’s Jake Tapper told Johnson. “I really have a difficult time imagining that if this was a Democratic president doing the exact same thing, you wouldn't be outraged.” “Look, I don't know anything about the dinner,” Johnson answered, claiming he “was a little busy this past week,” focusing on passing a $1.6 trillion federal budget funding bill. CNN’s Jake Tapper (left) speaking with House Speaker Mike Johnson (right).

He’s expected to spend less time in prison than his original sentence. The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has announced that he will be released from prison four years early, on December 14, 2044. Following the demise of FTX and its intertwined ties with Alameda Research, the hedge fund he oversaw on the side, Bankman-Fried was found guilty on seven charges of deceit and conspiracy. Federal prosecutors convinced the court that Bankman-Fried and his inner circle misappropriated customer funds, funneling them through Alameda to finance lavish lifestyles, political donations, and high-risk trades. The scheme , they said, amounted to an $11 billion fraud, one of the largest in US financial history. SBF gets sentence reduction after prison move At first, Bankman-Fried was kept at the notoriously harsh Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn after his sentencing. While there, he drew criticism for an unexpected interview he gave to conservative journalist Tucker Carlson and for sharing dorm-style lodgings with music billionaire Sean “Diddy” Combs. According to sources familiar with the matter, cited by the Wall Street Journal, the Bureau of Prisons did not sanction the interview, and its release reportedly caught federal authorities off guard. One source claimed Bankman-Fried had used an attorney-client video link to speak with Carlson. Bankman-Fried was later transferred to FCI Terminal Island, a low-security federal facility in San Pedro, California, which houses approximately 850 male inmates. Other FTX executives see early release dates According to CNN, two of Bankman-Fried’s top lieutenants, Ryan Salame and Caroline Ellison, have also seen their prison terms reduced . In May, Salame, a former top executive at FTX, admitted guilt on allegations of criminal fraud and received a seven and a half year sentence from the federal court. His new release date of March 1, 2031, is also one year ahead of the initial projection of April 20, 2032. Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda Research and a witness for the prosecution during Bankman-Fried’s trial, was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty to seven federal counts of fraud and conspiracy. According to the BOP, she is now scheduled for release on July 20, 2026, three months ahead of her prior release date. The Bureau of Prisons calculates release dates by taking into account several factors, including “Good Conduct Time” (GCT), which allows eligible inmates to earn up to 54 days off per year of their sentence. FTX creditors to begin receiving payouts Meanwhile, after years of legal proceedings and bankruptcy restructuring, former FTX customers are slated to begin receiving partial compensation for their lost assets. Beginning May 30, 2025, customers with validated claims will receive distributions through approved service providers BitGo and Kraken. The court-appointed agents have begun notifying eligible users via email to finalize identity verification and select their preferred platform for the payout. When FTX collapsed in November 2022, the platform froze withdrawals, locking billions in user deposits amid revelations of financial mismanagement and intercompany fund transfers between FTX and Alameda. According to the court-approved reorganization plan, creditors with claims exceeding $50,000 will receive 72.5% of their entitled amount in this initial round of payments. The remaining 27.5%, along with any post-petition interest, will be distributed in future phases. Customers are required to log in to the FTX claims portal, complete Know Your Customer (KYC) and tax compliance checks, and confirm their payout method.

Stop-loss orders in Bitcoin trading started as manual risk management in the early 2010s. Now, they have become advanced, automated tools on today’s exchanges. In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades. Setting up advanced BTC trading strategies doesn’t guarantee a successful risk management plan. Monitoring the market regularly helps you understand current conditions. This way, you can avoid strategic mistakes. Stop-loss and take-profit orders in trading were used long before Bitcoin. In traditional financial markets, they were already used as a risk management and profit-securing tool. They help reduce losses and boost revenue by automatically buying or selling an asset when its price reaches a set level. With Bitcoin’s emergence in 2009 and its subsequent trading on exchanges , these advanced trading strategy tools became crucial for dealing with its well-known price volatility. As Bitcoin ( BTC ) gained traction, traders began to use stop-loss and take-profit strategies from forex and stock markets. At first, price monitoring was manual. Then, automated features on crypto platforms changed everything. What are stop-loss and take-profit orders? Stop-loss and take-profit orders are trading strategies that help investors manage risk and secure gains automatically. They’re instructions you set on a trading platform to close a position when certain price levels are reached. They help limit losses in case of significant price drops or lock in profits when a price target is reached. They can be set up to boost gains and cut losses. This helps keep emotions out of trading, which can prevent regrettable mistakes. They also help if you can’t monitor the market constantly. There must be specific conditions for the orders to trigger. Bitcoin trading is very volatile. Its fast price changes and possible system delays can cause orders to trigger at a different price or not trigger at all. This type of trading strategy gives peace of mind to risk-averse investors. Bitcoin stop-loss orders If you don’t want to take risks and preserve your capital, you can use a stop-loss order designed to limit your losses. You can use it for a buy order, setting up a price level below your entry point, or right above it for a sell trade. In case of a price drop, the order is executed automatically at your designated price, preventing further losses. For example, if you buy BTC at $90,000 and set a stop loss at $85,000, your position sells if the price drops to $85,000, capping your loss at $5,000. Bitcoin take-profit orders To lock in some gains, you can use a take-profit order. Set a price level above your entry point, and when the market reaches that level, the trade is executed, giving you the expected gains. For example, if you buy BTC at $90,000 and set a take profit at $95,000, if the price hits $95,000, it sells, securing a $5,000 profit per BTC. Importance of stop loss and take profit for Bitcoin trading Bitcoin’s wild price changes make stop-loss and take-profit orders important. These tools help lower the risk of losses and boost the chance of gains. Remember, setting up these orders doesn’t guarantee they will be executed. Their execution relies on various factors, like market volumes. Why set up a stop loss for Bitcoin Bitcoin’s volatility has gone down over time. Still, it can have big price swings. Without proper Bitcoin trading risk management, traders may face heavy losses. Here are some of the most important reasons why it would be useful to adopt stop-loss orders in your Bitcoin trading strategy. Bitcoin volatility: BTC can still drop 10% in a very short time due to factors such as news, whale moves or market sentiment. On Dec. 5, 2024, for example, BTC suffered a flash crash from $103,853 down to $92,251 before recovering. A stop loss caps your downside trend when a flash crash hits. Without it, you’re gambling on timing the recovery manually. Non-stop market: The Bitcoin market is open 24/7. Setting up a stop loss will prevent losses due to sudden drops while you’re sleeping. Emotions: An emotional state can be a huge game-changer in trading. Emotional investors may panic-sell or panic-buy, triggering significant losses. A stop loss will reduce the risk of making costly emotional mistakes before fear kicks in. Why set up a take-profit order for Bitcoin A Bitcoin trading strategy may include defining price targets and a percentage of gains. Setting up a take profit order for BTC may be necessary as part of an overall trading risk management plan and will help reach the following targets. Locking gains: BTC’s volatility, in both bull and bear markets, can lead to quick spikes and can reverse just as quickly. A take profit ensures you cash out before pullbacks. Greed control: Without a take profit order, traders may be tempted to chase higher highs, which may not occur over the short term. Non-stop market: You can’t just sit and watch the market 24/7. A take-profit order ensures profits in case of a sudden pump while you’re asleep. How to set up BTC stop-loss and take-profit orders Setting up stop-loss and take-profit for Bitcoin trading varies by platform. However, the process is usually similar on most crypto exchanges, like Binance, Coinbase Pro and Kraken. The following step-by-step guide to setting up your BTC stop-loss and take-profit orders should give you a good overview of the process. Step 1: Choose a Bitcoin trading platform This may be the most crucial aspect of your process to set up your advanced BTC trading strategies. Pick a platform that aligns with your needs. Make sure to check the fees, volumes, reputation and security because these features can impact your trading strategy. Step 2: Open a BTC trading position Once you’ve set up your trading account, log in to your platform and navigate to the trading section, and look for the order form. Choose a BTC pair, for example, BTC/USD. Place your buy order (long) or sell order (short). For example, you can place your order to buy 1 BTC at $90,000. Step 3: Set your stop loss for BTC Here’s an example of an order from the Kraken platform. Click on the stop-loss option from the order menu as shown below to set up the tool. Set the stop-loss price by first deciding your risk level, or how much you’re willing to lose in case the Bitcoin price drops significantly. For example, if you bought BTC at $92,500, you can set the stop loss at $87,300, meaning you set your loss at roughly 5.62%. The loss = 92,500 - 87,300 = 5,200 Now, to find the percentage loss: (5,200 / 92,500) * 100 = 5.62% Step 4: Set your take profit for BTC Stay in the same trade interface. Just as above, after you select your BTC pair and buy the relevant BTC amount, click on the take-profit option. Set the take-profit price based on your exit strategy. For example, you want to set it 5% above the entry price, which would be $94,500 if you bought BTC for $90,000. Enter $94,500 as the sell price. When Bitcoin hits this price, it will sell automatically. Step 5: Confirm and monitor your orders Confirm and activate after double-checking the amount and price, then submit. If your notifications are active, you will receive one once the order is triggered. Nothing stops you from monitoring your order status, and you can cancel or amend it if the market conditions change. Best practices for BTC stop-loss placement Traders can limit their potential losses by using stop-loss orders. This helps them protect their capital during volatile market conditions. Therefore, with Bitcoin’s possible daily swings of 5%–10%, it’s safe to base a stop loss on volatility. Volatility: Platforms like TradingView might offer an option called Average True Range (ATR) over 14 days. This lets you set an average range below your entry point. For instance, you can choose a range of $3,000, so if you bought Bitcoin at $90,000, the order will trigger once it goes down to $87,000. Align with support levels: Historically, BTC respects price floors. Setting up a stop below a crucial support level gives some peace of mind. For instance, if you bought Bitcoin at $90,000 and $88,000 is your support level, set a stop-loss order at $87,800, just below the zone to bypass stop-hunting bots. Avoid obvious levels: Whales and bots target batches of stop-loss orders at round numbers ($80,000, $85,000) or chart patterns , triggering orders before price reverses. Moving the stop loss a bit lower, like to $87,800 instead of $88,000, will probably trigger the order more effectively. BTC trailing stop loss A trailing stop-loss order automatically adjusts a stop-loss price as the market price moves in a profitable direction to lock in profits and limit losses by following a trade’s price. It’s designed to keep a fixed distance below (for long positions) or above (for short positions) the current market price. A simple stop loss may miss profits, while a trailing stop locks them. You can set a trailing stop loss at 3%–5% below the peak as the price rises. If you buy BTC at $90,000 and it hits $95,000, the trailing stop loss moves to $93,250. You can adjust manually or automatically if the platform allows. Account for slippage Slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price at which it is executed. This can occur due to market volatility or low liquidity. In case of low liquidity during BTC crashes, execution can skip your stop loss. For instance, $88,000 may fill at $87,500. Widening the stop loss slightly by 0.5%–1% can solve the problem. How to adjust stop-loss and take-profit Bitcoin orders When and how to adjust a stop loss Stop-loss adjustments should be made carefully. This helps protect capital from unexpected market changes and secures profits when possible. It’s often done by adjusting the order to support or resistance levels. Another common strategy is using trailing stop-loss orders. You can use “modify position” or “edit trade” on your platform to adjust them. Tighten the stop loss after a move in your favor. In case BTC’s price rises after entry, you can move the stop loss to reduce risk or lock in profits. If BTC rises after entry, move the stop loss to reduce risk or lock in profit. For example, if BTC bounces from $88,000 to $93,000, you can tighten the stop loss to $90,500, thereby ensuring no loss if it is reversed. Trail the stop loss during a trend. As BTC keeps running upward during a bull market, trailing the stop loss captures more on the upside. A percentage- or ATR-based trail can be used. For instance, with a $90,000 entry, if BTC rallies to $100,000, you can trail the stop loss to $97,200 to lock in $7,200 per coin, which is an 8% profit if it then dips. Widen the stop loss during consolidation , as tight stop losses will get hit in unsettled ranges. For instance, if BTC stalls after the $90,000 entry, you can extend the stop loss from $88,000 to $87,500 to avoid sudden drops below support. Adjust before major events , like US Federal Reserve rate announcements or ETF approvals. These can cause big swings and increase slippage risks. You can tighten the stop loss to 1%–2% if you decide to remain in the trade, or you can widen it to 10% to ride the upward trend. When and how to adjust the take-profit order Take-profit orders can be adjusted to maximize gains, adapting to momentum or resistance. Just like a stop loss, you can modify them on your trading platform by selecting the open trade and choosing the “modify position” or “edit trade” option. Extend the take profit during strong momentum. This is to avoid missing a peak in a bull run. If you see volume spiking or a breakout clearing resistance, you can push the take profit higher. For instance, you buy at $90,000 and set the take profit at $93,000. If BTC hits $92,500 fast, you can adjust the take profit to $95,000 or $97,000 to maximize profits. Take partial profits at key levels. Resistance levels like $85,000 or $90,000 often see BTC reversing. Then you can decide to sell some of your position to grab some gains and let the rest ride. Tighten the take profit near resistance levels. BTC usually stalls at round numbers or past highs. If the price approaches resistance, you can cut the take profit from $90,000 to $88,500, for example. Reset the take profit after a pullback. If you just missed a take profit trade, do not despair, as BTC usually retraces and then runs up again. If you enter the trade at $90,000 and BTC dips to $85,000, you can reset your take profit order to $87,000 or $88,000 for a moderate win. Common mistakes to avoid with BTC orders Bitcoin’s fast-moving market needs a solid trading strategy. Stop-loss and take-profit orders are key tools. However, if they aren’t set up properly, they could do more damage than benefit. Here are some common mistakes traders make with BTC orders and how to get around them. Setting stops too tightly: Placing a stop loss too close to an entry price means it may get hit by an average drop of 2%–3%. Always keep Bitcoin’s high volatility in mind and use volatility and support level metrics. Ignoring slippage: Slippage can occur due to high volatility or low liquidity. Ignoring it may lead to costly mistakes. Especially on leveraged orders, slippage may result in heavy losses, which may affect your risk plans. Widening the stop loss slightly during highly volatile times may help reduce the risk of big losses. Chasing round numbers: Setting a stop loss at a round number is not a good idea. This can attract bots and whales looking to hunt stops or dump orders. Always set it up $100–$500 below or above a round number to avoid being caught in this typical mistake. Forgetting to adjust: Leaving a stop loss at $88,000 and a take profit at $93,000 after BTC pumps to $95,000 means you may miss profits or risk a reversal. Regularly monitoring the BTC price will ensure you’re ahead of the game and can adjust the orders accordingly. Setting platform alerts is also useful. Misjudging market context: Use your judgment following market trends. Setting a tight stop loss before a Fed announcement or a wide take profit in a bearish trend may incur heavy losses. Adjust accordingly while following trends and sentiments. Tighten the orders pre-event and widen them post-event. Aligning a take order with resistance is also a good idea. Not accounting for fees: Large-scale orders may be subject to high fees, which should be accounted for when setting up orders. Always factor fees into targets, as in the long term, it will make a difference. Panic-canceling orders: Emotions can lead to big losses. So, it’s smart to stick to your initial plan. This is especially true for BTC, which often faces flash crashes but can recover quickly. You can use trailing stops to adjust automatically. Avoid these mistakes by planning strategically, staying disciplined and adapting to Bitcoin’s volatile nature. Always test strategies on a demo account before trading live.

The analyst took to X to share his views on $ETH with his 318K followers. Backed by the Elliott Wave Theory on the 4-hour chart, Bluntz believes that $ETH might hit $3.5K before mid-June. The coin is currently trading at around $2.5K. With $BTC hitting a new all-time high last week , the crypto market looks ready for the next move up. And $ETH will almost certainly be one of the biggest beneficiaries. Read on as we break down Ethereum’s technical chart to explain why. We’ll also go over some of the best meme coins you can buy right now to benefit from the potential upcoming surge. $ETH on the Elliott Wave Theory Ethereum’s Wave 1 started in early April, when the token started slowly creeping up from $1.5K to $1.7K. This move was followed by another wave (Wave 2), where the price kept fluctuating close to the new price of $1.7K. Wave 3 was the strongest, as is the case in the Elliott Wave Theory. $ETH soon broke the $1.8K resistance and posted a whopping 50% move to reach $2.7K. Since then, however, it has been in a strong consolidation. As you can see in this chart, $ETH is currently in Wave 4. To be precise, it’s in a consolidation triangle pattern. Once Ethereum breaks out of this triangle at around $2.75K, we might be headed for Wave 5, which could see the price soar up to $3.5K. Alongside Ethereum, Bluntz is also bullish on SPX6900 ($SPX), an Ethereum-based meme coin. Currently trading at $0.9069, $SPX may soon break the $1 mark and head towards $2, as shown in the chart below. Mosesifunanya , a trader with 5.7K followers on CoinMarketCap, also published an $SPX analysis. The trader said that the positive MACD divergence supports a bullish bias, and investors should watch for confirmation above the $0.8921 resistance level. Just like $ETH, $SPX is also in consolidation and awaiting a breakout. The relatively tight Bollinger Band width (31.62%) also suggests decreasing volatility, according to Mosesifunanya. Overall, several technical indicators seem to be screaming bullishness for both $ETH and $SPX. The bullish bias becomes even stronger when you consider that the crypto market has regained its lost momentum in the last two weeks. With major coins in crucial consolidation, the market is in all likelihood gearing up for the next boom. Needless to say, this is the right time to invest. To help you out, we’ve handpicked some of the best altcoins to consider right now. 1. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best Meme Coin to Buy Now for Crypto Trading Advice MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is a new AI agent that combines online chatter and on-chain activity to identify the next big crypto coin . It starts its research on social media platforms like X, where it stirs up engaging, context-aware conversations with the crypto community. This way, $MIND takes the pulse of the broader meme coin market, finding out which coins are currently enjoying the most community buzz. The crypto AI agent then combines real-time trading data, such as volume spikes and early price movements from platforms like CoinMarketCap and DexScreener, to predict the next cryptos to explode with reasonable accuracy. To get access to MIND of Pepe’s real-time crypto investment advice, you’ll have to be a $MIND holder. Luckily for you, the project is currently in presale (having raised $10.4M+ so far). You can still buy each token for just $0.0037515. However, this offer ends in 4 days, as the $MIND presale comes to a close. So, now’s the moment to buy $MIND for the lowest price. 2. Moonpig ($MOONPIG) – Trending Meme Coin Ready to Rocket Further Launched on the Solana blockchain on May 6, Moonpig is among the newest top trending cryptos . With over 1,500% returns in less than a month, Moonpig is yet another example that a well-built combination of humor, crypto, and culture can take the market by storm. Interestingly, Moonpig was launched with no presale whatsoever, which makes its current rally even more praiseworthy. Simply put, it entered the arena and hit a home run without any practice sessions. Despite four-digit gains, $MOONPIG is still relatively young, and with expectations of a new crypto bull run in the air, it could probably shoot up even further. It’s currently trading at just $0.07569 , which makes it one of the best cheap cryptos to buy now . 3. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Themed Meme Coin Today With the broader crypto market expected to be bullish, Bitcoin will undoubtedly be the central attraction. If you want to make the most of $BTC’s historic growth, consider investing in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . $BTCBULL is not only one of the best cryptos to buy now but also the best Bitcoin-inspired meme coin on the market today. That’s because it’s the only one offering real free $BTC airdrops to its token holders. All you have to do to participate in BTC Bull Token’s Bitcoin airdrops is buy and hold $BTCBULL using Best Wallet . Then, every time the king cryptocurrency powers through a new landmark, such as $150K and $200K, you’ll receive your $BTC share directly in your crypto wallet . Additionally, $BTCBULL holders will also benefit from a periodic token supply burns. These will reduce the total supply, thereby increasing $BTCBULL’s demand and hopefully pumping its price. If you’re a Bitcoin maximalist, joining the BTC Bull Token presale is probably the best way to cheer on the ‘digital gold.’ The project has raised over $6.3M in total and the token is selling for $0.00253, though $BTCBULL’s price could surge 230% from the current price throughout 2025. 4. TROLL ($TROLL) – Internet Trolling Has Quite the Fanbase As the name suggests, TROLL is built from the ground up for ‘dank’ internet users who love and support online trolling culture. Frankly speaking, in a world that has been pushing for more sensitivity on all fronts, especially online, meme coins like $TROLL suggest that crypto degens are still very much in support of ‘edgy’ humor. $TROLL launched towards the end of April and has since then jumped over 160%. It’s worth highlighting that this new low-cap coin underwent a slight slump last week, although it is trending again. $TROLL now looks set to push past its all-time high of around $0.040. It’s currently trading at $0.02611 . Are the Best Meme Coins Ready to Party? Given the number of new meme coins that have come out over the past month, it’s fair to say that a new altcoin season is almost here. You can now maximize your potential gains by investing in tokens like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . However, it’s worth mentioning that the crypto market guarantees nothing. It’s highly volatile and unpredictable, which is why you mustn’t jump in with all your money.

The Michael Saylor-led company bagged a fresh stash of BTC, bringing its total Bitcoin stash to 580,250. Strategy Boosts Bitcoin Stack To 580,250 BTC Michael Saylor’s Strategy — formerly MicroStrategy — added 4,020 BTC to its balance sheet from May 19 to May 25, spending over $427.1 million on the digital asset, as per a Monday press release. The latest purchases were made at an average price of $106,237 per coin, with Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high of $111,814 on May 22. The purchase pushes Strategy’s total holdings to 580,250 BTC — now worth over $63 billion based on the current Bitcoin price of around $109,900. For perspective, Strategy now controls nearly 3% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply. The Nasdaq-traded company said that it has now spent a total of $40.61 billion on buying its Bitcoin stack, with each coin priced on average at $69,800. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the purchase was funded through three capital-raising mechanisms: an at-the-market (ATM) offering of its Class A common stock, MSTR, perpetual strike preferred stock, STRK, and the issuance of Series A perpetual strife preferred stock, STRF. Between May 19 and May 25, the company sold 847,000 shares of its common stock (MSTR) for $348.7 million, 678,970 shares of STRK preferred stock for $67.9 million, and 104,423 shares of STRF preferred stock for $10.4 million. The Tysons, Virginia-based firm began stockpiling Bitcoin under the leadership of Executive Chairman Saylor in August 2020. However, Strategy recently encountered a legal hurdle as a California-based investor has accused the company and its executives of violating federal securities laws by making false and misleading statements about its Bitcoin holdings strategy. According to the class-action suit, the defendants failed to disclose that “the anticipated profitability of the company’s Bitcoin-focused investment strategy was overstated.” Strategy indicated that it intends to “vigorously defend” itself against the claims. Meanwhile, smaller companies on the Nasdaq and elsewhere have emulated the Strategy’s aggressive Bitcoin-buying plan, including Metaplanet and Semler Scientific .",Bitcoin|News|Michael Saylor|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|SPONSORED|TRADING|STRK,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-26 13:57:54

Will the ETH Price Mark A New ATH in June 2025? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto markets are heading towards yet another monthly close, which usually generates huge volatility. Although the Bitcoin trading volume has dropped to some extent, the investors continue to remain optimistic about the upcoming action. As a result, the BTC price is primed to maintain a continued ascending trend and eventually reclaim its levels within the discovery phase in a short while from now. On the other hand, Ethereum’s price continues to struggle around $2500, which raises concerns over its probability of forming new highs by the end of Q2 or during the second half of 2025. In a recent update, Strategy has announced a fresh Bitcoin acquisition of over 4000 BTC, holding nearly 580,250 BTC in total. With this, the investors could have become somewhat sure of the next BTC bullish wave. After the latest move, it was pretty sure that the bulls were relaxing ahead of the next price action, but the question is why the Ethereum price is failing to catch up to the trend. The second-largest token is away from its ATH by more than 47% in times when the BTC price has smashed new highs. With this huge disparity between the top two tokens, will the markets be able to revive a strong bullish momentum as they did in 2021? The above comparison chart of Bitcoin and ETH/USD & ETH/BTC shows the ETH price has lost its track. Both the ETH pairs are going hand in hand, suggesting the token is failing weakly against the USD as well as BTC. As the correlation between the top two tokens has dropped significantly since the start of the year, the rise in the BTC price has not been impacting the ETH price rally. Hence, a strong Ethereum bull run may begin once the ETH/BTC triggers a strong rebound and rises above 0.055 BTC. In 2021, the ETH price rallied along with BTC, and they both reached a new ATH at almost the same time, which triggered a strong Altseason. Meanwhile, the current scenario suggests the ETH bulls do not appear to be quite sure of the upcoming trend. As a result, the price has been facing equal pressure from both sides for the past couple of weeks. The ETH price is yet to rise within the bullish range, which is above $2800, and until then, the token could remain within a consolidated zone.",Price Analysis|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-26 13:58:03

Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation. While cryptocurrency airdrops are a legitimate way for projects to gain publicity and users, scammers exploit this hype, draining wallets through fake campaigns. In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams around projects like Hamster Kombat and Wall Street Peepe cost victims millions. According to Chainalysis, the global estimated losses in 2024 from cryptocurrency scams and fraud, which included fake airdrops, amounted to at least $9.9 billion. Spotting red flags is crucial to staying safe from fake airdrops. This article explores key warning signs and practical tips to protect your funds. What are fake airdrops? Airdrops are a common practice of distributing free tokens in the crypto world as part of marketing campaigns, user acquisition efforts, or community-building exercises. Legitimate airdrops reward early takers, increase token visibility, or promote network activity. Getting airdrops requires minimal effort, like signing up, joining a community or holding a specific token. However, the popularity of airdrops has also drawn scammers . They exploit user greed and curiosity by promising free tokens (fake airdrops) in exchange for sensitive actions such as sharing private keys , signing malicious contracts or paying gas fees . Fraudsters may impersonate real projects using spoofed domains or fake social media accounts. These scams often look convincing, and even experienced users can fall victim. This is the reason consistent vigilance is required when you are getting airdrops. Did you know? In 2023, Inferno Drainer helped scammers steal over $80 million through airdrop phishing campaigns. Operating as a “drainer-as-a-service,” it lets affiliates use prebuilt kits to run scam airdrop sites, targeting wallets across several blockchains. Key red flags that expose ‘fake airdrops’ Before you connect for an airdrop, learn to spot the warning signs. These red flags are your first line of defense against losing your crypto or sensitive information to scammers: 1. No official announcement from verified channels What to watch for: A major warning sign of a fake airdrop is the lack of any announcement on the project’s official communication channels. Scammers often use unsolicited direct messages, unofficial Telegram groups or poorly crafted websites mimicking legitimate ones to promote fake airdrops. How to avoid: Always verify the legitimacy of an airdrop by checking the project’s official website, verified X account or official Discord/Telegram channels before clicking any links. If the airdrop isn’t mentioned there, keep away from it. 2. Request for private key or seed phrase What to watch for: A critical red flag of a fake airdrop is a request to “verify” your wallet by providing your private key or seed phrase . These scams deceive users into surrendering complete control of their crypto wallets by posing as eligibility checks. Once shared, scammers can immediately steal all assets. How to avoid : Genuine airdrops never ask for your private key or recovery phrase, which should always remain confidential. If anyone or any website requests these, it is a clear scam. Exit the page immediately. 3. Upfront gas fees or crypto payments What to watch for: A significant warning sign of a fake airdrop is that it requires upfront gas fees or cryptocurrency payments to “unlock” tokens. Scammers often insist you send Ether ( ETH ) or other coins to claim rewards, but after the payment, the promised tokens never materialize, and your funds are lost. How to avoid: Legitimate airdrops are free, typically involving only simple tasks like connecting a wallet or completing minor actions. If an airdrop demands any payment, it is likely to be a scam. Never send funds to unfamiliar addresses. 4. Suspicious URLs or clone sites What to watch for : Fake airdrops frequently employ phishing websites resembling legitimate crypto platforms. These sites aim to deceive users into connecting wallets and signing fraudulent transactions. How to avoid : You need to carefully check a project’s URL before executing any transaction on it. There will likely be subtle differences, such as misspellings, extra characters or alternate domain extensions. Did you know? Some airdrops use retroactive criteria, rewarding users based on past activity. This encourages organic participation before the airdrop announcement, so simply using DApps naturally could make you eligible for future free tokens. 5. Poor grammar and urgent language What to watch for : Many fake airdrops feature poor grammar, spelling errors or aggressive phrases like “Claim Now Or Lose Out!” or “Final Chance For Free Tokens!” These tactics aim to create panic, rushing users into clicking malicious links without careful thought. Sloppy writing and intense urgency are clear signs of a scam. How to avoid : Legitimate crypto projects communicate professionally and clearly. If an airdrop announcement contains errors or uses high-pressure, time-sensitive language, steer clear. 6. Fake social proof or bot comments What to watch for : Scammers frequently use fake airdrop posts filled with fabricated social proof, such as comments like “I just got 500 $XYZ!” or “Totally legit!” These are often posted by bots or fake accounts to create a false sense of trust and encourage participation. They might also use fake or hacked celebrity accounts to disseminate false information regarding airdrops. How to avoid : Avoid trusting social media comments alone to determine an airdrop’s legitimacy. Research the token thoroughly, confirm its presence on reputable platforms, and seek authentic user feedback on forums like Reddit or trusted crypto Discord groups. Genuine projects maintain transparent communities, not just artificial hype. 7. Unknown or nonexistent token projects What to watch for : Certain fake airdrops promote tokens tied to obscure or nonexistent projects, which might lack a white paper , roadmap, official website or verifiable team. Scammers use these fabricated tokens to trick users into connecting wallets or approving transactions that result in stolen funds. How to avoid : Always research a token extensively before participating in an airdrop. Check for a white paper, official website, team credentials and active community presence. If the project lacks basic details or appears suspiciously new with no credible background, it is likely fraudulent. 8. Token approval traps What to watch for : Certain fake airdrops entice users to connect their wallets and grant token spending permissions. These seemingly harmless “approval” requests can allow scammers to freely transfer or drain your tokens without further interaction, exploiting the granted permissions. How to avoid : Exercise caution when approving token transactions, particularly from unfamiliar sources. Avoid authorizing smart contract interactions on untrusted websites. Regularly use tools like revoke cash to check and cancel unnecessary token approvals. 9. Redirects to malicious wallet drainers What to watch for: Some fake airdrop links redirect users to malicious DApps known as wallet drainers . These sites are designed to resemble legitimate claim pages but execute malicious smart contracts once a wallet is connected. By clicking “claim airdrop,” users unknowingly sign transactions that give scammers full access to their funds. How to avoid: Always review transaction pop-ups carefully before signing. Use browser wallets like MetaMask with built-in phishing protection and stay updated on known scam domains. If a site looks unfamiliar or triggers unexpected approvals, disconnect immediately. 10. Unrealistic reward promises What to watch for : Fake airdrops often attract users with unrealistic promises, such as “Instantly claim $2,000 in free tokens!” with no effort required. These offers exploit greed and curiosity, luring users into connecting wallets or signing transactions without proper scrutiny. How to avoid : Be suspicious of extravagant claims. Genuine airdrops usually provide modest rewards and have certain eligibility criteria. If an offer appears too good to be true, it is likely to be fraudulent. Did you know? In 2021, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) gave governance tokens via an airdrop to anyone who had registered a .eth name. Many ENS holders received thousands of dollars just for owning a crypto domain name. Examples of fake airdrops Here are some examples of well-known fake airdrops to help you understand how these fraudulent actions scam unsuspecting victims: Hamster Kombat Hamster Kombat is a Telegram-based tap-to-earn game where players manage a virtual crypto exchange as a hamster CEO. By tapping, completing daily tasks and upgrading, players earn HMSTR coins, which are convertible to tradable tokens. Launched in March 2024, it attracted over 250 million users, but scams targeting players have raised concerns. Malicious actors targeted Hamster Kombat to profit from the tap-to-earn game’s viral popularity. Kaspersky warned users about fake Hamster Kombat airdrops, meant to steal victims’ crypto wallet credentials. Wall Street Pepe Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is an Ethereum -based memecoin that combines meme culture with practical trading utilities. Inspired by the Pepe meme and Wall Street trading, $WEPE provides small traders with unique market insights, strategic analysis and a supportive community. The $WEPE airdrop scam mimicked the legitimate token's website. It lured users with promises of an airdrop and prompted them to connect their digital wallets, inadvertently signing malicious contracts that drained their assets. HEX HEX is a token built on Ethereum to help users capitalize on cryptocurrency market growth through a system that supports coin locking and staking for fixed durations. The fraudulent webpage replicated the official HEX site. The airdrop on this counterfeit site was fake and unrelated to the genuine HEX project or other initiatives. When a crypto wallet was linked to the deceptive site, it activated a malicious contract that enabled the cryptocurrency drainer to steal funds. Sui Sui (SUI) is a layer-1 blockchain and smart-contract platform engineered for speed, privacy and accessibility, featuring a distinctive object-centric data model. When users checked airdrop eligibility on the fraudulent webpage posted by the scammers, they were prompted to link their digital wallets. This action unwittingly signed a malicious contract, enabling the cryptocurrency drainer. Consequently, their funds were automatically transferred to wallets controlled by scammers through seamless, unauthorized transactions. LayerZero The LayerZero airdrop implemented a novel ""proof-of-donation"" claiming system. Instead of distributing $ZRO tokens for free, as typical airdrops do, LayerZero required users to donate $0.10 per token to the Protocol Guild, which supports Ethereum’s core developers. In July 2023, security firm CertiK cautioned users to be careful about fake airdrops being promoted on X by accounts impersonating Layer Zero. When users clicked on the links, they were sent to a website that resembled the official LayerZero website. How crypto airdrops are evolving from freebies to secure community rewards Crypto airdrops are advancing beyond basic token giveaways, adopting more advanced and secure approaches to engage users. Projects increasingly implement activity-based airdrops, rewarding users for contributions like staking , testing apps or engaging in governance. This shift seeks to promote authentic community involvement and prevent exploitative tactics. Novel distribution models such as snapshot-based allocations and retroactive rewards are gaining traction. These approaches enhance transparency and ensure tokens reach active community contributors. Integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning improves fraud detection and strengthens airdrop security by helping detect bots, fake wallets and fraudulent behavior, making airdrops more secure and resistant to exploitation. This transformation reflects the evolution of responsible, effective token distribution practices that align with decentralization and community empowerment goals.

Richminer data shows that smart money is making blood-sucking arbitrage through XRP cloud mining,https://timestabloid.com/dont-speculate-on-cryptocurrencies-richminer-data-shows/,"As XRP breaks through its historical high, a “passive income revolution” is quietly emerging in the cryptocurrency field. As Ripple’s cooperation with global financial institutions deepens, XRP’s long-term value logic becomes clearer, and the evolution of the Richminer platform opens a new window for ordinary investors to participate without technical barriers and low risk – through Richminer’s intelligent configuration of computing power contracts and strategies, the goal of $100,000 in passive income per year has changed from being out of reach to a replicable wealth path. XRP uses Richminer to achieve compound interest on income XRP itself cannot be mined directly, but through cloud mining platforms such as Richminer, users can rent computing power to participate in the mining of Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin, and automatically convert the income into XRP to form a passive income stream. How to start Richminer passive income: Use an email address to create an account, register and get a $15 reward, and the daily income is about $0.6. Maximize profit configuration: Choose RichMiner high-computing power contracts: give priority to renting Bitcoin or Dogecoin mining machines because of their high profit stability; the following potential high returns and flexible investment options. For example, New User Experience Contract (invest 100, potential total profit of 106 in 2 days). For example, Canaan Avalon A15XP (invest 600, potential total profit of 650.82 in 7 days). For example, Bitdeer SealMiner A2 (invest 1,600, potential total profit of 1,897.92 in 14 days). For example, Bitmain Antminer L9 (invest 12,000, potential total profit of 19,140 in 35 days). For example, Antspace HK3 V6 (invest 110,000, potential total profit of 228,250 in 50 days), with an average daily return rate of more than 2.15%. Click richminer.com for more details on mining contracts. Compound interest reinvestment model: The cloud mining income is regularly invested in the purchase of contracts to form a positive cycle of “income → purchase more cloud mining contracts → higher income”. Assuming an investment of $5,400, if the monthly rate of return reaches 45%, the principal plus income can reach about $7,843 after one month. Through compound interest reinvestment, the initial funds can grow rapidly. Through the use of the above strategies, the goal of $100,000 in passive income can be achieved efficiently. RichMiner core advantages Fully automated operation: The platform integrates intelligent AI technology to automatically process mining, optimization and income distribution, and daily income is automatically credited. Sustainable development of green energy: The platform uses renewable energy mines, which are in line with ESG trends and ensure long-term income stability. Multi-currency support and instant withdrawal: Supports mining and settlement of mainstream currencies such as BTC, ETH, XRP, DOGE, etc., with a withdrawal threshold as low as $100, daily processing of user withdrawal requests, and support for multiple protocols such as TRC20/ERC20. Professional team and global service: A team of blockchain experts and IT engineers provides 24/7 technical support. The platform interface supports 8 languages ​​and covers users in 132 countries. Industry-leading security and compliance guarantee Fund security: 95% of user funds are stored in cold wallets, using McAfee® and Cloudflare® encryption technology to prevent hacker attacks. Compliance certification: Holds the UK FCA license and the US MSB compliance certification, funds are entrusted to HSBC Bank, and there has been no security incident record for 3 consecutive years. Summary: XRP cloud mining is reshaping passive income, and daily income compounding is achieved with the help of Richminer’s green energy mining pool. Behind the goal of $100,000 is actually the accurate capture of Richminer trends and AI intelligent management. The future has come, and only the wise can control the craze with reason and anchor their own golden coordinates in the wave of XRP. Will you be the next wise man to control the XRP craze?

Zebec (ZBCN), a payment utility platform on the Solana ( SOL ) network, has risen for nine consecutive days, reaching a record high of $0.0055. It has jumped over 600% from its monthly low, pushing its market cap above $410 million. The ZBCN token rallied as futures open interest surged to a record high. Data shows open interest hit $12.27 million, up from this month’s low of $2.43 million. Most of this activity occurred on Bybit, MEXC, and Gate. Rising open interest is often viewed as a bullish signal, indicating increased liquidity and stronger demand. According to Santiment data, the token’s surge coincided with a spike in social media activity. Social volume for ZBCN rose to a record high of 7 on Monday, up from 1 earlier this month. Its social dominance score also reached an all-time high. Social dominance | Source: Santiment That is a sign that it could be experiencing fear of missing out, or FOMO, among retail traders. This is also shown by the fact that the number of holders has continued rising, reaching an all-time high of 58,776. It had less than 50,000 holders earlier this month.

Zebec Network price analysis ZBCN price chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that ZBCN has gone parabolic in recent sessions. It broke above a key resistance level at $0.002137, the upper boundary of a cup-and-handle pattern, a classic bullish continuation signal. The token has also surpassed the pattern’s target price of $0.0035. However, the risk is that ZBCN has entered extremely overbought territory. The Relative Strength Index is now at 90, while the Stochastic Oscillator and momentum indicators are also at elevated levels. In addition, Zebec’s funding rate has remained negative since May 21, suggesting that investors expect a pullback. As a result, the most likely scenario is a short-term drop, a retest of the cup’s upper boundary, and a potential continuation of the uptrend.

This development increased expectations that a new rally could begin in the markets. According to leading crypto investors and analysts, the upward momentum in Bitcoin price may continue. Investors on prediction platforms like Polymarket are placing strong bets that Bitcoin will surpass $115,000 by the end of May. In the Deribit options market, almost half of the call options in May 30 futures consist of positions that will pay off if BTC stays above $110,000. In December futures, $170,000 stands out as the most popular target. Here are the Evaluations of 9 Experts About Bitcoin: Arthur Hayes (Maelstrom) Former BitMEX CEO and Maelstrom CIO Arthur Hayes predicts that Bitcoin will reach $1 million by 2028. According to Hayes, Trump’s economic policies and global geopolitical tensions will push investors away from US government bonds, and Bitcoin will be the new safe haven for this capital. Geoff Kendrick (Standard Chartered) Kendrick, chief crypto analyst at Standard Chartered, predicts that Bitcoin will reach $120,000 by July. Kendrick points out that investors have pulled $3.6 billion from gold ETFs in the last month and transferred $7.5 billion to Bitcoin ETFs. In addition, BTC ETFs currently hold close to 6% of the total supply. Kendrick says BTC could reach $200,000 by the end of 2025 and $500,000 by the end of 2028. Bernstein Analysts Three analysts from Bernstein stated that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by 2026 as institutional investment accelerates. The analysts said, “Wall Street will be the largest wallet for Bitcoin,” indicating that institutions will dominate the market. Noelle Acheson (Crypto is Macro Now) According to Madrid-based analyst Acheson, Bitcoin is seen as both a “risky asset” and a “safe haven.” This dual perception makes BTC a winner in various economic scenarios. Jay Jacobs (BlackRock) Jay Jacobs, head of BlackRock’s US Equity ETF, also stated that Bitcoin is increasingly acting as a “safe haven.” Emphasizing that BTC is different from technology stocks, Jacobs said that this situation has increased investor interest. Utkarsh Ahuja (Moon Pursuit Capital) Ahuja predicts that Bitcoin could see $120,000 in the first week of June. Stating that Trump’s dollar-weakening policies and the expectation of a rate cut are pushing BTC up, Ahuja said that Trump’s crypto-friendly stance is also positive for the market. Reece Hobson (eToro) Bitcoin could rise to $174,000, eToro Australia’s crypto analyst Hobson said on May 22. According to Hobson, this could just be the start of a new rally. Conclusion: New Highs Coming? Bitcoin has broken through key resistance levels amid Trump’s policies and renewed investor interest. Market players are now asking, “Is this just the beginning?” According to an analysis by 9 different experts, the probability of the BTC price moving higher in the coming months seems quite strong. *This is not investment advice.

His $11 billion FTX collapse sent shockwaves through the digital asset space. Now sentenced to 25 years, some legal twists could see him walking free earlier than expected. Let’s break it down. The $11 Billion FTX Meltdown: What Really Happened? In March 2024, a jury found SBF guilty on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. Prosecutors revealed how he and his close team funneled customer funds from FTX into his trading firm, Alameda Research. The result? A collapse that destroyed trust in crypto markets and left investors in disbelief. It was one of the most damaging events the industry has ever seen. What’s Prison Life Like for SBF? SBF began his prison sentence at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center. The conditions were rough – frequent power outages, staffing shortages, and inadequate vegan meals. His lawyers called the conditions “inhumane.” He was moved to FCI Terminal Island in California – a lower-security prison. The new facility houses around 850 male inmates. How He Could Get Out Earlier Than Expected The Bureau of Prisons has now listed SBF’s expected release as December 14, 2044 – more than four years earlier than his full sentence. Why? Federal inmates can earn up to 54 days off per year for good behavior. Additional credits come from taking part in educational and rehab programs. Plus, time spent in jail before sentencing counts too. Altogether, these could cut his 25-year term down to under 21 years. What Caroline Ellison’s Sentence Tells Us SBF’s former girlfriend and Alameda CEO, Caroline Ellison, also faced charges. She cooperated with authorities and received just a two-year sentence. With reductions, she could be released by May 2026 . It’s worth noting that SBF’s own bail was revoked during trial for leaking Ellison’s personal writings to a journalist – hurting his chances for leniency. Could Trump Really Pardon SBF? SBF reportedly seeking a pardon from President Donald Trump, with his parents lobbying Trump’s circle. Trump has pardoned crypto figures like BitMEX co-founders for violating anti-money laundering laws and Silk Road’s Ross Ulbricht , suggesting a pro-crypto stance. Bankman-Fried lacks the crypto community’s support. His pardon bid is a long shot due to his Democratic ties and limited backing. A Long Battle Ahead Good conduct and credits from welfare programs may cut SBF’s jail time from 25 to 21 years. However, Trump’s pardon bid can be a tough sell. As his legal team struggles, and scant crypto support and Democratic ties, his 25-year sentence is likely to stick, despite Trump’s crypto-friendly pardons.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-26 15:05:38

With the trading volume restricted within a range, the bulls were working hard to maintain a healthy ascending trend. Meanwhile, the SUI price seems to have been failing to gain the investor’s attention as the price levels continue to trade within a range-bound, facing enormous upward pressure. Now the question arises whether the SUI price will drop to the local support and offer a good entry for new investors or repeat the previous pattern and print a huge bullish candle, rising over 20%. Recently, the SUI blockchain experienced a major exploit that drained over $200 million from the markets. Besides, Hyperliquid price broke out of the range and formed a new ATH that dragged SUI price below in the crypto rankings, which has been a major setback. In the times when the price is not displaying a possibility of a breakout, the SUI price is now believed to test the local support before the next price action. The SUI price is stuck within a pivotal range between the resistance zone of $3.73-$3.8 and the support zone of $3.3-$3.23. Currently, the price has dropped to the lower bands of Bollinger, while they have begun to squeeze, which indicates a period of low volatility. However, a squeeze usually results in a breakout and a potential trend reversal. Meanwhile, the price is expected to consolidate a little more to trigger a breakout, and hence, a drop to the support appears to be fast approaching. On the other hand, the CMF and RSI continue to maintain a steep descending trend, which suggests a drop in the rally strength as well as the money flow into the token. This substantiates the bearish claim of plunging to $3.25, which may erase the selling pressure and pave the way for a strong rebound followed by a healthy ascending trend.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|SUI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-26 15:06:24

Trump. In the post, Trump announced plans to establish a U.S. Crypto Reserve that would strategically include assets like XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). McGregor, reflecting on the news, shared his astonishment and raised important questions about blockchain decentralization, saying, “I have learned from the events this week that not all blockchains are decentralized. A lot of people are telling me that BTC and ETH are the only truly decentralized networks. But the U.S. government is going to buy XRP, SOL, and ADA? Give me your thoughts!” I have learned from the events this week that not all blockchains are actually decentralised A lot of people are telling me that BTC and ETH are the only truly decentralised networks But the US government are going to buy XRP, SOL, and ADA? Give me your thoughts! pic.twitter.com/KMjVCSujqO — Conor McGregor (@TheNotoriousMMA) May 26, 2025 Trump’s Bold Crypto Declaration According to the post from Trump, the U.S. administration under his leadership would move forward with the creation of a Crypto Strategic Reserve, a policy initiative designed to position the U.S. as the “Crypto Capital of the World.” Trump emphasized that his Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to include XRP, SOL, and ADA in this reserve, signaling a dramatic policy pivot from what he described as years of “corrupt attacks” by the Biden administration on the digital asset space. This announcement marks one of the most direct endorsements yet by a major political figure of not just Bitcoin or Ethereum — traditionally viewed as the decentralized flag-bearers — but also of alternative Layer 1s like Solana and Cardano, as well as XRP, the token at the heart of Ripple’s cross-border payment infrastructure. Trump’s post stirred immediate reactions across the crypto sphere, prompting traders, investors, and even celebrities like McGregor to weigh in on the implications. McGregor Raises Decentralization Debate Conor McGregor’s comments tapped into one of the most heated and long-standing debates in the crypto community: what does it truly mean for a blockchain to be decentralized? While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are often hailed as the most decentralized networks due to their broad mining or staking bases and lack of centralized governance, assets like XRP, SOL, and ADA have frequently faced criticism from purists who argue their ecosystems rely on more centralized entities, whether it’s Ripple Labs, the Solana Foundation, or the Cardano development teams. McGregor’s post did more than just react to the headlines — it forced a wider audience to grapple with an issue that often remains confined to crypto circles. If the U.S. government, traditionally wary of decentralized currencies undermining sovereign monetary control, is prepared to hold XRP, Solana, and Cardano in national reserves, what does that say about the perceived utility, trust, and institutional acceptance of these blockchains? Strategic Implications for the Crypto Market Trump’s proposed Crypto Reserve has significant strategic implications. First, it signals a formal acknowledgment by a U.S. administration that blockchain assets are not merely speculative tools but strategic resources worthy of state-level stewardship. Including XRP , SOL, and ADA points to a belief in the functional roles these networks play — from XRP’s focus on global remittances to Solana’s high-speed decentralized applications and Cardano’s emphasis on peer-reviewed blockchain governance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Secondly, the political messaging embedded in Trump’s post, which frames the policy as a reversal of the Biden administration’s crypto stance, injects cryptocurrency firmly into the 2024 political arena. For crypto holders and industry players, this could mean greater regulatory clarity, but it also raises questions about partisanship and how future policy could shift with electoral outcomes. McGregor’s Star Power Amplifies the Conversation What makes this story even more captivating is the intersection of crypto, politics, and sports celebrity. Conor McGregor, with his global following and outspoken personality, has the unique ability to elevate niche technical debates to mainstream attention. His honest admission of confusion over decentralization reflects the sentiments of many newcomers to the space — those who see crypto headlines but are trying to understand the deeper mechanics behind the technology. As McGregor invites his audience to reflect on what it means for the U.S. government to buy XRP, SOL, and ADA, he’s pushing a conversation that crypto insiders have been having for years into the broader public eye. Whether his curiosity will turn into active advocacy or investment remains to be seen, but his involvement alone ensures the discussion will reach far beyond crypto Twitter. A New Era for Crypto Policy? The convergence of Trump’s high-stakes political promise and McGregor’s star-powered commentary signals a turning point for crypto’s role in public discourse. If a U.S. Crypto Reserve becomes more than just campaign rhetoric, it could reshape how global markets perceive blockchain assets, not merely as financial instruments but as national strategic assets. For now, one thing is certain: the conversation around which blockchains matter, how decentralized they truly are, and who is willing to hold them at scale has moved well beyond the developer forums and crypto traders. With figures like Trump and McGregor bringing these debates to global audiences, the future of crypto is set to become an even more prominent and hotly contested arena, both on the political stage and in the public imagination.

However, the token has since rebounded, currently trading around $176.24. Despite the volatility, on-chain data reveals that whale investors have accumulated approximately $381 million worth of SOL during this period, signaling strong confidence in the asset's long-term potential. Whale Accumulation Amid Market Turbulence Recent on-chain analyses indicate significant whale activity in the Solana ecosystem. Notably, one whale address acquired 1.777 million SOL, valued at approximately $223 million, and staked the entire amount, demonstrating a long-term investment perspective. Another whale transferred 50,000 SOL from an exchange to a private wallet, a classic sign of accumulation. These moves suggest that large investors are capitalizing on price dips to increase their holdings . This accumulation trend aligns with previous patterns where whales have strategically increased their positions during market downturns, often preceding price recoveries. Such behavior underscores a bullish outlook among major stakeholders, even as the broader market exhibits short-term volatility. Firedancer Upgrade: A Catalyst for Renewed Optimism Looking ahead, the anticipated Firedancer upgrade is poised to enhance Solana's network performance significantly. Developed in collaboration with Jump Crypto, Firedancer aims to introduce a new validator client capable of processing up to one million transactions per second, thereby improving scalability and reliability. The Solana Foundation plans to roll out a ”lite” version of Firedancer before the full release in 2025. This phased approach allows for incremental improvements and testing, ensuring a smooth transition and integration into the existing network infrastructure. The upgrade is particularly timely, given the increasing activity from decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) like Helium and Hivemapper, which demand higher throughput and stability. The successful implementation of Firedancer could restore investor confidence and attract new participants to the Solana ecosystem, potentially driving further price appreciation. Conclusion Despite recent price fluctuations, substantial whale accumulation indicates strong institutional confidence in Solana's future. The upcoming Firedancer upgrade represents a significant milestone that could enhance network capabilities and support the growing demands of decentralized applications. As the ecosystem evolves, these developments may position Solana for renewed growth and stability in the cryptocurrency market.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-26 15:12:12

Bankman-Fried was ultimately sentenced to 25 years behind bars and subsequently ordered to pay a fine of over $11 billion. Federal prison records show that he has also been moved out of New York federal prison after spending nearly two years behind bars in the Big Apple. SBF Transferred Out Of NYC On April 18, Sam Bankman-Fried was transported from Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, NY, to the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City, OK. While no specific reason was given for Bankman-Fried’s transfer, the one-time “king of crypto” had been sent to solitary confinement earlier this month after an unauthorized interview with Tucker Carlson. The FTX founder has been in prison since August 2023, when Judge Lewis Kaplan revoked his bail after he leaked excerpts of his ex-girlfriend Caroline Ellison’s diary to the New York Times, citing potential witness tampering. The former Alameda Research CEO, who was in an on-again, off-again relationship with Bankman-Fried until early 2022, was largely considered the prosecution’s star witness against the crypto kingpin. Bankman-Fried was found guilty on all charges in November of 2023 for orchestrating the massive crypto scheme that saw investors drained of over $8 billion. SBF Associates Face The Music Meanwhile, Ellison was sentenced to two years in federal prison for her role in the crypto exchange’s collapse . FTX co-founder Gary Wang and the exchange’s director of engineering Nishad Singh were both sentenced to time served by Kaplan, effectively avoiding jail time altogether. All three cooperated with the federal government in hopes of getting a lesser sentence and testified against their one-time boss. FTX to Deliver Up to 120% Creditor Payout on May 30 FTX, once a dominant force in the crypto exchange space, collapsed in November 2022 after facing a severe liquidity crisis. In May, FTX Trading Ltd. and the FTX Recovery Trust announced that distributions under the FTX Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization will resume on May 30, 2025. The forthcoming round, known as the Second Distribution, will be made to eligible creditors in the Convenience and Non-Convenience Classes who have completed all required steps, including KYC verification, tax form submission, and onboarding with one of FTX’s designated Distribution Service Providers—BitGo or Kraken.

The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security. The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin . In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack. It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting to take future-proofing crypto . Yes, exchange-traded fund (ETF) risk disclosures tend to be exhaustive by nature. But the fact that quantum computing made the cut (alongside more common concerns like volatility and regulatory shifts) suggests it’s no longer just a hypothetical issue in the eyes of big finance. For investors, this signals two things: first, that Bitcoin isn’t immune to emerging tech threats, and second, that institutional players like BlackRock are actively weighing those risks as they build long-term strategies in crypto . The message is clear: If the industry wants to stay ahead, preparing for a post-quantum world can’t wait. Did you know? As of early 2025, BlackRock manages over $11.6 trillion in assets, making it the largest asset manager globally. To put that in perspective, BlackRock’s assets under management exceed the combined GDP of Germany and France. Bitcoin quantum risk: Is it real? Quantum computers work differently from the laptops and servers we use today. Instead of crunching numbers one at a time, they can process huge numbers of possibilities at once. That makes them incredibly powerful — especially when it comes to cracking codes. Bitcoin’s security relies on two major cryptographic systems: SHA-256 and ECDSA . In plain terms, these are the tools that secure your Bitcoin address and make sure only you can authorize transactions. They’ve worked flawlessly for years, but quantum computers could change that. Here’s the worry: A powerful enough quantum computer might be able to reverse-engineer your private key from your public address , especially during that short window after you’ve broadcast a transaction but before it’s confirmed on the blockchain. If that ever became possible, someone could hijack your transaction and steal your coins. That sounds dramatic, but it’s not an immediate threat. Most researchers agree they’re still at least 10-20 years away from quantum machines that could actually pull this off. The tech just isn’t there yet — not at the scale or stability needed to break Bitcoin’s cryptography. Still, the warning signs are flashing. Roughly a quarter of existing Bitcoin ( BTC ) sits in older wallet formats that could be more vulnerable if quantum leaps happen faster than expected. And even if the timeline is long, the crypto community knows it has to act early. Work is already underway on post-quantum cryptography , which is a security system that could stand up to the next generation of computing. Did you know? Quantum computers can, in theory, solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. For instance, Google’s Sycamore processor completed a specific task in 200 seconds, whereas it would take even the most advanced classical supercomputers approximately 10,000 years to finish. Is Bitcoin safe from quantum computing? While quantum computing still feels like a future problem, the crypto industry is already gearing up for it, and the efforts underway are more serious than most people realize. What Bitcoin’s doing (and not doing yet) Changing the protocol behind a blockchain is never simple; you need broad consensus, careful testing and a long lead time. But that hasn’t stopped developers from floating ideas regarding Bitcoin. One of the most talked-about proposals is something called QRAMP, the Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol. The idea is to push users to move their coins from older, potentially vulnerable wallet formats into addresses protected by newer, quantum-safe algorithms. It would require a hard fork, so it’s no small lift, but it’s a serious plan to future-proof the network before a so-called “Q-Day” sneaks up. Who’s already ahead? Some blockchains aren’t waiting around. Algorand, for example, has already integrated Falcon , a post-quantum digital signature algorithm that’s been officially vetted by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). That means transactions on Algorand are already being backed by encryption that could hold up even if quantum machines go live tomorrow. The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is another big one. It was built from day one with this threat in mind, using XMSS (a hash-based signature scheme) instead of traditional cryptography. It’s not a major player in market cap terms, but it’s one of the most advanced projects in terms of pure security design. Why it’s not easy Of course, none of this is simple to implement. Quantum-safe cryptography often comes with trade-offs. Algorithms like Falcon are compact and efficient, but they still require more computing resources than traditional ones. Moreover, switching everyone — miners, exchanges, wallet apps and individual users — to a new cryptographic standard could be a logistical nightmare unless it’s planned years in advance. Plus, there’s a delicate balance to strike. Move too soon, and you risk breaking things or relying on tech that isn’t battle-tested. Wait too long, and you’re exposed. That’s why many in the space are eyeing a 10-to-20-year window as a rough estimate for when quantum computing becomes a real threat. But even then, nobody wants to be the last to prepare. Bitcoin’s future and quantum computing If there’s one lesson from quantum conversation so far, it’s this: Being early matters. When it comes to tech that could one day rewrite the rules of digital security, waiting around just isn’t an option. So, what does preparation look like? For developers, it starts with testing and integrating quantum-resistant algorithms into existing systems. Some are already experimenting with “hybrid” approaches, using both traditional and post-quantum cryptography side by side, so networks aren’t caught off guard if (or when) Q-Day arrives. For crypto businesses — exchanges, custodians and wallet providers — the job is twofold: Make sure your infrastructure is future-proof, and make sure your users know what’s coming. Education and UX will play a huge role here. Migrating keys and updating protocols isn’t something the average holder can or should do alone. And then there’s the regulatory side — maybe not the most exciting part of crypto, but an absolutely critical one in this context. You are already seeing movement: The NIST finalized several post-quantum cryptographic standards in 2024. That gives the industry a starting point, a common language to build around. But what’s still missing is a clear regulatory push that says, “Here’s how and when this should happen.” Good policy here wouldn’t mean clamping down on innovation — it would mean supporting it. Think: funding open-source research, incentivizing post-quantum upgrades and creating frameworks that help institutions adopt secure standards without killing momentum. Did you know? The US government began preparing for the quantum threat as far back as 2016, and in 2024, the NIST’s move was sparked by growing fears that quantum computers could one day break the encryption protecting everything from Bitcoin to national security infrastructure. A slow burn BlackRock didn’t need to bring up quantum risk in its ETF filing — but it did. And when a company of that size puts it in writing, it turns vague rumors into something much more real. The transition to a quantum-resistant crypto world isn’t going to happen overnight. It’ll be messy, slow and full of tough technical choices. But it has to happen. Finally, waiting until quantum computers are actively breaking SHA-256 in the wild would already be too late.",BlackRock,EN,0,0,ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FORKS,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-26 15:15:00

The White House confirmed that Trump made the decision after a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Trump posted on social media that the EU had been “very difficult to deal with,” and made it clear he’s not happy with how talks have gone so far. On Monday, European stocks opened stronger after sliding on Friday, when Trump’s initial threat rattled investors. But analysts immediately warned that this delay changes nothing fundamental. The risk of a trade war between the world’s two biggest economic blocs is still alive, and markets aren’t convinced this pause means resolution. Trump’s shock approach meets Europe’s slow pushback Ursula von der Leyen posted on X over the weekend, saying the EU was ready to “advance talks swiftly and decisively.” She added, “To reach a good deal, we would need the time until July 9.” An EU official, speaking to CNBC, allegedly said that European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic would meet his American counterparts on Monday to restart the stalled negotiations. Holger Schmieding, Chief Economist at Berenberg, told CNBC’s Europe Early Edition that six weeks isn’t enough to work out the details, but it might be enough to sketch out a broad agreement. “It should be enough to get an agreement like the one between the US and the U.K.,” Holger said, suggesting a potential 10% tariff on all EU imports, minimal retaliation from Europe, and some final sector adjustments handled after July 9. But Holger warned that if Trump raises the rate to 20% or 30%, the EU would be forced to hit back. “The EU would have no choice” but to impose strong countermeasures, he said. Pharmaceutical exports and even services could be targeted. Holger said Trump’s negotiation style is “interesting” and described his approach as trying to shock the other party into submission. He doesn’t think it’ll work here. “The European Union is not a region which can be scared into just throwing in the towel,” Holger said. He reminded viewers that Europe has its own leverage and size. “We do matter in economic terms to the US quite a lot, not just vice versa,” he added. Investors frustrated by uncertainty and lack of clarity Guntram Wolff, Senior Fellow at Bruegel, also spoke to CNBC on Monday. He didn’t mince words. “This uncertainty is bad for business, it’s bad for consumers, and frankly, it’s an unnecessary step in the negotiations,” Guntram said. He pointed to one big problem: nobody really knows what Trump wants. “It’s very unclear what exactly the US President wants,” he said. “That’s the biggest obstacle at this stage.” Guntram said the EU has already made proposals and is waiting for Washington to respond. In comparing strategies, he noted that the U.K. gave in to Trump’s demands easily, while China escalated things to the point where the US eventually backed down. The EU, he said, is trying a middle strategy—neither caving nor provoking. “Europe sort of tries to take a middle path,” he said. He also pointed out that Europe has the capacity to retaliate, especially with its dominance in pharma and services, but has so far chosen not to. “But at the end of the day, that might not be enough now,” he warned. On the investor side, Naeem Aslam, Chief Investment Officer at Zaye Capital Markets, said the delay created a short burst of confidence but not enough to change the overall risk. “Looking ahead, the EU-US trade dance is a high-stakes tango, with July 9 as the next flashpoint,” Naeem wrote in an email to CNBC. He said the EU is offering phased tariff reductions and talks based on “mutual respect,” but Trump’s aggressive tactics could derail everything. Naeem said tech and industrial companies are most at risk and that markets will react sharply to any headline or tweet. “Markets will hang on every tweet and trade talk whisper, with investors betting on whether this delay is a genuine olive branch or just Trump reloading for a bigger tariff showdown,” said Naeem. His advice to investors was simple: “Buckle up; this ride’s far from over.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",News|EU,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-26 15:15:34

Bitcoin ( BTC ) has surged over 1,000% in the last five years, while the Dow Jones has climbed 70% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has rallied 122% in the same period. Strategy stock, on the other hand, has outperformed all these assets after transforming its business model from a purely software company to a Bitcoin holding firm. Its stock has soared nearly 3,000%, growing its market cap from $1 billion in 2020 to $101 billion today. Bitcoin vs Strategy stock vs Dow Jones vs Nasdaq 100 | Source: crypto.news How the Strategy model works Investors interested in Bitcoin today have at least three main options. First, they can take the most straightforward route: buying Bitcoin and storing it on exchanges or in self-custody wallets. Second, they can invest in spot Bitcoin ETFs, which now hold over $131 billion in assets. These ETFs offer direct exposure to Bitcoin but charge a small management fee. Third, there’s Strategy, which has become the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin with over 580,250 BTC on its balance sheet. Investors place a premium on its model, with its current market cap of $101 billion standing at 1.58x the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Strategy has acquired 4,020 BTC for ~$427.1 million at ~$106,237 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 16.8% YTD 2025. As of 5/25/2025, we hodl 580,250 $BTC acquired for ~$40.61 billion at ~$69,979 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF https://t.co/eAd03GIKam — Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 26, 2025 Strategy’s approach has been effective because its net asset value (NAV) premium amplifies Bitcoin price increases. A higher share price, in turn, makes it easier for the company to raise funds and accumulate more Bitcoin. You might also like: Strategy stock continues to stall despite Bitcoin’s surge to record high At the same time, the rising Bitcoin price helps offset share dilution by increasing the firm’s BTC holdings at a faster rate, resulting in higher Bitcoin-per-share for investors. However, fears of further dilution have raised concerns. The company’s plan to raise $84 billion through share sales has put pressure on its stock. While Bitcoin is trading near its all-time high, Strategy stock is down over 12% from its 2025 peak. Bitcoin vs Strategy stock: which is a better buy? Analysts remain bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term outlook. BlackRock predicts BTC could reach $700,000, while Ark Invest sets a more aggressive target of $2.4 million. If either forecast proves accurate, both Bitcoin and Strategy stock would likely deliver strong long-term returns. At BlackRock’s $700,000 target, Bitcoin would gain about 536% from current levels, giving it a market cap of at least $13.9 trillion. Assuming Strategy holds 576,230 BTC at that point, its Bitcoin holdings would be worth $403.36 billion. Applying the historical NAV premium of 1.58x suggests Strategy’s market cap could reach over $637 billion. If Bitcoin’s rally continues and the NAV premium holds, Strategy stock would outperform Bitcoin in relative returns.

In 2028, the DOT price can reach a maximum price of $19.30 with an average of $16.75. The price of Polkadot is predicted to reach a maximum value of $61.24 in 2031. Polkadot (DOT) has shown impressive growth and resilience in a volatile cryptocurrency market, supported by its strong multichain protocol architecture and investor confidence. A major contributor to this success is the Sinai Upgrade on its Acala Network, enhancing functionality and security. With over 32 million transactions validated in October 2024 by the Polkadot Relay Chain, the network demonstrates significant activity and utility. A notable increase in unique wallets further signals growing user adoption and engagement, strengthening Polkadot’s position as a leading blockchain platform. Will DOT reach new heights soon? Let’s get into the Polkadot price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Polkadot Token DOT Price $4.48 (+0.49%) Market Cap $7.08 Billion Trading Volume $200.27 Million Circulating Supply 1.58B DOT All-time High $55.00 Nov 4, 2021 All-time Low $2.69 Aug 19, 2020 24-hour High $4.61 24-hour Low $4.36 Polkadot price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 8.64% 50-Day SMA $4.25 14-Day RSI 48.32 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 73 (Greed) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $4.78 Polkadot price analysis: DOT price shows uptrend amid resistance and support levels Range-Bound Price Action: DOT consolidates between support at $4.36 and resistance at $4.61, awaiting a breakout or breakdown. Stable Above $4.50: DOT holds steady above $4.50, indicating strong buyer support despite market volatility. Tightening Volatility: Intraday volatility decreases, suggesting a potential breakout if buyers sustain momentum. Polkadot’s native token, DOT, is trading at $4.52 as of May 26, 2025. This represents a daily increase of 0.94%, positioning the token upward. DOT’s price performance today exhibits a measured recovery, supported by a low of $4.36 and facing resistance at $4.61. This range highlights a narrow trading band that DOT navigates as traders seek clarity in its directional movement. The token is currently 91.76% below its all-time high of $55.00, set on November 4, 2021, signaling a prolonged period of consolidation and recalibration. Polkadot on daily timeframe: DOT consolidation near resistance as momentum builds The daily chart shows DOT bouncing from its support level at $4.36 to reach resistance at $4.61. The initial price decline was countered by strong buying interest that formed a series of higher lows, providing a firm base for the upward move. Despite intermittent pullbacks, the price has consistently held above $4.50, supported by steady buying interest and moderate volume spikes during periods of upward momentum. Price action continues to be characterized by consolidation near resistance levels, hinting at indecision among traders. DOT/USDT Price Chart (1-day): TradingView The relative strength index (RSI) is approaching overbought conditions, signaling potential for short-term corrections if buyers lose steam. However, the formation of higher lows combined with consolidation near resistance could signal a breakout attempt if momentum holds. Traders closely monitor volume shifts and price reactions to determine the next directional bias. Polkadot on the 4-hour chart: DOT intraday volatility eases as buyers eye a breakout On the 4-hour chart, DOT maintains its upward trend, with price consolidating around $4.52 after testing resistance at $4.61. Strong support at $4.36 has remained intact despite periods of selling pressure, underscoring underlying demand. The token’s price action has been marked by intraday volatility, but recent hours have seen reduced swings as the market consolidates. DOT/USDT Price Chart (4-hour): TradingView Price volatility has decreased since the initial surge, but short-term momentum remains positive as buyers test the upper resistance. Traders are watching closely for a confirmed breakout above $4.61 or a retest of $4.36, which could define the next significant price move. A new short-term high may form if buying pressure persists, driving renewed market optimism. Polkadot technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $4.62 BUY SMA 5 $4.93 SELL SMA 10 $4.78 SELL SMA 21 $4.47 BUY SMA 50 $4.13 BUY SMA 100 $4.42 BUY SMA 200 $4.9 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $4.35 BUY EMA 5 $4.17 BUY EMA 10 $4.07 BUY EMA 21 $4.13 BUY EMA 50 $4.44 BUY EMA 100 $4.95 SELL EMA 200 $5.4 SELL What to expect next? Polkadot’s DOT is poised at a critical juncture, consolidating between $4.36 and $4.61. Traders are closely monitoring this tight range, as a breakout above $4.61 could signal a shift in momentum, potentially driving a short-term price surge. Conversely, a retest of $4.36 support could signal a temporary pullback before another upward attempt. Intraday price compression suggests a breakout could be imminent, provided buyers maintain current momentum. If resistance at $4.61 is breached, DOT could target the next psychological levels. However, a drop below $4.36 would shift focus to the lower support regions. Until a clear breakout or breakdown materializes, expect DOT to continue trading within the current consolidation range. Is Polkadot a good investment? Polkadot’s price consolidation between $4.36 and $4.61 suggests an upcoming decisive move. Its consistent resilience above $4.50 reflects underlying market confidence. However, despite recent bullish momentum, DOT remains significantly below its all-time high of $55.00, indicating potential long-term upside if broader conditions improve. From an investment perspective, Polkadot’s evolving ecosystem and network upgrades position it as a solid project in the blockchain space. However, the current consolidation phase and resistance at $4.61 may limit near-term gains until a confirmed breakout occurs. Traders and investors should watch for clear price direction before making decisions, as a failure to hold $4.36 could trigger further declines. Long-term prospects remain positive, but short-term caution is warranted. Why is Polkadot up today DOT’s modest gain stems from strong buying support near $4.50 and trader anticipation for a breakout above $4.61. The tightening volatility and higher lows indicate growing momentum, encouraging cautious optimism among investors and traders. Will Polkadot recover? Polkadot (DOT) shows signs of recovery with a recent upward trend. If positive market conditions continue, we could see a bullish trend, and Polkadot has the potential to recover.

Polkadot historic price sentiment After spending most of the second half of 2020 trading around $4-$5, the price broke above the previous all-time high of $7 on December 29 and quickly reached the Polkadot price projection of $10. Polkadot price history | Coinmarketcap Polkadot experienced rapid growth, with its price climbing from around $3 in January to an all-time high of approximately $57.50 in May 2021. After the peak, the price declined sharply, falling to around $10 by July before partially recovering to over $40 in November 2021. In 2022, Polkadot price steadily declined, starting the year around $30 and dropping below $10 by mid-year. By the end of 2022, the price stabilized near $5 as bearish market conditions dominated the cryptocurrency space. The price of DOT hovered between $5 and $7 for most of 2023, reflecting a period of consolidation and limited market excitement. In January 2024, Polkadot’s price remained relatively stable, trading around the $5–$6 range. By July 2024, Polkadot showed slight signs of recovery, with its price rising to around $7–$8. This modest uptick was likely driven by increasing market interest. In December 2024, Polkadot showed signs of recovery, with its price climbing to around $10.4. In January 2025, Polkadot peaked at $7.98 but lost momentum towards the end of the month, leading to a trading range of $4.64 – $5.28 in February. In March, 2025, Polkadot (DOT) traded at approximately $4.30. In April 2025, Polkadot (DOT) experienced a gradual downtrend, with its price hovering slightly below the $4 mark amid ongoing market volatility.

Analyst Says This Bullish Signal Will Send it Beyond $4,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-breaks-out-of-7-year-triangle-targets-4-43-as-bullish-momentum-builds/,"XRP, the digital asset powering Ripple’s payments ecosystem, has staged a remarkable breakout, drawing the attention of top crypto analysts and market watchers. Brett, a prominent crypto analyst and trader on X, recently spotlighted this development, emphasizing that XRP has shattered a 7-year symmetrical triangle formation on its long-term chart. According to Brett, this technical breakout signals the beginning of a powerful bullish wave that could propel XRP well beyond the $4 mark, with a near-term target set at $4.43. $XRP Breaks Out of 7-Year Triangle, Targets $4.43 as Bullish Momentum Builds Send it pic.twitter.com/eOcgqjYGDq — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) May 26, 2025 Understanding the 7-Year Triangle Breakout For years, XRP has been trading within a tightly compressed triangle pattern—a technical structure formed by a series of lower highs and higher lows that gradually narrow price action into an apex. This pattern often precedes a major price move once a breakout occurs. Brett’s analysis, shared with his followers, underscores that XRP has now decisively broken through the triangle’s upper resistance, a move that historically signals the start of a strong bullish trend. Such a breakout is significant because it marks the end of a long-term consolidation phase and indicates renewed market momentum. In technical analysis, when a multi-year triangle pattern is resolved to the upside, it often unlocks substantial upside potential, as suppressed price energy is released. Brett projects an initial price target of $4.43 for XRP, a level that represents a major psychological and technical milestone. Factors Fueling Bullish Momentum Several factors are aligning to bolster XRP’s bullish momentum beyond the breakout. First, Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has seen important victories over the past year. Although final settlement details and potential penalties remain pending, the broader market has interpreted these legal wins as a green light for XRP’s broader adoption. Second, Ripple’s expanding global partnerships are strengthening XRP’s use case as a bridge asset for cross-border payments. With financial institutions in Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia integrating Ripple’s technology, demand for XRP’s underlying liquidity is expected to rise. This real-world utility adds fundamental weight to the bullish technical setup, giving traders confidence that the breakout is supported not just by charts but by evolving market dynamics. Charting the Path to $4.43 and Beyond Brett’s $4.43 price target is derived from projecting the measured move of the triangle breakout—a standard method in technical analysis that estimates the likely price gain following the breach of long-standing support or resistance levels. While short-term resistance levels and pullbacks are expected, Brett maintains that the breakout is structurally sound and that XRP is now positioned to reclaim and potentially surpass its previous all-time highs. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Moreover, broader market sentiment is turning increasingly favorable for altcoins like XRP as Bitcoin hovers near its post-halving highs. Historically, when Bitcoin consolidates or slows down after major rallies, capital tends to rotate into altcoins, triggering what traders call an “alt season.” If such conditions materialize, XRP’s breakout could gain even stronger tailwinds , amplifying its upward trajectory toward—and potentially beyond—the $4.43 mark. A Historic Moment for XRP Holders For long-term XRP holders, many of whom have endured years of price suppression, regulatory battles, and skepticism, this breakout marks a potentially historic moment. It reflects not just a technical milestone, but a renewed sense of market confidence in XRP’s future. Brett’s analysis has added fuel to this optimism, offering a clear technical roadmap for where XRP could be headed next. While crypto markets remain notoriously volatile, and no price target is guaranteed, the combination of a 7-year triangle breakout, improving fundamentals, and growing institutional adoption makes XRP one of the most closely watched assets in the current market cycle. As bullish momentum builds , all eyes will be on whether XRP can achieve—and sustain—Brett’s projected $4.43 target, ushering in a new chapter for Ripple’s digital asset.

Here's Why,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-exchange-coinbase-lawsuit-shock-shareholders-filed-a-lawsuit-against-the-company-heres-why/,"US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has come under legal pressure following a class-action lawsuit filed by investors after the company's shares plunged in value. Coinbase Class Action Lawsuit Filed: Shareholders Blame Company for Data Breach and Concealment The lawsuit alleges the company failed to timely disclose the user data breach and concealed from investors the breach of a settlement with a U.K. regulator. In a lawsuit filed in the Pennsylvania Eastern District Court by plaintiff investor Brady Nessler, it was stated that Coinbase shareholders “suffered significant damages and losses.” The lawsuit alleges that Coinbase failed to timely disclose to investors that its UK subsidiary, CB Payments, had breached an agreement it made with the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in 2020. It also highlights that the company only publicly disclosed a serious data breach that occurred in December 2024 on May 15, 2025. According to Coinbase, cyber attackers bribed some employees and stole users' personal data. Following this development, the company's stock value fell by 7.2% to $244. Coinbase estimates that the cost of fixing the breach and potential refunds to customers could be between $180 million and $400 million. The lawsuit names Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and CFO Alesia Haas as individual defendants and seeks damages for losses incurred by investors who purchased Coinbase stock between April 14, 2021, and May 14, 2025. After falling following the disclosure of the data breach, Coinbase shares recovered as of May 23, closing at $263.16. *This is not investment advice.

Chart Outlook: $LINK Faces Resistance at $20, Eyes $36.5 Breakout At press time, the $LINK/$USDT chart suggests the market is attempting a gradual recovery. The token is currently trading at around $15.67. In April, a period of price consolidation, marked as a “cluster” on the chart, triggered a 15% breakout, supported by increased trading volume that indicated a resurgence of buying interest. Technically, the first resistance lies at $20, a psychologically important level previously acting as a zone where sellers regained control. A break above this could push $LINK’s price toward the next resistance range between $25.62 and $26.56. Beyond that, the mid-term price target is between $28.67 and $30.07, coinciding with highs observed in late 2024. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator shows the MACD line currently trending below the trigger line, typically a bearish indicator. However, the histogram is relatively neutral, implying that selling momentum may weaken. If the trend reverses, a bullish crossover could soon follow.

The president accused the school of being overrun by “radicalized lunatics” and said he’s waiting for Harvard to send over lists of international students so the government can figure out which ones shouldn’t be allowed back into the country. The statement came shortly after US District Judge Allison Burroughs, based in Boston, blocked a move by the Department of Homeland Security to cut Harvard off from the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), a federal system that tracks foreign students. That ruling stopped the administration, for now, from stripping the university’s ability to legally enroll non-US students. Judge halts Trump’s ban on foreign students at Harvard Harvard had already filed a lawsuit to stop the action. In the legal complaint, the school said Trump’s administration was targeting around a quarter of its student body, referring to international students who, in their view, are essential to the school’s mission. In a statement posted on X, Harvard said, “Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard.” Judge Burroughs issued the temporary restraining order on Friday, describing the federal attempt to revoke Harvard’s access to SEVP as both rushed and disruptive. The next court hearing is scheduled for May 29 in Boston. In a letter circulated to faculty and staff, Harvard President Alan Garber said, “We condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action,” adding that the decision was retaliation for Harvard’s refusal to give up control of its faculty, curriculum, and enrollment decisions to the government. Garber said, “The revocation continues a series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence.” That didn’t sit well with the White House. Abigail Jackson, the deputy press secretary, released a statement saying, “If only Harvard cared this much about ending the scourge of anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist agitators on their campus, they wouldn’t be in this situation to begin with.” She later criticized the judge’s decision, accusing Burroughs of pursuing a “liberal agenda,” and added, “These unelected judges have no right to stop the Trump Administration from exercising their rightful control over immigration policy and national security policy.” Students at Harvard fear deportation as legal fight unfolds By Friday, the Harvard campus had turned into a strange mix of calm and chaos. Classes were over for the semester, and tents were being set up on the quad for commencement ceremonies. But international students were scrambling. Many of them weren’t even sure if they were allowed to stay in the US or whether they’d be forced to leave immediately. Cormac Savage, a senior from Downpatrick, Northern Ireland, had just six days left before graduating with a degree in government and languages. He told reporters that he accepted a job in Brussels instead of staying in the US because of how uncertain everything had become. “You know that you’re fine if you’re still legally in the United States for the next 90 days,” Cormac said, “but you don’t know that you can come back and finish your degree. You don’t know if you can stay and work in the US if you’re about to graduate.” Rohan Battula, a junior from the UK, said he considered flying home but decided to stay on campus to avoid visa issues. He said, “I was worried if I went home, I wouldn’t get to come back.” His internship in New York starts in June, and the court order gave him some breathing room, but it didn’t remove the risk completely. “It’s surreal to think that even for some period of time you’re unlawfully staying in a country, just because you’ve been to university there,” Rohan said. For a group of international students gathered near the Charles River, relief swept in when they heard about Judge Burroughs’ ruling. But most knew the reprieve was temporary. Until May 29, no one’s certain whether they’re staying or getting kicked out.

The battle between Cosmos (ATOM) and Celestia (TIA) has heated up, each offering unique strengths. This comparison seeks to uncover the potential winner, highlighting which coin seems more poised for a profitable future. Cosmos: Short-Term Gains Amid Long-Term Setbacks Cosmos gained 3.16% over the past month but suffered a 40.60% decline over the last six months. The price action shows a mix of quick recoveries and prolonged downturns, highlighting marked volatility in its performance. The monthly pickup stands in contrast to the extended bearish trend, showing a coin striving to regain momentum while battling significant long-term pressure. Currently, the coin trades between $3.79 and $4.94, with immediate resistance at $5.59 and secondary resistance at $6.74. Strong support is around $3.29 and lower near $2.14. Bearish influence remains as momentum is negative with no strong trend, suggesting traders consider cautious buys near support and exits near resistance. Celestia Price Analysis: Decline History and Bearish Market Levels Celestia experienced a noticeable drop of about 11% over the past month, while the last six months saw a dramatic decline of nearly 67%. The coin's performance has suffered from persistent downward pressure, with losses accumulating steadily in recent periods. The historical trend points to significant weakening, reflecting a market struggling to regain strength over time. The current trading range stands between $2.15 and $3.23. Immediate support appears near $1.61, with resistance around $3.77. Secondary levels are found near $0.53 and $4.84. Bears hold sway at the moment, and no clear trend emerges. Traders might consider shorting at resistance or watching for a strong rebound near support before committing to new positions. Conclusion Both ATOM and TIA present strong investment opportunities. ATOM offers a well-established network with broad support and a proven track record. TIA, while newer, brings innovative features that could drive future growth. Investors might consider ATOM for stability and TIA for potential high rewards. Both cryptocurrencies have unique strengths, making each a viable option depending on investment goals and risk tolerance. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Meanwhile, the total crypto market cap edged 2% higher to $ 3.45 trillion, supported by steady inflows across major assets. Sentiment moderated slightly, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index dipping to 73, retreating from “extreme greed” yet holding firm in “greed” territory, reflecting the resilient bullish undertone across the market. Why is Bitcoin going up? Although Bitcoin faced some profit-taking pressure after hitting an all-time high of $111,800 last Thursday, macroeconomic developments quickly revived upward momentum. On May 25, Bitcoin reclaimed the $109,000 level after US President Donald Trump announced a delay in the implementation of tariffs on European Union goods. The move, which followed a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, eased investor concerns about an imminent escalation in trade tensions. Trump’s earlier threats of a 50% tariff had weighed on risk assets, briefly sending Bitcoin below $108,000. But with the tariff deadline pushed to July 9, markets breathed a sigh of relief. BTC responded swiftly, rising as much as 3.2% to an intraday high of $110,100 on May 26 from a low of $106,660 the previous day. Market participants said the extension restored confidence in the broader uptrend. Adding fuel to the recovery were growing concerns around Japan’s bond market, where long-term yields surged to record levels. Bitwise’s head of European research, André Dragosch, noted that instability in Japan’s sovereign debt market was prompting some TradFi participants to rotate into Bitcoin as a hedge against sovereign risk and potential default scenarios. The yield on 30-year Japanese government bonds spiked to 3.185% on May 20, an all-time high, before easing slightly. Rising yields often signal market stress and fiscal sustainability concerns, further positioning Bitcoin as a non-correlated, counterparty-free asset during global uncertainty. What’s next for Bitcoin? Bitcoin has now entered a fresh price zone after tagging the $111,800 mark, and while a brief pullback followed, technical indicators suggest the uptrend remains intact. Many analysts on X argued that the retracement toward $106,500 appears orderly, with that zone now acting as strong support, reinforced by the 0.618 Fibonacci level and a cluster of moving averages. This structure fits a classic higher low formation, a bullish continuation signal that could set the stage for another leg upward. Since the swing low at $91,500, Bitcoin has consistently formed higher highs and higher lows, a textbook sign of trend strength. BTC’s close above $109,000 on May 25 marked the seventh consecutive green weekly candle. If the current trend holds, Bitcoin could log an eighth by June 1. Historically, such patterns have led to sustained rallies over the following six to 12 months. “Since 2014, an eight-week streak of green weekly closes has occurred only three times,” noted analyst Carpe Noctom on X. “While the market has historically pulled back the week after, it has always been positive six months and one year later.” Key downside levels to watch include $106,500 as immediate support, followed by $102,500, an area that previously acted as a floor between May 9 and May 19. The psychological $100,000 mark also remains an important pivot should broader markets retrace. Traders also remain focused on whether Bitcoin can maintain momentum above prior highs. According to Micky Bull, Bitcoin needs to close above its January high of $109,000.

A similar tone was echoed by analyst Cas Abbé, who noted that Bitcoin’s ability to recover back near $110,000 after the weekend dip sets the stage for price discovery. Abbé projected $130,000 by July and over $160,000 by Q4, calling such a move “highly likely.” His chart comparison to 2013, 2017, and 2021 suggests BTC may be entering the vertical phase of its bull run.

Altcoin market Over the past 24 hours, the altcoin market cap rose 7% to $1.38 trillion as roughly $100 billion entered the sector. The Altcoin Season Index showed a reading of 28, implying we are still deep into the Bitcoin season, which has a stronghold over the broader crypto market sentiment. Ethereum, the largest altcoin by market cap, was up 1.8% over the day, holding above the $2,500 support level while other large-cap altcoins such as XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) held gains ranging between 1-3%. Among the top 100 altcoins, Jupiter (JUP) led the pack with a 15.28% rise, fueled by investor interest ahead of a major update or milestone that the exchange teased yesterday.

Dogecoin, in particular, is showing strong signs that something bigger may be on the horizon. Large holders have been steadily scooping up DOGE, and the price action over the past day suggests that this accumulation phase might be nearing its payoff. With fresh resistance levels now in the rearview mirror and volume pouring in, Dogecoin is starting to look like it’s getting ready for a run. It’s been here before—building quietly, then sprinting. And this time, the setup feels familiar. Whether you're already in or still on the fence, it’s worth watching closely. The conditions are lining up. Dogecoin Predictions - Whales Load Up on DOGE as Price Breaks Through Key Resistance Dogecoin didn’t just climb a few cents—it moved with intent. Over the last few days, the price has risen considerably, crossing above the $0.22 mark. That alone would’ve been worth noting, but the volume behind it is what really matters. More than 300 million DOGE was traded in back-to-back hours, and that’s not noise—that’s weight. This push wasn’t a one-off. The structure of the chart has been tightening, showing higher lows and steady attempts at breaking through resistance. Support is now firm at $0.225, and the market didn’t hesitate to hold that level during the retest. Each time the price slipped slightly, it was bought right back up. Behind the scenes, whales have been busy. Over a billion DOGE has been picked up by large wallets in just the past month. That kind of behavior doesn’t happen out of boredom. It’s usually a signal that something’s expected—whether that’s a macro shift, an upcoming narrative push, or simply a bet on sentiment returning to meme coins. And then there’s the timing. With markets still shaky from global uncertainty and investors looking for less conventional bets, DOGE has started to attract fresh eyes. It’s showing signs of a bull flag forming—a pattern that often precedes a larger leg up. Some traders are already throwing around price targets north of $0.60 if momentum holds. #Dogecoin Explosive Price Projection💥 $DOGE has been moving nicely within this uptrend structure, fueled by long lasting bull flag channels.The first flag yielded a +90% return, the second +215%, and the third +440%💹This forth flag could potentially take the price of $DOGE … pic.twitter.com/kiomHgwgHR — Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus) May 23, 2025 In real-time, the coin chipped away at the $0.230 barrier multiple times before cracking it with close to 10 million DOGE traded in just a few minutes. It didn’t stall—it surged, briefly—and that tells you the interest is there. Not speculative FOMO, but calculated accumulation. Dogecoin isn’t running on hype this time. It’s moving with buildup, and if this continues, the next leg up might come faster than most expect. This makes it an excellent time to accumulate and create strong positions in other projects with upside potential too—a move that could end up paying off in the coming weeks. Best Meme Coins to Buy Next MIND of Pepe If Dogecoin’s recent accumulation is any indication, meme coins that offer more than just a joke are beginning to separate themselves from the crowd. MIND of Pepe is a solid example of that shift. Rather than using nostalgia or meme culture alone as its selling point, this project leans into utility by deploying AI as a real product layer. MIND of Pepe introduces an AI-driven agent that actively monitors crypto discussions across social media, analyzes sentiment, and presents that data to investors in a simplified form. This AI agent has its own personality, posts on X, and engages with community discussions in real time. That presence isn’t just for show—it provides signals that holders can use to understand which tokens are trending, why they’re moving, and whether the sentiment is building or fading. For traders who rely on narratives, this tool can provide an edge. A 100x crypto is what the crypto education company 99Bitcoins claimed MIND of Pepe could be in one of their dedicated videos on YouTube. The current wave of Dogecoin accumulation shows that sentiment-based bets can gain traction very quickly when conditions are right. In that context, a token that exists to track and interpret sentiment has very real upside potential. MIND of Pepe doesn’t try to be a Dogecoin competitor. It aims to be an intelligence layer for traders navigating meme cycles. With DOGE heating up, that kind of utility might soon shift from niche to necessary. Pepe Priced at $0.00001397, Pepe has had a relatively quiet few weeks after its earlier spike in 2023, but silence doesn’t always mean stagnation. Sometimes, it means loading. And with Dogecoin breaking through resistance and dragging renewed attention back toward top-tier meme tokens, Pepe may find itself back in focus. Pepe doesn’t complicate its pitch. It’s a cultural meme turned tradable token—one that succeeded in getting listed on top exchanges and building a loyal community almost overnight. It proved early on that momentum alone could carry a project far, but sustaining that interest is another challenge altogether. That’s where current market conditions help. With investors looking to rotate into assets that have a history of strong performance and viral appeal, Pepe’s familiarity works in its favor. There’s no AI here, no utility pitch layered on top—but that may be the point. As Dogecoin shows, sometimes meme coins don’t need complex fundamentals to move. They need attention, timing, and volume. Pepe has checked those boxes before and could do so again as meme narratives gain traction. The token sits in a zone where accumulation doesn’t require much capital, but the returns—if history repeats—can be outsized. In short, the market may be nearing another phase where raw meme power resurfaces. Pepe, being one of the most recognized in that category, could find itself rising faster than most anticipate. BTC Bull Dogecoin has always represented a kind of rebellion against traditional finance, and BTC Bull takes that spirit and redirects it toward a very specific goal: pushing Bitcoin adoption through the power of meme coins. But this isn’t just another meme riding on aesthetics. BTC Bull is structured to reward those who actively support Bitcoin’s mission. The project introduces a unique incentive model where users are rewarded with Bitcoin itself through a staking system built around the BTCBULL token. Unlike most meme projects that stop at branding, BTC Bull ties its identity to a larger movement. That focus has helped it gain credibility among those who want to participate in meme culture without detaching from Bitcoin’s long-term thesis. The contract has been audited, the presale is live, and users are already earning staking rewards. But what’s more interesting is the design philosophy. This isn’t a coin that’s trying to mimic Dogecoin’s randomness. It’s aligning itself with the Bitcoin ethos while using meme coin virality as the gateway. That combination could be especially effective now, given the shift toward high-volume speculative assets and the growing interest in Bitcoin-aligned projects. As DOGE’s price continues to signal accumulation, investors looking to diversify within the meme space may gravitate toward projects that echo its values but build something more specific. BTC Bull fits that bill, offering upside potential without straying far from the crypto mainstream. Solaxy With Dogecoin pushing higher and large holders showing renewed interest in speculative yet narrative-driven assets, Solaxy presents an interesting case. While not a meme coin in the traditional sense, it taps into the same investor psychology: low entry cost, bold vision, and the potential to ride larger ecosystems—in this case, both Solana and Ethereum. Solaxy is a Layer 2 chain that enables seamless interaction between Solana and Ethereum-based assets. It offers staking on both chains and has already generated interest for its high APY and low-fee infrastructure. For investors watching the meme coin rally unfold, Solaxy offers exposure to the infrastructure side of the story rather than the tokens themselves. $SOLX is breaking new barriers! 🛸40M Raised! 🔥🚀 pic.twitter.com/tk6mwT5hH1 — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 24, 2025 When meme projects attract large inflows, the chains they run on often see secondary demand. Having raised over $40 million already, Solaxy positions itself at that intersection, building a scalable solution with direct utility for traders, stakers, and future dApps. Its presence on both Ethereum and Solana also acts as a bridge for liquidity—one that could become increasingly valuable if the meme coin sector gets hotter. In the context of Dogecoin's current move, Solaxy offers a different kind of speculative play: not the meme, but the rails. The more attention DOGE gets, the more crowded the markets become, and the more value there is in holding projects that benefit from broader user activity. For those looking to get ahead of that infrastructure demand, Solaxy may deserve a closer look. SUBBD As Dogecoin shows signs of awakening again, the broader meme coin space is back on investor radars—but not all projects rely on memes alone to justify their existence. SUBBD leans on a very different narrative: the monetization of content and the decentralization of the creator economy. Whether you're a YouTuber, podcaster, or niche content producer, SUBBD provides tools to launch memberships, paywalled content, tipping systems, and more—all driven by blockchain rails. This isn’t a copy-paste meme token with a new mascot. It addresses a real problem in Web2: creators being underpaid and overcontrolled by platforms that gatekeep monetization. SUBBD flips that model. With its token ecosystem, it rewards both creators and supporters, making the relationship financially symbiotic. While Dogecoin gains traction through cultural appeal, SUBBD is attracting attention for its model. And in the current market, where attention is currency, projects that tie utility to actual user behavior have room to run. The meme coin wave might be about memes today, but it’s clear that tokens offering real-world use cases could benefit from the same speculative interest. If Dogecoin rallies and the appetite for low-cap, high-utility projects rises alongside it, SUBBD sits in a position where traction can build quickly—especially among creators looking to exit the platform trap. It's not just a meme bet. It's a product bet, and the timing might be just right. Conclusion With altcoins showing fresh signs of momentum, it may not be long before meme coins follow suit. The recent accumulation in Dogecoin suggests that market participants are beginning to rotate capital back into speculative assets—often a signal that sentiment is warming up across the board. While the window is still early, that’s often when positioning matters most. Meme coins tend to move quickly once they catch fire, and given the technical strength and volume building up in select tokens, this could be a smart time to start identifying quality entries.

Table of Contents James Wynn Bitcoin trade spirals into a $60M wipeout What makes James Wynn trader different from the average degen How does leverage trading work? James Wynn Bitcoin trade spirals into a $60M wipeout James Wynn, a well-known high-leverage crypto trader, recently experienced one of the steepest losses of his career. Over the span of seven days, he lost more than $60 million through a series of high-leverage Bitcoin ( BTC ) trades on Hyperliquid ( HYPE ). The sequence began on May 19, when Wynn opened a 40x long position of 5,520 BTC at $103,302, placing his liquidation level at $98,294. On the following day, he expanded the position to 7,764 BTC, raising the notional value to $830 million. His new average entry moved to $105,033, narrowing the buffer between market price and liquidation, now set at $100,330. May 21 saw him increase exposure further to 9,371.71 BTC, pushing the position above the $1 billion threshold. At that point, the trade was in profit, showing unrealized gains of $10.71 million with an average entry of $108,005. Later that day, Wynn closed 2,139 BTC, securing $11.92 million in realized profit and leaving 5,203 BTC still active, valued at $554.6 million. He followed up with a fresh long on May 22, entering 10,200 BTC at $108,065. As Bitcoin touched $111,900, unrealized gains peaked at $39 million. Momentum reversed quickly. On May 23, a 4% drop brought Bitcoin down to $106,700 following President Trump’s announcement of a 50% tariff on European Union imports. Wynn responded by closing a separate Pepecoin ( PEPE ) position on May 24 with a $25.18 million gain. He then raised his Bitcoin long to 11,588 BTC at $108,243, placing his new liquidation level at $105,180. That decision proved costly. On May 25, he exited at $107,746, booking a $13.39 million loss. That same morning, he shifted to a short strategy. On May 25, Wynn scaled his Bitcoin short to 7,967.83 BTC, valued at $856 million, with a liquidation price set at $111,280. JUST IN: James Wynn increases short position on BTC to 7,967.83 BTC ($856 million) at $107,057; liquidation price set at $111,280. pic.twitter.com/ljX0yeGHHv — Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) May 25, 2025 He later exited over $1 billion worth of BTC short positions on May 26, recording a loss of approximately $15.87 million over a 15-hour span. https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1926794028533551106 He also closed his Ethereum ( ETH ) and Sui ( SUI ) longs during the week, taking an additional $5.3 million in losses. The total drawdown over seven days reached $60 million. Wynn acknowledged the setback in a post on May 26, noting that despite the losses, his account still held $25 million in profit from an original base of $3–4 million. The figure marked a sharp drop from his earlier peak of $87 million. What makes James Wynn trader different from the average degen Wynn began gaining traction in the crypto trading world in 2022, during the final phase of the previous bull market. His early entry into the space was reportedly funded by Alameda Research, a firm known at the time for backing emerging crypto traders. That year, he invested $7,000 into the memecoin PEPE when its market cap was just $600,000. As the token’s valuation rose to $4.2 million, Wynn employed high-frequency trading methods to eventually turn his position into $25 million. In March 2025, Wynn began trading on Hyperliquid, starting with a deposit of $4.65 million in USD Coin ( USDC ). Over the following two months, he executed 38 trades on the platform, focusing primarily on Bitcoin and memecoins such as PEPE, Official Trump ( TRUMP ), and Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ). Reports show that as of May 10, Wynn had accumulated $46.5 million in profits from his Hyperliquid trades. His strategy blends high leverage with fast execution and a sensitivity to market sentiment. He typically operates with leverage ranging from 5x to 40x, building positions in fast-moving tokens that exhibit strong momentum. Size is another defining aspect of his method. Trades often carry notional values in the millions, creating significant exposure but also increasing vulnerability. Liquidation thresholds tend to fall within a narrow 2–3% range below the entry price, meaning a minor market drop can result in massive losses within minutes. Wynn also integrates social media into his trading playbook. He regularly shares his positions and real-time updates on X, using transparency to build credibility and influence market psychology. That presence can amplify trends already in motion, adding another layer to his strategy. How does leverage trading work? High-leverage trading allows crypto traders to amplify their positions well beyond their actual capital, creating the possibility of large gains but also sharp, fast losses. Platforms like Hyperliquid, Binance Futures, Bitget, and Bybit, traders provide leverage levels ranging from 5x to 100x, depending on the asset and exchange policies. These tools offer flexibility and capital efficiency, but they also introduce a narrow margin for error that can result in forced liquidations within minutes. The concept of leverage is straightforward. A trader using 10x leverage can open a $10,000 position with only $1,000 in actual capital. The remaining $9,000 is essentially borrowed from the exchange. If the asset’s price rises by 1%, the position gains $100, which is a 10% return on the initial margin. However, the reverse is equally true. A 1% price drop results in a $100 loss, wiping out 10% of the trader’s capital. The critical point is that a 10% move in the wrong direction fully erodes the initial margin, triggering liquidation. With 20x leverage, only a 5% drop is required to wipe out the position. At 50x, the liquidation threshold tightens to around 2%. And at 100x, even a 1% move against the position is enough to result in a complete loss. To better understand how this plays out, consider a scenario. A trader opens a long position of $100,000 on Bitcoin at $50,000 using 20x leverage. They contribute $5,000 in margin. If Bitcoin drops to $47,500, a 5% decline, the trader’s margin is entirely consumed, and the exchange liquidates the position. Exchanges often apply additional buffers, known as maintenance margins, which may trigger liquidation slightly before the full margin is lost to ensure system solvency and protect insurance funds. Most traders using high leverage rely on short-term strategies such as breakout momentum, news-based reactions, or high-volatility scalping. Entry timing is crucial, and exits are often planned with stop-losses or trailing orders. Funding rates — periodic payments between long and short positions on perpetual contracts, also influence decision-making. A positive funding rate means long traders pay shorts, and vice versa. Some traders incorporate these rates into their strategy to earn yield on sideways markets, though this often requires tight trade management and substantial volume. For retail participants, the key lies in understanding these numbers, using margin calculators, and applying strict controls on position size. Tools like liquidation heatmaps and volatility indicators can help assess entry risk, but they cannot eliminate the core exposure that leverage brings. When used cautiously, leverage can support capital-efficient strategies or hedging. When applied without a well-defined risk framework, it becomes a fast track to liquidation. As always, trade wisely and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

45123595,https://timestabloid.com/?p=68571,1748274648,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Analyst Says This Notable XRP History Will Repeat, Shares Three Compelling Charts",https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-this-notable-xrp-history-will-repeat-shares-three-compelling-charts/,"XRP, the digital asset at the heart of Ripple’s cross-border payment innovations, is once again commanding attention on the crypto stage. Steph Is Crypto, a respected crypto analyst and chartist on X, recently set the XRP community abuzz by sharing a series of compelling charts that draw striking parallels between XRP’s current price behavior and its legendary rallies of 2017 and late 2024. According to Steph, XRP is not just poised for another strong move—it is on the verge of repeating history with a parabolic rally that could redefine its market trajectory. #XRP HISTORY WILL REPEAT! pic.twitter.com/fSe419SIBy — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) May 26, 2025 Parallels Between 2017, 2024, and Today In Steph’s detailed chart analysis, XRP’s present-day price structure shows a remarkable resemblance to the patterns observed just before its meteoric rise in 2017, when the asset skyrocketed to all-time highs, and again ahead of its 2024 surge. Both historical phases were marked by a prolonged period of consolidation, growing market skepticism, and a sudden technical breakout that unleashed a wave of aggressive buying. Steph believes the current setup mirrors those conditions almost perfectly, signaling that another explosive rally could soon unfold. One of the core arguments Steph makes is based on the fractal nature of XRP’s charts. Fractals in technical analysis refer to recurring patterns across different timeframes that suggest price history tends to repeat itself under similar conditions. Steph’s three shared charts highlight identical consolidation ranges, breakout points, and momentum signals, reinforcing the thesis that XRP is about to embark on another historic price run . Why This Time Feels Familiar Beyond the visual similarities, several factors on the ground add credibility to Steph’s projection. In 2017, XRP benefited from the broader crypto market’s first mainstream bull run, fueled largely by speculative mania and institutional curiosity. Fast forward to late 2024, and XRP’s surge was shaped by a combination of legal clarity and renewed institutional interest in blockchain-based payment solutions. Today, XRP finds itself at another inflection point. The asset has recently broken out of a multi-year technical triangle, as other analysts like Brett have pointed out, setting the stage for a fresh upside. Meanwhile, Ripple’s global expansion into new payment corridors and central bank digital currency (CBDC) partnerships continues to bolster the asset’s underlying fundamentals. When combined, these conditions replicate the perfect storm that catalyzed XRP’s previous historic rallies —only this time, the foundations appear even stronger. The Psychology of Parabolic Rallies Steph’s analysis taps into a deeper understanding of market psychology. Parabolic rallies, by definition, are driven not just by fundamentals or technical setups, but by the collective behavior of market participants reacting to a sudden surge in momentum. In XRP’s case, past rallies were often amplified by a rapid shift in sentiment, where sidelined investors rushed in as prices began to climb, creating a self-reinforcing loop of buying pressure. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Steph cautions, however, that while history may repeat, timing remains uncertain. Parabolic moves often emerge when the market least expects them, catching even seasoned traders off guard. Still, the conviction behind Steph’s thesis is clear: XRP’s chart patterns, market structure, and broader ecosystem signals are aligning in a way that echoes its most explosive moments in the past. A Defining Moment for XRP’s Future For XRP holders, the prospect of a history-repeating rally is more than just a technical prediction—it represents a potential vindication after years of regulatory challenges, market doubt, and price stagnation. Steph’s analysis, amplified across social media and trading communities, is reigniting optimism that XRP could soon reclaim its place among the top-performing digital assets of the market cycle. While no rally is ever guaranteed, the alignment of historical patterns, current momentum, and strengthening fundamentals makes Steph’s argument compelling. If XRP does indeed follow the script of its past parabolic moves, the coming months could mark a defining chapter in its journey, delivering not only price gains but a renewed sense of purpose for Ripple’s global ambitions. As the crypto market watches closely, one thing is clear: XRP’s past may soon become its prologue, setting the stage for a surge that history—and Steph Is Crypto’s charts—have already mapped out.

Having a vision is easy, but the hard work comes in when developers have to create the code, test it, and then submit it for audit. So far, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has overcome the main hurdles and is now looking forward to launch day. Before that date, the community has been rushing into the platform via the presale, which is now in phase 5. Thus far, they have poured over $9.25 million into the project, with each token going for $0.03 in the current phase. Over 11,100 unique buyers have secured their place in the presale, and over 5% of the tokens in phase have been sold, barely two days after it began. Buyers who found out about the potential of this project early on bought in while the tokens were going for $0.01 in phase 1. Since then, the token price has risen 200% to the current $0.03, and is set to rise 16.67% in the upcoming phase 6 to $0.035 per token. At the current price of $0.03, all buyers are guaranteed a 100% return on listing day, which will be $0.06 per token. However, wise investors have no plans to sell their tokens on listing day. They expect the price to shoot up massively, with conservative estimates placing the increase at $2 per token. On the higher end of the forecast, some analysts expect a price of $5 per token. These zealous forecasts are driven by the recently passed audit of the protocol’s smart contract. With an audit report providing the wind under its wings, even these estimates could be exceeded due to the premium crypto investors place on verifiable trust. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a bastion of utility The past few years have led to an explosion of meme coins with no real utility, which has led to a phenomenon called meme coin fatigue. As such, the massive utility promised by the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) projects comes as a much-awaited relief for investors who have been holding off due to lack of utility. The project’s utility is mainly derived from its lending protocol, which recently passed an audit. Within this lending protocol, there are two distinct modes, which are the peer-to-contract (P2C) and the peer-to-peer (P2P) mode. Within the P2C mode, lenders deposit their funds into lending pools that are backed by audited smart contracts. They can deposit $6,000 worth of ETH, for example, and then sit back as their holdings accrue a percentage annual yield. The rate of the yield will be dynamically set by market forces, based on the pool’s utilization rate. In the second mode, called P2P, lenders and borrowers engage in direct negotiations. In these negotiations, which do not involve any third party, they can decide on the terms of the loan, such as the yield rate, repayment period, and much more. This mode offers lenders an opportunity to get the best rate possible, while borrowers negotiate terms that suit their interests best. The P2P mode is reserved for low-liquidity tokens such as meme coins like PEPE. Having recently passed its audit, the number of lenders who are considering joining Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be quite high. In the crypto space, the main currency of trade is trust, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has 100% trust with its publicly available audit. The team also plans to launch a stablecoin, which will boost liquidity on the platform, solving the issue of liquidity that has plagued DeFi platforms in the past. Unlike other platforms where the stablecoin is backed by siloed vaults of assets, users of this platform will be able to create a multi-asset position to back their stablecoins. This simplified process is expected to be a massive boost to the platform’s liquidity. Further bolstering its position as one of the best DeFi platforms in existence is the planned buy-back and redistribution model. With so many facets for utility, this platform is expected to have numerous sources of revenue. They plan to utilize this revenue to buy back MUTM tokens on the open market and distribute them to their stakers. Besides having a positive impact on the price of the tokens, it will also incentivize new stakers to join the platform and benefit from these distributions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a platform that has successfully passed its audit and plans to launch a beta version of its platform on day one of listing. To position yourself to benefit from this upcoming windfall, getting into the presale now would be your best move.

But the next big winner in crypto isn’t another joke—it’s a game-changing decentralized finance protocol with real utility, massive upside, and unstoppable momentum. That project is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . While Shiba Inu (SHIB)’s rise was impressive, its foundation was built on nothing but hype and tweets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is backed by working technology, real-world financial use cases, a growing base of over 11,000 holders, and a live platform ready to launch. With a presale price of just $0.03 and strong fundamentals, MUTM is already positioned to match and surpass Shiba Inu (SHIB)’s legendary run. SHIB Was Hype—MUTM Is Real Shiba Inu (SHIB) captured headlines by riding a wave of social media buzz. It offered no product, no utility, and no roadmap beyond speculation. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already deep into development, with a beta version of its DeFi platform ready to launch by the time the token goes live. Mutuum Finance (MUTUM) enables anyone to become a lender, borrower, or liquidator through a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol. This isn’t a meme—it’s financial infrastructure. Lenders earn interest by providing liquidity. Borrowers access overcollateralized loans without selling their assets. The system is governed by smart contracts that dynamically adjust interest rates based on supply and demand, optimizing capital efficiency at all times. Why MUTM Will Explode by 7,500% Let’s talk numbers. MUTM is currently priced at $0.03 in Phase 5 of its presale. With a roadmap that includes multi-chain expansion, institutional partnerships, exchange listings, and passive dividend distribution, the path to exponential growth is already set in motion. Just like Shiba Inu (SHIB), early adopters of MUTM stand to gain massively—but this time, it’s not a gamble, it’s a strategic play. With MUTM, the potential returns are staggering: a move from $0.03 to $2.25 would mean a 7,400% gain; even a rise to $1.50 offers 4,900%, and hitting $0.75 still yields a solid 2,400% return. These numbers aren’t projections—they’re milestones waiting to be reached. As more users deposit into the protocol, stake mtTokens, and claim dividends, the demand for MUTM surges. With each phase of the presale, prices increase and supply becomes more limited. Real Utility Creates Real Demand Shiba Inu (SHIB) had no use case other than trading. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers real benefits to its holders. When you deposit assets into Mutuum Finance (MUTUM), you receive mtTokens that grow in value with interest. Those mtTokens can be staked for passive dividends, earned from Mutuum Finance (MUTUM)s revenue as it buys MUTM tokens on the open market and redistributes them. This model creates a continuous demand loop. Borrowers need the platform, lenders earn from the activity, and stakers receive dividends. MUTM isn’t just a token—it’s a revenue engine for its community. Additionally, the flexibility in lending (via P2C and P2P models), unrestricted deposit limits, and dynamic yield generation make the platform accessible to everyone—from casual investors to sophisticated DeFi users. Shiba Inu (SHIB) started with a massive supply that diluted its price, relying on psychological appeal with its low cost per token. Mutuum Finance (MUTUM)’s phased token model offers real scarcity and controlled growth. With clearly defined stages and rising prices, early investors are directly rewarded, and there’s no inflationary dump waiting at the end of the presale. With a low starting market cap, MUTM is perfectly positioned for explosive growth. A $2.25 price point, which delivers 7,500% returns from current levels, would still place it within a modest market cap range in the DeFi space. That’s not only achievable—it’s inevitable. A Platform That’s Already Winning Mutuum Finance (MUTUM)’s roadmap is laser-focused and already executing. The team is currently working on getting its smart contracts audited by CertiK. Once the audit is complete, an official announcement will be made through the project’s social channels. Additionally, the team plans to implement an AI-powered helpdesk as part of the platform’s upcoming features. The $100K giveaway is driving viral growth, and community numbers are climbing daily. By the time the token hits exchanges, users will already be interacting with a live beta platform. That means value will be realized from day one, not years later. No other DeFi project at this price level offers this level of readiness and real-time utility. Shiba Inu (SHIB)’s rise was all about speculation. MUTM’s rise is about strategy and sustainability. Every feature of the protocol is designed to grow usage, increase demand, and reward participation. The more active the ecosystem becomes, the higher the pressure on MUTM’s price—driven not by hype, but by actual on-chain activity. Conclusion: MUTM Is the Next SHIB—But Smarter, Stronger, and Unstoppable Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another crypto. It’s the future of decentralized lending and borrowing. With real utility, a working platform, exponential upside, and a powerful reward system for token holders, MUTM will not only match SHIB’s 7,500% rise—it will build something lasting on top of it. The price is still at $0.03. The beta platform is ready. The roadmap is moving fast. The rewards are just beginning. This is your Shiba Inu (SHIB) moment—but this time, with substance. Don’t wait for the exchanges. Get in now. MUTM is going to $2.25—and beyond.

45123771,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=758623,1748275200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/45123771.jpeg,Avalanche Slides Off The Edge – What Comes After The 4H Trendline Snap?,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/avax/avalanche-after-trendline-snap/,"Avalanche (AVAX) just took a sharp turn as it drops below a key 4-hour trendline, signaling a potential shift in momentum that has traders on high alert. What once looked like a steady climb has suddenly faltered, raising concerns about further downside pressure for the crypto asset if buyers fail to reclaim control. Failure To Reclaim May Trigger New Lows For Avalanche In his recent post, TradingGain noted that “Avalanche breakdown signals a shift in momentum from bullish to bearish,” marking a pivotal moment for the asset. The price has slipped below a key trendline on the 4-hour chart, which had previously provided strong support during the recent uptrend. This breach suggests that selling pressure is beginning to outweigh bullish momentum. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Eyes 30% Rally Amid Cup-And-Handle Pattern Breakout He further pointed out that AVAX is “currently retesting the broken trendline.” This stage is critical, as it often determines whether a breakdown will be confirmed or invalidated. If the bulls manage to push the price back above this level, there could be a chance for a rebound. However, a failure to reclaim the trendline might open the door for a deeper correction toward $21 and below.” This reinforces the need for traders to watch the price action closely in the coming sessions, especially around the retest zone, as it could shape the next major move for Avalanche. Momentum Fades As RSI Weakens Further strengthening the case for a bearish shift, TradingGain also pointed out that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is flashing signs of weakness. The RSI has been steadily declining, reinforcing the idea that momentum is tilting in favor of the bears. This adds another layer of confirmation to the recent trendline break, suggesting that the upward trajectory may be losing steam. He emphasized the importance of closely monitoring price action between $22.8 to $23.0, a previous support region now acting as a potential resistance level. If AVAX fails to reclaim this zone and faces rejection, it could solidify the bearish narrative and open the door for further downside movement. For now, traders should remain cautious and watch how the market reacts around this crucial area. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Overextended—Is A Market Shakeup Imminent? In his concluding remarks, the analyst urged traders to stay alert and avoid rushing into trades. He emphasized the importance of letting the market reveal its direction before making any decisive moves, especially with Avalanche sitting at a key level. At the time of writing, Avalanche is changing hands at approximately $23.74, posting a 6.61% increase in price over the past 24 hours. The upward move is accompanied by a 5.72% rise in trading volume, suggesting a fresh wave of market participation.

In 2026, it will range between $0.5404 and $0.6531, with an average price of $0.5558. In 2030, it will range between $2.21 and $2.73, with an average price of $2.29. Algorand’s capabilities make it an interesting prospect for investors and developers interested in smart contracts and blockchain interoperability. A 2019 video featured Gary Gensler, former Securities and Exchange Commission chair, referring to Algorand as a great technology and using it as an example when discussing the decentralization of cryptocurrencies. Will ALGO go up? Can it reach $10? Where will ALGO be in 5 years? We explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction.

Per our technical indicators, ALGO is neutral, with the fear and greed index showing a greed sentiment among investors. Data analysis shows that activity on decentralized finance applications has stagnated, with the charts showing that it could drop further in the coming days. Recent news: FIFA dumps Algorand for Avalanche Avalanche announced that FIFA will launch a purpose-built blockchain called the FIFA Blockchain. This move comes as the organization dumps Algorand. The network will use Avalanche’s architecture for FIFA’s digital products, beginning with the migration of FIFA Collect, the organization’s official digital collectibles marketplace. Why is ALGO down? ALGO is dropping from previous highs set in the last quarter of 2024, The drop could be attributed to the crypto market’s correction, which saw Bitcoin drop below $99,000. Will ALGO reach $1? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, ALGO will break above $1 in the period ending in 2028. Can Algorand reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $10 in the period ending in 2031. Can Algorand reach $20? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $20 in the period ending in 2031. Can ALGO reach 100 dollars? At $100, Algorand’s market capitalization has to rise above $700 billion from the current $1.2 billion. In comparison, Ethereum’s market capitalization is at $400 billion. Per our price prediction, Algorand is highly unlikely to reach $100. Is there a future for Algorand? Like most mega-altcoins, Algorand is trading at its lowest level this year. A break below 30 RSI will be crucial to sending it to previous highs. Looking ahead, ALGO will register new all-time highs in the coming years. What will Algorand be worth in 2025? For the last month of 2025, ALGO’s price will range between $0.2960 and $0.4313. The average price for the period will be $0.3900. Is ALGO a good investment? Analysis by Intotheblock shows that 97% of holders are at a loss at the current price. The figure will likely drop lower in the short term. However, as our Cryptopolitan price prediction shows, this will change over the long term.

Source: CoinStats Algorand held its token sale in June 2019 at $2.40 each. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to CoinMarketCap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from its ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.64 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. So, in 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.30 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.61 in December. It then corrected into 2025 below the $0.40 mark in January, $0.35 in February, $0.21 in March, and $0.20 in May.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-26 16:00:00

FloppyPepe (FPPE) is gaining global traction for its compelling proposition, including a low entry price of $0.00000035 , strong utility, deflationary mechanics, cultural credibility, and robust security. Dogecoin (DOGE) Breakout Faces Stalling Momentum Despite an analyst’s optimistic chart on X pointing to a bull flag pattern for Dogecoin (DOGE), the asset is showing modest daily growth of just 1.0%, with a seven-day uptick of 7.9%. A breakout candle on the chart closing above $0.24 does hint at returning momentum, but Dogecoin’s (DOGE) sideways movement, while technically bullish, has yet to deliver the explosive gains investors anticipated. Amid this Dogecoin (DOGE) price stall, investors are shifting toward tokens offering more dynamic growth trajectories. Pepe Coin (PEPE) Surges As Investors Gear Up For Potential ATH Pepe coin (PEPE) has seen a 24-hour gain of 8.1%, a 7-day rise of 15.8%, and a staggering 30-day rally of 71.3%. Analysts now suggest a $0.00008 resistance test within two weeks, with eyes set on an ATH beyond $0.0002824 by June. Pepe coin’s (PEPE) recent breakout above key resistance on strong volume supports this sentiment. However, while Dogecoin’s (DOGE) rally slows and Pepe coin’s (PEPE) meteoric rise seems fueled by technicals and market sentiment, a quieter takeover is brewing beneath —and it’s poised to outperform both. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Ignites Investor Interest With Low Entry Barrier And Its Deflationary Model FloppyPepe (FPPE) is quietly assembling a structurally sound and forward-thinking ecosystem. Having raised an impressive $907,200 in just 24 hours during its private round, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) presale has since surpassed $1.9 million. Tokens are still available at a deeply discounted rate of $0.00000035 , with a limited-time 80% bonus, generous referral rewards, and monthly airdrops to amplify early gains. Beyond its attractive profit mechanics, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is grounded in a solid technical and security framework.

According to the Financial Times, this funding will be provided through a $2 billion new capital raise and $1 billion in convertible bonds. TMTG’s strategy is similar to that followed by MicroStrategy, a software company that now has a market value of over $100 billion. MicroStrategy has attracted attention by purchasing billions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin through debt and equity issuance. The company’s secondary stock offering will be conducted at “at-the-market,” or close to the market’s closing price. TMTG shares closed at $25.72 on Friday, giving them a market value of about $6 billion. Related News: Why Are There Still People Who Don't Believe in Bitcoin Despite Its Growth?

Bitcoin experienced a brief decline last Friday after US President Donald Trump proposed 50% tariffs on the EU starting June 1, but today it surpassed $110,000 again during the day. Related News: Trump Wind in Bitcoin (BTC), Etheruem (ETH) and Altcoins: The New Week Started with an Uptrend! At this point, CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr., in his post from the X account, predicted that Bitcoin could reach $162,000 on June 11 with its current growth rate. While the analyst reached his $162,000 estimate for June 11 based on some technical data, he first touched on the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) ratio of short-term Bitcoin holders. Stating that the NUPL ratio is currently at 27 percent, the analyst said that when this ratio exceeds 40 percent, investors tend to sell and selling pressure will begin. “The NUPL ratio is currently 27 percent. According to data from the past 4 years, when this indicator exceeded 40 percent, short-term investors started selling BTC. This created strong price pressure.” At this point, the analyst predicted a new ATH of $162,000 in BTC, noting that given the current bullish trend in NUPL, the rate is expected to reach 40% on June 11. “1. Current NUPL: 27% 2. Critical threshold: 40% (historically, traders start taking profits here, applying downward pressure.) 3. Time to reach threshold: 13 pp / 0.818 pp/day ≈ 16 days 4. Estimated date: June 11, 2025 5. Bitcoin price prediction: $162k.” The analyst finally reminded that historically, when NUPL exceeds 40 percent, profit-taking begins. Stating that with the current growth rate of about 0.82 percent per day, he expects Bitcoin to reach the 40 percent threshold on June 11, the analyst said, “This will correspond to a BTC price of about $ 162,000. Selling pressure begins after $ 162,000.” The current unrealized profit indicator for Short-Term Holders holding coins for 1 to 3 months is 27%. Over the past 4 years, when this metric rose above 40%, the cohort began selling coins – this created strong price pressure. 1.

The increasingly turbulent macroeconomic environment is making companies rethink their investment strategies. However, this may be good for Bitcoin (BTC) , as institutions flee from traditional types of assets. Tracy Jin, COO of the MEXC exchange, told crypto.news that increased institutional interest can potentially push Bitcoin’s price to $140,000. Jin noted that many corporations have pivoted sharply toward integrating Bitcoin into their portfolios. In particular, institutional capital is moving away from U.S. Treasurys, which no longer carry the safe-haven status they once held. “Importantly, this is not a flight from risk — it’s a flight from the old model of risk. Bond yields in the U.S. and Japan are surging, sovereign debt burdens are flashing red, and even the last remaining AAA credit badge is gone. For decades, Treasurys were the safe haven during turbulent times. Today, capital is running from them. Japanese institutions are rethinking their exposure to U.S. bonds, while American investors are watching political tensions creep into Fed policy decisions,” Tracy Jin, MEXC. The flight from bonds was partially due to Moody’s cutting the U.S. credit rating, losing its perfect score. Escalating government debt, trade policy, and pressures are hurting the U.S. dollar’s appeal, especially among investors abroad.

Bitcoin’s price could reach $140,000: Jin In response, Bitcoin ETFs have seen inflows totaling $2.75 billion, much of it driven by institutional demand. If the current uncertainty persists, more investors may increase their Bitcoin exposure. In that case, Jin believes BTC could reach $140,000 as early as this summer. “If corporate finance and institutional momentum persist, Bitcoin is expected to break the $109,500 and $111,000—$112,000 resistance range in the coming weeks and head towards the $140,000 range towards the end of summer.,” Tracy Jin, MEXC. Still, Jin acknowledged that if macro uncertainty weighs too heavily on corporate demand, Bitcoin’s upside could falter. The $100,000 level remains a strong support, and BTC retains its bullish structure unless it breaks below $94,000.

The reason for the volatility caused by Donald Trump’s Truth Social post that highlighted his decision to impose 50% tariffs on the European Union. This sent a chill across the sector. But, to this negative news, market adapted, instead of falling like in Q1, shows the strength in Q2. In the final week of Q2’s second month, the BTC price is consolidating after hitting a new all-time high, while ETH and XRP are holding near key support levels, suggesting bullish forces may still have a chance to reclaim control. Source: santiment When writing, Bitcoin is exchanging hands at $109868 on May 26th, recovered 2.6% from May 23rd’s low of $107278, Ethereum is at $2569, recovered 3.6% from $2525, and XRP is at $2.34, recovered 3.2% from $2.29. While the gains are still minimal, it is still reflects optimism. As the market is not collapsing like in Q1, despite the Trump’s threat. Bitcoin Price (BTC) Bitcoin price reached a new all-time high and declined the next day. However, it found support and recovered slightly the next day. If it continues to recover, and continues to recover and closes above its ATH, it could extend the rally toward a key psychological level of $120,000. However, if BTC faces a pullback and closes below the current swing low around $107K, it could fall to retest its next key support at $100,000. Ethereum Price (ETH) Ethereum price faced rejection from a strong supply level that aligns with early Q1’s high volume profile level. But, ETH price retested and found dynamic support around its 200-day EMA band at around $2,447.82. If the 200-day EMA at $2,447 holds the fall, ETH price could extend the recovery to retest its daily resistance at $2,728. On the other hand, if ETH crypto breaks and closes below the 200-day EMA at $2,447.82, it could extend the decline to reach its next support at $2,000.23.

But while Ethereum’s momentum signals strength, another coin is capturing attention for a different reason: utility. Meet Unilabs, a new AI-powered DeFi project that is offering far more than hype, unlike Dogecoin. It seeks to build an ecosystem where users are incentivized for their hard work and have access to the best crypto investment opportunities. Ethereum predicted to rise to $10,000 The Ethereum price ( ETH ) has been on an uptrend since the beginning of May. Its value is up 49.2% in gains. On the lower timeframes, the Ethereum price has increased by 12.5% on the biweekly level. Interestingly, there has been a massive increase in whale activity in the past month. Crypto Rover notes that BlackRock is one of the top giants that has been accumulating ETH. Looking ahead, the analyst notes that Ethereum might have a hard time soaring to $4,000. However, Crypto Rover said the Ethereum price could easily surge to $10,000 afterward. Ted notes that the Ethereum price chart is a replica of Bitcoin from 2021. Currently, the altcoin price is consolidating inside an asymmetrical triangle and may soon head higher. If this happens, ETH might rise to $10,000 before the end of the year. Dogecoin skyrockets as memecoins wake up Dogecoin’s price ( DOGE ) is showing positive signs on both the weekly and monthly charts. CoinMarketCap data shows its value has jumped by 34.4% on the 2W chart. The memecoin is currently one of the top performers in the market and could see more upside if bulls hold their ground. In the meantime, technical indicators point toward a continued rally. The Hull Moving Average (9) and VWMA (10) indicators flash buy signals which shows that bulls have the upper hand. Also, the relative strength index remains above the midline, supporting a Dogecoin price surge. Badger0102 predicts that over the next few weeks, Dogecoin could jump to $0.47. Another expert, Gnarleyjquinn notes that the memecoin is about to make a big move. He posted a chart that showed the Dogecoin price soaring to $0.60. Another analyst called Rose Premium Signals posted a similar Dogecoin price prediction. They say the value of DOGE could soar to $0.61.

With this, the investor’s interest in the token appears to have waned as the token has not displayed any major price action. Besides, the volume has dropped heavily from the levels above $4 billion to the levels around $2 billion, which substantiates the bearish claim. However, a couple of catalysts are expected to enhance the volatility, which could probably push the price above the accumulated range. Besides a potential XRP ETF, the platform’s stablecoin, RLUSD, is gaining more ground after the US government unveiled the Genius Act to legalize its usage. On the other hand, XRP is slowly challenging the dominance of SWIFT with instant settlement and cheaper transaction fees. In a recent development, the Dubai government has chosen the XRP ledger to power its real estate tokenization project, which aims to digitize $16 billion in property assets by 2033. This is believed to accelerate the mainstream adoption significantly. So what’s in store for the XRP price ahead of the monthly close? As seen in the above chart, the XRP price remains stuck below the descending trend line, which has been pushing the token lower. Meanwhile, the failure of the price to rise above the local resistance at $2.5 has also negatively impacted the rally. After a 6-month-long consolidation, the price seems to have been reconsolidating before marching towards new highs. Reclaiming the 200-day EMA and maintaining a consecutive higher high shows the growing strength of the bulls. However, until the price breaks the trend line and reaches the crucial resistance zone around $2.8 via $2.5 resistance, the accumulation may prevail. The RSI remains glued along the neutral range while the MACD indicates the selling pressure persisting over the rally. However, the levels remain within the positive range that keeps the bullish hopes alive. Therefore, the XRP price is required to break above the $2.5 resistance zone and sustain without facing a rejection, which may pave the way for new highs at $4. Otherwise, the token may continue to extend the horizontal consolidation.",Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|WALLET|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-26 16:14:36

As AI increasingly intersects with various technologies, including blockchain and cryptocurrencies, understanding these terms becomes crucial. To help you make sense of the lingo used in our coverage, we’ve compiled a simple guide to common AI terms . This glossary will be updated regularly as researchers push the boundaries of AI and identify new challenges. Understanding Core AI Concepts: From AGI to LLMs Let’s start with some fundamental concepts that underpin many discussions around artificial intelligence today. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence): This term refers to AI systems that possess cognitive abilities comparable to or exceeding humans across a wide range of tasks. Definitions vary among experts and organizations like OpenAI and Google DeepMind, but the core idea is an AI capable of generalized intelligence, not just specialized skills. AI Agent: An AI agent is a system that leverages AI to perform a series of tasks autonomously on your behalf. Unlike basic chatbots, agents can handle multi-step processes like booking travel, managing expenses, or even writing code, often by coordinating multiple AI models. Chain of Thought: This is a reasoning technique used by large language models (LLMs) where a complex problem is broken down into smaller, intermediate steps. This process mimics human problem-solving, improving the accuracy and reliability of the AI’s output, especially for logic-based tasks. Hallucination: In AI, a hallucination occurs when a model generates incorrect or fabricated information. This is a significant challenge, particularly for general-purpose generative AI models, as it can lead to misleading or potentially harmful outputs. It often stems from gaps in the training data. Inference: This is the process of running a trained AI model to make predictions or draw conclusions from new data. Inference is the ‘application’ phase after training, where the model puts its learned patterns to use. Hardware capabilities significantly impact the speed and efficiency of inference, especially for large models. Large Language Model (LLM): Perhaps the most talked-about term recently, LLM s are deep neural networks trained on vast amounts of text data. Models like GPT, Claude, and Gemini are examples. They learn relationships between words and phrases, enabling them to understand prompts and generate human-like text. When you interact with an AI assistant like ChatGPT, you are interacting with or through an LLM. The Building Blocks: Deep Learning and Neural Networks Much of the recent progress in AI, especially in areas like generative AI, is built upon specific architectural and training methods. Deep Learning: A subset of machine learning, deep learning utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence ‘deep’). This multi-layered structure allows models to automatically identify complex patterns and features in data, improving performance on tasks like image recognition, speech processing, and natural language understanding compared to simpler machine learning methods. Neural Network: A neural network is an algorithmic structure inspired by the human brain’s interconnected neurons. These networks consist of layers of nodes (neurons) that process and transmit information. The rise of powerful hardware like GPUs has made it possible to train networks with many layers, leading to the significant advancements seen in modern AI, including large language models. Training and Refining AI Models Building effective AI models requires specific processes for learning and adaptation. Training: This is the fundamental process where data is fed into a machine learning model to enable it to learn patterns and relationships. Through training, the initially random numerical parameters of a model are adjusted so it can produce desired outputs, whether classifying images or generating text. Rules-based AIs do not require training, but learning systems do. Fine-tuning: After initial training on a broad dataset, fine-tuning involves further training an AI model on a smaller, specialized dataset. This optimizes the model’s performance for a specific task or domain, allowing startups, for instance, to adapt a general LLM for a niche industry application. Transfer Learning: This technique uses a pre-trained AI model as a starting point for developing a new model for a related task. It leverages the knowledge gained during the initial training phase, potentially saving time, computational resources, and data requirements compared to training from scratch. It is often used in conjunction with fine-tuning. Distillation: Distillation is a method to create a smaller, more efficient ‘student’ model based on a larger, more complex ‘teacher’ model. The student model is trained to mimic the teacher’s outputs, resulting in a model that performs similarly but requires less computational power and memory, making it suitable for deployment on less powerful hardware. Weights: Weights are numerical parameters within an AI model that determine the importance given to different features or inputs during processing. They are adjusted during the training process, shaping how the model interprets data and arrives at its output. Effectively, weights encode the patterns learned from the training data. Specialized AI Models and Techniques Beyond the core concepts, several specialized techniques are driving specific types of AI capabilities, particularly in generative AI . Diffusion: Diffusion models are a class of generative AI models that work by progressively adding noise to data (like images or audio) and then learning to reverse this process to generate new data from noise. They are behind many state-of-the-art image, music, and text generation systems. GAN (Generative Adversarial Network): GANs consist of two neural networks, a ‘generator’ and a ‘discriminator’, trained in competition. The generator creates data (e.g., images), and the discriminator tries to distinguish between real data and generated data. This adversarial process drives the generator to produce increasingly realistic outputs, powering applications like deepfakes and realistic synthetic data generation. Navigating the landscape of AI terms can feel daunting, but understanding these key concepts provides a solid foundation for following developments in this transformative field. As AI continues to evolve, so too will the language used to describe it. Stay tuned for updates to this guide as new terms emerge.

The capital raise, which is said to combine an equity raise and convertible bond offering, could be announced at this week's Bitcoin 2025 event held in Las Vegas, according to the report. The news comes as a growing roster of public firms are adding cryptocurrencies, predominantly bitcoin BTC, to their balance sheets, taking a page from Michael Saylor-helmed Strategy's (MSTR) increasingly popular playbook. The software firm has become the world's largest corporate holder of the leading crypto asset, accumulating over $62 billion in BTC in its treasury by financing the purchases via a combination of equity and debt issuances. Trump Media shared plans earlier this year to launch a financial services platform focusing on crypto and customized exchange-traded funds. It also said it wants to partner with crypto exchange Crypto.com to launch the ETF products.

Strategic Diversification of Digital Assets The purchase, in a Monday regulatory filing, follows the near-funding last year of a previous ¥11 billion acquisition, ¥10.5 billion of which has already been incurred. Remixpoint said the timing of the new acquisition will be determined by market conditions, though no price or date has been provided.

The positive market response reflects investors’ confidence in the company’s ongoing transition towards digital assets. A Segment of New Trend in Japan Remixpoint, listed in 2006 after its incorporation in 2004, started out in software before expanding to the energy and auto sectors. Recently, it expanded its foray into cryptocurrencies as part of a small but growing group of Japanese firms adding Bitcoin to their capital strategy. In 2023, another move by Metaplanet, holding in excess of 1,100 BTC valued at over $125 million today, served to reinforce the trend among Japanese firms towards utilizing crypto as a defense mechanism against financial instability.

The estimate accounts for nearly 19% of Nvidia’s revenue on an annual basis. Nvidia’s stock price hit a high of $153 at the beginning of the year, but it has been dropping dramatically recently due to investor worries. As the first quarter results are looming, analysts believe spending on Nvidia’s AI chips for data center revenue will continue to slow down. Big Tech companies drive Nvidia’s AI chip sales On Sunday, a Bloomberg report estimated on an annual equivalent basis that Nvidia’s fellow members of the Magnificent Seven Group, including Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, Alphabet, and Google, are the biggest customers for its AI chips. According to the report, Microsoft is the most significant driver of Nvidia’s revenue, followed by Amazon, Meta, and Google’s parent Alphabet (GOOG). Source: Bloomberg, May 2025, estimates on an annual-equivalent basis 25% of Meta’s capital expenditure goes to Nvidia, and the company accounts for just over 9% of Nvidia’s annual revenue. According to the report, the results reflected direct spending on Nvidia. Indirectly, Big Techs props up Nvidia, for instance, Microsoft spends a lot on renting data center capacity from cloud provider CoreWeave (CRWV). Core Weave spends billions on Nvidia’s AI chips to run those data centers. Microsoft accounted for 72% of CRWV revenue in the last fiscal year’s financial results. According to DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria, Nvidia relies on a handful of large technology companies for about half its revenue. He added that the revenue had grown dramatically in recent years, but it appears to moderate Nvidia’s growth. According to Nvidia’s 2022 fourth-quarter earnings report, Microsoft spent less than 1% of its capital on Nvidia and similarly accounted for less than 1% of Nvidia’s revenue on an annualized basis. Luria warned that the expenditure may slow as customers increasingly use the chips they developed in-house. According to Luria, Nvidia chips have a considerable advantage in AI pre-training, and the cost of the custom chips is competitive. Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon have developed custom chips to target specific AI workloads, making the chips more efficient for each company’s needs. Microsoft could moderate its spending on AI hardware Rival chip maker like Broadcom (AVGO) are developing custom chips for their customers, whereas Nvidia’s GPUs are for more general-purpose AI computing. Investors have raised concerns about how Big Tech firms could monetize the technology and generate a return on their investment. Analysts believe spending on Nvidia’s AI chips for data center revenue will continue to slow down. According to Bloomberg consensus data, Nvidia’s data center revenue is expected to jump more than 74% to $39 billion in the first quarter of the following fiscal year report. In the first quarter of Nvidia’s fiscal year 2025, data center revenue rose by 427%. Microsoft confirmed its $80 billion spending plan to build AI data centers, with 80% of the expenditure going to the US. Meta raised its 2025 expenditure outlook, predicting that spending will fall between $64 billion and $72 billion, up from the previous range of $60 billion and $65 billion. AMD won over Nvidia’s top customers with its MI300X data center GPU AI chip and is planning to ship its MI350 series, which is based on a new architecture called CDNA (compute DNA). CDNA delivers 35 times more performance than the MI300X, so it is a legitimate threat to Nvidia’s AI chips. Nvidia’s stock reached a high of 153.13 on January 7, but then it dropped, which was caused by a series of investor worries. Investors were worried about the sustainability of AI data center demand from hyperscalers after two years of heavy investment triggered by the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022. China’s DeepSeek AI model reportedly required less advanced processors to build, threatening Nvidia’s sales. Nvidia is trading at 131.29, with a change of 1.16% today.

Following the acceleration in institutional onboarding and a new trend of bullish momentum, investor optimism is surging robustly. However, XRP is not alone in hogging the headlines. New entrant crypto projects like Remittix and old-timers like Stellar (XLM) are catching up fast. Let’s find out what is driving the XRP boom and whose other tokens can follow its growth path. Remittix (RTX) – the future of cross-border payments While XRP is in the limelight, Remittix (RTX) is quietly becoming a major global payment sector contender. With a price of $0.0781, Remittix has earned more than $15.3 million and sold more than 538 million tokens, which reflects massive investor demand. What distinguishes Remittix is its fiat-to-crypto bridge, which allows users to send BTC, ETH, XRP, and many more directly to their bank accounts within minutes. At a time when ease of use and speed matter the most, RTX presents a revolutionary solution with real benefits, a far cry from projects still stuck in proof-of-concept. With direct access to the $190 trillion global payments space, Remittix’s growth is being compared to that of early-stage XLM and XRP. But its focus on pragmatic real-world usability and simple adoption could leave them in the dust. As additional investors become aware of RTX’s potential, it’s fast becoming an odds-on number one 2025 bull cycle performer. XRP: institutional adoption and legal clarity drive breakout expectation The recent XRP price action shows the token consolidating at pivotal support at $2.35 after getting rejected by the $2.50 resistance. With the support coinciding with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement, analysts show that holding this level may trigger a bullish breakout. Source: Kriptofoni Investor sentiment is also backed by a recent WEF report, which included the XRP Ledger as the basis for a $1 billion tokenized equity program. Ripple’s acquisition strategy behind BitGo and Metaco lends credibility to its custodian and compliance strength, which underlies institutional finance. If XRP reclaims the $2.42–$2.45 zone and confirms its bullish flag pattern, some analysts predict a breakout to $5–$10. While short-term caution based on resistance continues to exist, overall indicators point towards a new uptrend. Stellar (XLM): following XRP with government-backed support Like XRP, Stellar (XLM) gained new interest because it was included in a U.S. Faster Payments Council report supporting G20 cross-border payment objectives. The report puts Stellar and Ripple in the lead as building block tech for faster, more transparent foreign exchanges. The real power of XLM lies in token-based transfers that streamline and minimise transaction fees. With its foundation on US agency backing and financial inclusion, Stellar is being asked to enhance the speed of payments, cost reductions, and compliance. As financial infrastructures integrate standards like ISO 20022, Stellar’s architecture positions it as a network of choice for future-proofed cross-border payments, equalling XRP’s long-term application. Investors who have tracked XRP’s trajectory would be advised to look out for XLM as both networks ride the same institutional wave. Conclusion The price of XRP may be grabbing attention with the potential to break out, but the bigger picture is a broader trend among payment-centric cryptocurrencies. With its real-time applications, growing investment, and use case benefit, Remittix (RTX) could well overshadow veteran players in the next bull cycle. While XRP and XLM continue to receive official and institutional support, new players like Remittix are demonstrating how innovation and real-world usability can remake the leaderboard. For investors, that means not just keeping an eye on who’s at the top today but also what they’re working on for tomorrow.

But while many chase the rally, early investors are already turning their focus to a new contender, Mantix (MTX) . Currently in Stage 1 of its presale at just $0.02, Mantix is projected to hit the $1 mark by the end of the year. With innovative features and real cross-chain trading power, MTX is quickly emerging as the next major breakout opportunity. Hyperliquid price hits all-time high as HYPE surges past $367 Hyperliquid’s native token HYPE has surged to an all-time high of $367.24, marking a major moment for the decentralized derivatives giant. The 30% weekly gain and around 14.5% in the last 24 hours alone have turned heads across the crypto space, largely driven by soaring open interest, institutional momentum, and a backdrop of rising Bitcoin prices. With $9.37 billion in open interest now locked in, Hyperliquid’s rise signals growing dominance in DeFi trading infrastructure. Source: CoinMarketCap Part of this rally stems from Hyperliquid Labs’ efforts to shape the future of decentralized finance through proactive regulatory engagement. The firm’s push for clearer, safer DeFi frameworks has earned praise among traders and institutions alike. Social media has amplified the buzz, as community members celebrated the token’s new highs across platforms like Twitter and Discord. Yet some investors are already looking ahead, even with Hyperliquid capturing the spotlight. While latecomers chase HYPE’s highs, early movers are turning their attention to Mantix(MTX), a fresh entry in the DeFi space. Mantix challenges Hyperliquid with deeper liquidity and lower fees While Hyperliquid celebrates a major 30% surge, savvy investors are already placing their bets on what could be the next breakout, Mantix (MTX). Still in Stage 1 of its presale and priced at just $0.02, Mantix is quietly gaining traction as the DeFi platform poised to challenge the big names. Built for serious traders, Mantix offers deep liquidity, seamless cross-chain swaps, and up to 1000x leverage, all wrapped into one intuitive, high-performance platform. Mantix stands out because of its features and particularly how accessible it makes them. There’s no need to download clunky software or jump through hoops. Just connect your wallet and start trading. Its architecture is built for speed and scalability, ensuring it can support a growing user base without compromising on security or performance. Every transaction is protected with the latest blockchain encryption. This gives traders peace of mind as they operate in a fully decentralized environment. Mantix is doing more than following the current DeFi trend. It’s rewriting the rules. While Hyperliquid has proven the appetite for high-powered decentralized derivatives trading, Mantix is expanding on that idea with a platform that’s more inclusive, more efficient and packed with long-term potential. For early investors looking beyond today’s headlines, MTX might just be the smart move of 2025.

Investors are buzzing with optimism as trading volume spikes 69% to $1.33 billion. Yet, a new altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is stealing attention with its innovative DeFi lending model. Currently in phase 5 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $9,300,000, with over 510 million tokens sold to 11,500 holders. Offering real-world utility, this project is drawing investors eager for high-yield opportunities. As Cardano aims for $1.14, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) promises a 100% ROI at launch, potentially outshining ADA’s gains. This fresh contender is sparking curiosity in the crypto market. Cardano’s bullish momentum Cardano is riding a wave of enthusiasm. Its price has surged to $0.80, reflecting strong investor confidence. Daily trading volume has soared, hitting $1.33 billion, a 69% increase. Crypto charts show a bullish tilt, with the 50-day moving average now acting as support at $0.69. The RSI, at 60.68, hints at room for further gains. However, the $0.81 resistance looms large. Breaking it could propel Cardano toward $0.86, $0.97, or even $1.14. Stablecoin growth, doubling to $30 million in Q1, bolsters this optimism. This momentum suggests Cardano remains a top crypto to buy now, but challenges await if resistance holds firm. Meanwhile, a new project is turning heads. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lending innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in the crypto market with its decentralized lending platform. Phase 5 of its presale is underway, with tokens priced at $0.03, a 200% jump from the opening phase’s $0.01. Investors are flocking, having purchased over 510 million tokens. The project’s lending model allows users to borrow or lend assets like ETH or DAI, earning passive income through mtTokens. These tokens, such as mtETH, accrue interest over time, offering flexibility and liquidity. Unlike speculative coins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emphasizes utility, making it a standout in crypto investment. Its structured tokenomics ensure stability, setting the stage for phase 6’s price hike. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale success Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction with its presale, raising $9,300,000 so far. Phase 5’s $0.03 price offers a guaranteed 100% ROI at the $0.06 launch price. Analysts predict a post-launch surge to $2.50, suggesting a potential 8,233% return. The project’s buy-and-distribute mechanism fuels demand by redistributing tokens to stakers, ensuring long-term growth. A leaderboard rewarding the top 50 holders with bonus tokens is sparking excitement. The team is also prioritizing security, working with Certik to audit smart contracts, with updates soon on socials. As phase 6 approaches with a 16.7% price increase to $0.035, investors see Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a top crypto to buy now. Why Cardano faces competition Cardano’s technical indicators remain promising, with a 52% rise in derivatives trading volume to $2.05 billion. Open interest is up 10.56% to $966 million, reflecting strong market sentiment. Yet, its reliance on stablecoin growth and technical breakouts leaves it vulnerable to resistance at $0.81. A failure here could see prices dip to $0.75 or lower. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers tangible utility through lending and borrowing, appealing to investors seeking real-world applications. Its presale momentum and structured growth model position it as a formidable rival. As crypto investment trends shift, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could outpace Cardano in delivering consistent value. Looking ahead with optimism Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as an altcoin with robust fundamentals. Its lending platform and presale success signal strong potential in the crypto market. Investors are drawn to its 100% ROI at launch and predictions of reaching $2.50 post-launch. Cardano’s bullish run is notable, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a fresh approach with practical DeFi solutions. Crypto prices are volatile, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s model ensures stability.

These fast-moving assets are grabbing investor attention with strong price action, bullish momentum and serious growth potential. Solana is breaking out, Bitcoin Cash is testing key levels and Mantix is stealing the spotlight in its early presale at just $0.02. Tipped for a 100x surge in 2025, Mantix could be the biggest winner of them all. Don’t miss out. Solana leads fast-growing crypto list with strong fundamentals Solana (SOL) is heating up again and traders are taking notice. Currently priced at around $172.98 with a 1.7% gain over the past week, SOL is showing strong signs of renewed bullish momentum. Backed by a massive 24-hour trading volume of $3.23 billion and a market cap nearing $92 billion, Solana is proving its support is consistent buying interest and technical validation. On the charts, SOL has broken out of a symmetrical triangle pattern that had been forming throughout May. This type of structure typically signals indecision, but the recent breakout above the $180 resistance level erased doubts. The price quickly retested the $175 level, now acting as firm support, confirming the breakout and setting the stage for a potential continuation higher. Price action suggests Bitcoin Cash is building for next move Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is back on traders' radars as one of the fastest-growing cryptos to watch, even as it takes a short breather around the $431 level. After a solid push to a recent high near $438, BCH is now consolidating within a tight range, hovering between support and resistance levels that could define its next move. Source: CoinMarketCap While the short-term momentum has cooled slightly, the overall trend still hints at upside potential if bulls regain control. The indecision in the market hints at a buildup. Bitcoin Cash is gathering steam and once it clears the $438 barrier convincingly, a fresh leg higher could follow. It’s a technical zone worth watching for traders who don’t want to miss the next run. Mantix gains early momentum with strong presale interest As Solana and Bitcoin Cash gain fresh momentum, a new name is quickly joining the ranks of the fastest-growing cryptos to buy now , Mantix. Still in Stage 1 of its presale and priced at just $0.02, Mantix is capturing early attention for its bold approach to decentralized trading. It’s a purpose-built platform offering seamless cross-chain swaps, real revenue sharing and next-level performance that’s built for real traders. At the heart of Mantix is the $MTX token, which does more than power transactions. Holders earn passive rewards through a built-in revenue-sharing model without needing to lock up liquidity or participate in complex staking pools. It’s a smarter, simpler way to get rewarded for supporting the platform and that’s exactly what’s pulling early buyers in. Behind the scenes, Mantix runs on a secure, scalable architecture designed to handle heavy demand without slowing down or compromising user data. Traders can move across blockchains, bridge assets and execute high-speed trades all from one sleek interface with no downloads or extra tools required. It’s designed for global accessibility and built to lead, not follow. As big names like Solana and Bitcoin Cash surge, investors looking for high-upside potential are loading up on Mantix early. With advanced features, growing buzz and a tiny entry price, this could be the most overlooked crypto play of the moment. Don’t miss out.

With technical patterns forming, bullish sentiment rising and early-stage opportunities still on the table, these three projects are being tipped for explosive growth. Mantix, currently in presale at just $0.02 , is projected to surge up to 100x in 2025. As market chatter intensifies, one thing is clear: big moves could erupt at any moment. Crypto analysts say Pepe price follows familiar breakout pattern from past rallies Pepe is starting to look like it’s gearing up for another run and market watchers are taking note. After trading just under $0.00001 during early May, the memecoin surged to $0.00001603 by May 23, driven by improving sentiment and a wave of speculative interest. The market-wide correction that followed shaved off $100 billion in crypto market cap, pulling PEPE down to $0.0000139, but even with that pullback, it’s still up nearly 65% on the month. That kind of resilience is what’s keeping traders engaged. Despite the 12% daily drop on May 24, Pepe’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) held at a healthy 59.19, indicating there's still room to run before the token becomes overbought. Source: x.com Analysts point to the 61.8% and 23.6% Fibonacci levels as key markers, suggesting Pepe’s latest dip could be just another setup for its next breakout. They believe PEPE has already bottomed around $0.000007 and is showing a familiar chart structure seen in its previous rallies. Polkadot breaks free from 2024 consolidation with renewed momentum Polkadot (DOT) is starting to turn heads again, quietly building bullish momentum while the broader market watches. Currently trading at around $4.53, DOT is down 2.62% in the last 24 hours, with trading volume climbing 7.25% to nearly $292 million. That uptick in volume, combined with improving sentiment, has technical analysts leaning toward a positive reversal on the horizon. One of the more compelling signals comes from analyst VipRoseTr, who believes DOT is forming a rounded bottom, a classic U-shaped pattern that often marks the end of a downtrend and the start of accumulation. Historical price action supports this view, with 2023’s steep decline followed by a year of consolidation in 2024. Now, with higher volume and more aggressive buying at these levels, the stage may be set for DOT’s next major leg up. Community powers Mantix as next DeFi breakout begins Mantix is rapidly emerging as one of the most talked-about DeFi projects of the year and the buzz is only getting louder. While Pepe and Polkadot command their own waves of investor attention, Mantix is drawing serious interest from early adopters who see something bigger brewing. Currently in its presale phase with a token price of just $0.02, Mantix’s performance so far has shown that investors are positioning ahead of what could be a breakout year. What makes Mantix is the tech. Built on a hybrid infrastructure that merges blockchain efficiency with AI-driven intelligence, the platform offers seamless cross-chain trading, staking and liquidity provision, all within a user-first, decentralized framework. The integration of artificial intelligence helps power smart trading tools, giving users a competitive edge while maintaining full control of their assets. As Mantix continues to build momentum alongside buzz-worthy names like Pepe and Polkadot, it's becoming clear that this isn’t just another token launch. It’s a potential DeFi heavyweight in the making. And those getting in now may just be ahead of the next major market eruption.

This is setting up the social media platform to be an everything app, as Musk wanted. The money service is expected to give users a digital wallet on X to store money and make peer-to-peer transfers. The information has been made public by an Elon Musk and Tesla fan account, after which the repost was picked up by the widely-followed Tesla Owners Silicon Valley account. It added, “Payments. Banking. The Everything app just got even bigger.” 🚨BREAKING: Confirmed by Elon — X is launching X Money soon 💸📲 Payments. Banking. The everything app just got even bigger. pic.twitter.com/vVHszUKQC8 — Tesla Owners Silicon Valley (@teslaownersSV) May 25, 2025 Elon Musk commented, “This will be a very limited access beta at first When people’s saving are involved, extreme care must be taken.” The project has not started yet. Musk has been getting money transfer licenses in states across the country since he bought Twitter and changed its name to X. X to become the US WeChat Industry leaders have been adding financial services to social media platforms for a long time. Nearly ten years ago, Meta made Facebook Marketplace, a place where people could buy and sell things. While TikTok has a Shop, it also has a Creator Rewards program that lets artists make money. However, the new thing about X Money is that it lets you make quick payments from the app. TikTok says that payments made through PayPal are usually handled in 72 hours. Musk has said in the past that he wants people to do all of their banking on his platform and that one day, “you won’t need a bank account.” Visa said earlier this year that it would be the first company to work with X Money. Through the agreement, users would be able to safely send money to X from their checking account or debit card. Not to say that there are no competitors. There are a lot of players in the market for mobile payment apps. Millions of people use them regularly. However, X Money is the most tightly linked mix of money and social media the US market will see. This is a popular pairing in other parts of the world; Tencent’s WeChat is a good example of the service. X Money LLC is now registered with money transmitter licenses in 40 states plus the District of Columbia. It is also registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Joanne Kumire, lead banking and payments analyst at GlobalData, said in emailed comments, “Acquiring money transmitter licenses, leveraging Visa’s support, and tapping into X’s existing user base create a strong foundation However, the challenge lies in turning potential into action. To succeed, X will need to address trust concerns, offer compelling reasons for users to switch, and deliver a seamless, innovative payment experience.” The odds that Musk will allow crypto transitions While working with DOGE, Musk said that he wanted to put the US Treasury on a blockchain. This is the technology that Bitcoin and other crypto coins are based on. Musk is a huge fan of c rypto and especially the Doge memecoin. Also, earlier this year, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, said that payments would be coming to the social media platform in 2025. This led to a lot of wild speculation that the platform might use or support bitcoin, crypto, or dollar-pegged stablecoins that use crypto technology to make transactions faster and cheaper. In the meantime, the crypto market is doing extremely well, with the biggest coin (BTC) managing to maintain above $100k. On the other hand, the dollar has been affected by the uncertainties that have come with Trump’s administration. This has led to the US states approving of the strategic Bitcoin reserve.

But in May 2025, the token made a stunning comeback — soaring over 630% month-over-month. Why did this happen, and what’s next for Moo Deng? Find out in our Moo Deng price prediction. Table of Contents What is Moo Deng? Moo Deng crypto price prediction: general outlook Moo Deng price prediction 2025 Moo Deng price prediction 2030 What is Moo Deng? Moo Deng ( MOODENG ) was launched on September 10, 2024, via Pump.fun — a Solana-based platform known for its rapid-fire, no-code approach to creating meme coins. Built on the Solana blockchain, the token quickly caught the attention of the crypto world. The meme coin was inspired by a baby pygmy hippopotamus named Moo Deng, who became a viral sensation thanks to his playful antics at Thailand’s Khao Kheow Open Zoo. His internet fame sparked the creation of a fast-growing crypto asset that resonated with meme coin fans. https://twitter.com/MooDengSOL/status/1924236777084371088 Interestingly, the project has also introduced a number of related tokens, representing characters like Moo Deng’s mother Yona and his siblings Moo Toon and Moo Waan. So, why is this token rising — and where could it be headed next? Is Moo Deng a good investment? Let’s shift from cute to serious: it’s time for our Moo Deng coin price prediction. Moo Deng crypto price prediction: general outlook As of May 26, 2025, Moo Deng is trading at $0.25, up approximately 31% over the past week and 464% over the past month. Despite this impressive jump, Moo Deng still hasn’t bounced back to its previous all-time high of $0.6911, which it hit back in November 2024. Moo Deng 7-day chart, May 2025 | Source: CoinMarketCap Moo Deng’s impressive surge this month is largely tied to its recent listing on Binance Alpha — a launchpad for emerging tokens under the Binance ecosystem — in early May, which drove a 114% price increase. You might also like: Moo Deng crypto surges over 114% after Binance Alpha listing Then, on May 22, Moo Deng was added to Robinhood — a major U.S. trading platform known for its commission-free access to stocks and crypto. The listing opens the door for even more retail investors to ride the meme token’s growing momentum. While its rapid rise has caught the attention of the market, the future of Moo Deng will likely depend on sustained community interest and whether it can evolve beyond meme status into a more established crypto asset. What’s the Moo Deng price prediction for the rest of 2025? Moo Deng price prediction 2025 According to CoinCodex’s Moo Deng price forecast, the token could experience a decline of up to 46%, potentially dropping to $0.148 by June 21, 2025. Meanwhile, the platform suggests that the token could trade between $0.08 and $0.275 throughout the year. According to CoinDataflow’s MOODENG price prediction for 2025, token’s value could range from $0.225 to $0.517. All in all, these forecasts show that Moo Deng’s price could swing quite a bit — with chances for both gains and dips. If you’re thinking about investing, it’s important to keep in mind that this token, like many meme coins, can be highly volatile. So, doing your own research and being prepared for ups and downs will be key if you want to ride the wave with Moo Deng. Will Moo Deng go up or down in 5 years? Moo Deng price prediction 2030 CoinCodex’s Moo Deng price prediction for 2030 estimates that MOODENG could range from $0.279 to as high as $0.51. CoinDataFlow’s projections for MOODENG suggest the token might trade between $0.155 and $0.484 by the end of the decade. Should you invest in Moo Deng? Should you invest in Moo Deng? Right now, the outlook for Moo Deng looks promising, thanks to its recent listings on popular platforms and a growing community backing it. That said, expectations for 2025 suggest the price could be quite volatile — with some ups and downs along the way. Staying informed will help you make smarter decisions about Moo Deng.

Ethereum , too, is drawing interest, fueled by strong institutional trends. These developments hint at potential upcoming breakouts for both cryptocurrencies. Readers can explore the details and discover which digital assets may be primed for impressive growth in this report. Solana Price Dynamics: Short-Term Gains Amid Long-Term Corrections SOL experienced an 18% monthly gain contrasted by a 23% decline over six months. Price movement ranged mainly between $109 and $171, highlighting volatility with bursts of strength against a broader downward backdrop. Recent rallies were notable despite the longer-term weakness, suggesting that short-term optimism temporarily outpaced the persistent selling pressure. The current trading zone features a support level at $71.65 and a primary resistance at $194.93, with a secondary resistance at $256.57 and additional support at $10.01. Bulls have pushed prices moderately upward over one week, yet the absence of a sustained trend calls for caution. Traders might find entry points near support while waiting for a decisive move beyond the key resistance level. Ethereum's Surge and Correction: Monthly Rise vs. Six-Month Slide Ethereum demonstrated a sharp monthly rebound with prices surging by about 44% while showing a more cautious six-month decline of roughly 23%. The recent month was marked by renewed investor interest and stronger market momentum. Over the past six months, the coin experienced downward pressure that tempered earlier gains, resulting in a mixed performance picture that reflects both bullish runs and bearish corrections. Currently trading between approximately $1469 and $2038, Ethereum faces nearby resistance at around $2281 with a further hurdle at $2850, while support is established near $1142 and again at $573. Bulls are gradually gaining influence in the short term, suggesting buying opportunities near support levels while maintaining caution around key resistance zones. Conclusion SOL is poised for a potential breakout towards $200 following a period of reduced leverage. ETH is also displaying a strong setup, driven by interest from institutional investors. Both assets show promising near-term growth. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Launched by the Dubai Land Department (DLD), the initiative comes as part of a government-backed program that aims to digitize approximately $16 billion worth of real estate assets by 2033. The platform, called “Prypco Mint,” was developed in collaboration with real estate fintech firm Prypco. The platform offers investors fractional ownership of Dubai real estate for as little as 2,000 dirhams (about $540). Currently, only Emirati ID card holders can invest in dirhams, but the plan is to open up global access and integrate with other platforms in the future.

Ctrl Alt has established a synchronized structure with the state’s official registration systems by transferring real estate title deeds directly to the XRP Ledger blockchain network. Thus, title deeds are kept simultaneously in both traditional registration systems and on the blockchain. In the project, where Zand Digital Bank is the banking partner, regulatory support is provided by the Central Bank of the UAE, the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) and the Dubai Future Foundation's “Real Estate Sandbox” programme.

Key economic events of this week Some significant U.S. economic reports are scheduled for release this week that are expected to impact XAUUSD . Wednesday, May 28: FOMC Meeting Minutes A stronger USD and higher rates might cause gold to decline if the minutes indicate a hawkish Fed (leaning toward more rate hikes or tight monetary policy). Gold prices would probably be supported by a dovish tone (rate reductions or worries about an economic slowdown). Thursday, May 29: Unemployment Claims & Prelim GDP Q/Q Strong GDP: Indicates a robust economy, which is negative for gold (USD up). Weak GDP: Increases recession fears → gold is positive (desire for safe havens). Unemployment Claims: Higher than anticipated claims point to a poor job market, which is good news for gold. Reduced claims might affect gold prices. Friday, May 30: Index of Core PCE Prices m/m The Fed favors this inflation indicator. PCE higher than anticipated: More Fed tightening = negative outlook for gold. PCE below expectations: Reduces pressure on rate hikes therefore gold is positive.

While BTC captures headlines, another asset is quickly gaining ground, Mantix (MTX) . With a presale price of just $0.02 and whispers of a 100x return in 2025, Mantix is stealing the spotlight among early investors. As markets react to political shocks, BTC leads the charge, but MTX could be the breakout no one sees coming. Bitcoin hits $111K before pulling back to $107K amid tariff news Bitcoin (BTC) is once again dominating headlines after hitting an all-time high of $111,970 on May 22. This incredible milestone reflects its continued strength in this market cycle. Although a sharp dip followed, briefly pulling BTC down to $107,000, the king of crypto still holds a commanding lead over altcoins, many of which remain nearly 30% below their 2021 highs. Despite volatility, Bitcoin’s position remains solid as the market digests external geopolitical signals. Source: x.com One of the key drivers behind BTC’s recent surge, and its subsequent dip, has been President Trump’s bold trade move . His announcement on TruthSocial about implementing a 50% tariff on European Union imports sparked fresh fears of a looming trade war. While such statements have shaken traditional markets and triggered some short-term instability in crypto, they’ve also reinforced Bitcoin’s role as a macro hedge in times of global economic uncertainty. Similar tariff threats earlier this year sent BTC below $76,000, but each recovery since has shown the market’s growing resilience. Now sitting near $110,000 again, Bitcoin is proving it's thriving. Traders join Mantix for passive income through revenue sharing While Bitcoin dominates headlines with its $110K milestone in the wake of Trump’s bold tariff stance, savvy investors are quietly locking in their positions on what could be the next major crypto explosion, Mantix (MTX) . This AI-powered, fully decentralized trading platform is still in presale at just $0.02, yet it's already making waves as the most exciting DeFi entry of 2025. And with the way things are shaping up, Mantix isn’t just riding market momentum, it’s building its own. At the core of Mantix is a next-gen trading engine powered by AI algorithms that do more than just follow trends; they anticipate them. These intelligent systems analyze massive datasets in real time, identifying high-probability moves and executing them through flawless smart contracts. The platform’s hybrid infrastructure bridges multiple chains effortlessly, giving traders deep liquidity, lightning-fast execution and full control without the need for intermediaries. What’s pulling investors in even further is Mantix’s token model. $MTX isn’t just a utility token. It’s a revenue-sharing asset. Holders earn a cut of the platform’s fees based on their holdings, offering a passive income stream in addition to capital appreciation. That’s a powerful incentive given the evolving demands of the crypto market. With community-driven governance, enterprise-level security and a product already turning heads, Mantix is more than a promising altcoin. It’s a serious contender for the next 100x breakout. While Bitcoin continues to lead the macro charge, Mantix is quickly becoming the altcoin most likely to steal the spotlight.

Here are four names—DOGE, YETIO, XEP, and SOL—each with new catalysts or strategic presales we’re eyeing for the next market upleg. Dogecoin (DOGE): On-Chain Revival Sparks a Comeback Dogecoin price is currently at $0.2196 at the time of writing, slightly down from yesterday but maintaining a 15% weekly gain. On-chain metrics indicate over 280,000 unique addresses active, a six-month peak, while whales mobilized ≈60.9 billion DOGE over a 24-hour period—a 41% jump in “whale” trading volumes known to lead to robust expansion in prices. Technically, Dogecoin price remains above analysts’ $0.21 level identified as the lower boundary to a bullish flag; a robust breakout would propel the token towards the psychologically significant $0.35 level within a few weeks . With whales buying in and network traffic increasing, the meme coin still holds asymmetrical potential if the general rally intensifies. Yeti Ouro (YETIO): Stage-4 Presale, P2E Utility, And A $100k Raffle The one presale token here, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) , sits in Stage 4 at $0.041 per coin, having already raised ≈$4.3 million after selling more than 244 million tokens. Built on the Ethereum chain, this SOLIDProof-approved token combines meme-coin virality with a play-to-earn game built in Unreal Engine 5. Players of Yeti Go can be rewarded in YETIO tokens feeding back into demand by stages—each tranche has a programmed price boost, so late buyers pay more automatically, while early buyers reap embedded mark-ups. A one-billion supply cap plus a timed burn of 5% in tokens gives a layer of scarcity to GameFi. The project is offering a 20% bonus on all purchases with an additional 5% on purchases over $500. Yeti Go throws you into the center of a high-speed, high-stakes world where every detail is built for immersion. Developed with the acclaimed team behind blockbusters like Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space, the game delivers striking visuals and heart-pounding gameplay. What takes it even further is the sound—expertly crafted by engineers who’ve collaborated with Grammy-nominated artists including Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid—creating a rich, cinematic atmosphere that amplifies every moment. ​​ Giveaway notice: A $100,000 giveaway from Yeti Ouro is now also live—five lucky participants will be awarded $20,000 in YETIO through an open raffle. Instructions for entering can be found on the project’s website . With Stage-5 jump already programmed, analysts covering the sale indicate that the token may hit double-digit cents at listing if current trends continue. For buyers seeking a high-beta punt with real utility versus hype alone, YETIO’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) loop and ramping-up presale model provide a straightforward catalyst path. Electra Protocol (XEP): Micro-cap Staking Play with Real Yield At $0.000255 and a market cap at less than $5 million, XEP is this week’s smallest asset. Still, trading in Electra Protocol picked up after this week’s Medium tutorial highlighted increased APY rates for desktop staking and new DeFi liquidity rewards — benefits potentially drawing in yield hunters outpriced from more sizable Proof-of-Stake chains. XEP operates a quick UTXO-layered chain with future smart-contract capabilities, positioning it as a micro-cap competitor for Cardano or Algorand. With very thin order books, even small inflows can produce large percentage moves; however, liquidity risk remains extremely high, so sizing appropriately is essential. Solana (SOL): Institutional Tailwinds and Memetic Pull Solana price is at $172.06 and remains holding up above the $170 level despite profit-taking in recent times. Two short-term factors favor bulls: 1. Meme-coin resurgence: Solana-based memecoins have seen average daily trading volume leap by 46% in May, attracting new retail flow into the chain’s low-fee DEX network . 2. Institutional adoption: Bank reports of introducing Solana for pilot applications in tokenized assets and a Layer-2 fund-raise reignited the long-term “ETH-but-faster” storyline, with analysts targeting a move to $200 if trends keep going this direction. As long as inflows to ETFs persist and network fees remain low, SOL might again challenge its late-2021 mountains to be the preferred base layer for mass-market DeFi and consumer tokens. Critical Alpha for Enthusiasts From DOGE’s whale-led comeback to YETIO’s gamification presale, XEP’s income focus, and SOL’s institutional driving force, every coin paints a unique picture for the next crypto expansion. Diversify sizing, back project vision, and keep in mind that explosive returns and added volatility move hand in hand in this asset category.

33767162,[object Object],1748280600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Chainlink Vs. XRP Ledger—Who Leads In Institutions? Report,https://bitcoinist.com/chainlink-vs-xrp-ledger-report/,"Messari’s new comparative study sets two of crypto’s most talked-about networks side by side, measuring how successfully each is courting the next wave of enterprise capital and regulated finance. Chainlink, a decentralized oracle network built atop Ethereum, is framed as “a foundational connectivity layer that already underwrites more than $20 trillion in on-chain value,” while the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is cast as “a purpose-built settlement rail evolving toward full-spectrum institutional DeFi.” Chainlink Vs. XRP Ledger Chainlink’s value proposition is singular: secure, tamper-proof data delivery and cross-chain messaging for any smart-contract platform. Messari notes that its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) “is fast becoming the TCP/IP of tokenized finance,” and points to the October 2024 launch of the Chainlink Runtime Environment as a turning point. “CRE lets capital-markets engineers design bespoke oracle workflows without writing Solidity at all; that is gold dust for banks,” the report quotes a London-based fintech architect as saying. Development pace is equally striking. Over the past year Chainlink’s GitHub activity “frequently surpassed Ethereum core-protocol repos,” an achievement Messari attributes to the roll-out of CCIP v1.5, the network’s institutional sandbox, and the latest iteration of staking. XRPL’s trajectory, by contrast, flows from payments into tokenization, then outward into regulated DeFi. Messari highlights the ledger’s decade-long record of sub-second settlement and its native decentralized exchange, but argues that “the existing Solidity code to an environment that settles in fractions of a cent.” Legal clarity matters as well. The report reminds readers that Ripple’s courtroom clash with the US Securities and Exchange Commission still drags on the network’s success. Financial metrics underscore how differently the two ecosystems monetize traction. At roughly $10.35 billion in market capitalization, LINK commands only a third of XRP’s $34.82 billion valuation, yet the oracle token trades at $15.65—some twenty-five times more than XRP’s $0.63. Messari argues that the disparity reflects “structural divergence between a scarce middleware token valued like a SaaS utility and a high-velocity settlement asset priced for payments throughput rather than store-of-value appeal.” Partnership momentum is where the lines truly begin to blur. Chainlink’s SmartCon 2024 disclosed integrations with 37 new blockchains and a string of proofs-of-concept with global custodians; still, Messari singles out one link-up above the rest: “Chainlink now supplies pricing oracles for Ripple’s incoming RLUSD stablecoin , a deal that dissolves the idea that the two projects exist in separate silos.” On XRPL’s side, the report flags the network’s Multi-Purpose Token standard, compliance hooks for know-your-customer checks, and rapid patching of an SDK vulnerability in April 2025 as signals that “institutional risk desks are finally willing to run production traffic through an open public chain.” Regulatory posture remains an axis of comparison. Chainlink, lacking a payments layer of its own, has largely skirted securities scrutiny. Messari writes that “its biggest regulatory lift is proving the determinism of its oracle engine—so far, so good.” XRP Ledger, by contrast, “carries the scar tissue of the SEC’s enforcement era,” but the report argues that recent victories have turned that history into an advantage: “Few other networks can show investors a playbook for navigating hostile regulators and emerging with a settlement, market cap intact, and enterprise pipeline expanding.” The conclusion resists coronating an outright winner. Chainlink, Messari says, “is cementing itself as the indispensable data and interoperability layer for tokenized finance,” whereas XRPL “is positioning to become the settlement and asset-issuance backbone for banks that must obey strict compliance regimes.” The most telling line in the report may be this: “The future of crypto infrastructure is collaborative, not competitive.” By supplying oracles for Ripple’s own stablecoin, Chainlink implicitly endorses XRPL’s settlement layer; by leaning on Chainlink’s feeds, Ripple concedes that institutional DeFi will require best-in-class middleware rather than closed-loop solutions.

With DOGE currently trading around $0.24, analysts are divided, some warn of a potential 30% correction due to waning momentum, while others cite a strong resurgence in retail interest and broader meme coin rallies as signs of an incoming 1,000% breakout. As investors debate its future, emerging DeFi token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly gaining attention for potentially higher returns. Mutuum Finance presale has raised more than $9.3 million and attracted over 11,500 participants, ahead of a token price rise to $0.035 at the start of the next phase. Those investing at this stage stand to make up to 100% in profit once the projected launch price of $0.06 is reached. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Forecast: Will the Meme Coin Rally or Retreat in 2025? Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme cryptocurrency, is currently trading at $0.246, reflecting a slight increase of 0.015% over the past 24 hours. In May 2025, DOGE has exhibited significant volatility, with prices ranging from highs of $0.26 to support levels near $0.21. Analysts suggest that if DOGE maintains its current momentum, it could reach price targets between $0.28 and $0.30 in June, with potential to test $0.35 to $0.40 under favorable conditions. However, some forecasts indicate a possible short-term decrease, with prices potentially dropping to around $0.232 by May 24, 2025. Despite these fluctuations, DOGE remains structurally intact, and its price trajectory heading into June appears cautiously bullish. While Dogecoin continues to capture investor interest, emerging projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also gaining attention in the cryptocurrency market. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors due its advanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending solutions is gaining significant momentum in the market. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform has collected more than $9.3 million and accumulated 11,500 holders in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.03 before their value will grow to $0.035 within the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 100% when Mutuum Finance hits its launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position. Social media channels will release the results of an ongoing Certik smart contract audit after the completion of this audit by the team. Mutuum Finance is easily the best cryptocurrency to invest today. Rewarding Early Investors & Expanding the Community Mutuum Finance strives to acquire more users and provides financial benefits to its initial investor community. To award early investors Mutuum Finance platform provides ten lucky winners a total of $100,000 distributed in equal amounts of $10,000 value MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance allows new investors to benefit when they refer members to the platform which creates an inclusive investor community.

The Buy-and-Distribute mechanism is to purchase tokens in the open market and redistribute them to stakers, which ensures frequent user engagement and sustains the tokenomics of the project. By matching supply and rewarding users on a regular basis, the strategy entices committed, long-term investors. While Dogecoin (DOGE) faces uncertainty with potential for either a 30% drop or a 1,000% surge, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving out a strong path with over $9.3 million raised from 11,500+ investors during its presale. Currently priced at $0.03, MUTM is expected to rise to $0.035 soon, offering early buyers a possible 100% return at its $0.06 launch price. Don’t miss your chance to join the MUTM presale today.

The prediction suggests a staggering 140% surge from current levels toward a bold price target of $420 and beyond. Solana Prepares For Parabolic Move Toward $420 A fresh chart analysis shared by a TradingView crypto analyst, Master Ananda, reports that Solana has completed a textbook rounded bottom pattern, indicating a bullish reversal to new ATHs. Notably, the analyst forecasts that SOL is gearing up for a parabolic surge to $420, emphasizing that this bullish projection is not the cryptocurrency’s final target. Related Reading: Analyst Tells Investors To Be Patient As Solana Price Hits Resistance The analysis, as stated earlier, is based on the formation of a rounded bottom pattern, which has been developing since early 2025. This pattern has now transitioned into a breakout structure, with the Solana price reportedly holding firm above the $160 support line — a level considered the baseline of the rounded bottom and a psychological stronghold for the market. Notably, Solana faced a strong rejection at a key resistance area on May 23. However, despite the pullback, Master Ananda emphasized that the price action remains resilient, suggesting that bullish momentum is still intact and the dip has not altered the altcoin’s positive long-term outlook in the months ahead. In addition, Solana also dropped to a low on May 19, marked by the blue line on the price chart. Despite this, the analyst strongly asserts that there is “absolutely no bearish action” on the current chart. As long as the $160 level holds, the current trend is likely to accelerate toward higher Fibonacci resistance levels, culminating in the 1.618 extension at around $419.78. This bullish target would represent approximately 140% growth from the current price of around $178 and would place Solana at a new all-time high. Interestingly, Master Ananda noted that even if Solana falls below the key support level, it would be of little concern. Such a move would likely signal a market shakeout or a bear trap rather than a pullback or an invalidation of Solana’s bullish thesis. This view stems from the belief that SOL’s bullish bias has already been confirmed, positioning the market for potential strong growth over the long term. The key point of Master Ananda’s analysis is that Solana’s rise is expected to be sudden and powerful, leaving those on the sidelines regretting missed opportunities. As the market matures and liquidity improves following Bitcoin’s steady rise, the sharp upside potential for Solana could unfold much quicker than anticipated. Macro Catalysts Align For Massive Crypto Growth While explaining his bullish case for Solana, Master Ananda revealed that changes in macroeconomic factors could become a catalyst for astonishing growth in the crypto market. With the US Federal Reserve (FED) expected to initiate interest rate cuts in the coming months, the broader risk-on environment is set to benefit the crypto sector significantly. Related Reading: Solana Rebound To $900 Is Coming, But This Resistance Stands In The Way The analyst suggests that Solana’s current price levels, while not at absolute lows, still represent a significant buy zone. Master Ananda revealed that Solana’s potential is substantial, and as the next bull cycle gains momentum, $300 will no longer be seen as expensive. Before this happens, Master Ananda has stated that investors “should be fully invested and buy like it’s the end of the world”.

Ethereum price technical analysis ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Ethereum has rallied from April’s low of $1,382 to its current price of $2,547. It has formed a bullish flag pattern, consisting of a strong vertical rally followed by a period of consolidation. ETH is currently trading between the 38.2% and 50% Fibonacci retracement levels.

Which Of These Will Produce The Highest Returns Over The Coming Weeks",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/dogecoin-hyperliquid-or-mantix-which-of-these-will-produce-the-highest-returns-over-the-coming-weeks,"Last week, Bitcoin (BTC), the leader of the big-caps coin, reached a new ATH of around $112,968, signalling a strong bullish sentiment in the crypto space. As we approach the end of the second quarter, altcoins are flashing green in a similar manner, with traders and investors lining up their short-term picks in anticipation of the next possible bullish surge in price. But as usual, the same question lingers on the lips of many: Which asset will deliver the highest returns over the coming weeks? Will it be Dogecoin (DOGE), Hyperliquid (HYPE)or Mantix (MTX) ? Of course, each of these tokens belongs to a different category. DOGE is renowned for being the king of meme coins, HYPE is a rising innovator in the DeFi space and MTX is the new presale underdog that analysts have tipped for 100x potential gains. So, which one will it be? Let's take a quick dive into each asset to see what ROI potential they hold. Dogecoin price outlook – is the meme king losing steam or gearing up? Indeed, DOGE has been a major contender, especially in the meme space, as it has held the position of being one of the most recognized crypto assets in the world. However, Dogecoin's price action tells a different story. It has remained volatile for the past two weeks, hovering between the $0.211 to $0.259 range. Thus, its short-term momentum has been inconsistent. So, essentially, even though DOGE may deliver a short pump, perhaps due to its strong community support, there's likely no chance for it to make any serious gains except, of course, if Elon Musk remembers to talk about it again. Hyperliquid news: can this DEFI darling deliver double-digit gains? HYPE is a token that has been making waves in recent DeFi circles. Its on-chain perpetual platform offers users lightning-fast transactions and low fees. Backed by big-name investors and VC groups, it’s one of the hottest topics in Hyperliquid news, especially after the token’s listing earlier this year. Honestly, the fundamentals look good, with daily trading volume almost reaching past $500m and active traders increasing daily. So, yes, Hyperliquid news coverage is painting a bullish narrative. However, despite this, returns may cap at 50–70% upside in the short term, especially since entry is no longer early and competition in the on-chain derivatives space is heating up. Why Mantix may be the sleeper that outshines them all Mantix is an AI-driven, decentralized exchange that caters to traders and investors looking for a platform to carry out smarter, safer Transactions. The project generates serious buzz for its 1000x leverage, revenue sharing, cross-chain trading, instant buyback-and-burn mechanism and many more features. But could it outperform both Dogecoin and Hyperliquid in the near term? Well, that’s very possible. While Dogecoin and Hyperliquid have already launched and gained traction, MTX is currently in Stage 1 of its presale at just $0.02. Those with skin in the crypto investing game can tell what that means for MTX. With its unique offering and strong tokenomics, Mantix aims to become a serious competitor to Hyperliquid, but with more state-of-the-art features that make it stand out in the DEFI space.

According to Stalkchain, a blockchain analytics platform tracking whale and insider activity, $BONK was the most purchased token by smart money in the past week. One clear example occurred on May 22, when a wallet linked to Squads Protocol initiated a $936,000 dollar-cost averaging (DCA) campaign into $BONK. https://twitter.com/StalkHQ/status/1926953590477709649 At press time, the wallet has completed its accumulation phase and now holds 85.98 billion $BONK, currently valued at $1.81 million. This trend bucks the broader sentiment in the Solana memecoin sector, which has largely seen capital outflows. Between May 19 and May 25, selling pressure across the memecoin space has generally outweighed buying, suggesting that most smart money investors have been offloading their holdings rather than accumulating. Memecoins outflow from smart wallet/ Source: Stalkchai On May 25 alone, top memecoins recorded over $3 million in net outflows. However, $BONK defied this trend with a positive net flow of $281,000 on the same day. In contrast, another leading Solana memecoin, Dogwifhat ($WIF), was the most sold token by smart money within the last 24 hours, experiencing more than $250,000 in outflows. Whale Trader Banks $34K in Just 3 Days on $BONK—Experts Eye Massive $2B to $15B Market Cap Surge Despite the otherwise subdued market, traders have also found profitable opportunities in $BONK. For instance, one whale made a $34,760 profit in just three days by flipping $BONK. https://twitter.com/StalkHQ/status/1926952034009272631 The trader purchased 20.4 million tokens worth $437,740 at an average price of $0.0000214 on May 22 and sold them for $472,500 as the price broke above $0.0000217 earlier today. Crypto Twitter (CT) has also taken note, with numerous traders sharing bullish long setups for $BONK and speculating on the token surpassing a $2 billion market cap in the near term. One trader recently attended a Solana conference and expressed strong conviction in $BONK, calling it his top pick. https://twitter.com/voided/status/1926818257811525823 He praised the project’s roadmap and projected a long-term market cap target of $15 billion, a more than 826% increase from current levels. $BONK Technical Outlook: Chart Patterns Point to Bullish Breakout From a technical standpoint, the $BONK/$USDT chart appears to form a double bottom pattern on the daily timeframe, with neckline resistance around $0.00003272. If confirmed, this pattern typically indicates a bullish reversal, especially after an extended downtrend. It has recently rebounded from its April low and is now pushing higher, though it remains below the key resistance zone at around $0.00002020. Should the token break through this resistance with conviction, technical analysis suggests a potential upside of 172%, targeting the $0.00005500 area based on historical price structure and Fibonacci extension projections. https://twitter.com/theunipcs/status/1925736726359597353 The RSI divergence indicator currently reads 51.49, slightly above the neutral mark. This indicates that momentum is neither overbought nor oversold, leaving room for further movement in either direction depending on upcoming market dynamics. Nonetheless, the breakout has not yet been confirmed, and the rise of new memecoins may dilute investor focus.

Spot ETH ETFs have attracted steady inflows, indicating strong investor sentiment. At the same time, increasing exchange netflows hint at possible short-term selling pressure. What’s Next? The price of Ethereum has risen over 40% in the past month, currently trading just north of $2,550. However, numerous market observers believe this is only the beginning of a major rally that may last in the near future . Michael van de Poppe assumed that the sub $2,400 levels observed a few weeks ago resembled “ an incredibly good buying opportunity.” He thinks ETH will start “attacking the highs” in the short term, claiming that a breakout above $3,000 could mark the beginning of a new bull run. The X users, Sensei and Lucky, also gave their two cents. The former noted that the price has recently consolidated between $2,400 and $2,700, envisioning a move to the upside and a pump beyond $3,200. Lucky, a popular analyst with more than 2.2 million followers, revealed that ETH has been “heavily outperforming” BTC in the current quarter. The analyst sees this momentum continuing and expects further price growth for the second-largest cryptocurrency. Ethereum is heavily outperforming $BTC in this quarter. This shows more money flowing into $ETH , and in my opinion, this momentum will continue, and we will see more highs in ETH, especially the low and mid caps. pic.twitter.com/DQaJ6T42kG — Lucky (@LLuciano_BTC) May 26, 2025 For his part, Merlijn The Trader shared a chart showing that ETH inflows into accumulation wallets have surged in the past few days. “Something big is coming. You don’t stack like this unless you know what’s next. And what’s next isn’t normal, it’s historic,” the analyst predicted. Known for their steady inflows and minimal outgoing transactions, accumulation wallets are closely watched by analysts and traders for signs of investor confidence and long-term positioning. Keep an Eye on These Important Factors The recent inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs suggest that ETH could indeed be on the verge of a further price upswing. SoSoValue data indicates that in the past few days, these funds have attracted more capital than they’ve lost, reflecting a boost in investor confidence. In fact, the last date when netflows were negative was May 15. On the contrary, exchange netflows have been predominantly positive in the past week. This suggests that some investors have shifted from self-custody towards centralized exchanges, which increases the immediate selling pressure.

45126463,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=735176,1748280950,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45126463.jpeg,Germany’s Merz warns EU may hit US tech over Trump tariffs,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/germanys-merz-warns-eu-may-hit-us-tech/,"German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has threatened the EU will move against massive US tech companies if American President Donald Trump tries to impose high tariffs on EU imports. Merz said that Europe needs to be prepared to defend itself in the event of a souring trade conflict , addressing the WDR Europa forum in Berlin on Monday. “At the moment, we strongly protect US tech companies — also on taxes,” Merz said Monday in Berlin at the WDR Europaforum conference. “That can be changed, but I don’t want to escalate this conflict. I want to solve it together.” The threat follows Trump’s recent warning to slap a 50% tariff on EU goods starting June 1. However, the move was put on hold after a phone call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The new deadline is now set for July 9. But tension remains high. Trump accuses Europe of exploiting the US and demands the EU slash its goods surplus, dismantle tax barriers, and ease regulations for American companies. EU plans retaliatory tariffs in response to Trump In response, the EU has lined up several layers of countermeasures. One plan targets €21 billion ($23.9 billion) worth of US goods—like motorcycles, whiskey, and orange juice—and could be automatically triggered if trade talks fail. Brussels is also working on a second, much larger list. If Trump moves forward with the 50% tariffs, the EU plans to hit back with tariffs on €95 billion of American products, including US-made cars, Boeing planes, and bourbon whiskey. European Commission officials have said they will look into digital service taxes and create tighter regulations for US tech titans operating in the EU. These companies, including Google, Amazon, Apple, and Meta, would face new restrictions if the trade war ramped up. Bernd Lange, Chair of the European Parliament’s Trade Committee, said that the EU did not want confrontation, but if it had to take action, the tech sector would be in the bull’s eye. The US has a significant surplus in digital services trade with Europe, according to a 2025 Goldman Sachs report. Should the EU limit access or raise taxes on American platforms, billions of dollars in annual revenue for American companies may be up for grabs. Merz leads EU push for unity and restraint Chancellor Merz emphasized that Germany would not be going it alone. He promised full backing for Ursula von der Leyen’s direction of the EU and said trade talks had to be kept under EU control and not added to piecemeal by national side deals. Chancellor Merz told German radio that the EU must not react in a hair-trigger, panicked, or hectic manner. He said that tariffs would hurt Europe but added that the bloc would use tariffs as a last resort if no other options remained. Merz admitted that he had initially believed he could build good relations with Donald Trump but said he had since moderated his message during his time in office. He noted that the current situation shows Europe and the United States now have very different approaches to trade. Merz said that, from the European perspective, tariffs harm everyone. He explained that Trump views them as a way to protect his own economy and sees trade as a zero-sum game. Trump has made doubling down on tariffs a cornerstone of his economic strategy. He has made repeated charges, in rallies and recent interviews, that the EU has been “cheating” the US for decades. According to Bloomberg Economics , Trump’s threat of 50% tariffs would apply to $321 billion of EU-US trade. That could reduce US GDP by almost 0.6% and lift consumer prices by over 0.3%.

According to reports from the past week, the Solana price prediction isn't looking up after the coin dipped close to its support level. The TAO price prediction is also on a similar trend after giving weak bullish signals that have left its investors displeased. In contrast, Mantix ($MTX) is experiencing an influx of investors as the first stage of its presale hits up and gears toward a potential 100x breakout. Considering the other altcoins' shaky performances, will this project continue its unprecedented rise? Bittensor (TAO) price prediction At press time, the TAO price was around $442, after a 10% fall in the past week. According to the 5-day TAO chart, the crypto trade is far from its $400 psychological support level. Source: TradingView Currently, sellers are in control, meaning Bittensor (TAO) may continue its downturn as it lacks the momentum to smash this bearish obstacle. If the dip persists, the TAO price could plunge to the next support level between $388 and $392. Still, Bittensor investors remain bullish, indicating that traders maintain confidence in TAO price prediction. However, the RSI divergence suggested that the bullish momentum is weakening and that a TAO price collapse is near. Solana (SOL) price prediction Like Bittensor (TAO) price performance, the Solana price prediction and performance have been affected by the current downturn in the altcoin market. The SOL crypto lost nearly 8% in the past week and traded at $177 after breaching the $180 resistance. Multiple technical signals provide more insight into the recent Solana price decline. The charts show the Solana price trading below the Ichimoku cloud, which is often a sign of price weakness. Meanwhile, the red and wide cloud ahead signals that this bearish SOL momentum may persist. Solana’s price trades close to the lower Bollinger band, indicating a strong downtrend. The widened band demonstrates increased volatility and possible persistence of selling pressure. As the Solana price struggles continue, Mantix continues its high-flying start to life despite the bearish atmosphere. Mantix (MTX) growth captures market-wide attention Mantix ($MTX) steps into the DeFi space with modern decentralized infrastructure simplifying crypto. Think cross-chain swaps, up to 1000x futures leverage, and a share of revenues when you hold $MTX; Mantix users are on to the newest wave of DeFi excellence. While Stage 1 of its token presale only recently began, Mantix has already raised more than $600,000, while $MTX sells for only $0.02. Leveraging its ERC20 roots and Ethereum backing, Mantix completes transactions rapidly and delivers high liquidity and user control. Mantix is quickly becoming a widely known DeFi project as the struggles of other cryptos like TAO and SOL become obvious. Its robust ecosystem features powerful AI trading tools, an audited contract and deflationary tokenomics, making it an attractive option for investors seeking the next big crypto with possible 100x returns!

According to Financial Times, the raise will include $2 billion in fresh equity and $1 billion through convertible bonds. The report cited six people familiar with the matter but there is no further information. However, the firm may formally announce the raise during the upcoming Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas.

45126701,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=735165,1748281800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45126701.jpeg,High turnover hits Meta’s Llama as 78% of the original research team exits,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/exodus-hits-metas-llama-as-researchers-exit/,"Meta’s pioneering Llama initiative once heralded as a cornerstone of its artificial intelligence roadmap, is now grappling with a significant exodus of key contributors. Of the fourteen researchers whose names adorn the seminal 2023 paper that unveiled Llama, only three, research scientist Hugo Touvron, research engineer Xavier Martinet, and technical program leader Faisal Azhar, remain at Meta . The Llama team left for competition The other eleven team members, or 78% of the researchers, have largely departed to either join or establish rival ventures, leaving Meta’s flagship open-source project without much of its original creative force. Nowhere is this talent drain more conspicuous than at Mistral, a Paris-based AI upstart founded by Guillaume Lample and Timothée Lacroix, both instrumental architects of Llama’s initial design. Alongside a cadre of fellow Meta alumni, they are hard at work developing new open-source models that directly challenge Meta’s offerings. This also comes as reports have indicated top AI firms are on a serious talent hunt, paying large sums of money to fish top AI researchers to join their teams. As for Meta, the migration of expertise has prompted observers to question whether Meta can continue to hold onto top researchers at a moment when the company faces increasing scepticism about its own AI ambitions. Compounding Meta’s internal challenges, the company recently announced a delay in the release of Behemoth, its largest-ever AI model, in response to concerns raised by employees over its performance and direction. Meanwhile, developers have remained largely muted at Llama 4, the latest iteration in the model series. Many are now favoring open-source alternatives, such as DeepSeek and Qwen, that promise more rapid innovation and cutting-edge capabilities. Could Meta be reorganizing its research department? The upheaval in personnel has dovetailed with a shake-up in leadership. Joelle Pineau, who for eight years guided Meta’s Fundamental AI Research ( FAIR ) division, revealed last month that she would be stepping aside. In her wake comes Robert Fergus, a FAIR co-founder who spent half a decade at Google’s DeepMind before rejoining Meta in May 2025. This transition highlights a broader pattern of turnover and reorganization within Meta’s research ranks. Since the publication of the Llama paper, FAIR has quietly lost many of its original talents, even as the company continues to spotlight Llama as the lynchpin of its AI strategy. The question now is whether Meta can defend the lead it once held in open-source model development without much of the team that laid its foundation. At the time of its release, the Llama paper did more than introduce a new model; it conferred legitimacy upon the concept of openly shared large-language-model weights. Unlike proprietary systems such as OpenAI’s GPT-3 or Google’s PaLM, Llama’s architecture, training code, and parameter sets were freely available to researchers and developers. Meta demonstrated that by leveraging only publicly accessible data and optimizing for efficiency, state-of-the-art language models could run on a single GPU, democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities. For a brief period, Meta appeared poised to dominate the open-source frontier. However, two years on, its early advantage has waned. Despite pouring billions into AI research, the company still lacks a dedicated “reasoning” model tailored for tasks that demand multi-step logic, complex problem-solving, or the integration of external tools. In contrast, competitors such as Google and OpenAI have made these features central to their latest releases, further highlighting Meta’s gap. The eleven authors who have left Meta each averaged more than five years with the company, indicating a departure of deeply embedded researchers rather than short-term contractors. Their exits span from January 2023 through the Llama 3 cycle and as recently as early 2025, marking a gradual unravelling of the original Llama team. Meta has acknowledged the departures publicly, with spokespersons pointing to an X post that tracks the career moves of former Llama paper co-authors. While the precise destinations vary, from roles at emerging startups to leadership positions in competing labs, the collective migration reportedly highlights a shift in the AI landscape, where talent follows the most dynamic and open platforms.

With price now retesting the trend line it recently broke above, a breakout run could be imminent. XRP’s ( XRP ) recent price action has unfolded in a textbook bump-and-run reversal structure, a pattern known for signaling major bottoms before large bullish expansions. After breaking above a long-standing dynamic trend line, XRP has pulled back to retest it, a phase known as the “throwback.” This moment is crucial, as a successful hold typically triggers the final “run” phase, historically associated with sharp upside moves. Technically, XRP remains in a strong position as long as this support holds. Key technical points Retest of trend line support in the throwback phase after a strong breakout Multiple bullish candles confirmed above the trend line, shifting market structure Pattern targets expansion if support holds, with potential for new all-time highs XRPUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView XRP is now in the throwback phase, a common technical retest of the trend line previously acting as resistance. The trend line is now serving as support, and price action has so far respected this level. This area is often where traders seek confirmation before a new leg higher. The breakout itself was clear: XRP printed a sequence of strong green candles, decisively flipping structure and signaling a shift in trend momentum. Such a move often marks the transition from a bearish to a bullish market regime, a setup that historically supports continued upside when support is respected. You might also like: DEGEN price prediction: Will key support at $0.00395 trigger a 255% rally? The structure of this bump-and-run follows the classic progression: a long period of resistance along the trend line, followed by a sharp “bump” below it, and now a return into strength. This formation strongly suggests that the accumulation phase may be over, and XRP is positioning for a breakout. What to expect in the coming price action As long as XRP holds above the trend line, the throwback phase remains valid. This sets the stage for the powerful “run” phase, a rapid, high-momentum move that could target new all-time highs in the coming weeks. A failure to hold support would invalidate the pattern, but for now, the technical bias remains firmly bullish.

The price explosion, which has seen HYPE climb to all-time highs and dominate discussions among traders, signals renewed enthusiasm for derivatives trading on decentralized platforms. But beneath the current euphoria, seasoned participants are looking ahead, spotting the early signs of another disruptive force: Mantix (MTX). The Rise of Hyperliquid: A DeFi Success and a Signal for What’s Next Earlier this week, Hyperliquid’s HYPE token soared to an all-time high of $367.24—a milestone reflecting not just a 30% weekly leap, but also a broader appetite for decentralized trading alternatives. This rally brought Hyperliquid’s open interest to an extraordinary $9.37 billion, underscoring its growing role in the evolving world of DeFi. Much of this momentum comes as traditional markets keep a close watch on Bitcoin’s resurgence and as interest spikes in advanced derivatives platforms. One element fueling the excitement around HYPE is Hyperliquid's efforts to create a more transparent and regulatory-compliant environment for DeFi participants. By actively engaging with regulators and pushing for innovative frameworks, Hyperliquid has won support from both large and small investors. The buzz didn’t stay on trading screens for long—it spilled over into crypto forums, Discord channels, and Twitter, with community members celebrating the project’s new milestones. Source: CoinMarketCap Opportunity Beyond the Headlines: Early Investors Seek the Next Wave Yet, as excitement around HYPE’s latest gains reaches a fever pitch, sharp-eyed investors are already scouting for the next crypto to break out. One standout contender is Mantix (MTX)—a project quietly building momentum while still flying under the mainstream radar. Mantix (MTX) Quietly Emerges: Why Early Adopters Are Taking Notice Unlike many speculative tokens, Mantix (MTX) is building a strong foundation before the masses arrive.

Mantix captures this spirit by making advanced DeFi tools not only powerful, but also accessible. Its platform supports zero-barrier entry, while providing the muscle and reliability once limited to established giants. Mantix’s presale is rapidly catching the attention of those who missed the early HYPE wave.

A recent crypto survey of Korean crypto investors provides some fascinating insights, suggesting a notable shift in sentiment, particularly concerning FTX payouts and future Bitcoin price prediction . What’s the Latest on Crypto Market Sentiment Among Koreans? According to a survey conducted by Bitcoin World and Cratos between May 20 and 23, involving 2,000 individuals, the overall mood among Korean crypto investors appears to be cooling slightly from previous bullishness. Here’s a quick look at the breakdown of overall sentiment: Optimistic or Extremely Optimistic: 27.5% Neutral: 43.2% Fear or Extreme Fear: 29.3% While a large portion remains neutral, the nearly 30% expressing fear indicates underlying caution in the market. How Has the Bitcoin Price Prediction Changed? The survey specifically tracked weekly trends for Bitcoin price prediction . The results show a clear shift away from strong bullish expectations compared to the previous week. Here’s a comparison: Expectation This Week (May 20-23) Last Week Increase or Significantly Jump 37.6% 49.4% Stable Market 35.8% 27.3% Decline or Sharp Drop 26.7% 23.5% The percentage of investors expecting an increase dropped significantly, while those predicting a stable or declining market rose. This suggests a more cautious short-term outlook on Bitcoin price prediction among this group. Are FTX Payouts Bullish or Bearish? Korean Investors Weigh In A major point of discussion in the market has been the impact of the second phase of repayments to FTX creditors , scheduled for May 30 and expected to return over $5 billion. The survey asked respondents how this event might influence the market. The responses were mixed, but a significant majority leaned towards a neutral or negative impact: Bullish (Liquidity Boost): 26.9% Bearish (Catalyst Faded): 41.7% No Impact (Macro Factors Key): 31.4% Interestingly, the largest group (41.7%) viewed the FTX payouts as bearish. Their reasoning? They believe the positive effect of the news or the anticipation has already worn off, suggesting the market may have already priced it in or simply moved on to other concerns. Another substantial group (31.4%) felt the payouts would have no real impact, emphasizing that broader macroeconomic factors are the primary drivers of the market right now. What Can We Learn from This Crypto Survey ? This crypto survey highlights a few key takeaways from the perspective of Korean crypto investors : Cooling Bullishness: Short-term expectations for Bitcoin price increases have diminished compared to the previous week. Cautious Sentiment: While neutrality is common, a notable percentage of investors feel fear. FTX Payouts Are Not Seen as a Positive Catalyst: A large segment views the repayments as bearish because the market reaction is perceived to have already happened, or they simply see other factors as more important. Understanding the sentiment of groups like Korean crypto investors is crucial as they represent a significant part of the global market. Their views on events like FTX payouts and their collective Bitcoin price prediction can offer valuable insights into potential market movements and overall crypto market sentiment . Conclusion: A Shifting Tide? The latest crypto survey from Bitcoin World and Cratos suggests a nuanced picture among Korean crypto investors . While not overwhelmingly bearish across the board, there’s a clear reduction in short-term bullish expectations for Bitcoin and a dominant view that the much-discussed FTX payouts will not serve as a positive market catalyst, with many believing the impact has faded or that macro factors are more influential. This snapshot of sentiment provides a valuable perspective on the current state of the crypto market sentiment in a key region.

In the wake of trade talks, Trump and other top officials have begun acknowledging they will have to set new tariff rates on many countries when they hit the July 9 deadline for their so-called reciprocal tariffs to kick back in. Trump said during a trip to the United Arab Emirates last week that the U.S. has 150 countries that want to make a deal. Trump makes trade deals with some countries TRUMP: ""Countries from all over the world want to make trade deals with us."" pic.twitter.com/Dzz00q6Kfz — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) May 26, 2025 The U.S has been vague about what may happen if deals are not reached, with Trump promising that he would send out new tariff numbers. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested over the weekend that the White House could establish regional tariff rates or revert to the higher April 2 rates for countries that are not negotiating in good faith . President Trump reversed course Sunday evening on his threats to impose high tariffs on the EU following talks with the bloc’s head, Ursula von der Leyen. He agreed to delay new tariff implementations from the June 1 deadline for a 50% tariff on the European Union to at least July 9. “The wind has come out of the sails a bit on a lot of the trade deal push. I don’t think anyone expected 90 deals in 90 days. But I do think we did expect a little more in terms of quick deals to keep things moving.” -Scott Lincicome, Vice President of Economics at the Free-Market Cato Institute. The White House and the Indian government agreed to finalize Phase 1 of a broader bilateral trade deal by fall. The two trading partners aim to increase bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. Rajesh Agrawal, India’s chief negotiator and special secretary in the Department of Commerce, returned from a four-day visit to Washington last week, where he held direct talks with the U.S. on the contours of the interim deal. Vietnam faces a 46% levy if it does not reach an agreement with the U.S. by early July, which could decline exports to the U.S. that contribute 30% of annual gross domestic product. A person familiar with the talks said the terms of the agreement proposed by the U.S. were terrible, signaling a long-term agreement may prove elusive. The U.S. also expects a delegation of Japan’s officials in Washington on Friday for a third round of talks. Japan still demands that the White House remove all tariffs imposed on the country as part of any deal, including the baseline 10% tariffs the U.S. set for imports worldwide. The U.S. and the UK agreed to maintain the 10% tariff, while top economic officials like Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have maintained the duty is non-negotiable. U.S. faces tensions with some countries amid trade negotiations Other nations are waiting for the White House to engage in trade talks, with Thailand submitting a term sheet to the U.S. earlier this month. The country offered to cut tariffs on agricultural goods, but geopolitical tensions between the two countries have made the U.S. reluctant to engage. China and the U.S. agreed to de-escalate tariffs last week. Still, tensions between the two countries spiked after the Department of Commerce issued guidance suggesting some silicon chips made by Huawei may violate export controls. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, said that on Friday, Beijing will take firm measures to defend its right to development and Chinese businesses’ legitimate rights and interests. Both nations agreed to set up a mechanism to continue trade talks, but the U.S. still maintains a 30% tariff on goods from China. Politics are hampering talks with South Korea as the country is currently under a placeholder government after its former President, Yoon Suk Yeol, was removed from office earlier this year. The country is awaiting presidential elections on June 3, pushing any deal-making until later that month. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

At a point when Bitcoin (BTC) has made a new all-time high, traders may be losing their patience with the native asset of the BNB Chain as it has failed to deliver the kind of gains that they would normally expect. Alphractal , a crypto analytics firm, noted an interesting divergence in on-chain data between whales and retail investors’ activities. Something Strange Is Happening With BNB! Whales are showing more interest in shorting than retail, and this is especially true for BNB compared to other altcoins. Another key observation: buy pressure has dropped to relatively lower levels compared to last week, leading to… pic.twitter.com/dQqeUHafO4 — Alphractal (@Alphractal) May 23, 2025 It appears that whales have been shorting BNB at a faster pace than retail investors. Does the market’s ‘smart money’ know something that lay investors don’t? On-chain data shows that BNB is the only token that is experiencing this kind of selling pressure from whales. Whales may be shorting BNB to trap bears and eventually pull a short squeeze by pushing the price higher to trigger a large volume of stop orders. This would result in a sharp short-term climb for BNB Coin. If this turns out to be the case, it would support a bullish BNB Coin price forecast in the near term. BNB Coin Price Prediction: Bullish Breakout Could Push BNB to $828 Looking at the daily chart, BNB has found strong selling pressure at around $690, but is still on an uptrend as shown in the chart. The token’s short-term exponential moving averages (EMAs) have sent buy indicators as the 9-day and 21-day EMAs have made a ‘golden cross’ above the 200-day EMA. Meanwhile, momentum indicators show solid trend strength as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 62. It is highly likely that BNB will retest the $690 shortly. The key psychological resistance to watch for this token would be the $700. A bullish breakout above this level could mark the beginning of a strong uptrend and may confirm a short-squeeze. The first target for a short-term BNB Coin price prediction could be set at $828 based on the ascending triangle’s height, which is typically used as a reference. As the crypto market continues to recover, the best crypto presales like Best Wallet will likely outperform well-established tokens like BNB Coin (BNB). Here’s what makes this new token so attractive for early buyers. Best Wallet (BEST) Raises Nearly $13M to Launch Its New Crypto Wallet Best Wallet (BEST) plans to become the ultimate Web 3 storage solution by introducing new features and tools that help users make the most out of their crypto holdings. This solution supports assets in 60 different blockchains and will soon launch a low-fee decentralized exchange (DEX). In addition, a tool called Upcoming Tokens helps investors identify the most promising initial coin offerings (ICOs) like Pepe Unchained (PEPU), whose crypto presale delivered 500% gains to investors this year. $BEST is the utility token of the Best Wallet ecosystem. Once the solution is embraced by a high number of users who enjoy this wallet’s low swap fees and other attractive tools, its price will explode. To buy $BEST at its discounted presale price of $0.025085, head to the Best Wallet website and connect your wallet or you can download the Best Wallet app in case you don’t have one. You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token to make your investment or use a bank card.

A Ripple Labs co-founder founded XLM and these two PayFiprojects’ goal centers around streamlining payment processes. However, this article is not about Ripple or Stellar. It is about a new viral crypto called Mantix , predicted to be the top crypto for 2025 following how fast the first stage of its presale is selling out with potential 100x returns. XRP price analysis Ripple Labs’ RLUSD stablecoin is fast attracting market-wide interest following its market cap recent rise above $300 million. The project is also in talks to acquire Circle, the creator of USDC, an event that would make Ripple the second-biggest stablecoin after Tether. According to the daily charts, the XRP price has created an inverse head and shoulders pattern. This crypto has also risen narrowly above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). XRP price chart | Source: TradingView Hence, there's a fair chance the XRP price will retest the year-to-date high of $3.4. However, there is still a chance of further declines. Stellar (XLM) price prediction There are multiple catalysts for Stellar Lumens (XLM). From becoming a major player in the tokenization industry, thanks to the Franklin Templeton Money Fund, which has over $400 million in assets, to partnership prospects with top brands like Mastercard, MoneyGram, Visa and UNICEF, the Stellar payment platform has a credible case. XLM price chart | Source: TradingView According to the Stellar daily price chart, the XLM price has also created an inverse head and shoulders pattern and a declining wedge pattern. Stellar has also risen above the 50-day moving average, signaling there might be an eventual rebound to the 2024 high of $0.6415. While this sounds promising, Stellar investors like Ripple’s have assessed the odds and chosen to bet on the new viral Mantix project. Why Stellar and Ripple investors believe Mantix ($MTX) will be the top crypto for 2025 As Stellar moves toward a potential rebound and Ripple’s recent activities increase belief in its bullish chances, investors are increasingly confident that this new viral crypto stealing the spotlight, Mantix, is where to be. It is currently in Stage 1 and market observers explain why. From being a full-featured trading ecosystem developed to deliver deep liquidity, real-time cross-chain functionality and leverage options that go up to 1000x to how it combines the power of blockchain with the flexibility traders need seamlessly, there's a lot going for Mantix ($MTX) . There's all to desire with its ultra-low trading fees and seamless swap feature. Still, it gets more exciting that the project’s native token, $MTX, is backed by several utilities. Holding $MTX earns you a share of the platform revenues based on how much you hold. That is passive rewards without having to stake or lock up liquidity directly. Token holders can also vote on proposals and governance processes, making Mantix more democratic and responsive to its users and the growth of its community. While Stellar and Ripple make headlines with their market activities, Mantix is creating long-term momentum from scratch and early adopters are betting big that it could be the top crypto for 2025.

In its updated prospectus for its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), BlackRock mentions quantum computing under its “risk factors” section. Quantum computers are considered by many to be a potential threat to Bitcoin due to their theoretical ability to, in the future, override the cryptographic schemes that secure blockchains. While quantum computers have not yet demonstrated an ability to come anywhere close to threatening Bitcoin, BlackRock says it, along with other technological advances, could render the flagship cryptocurrency “flawed and ineffective.” “…In the past, flaws in the source code for digital assets have been exposed and exploited, including flaws that disabled some functionality for users, exposed users’ personal information and/or resulted in the theft of users’ digital assets. The cryptography underlying Bitcoin could prove to be flawed or ineffective, or developments in mathematics and/or technology, including advances in digital computing, algebraic geometry and quantum computing, could result in such cryptography becoming ineffective. In any of these circumstances, a malicious actor may be able to compromise the security of the Bitcoin network or take the Trust’s Bitcoin, which would adversely affect the value of the Shares. Moreover, the functionality of the Bitcoin network may be negatively affected such that it is no longer attractive to users, thereby dampening demand for Bitcoin. Even if another digital asset other than bitcoin were affected by similar circumstances, any reduction in confidence in the source code or cryptography underlying digital assets generally could negatively affect the demand for digital assets and therefore adversely affect the value of the Shares. Moreover, because digital assets, including bitcoin, have been in existence for a short period of time and are continuing to develop, there may be additional risks in the future that are impossible to predict as of the date of this prospectus.” BlacRock’s IBIT – which is believed to be the most successful ETF of all time, currently has $70.1 billion worth of Bitcoin backing it.

He believes Ripple Labs’ attempt to buy Circle could help make the crypto industry more open and fair, especially for smaller projects. This could reduce the power of a few large companies that currently control key parts of the market. Ripple and Coinbase Compete for Circle Ripple and Coinbase are both bidding to buy Circle , the company behind the USDC stablecoin. USDC is one of the most used stablecoins in the crypto market. Reportedly, both companies are willing to spend billions of dollars. Ripple is ahead in the race. A few weeks ago, the fintech company reportedly offered Circle $4 to $5 billion, but that offer was rejected. Later, there were talks that Ripple increased the offer to $20 billion, although this has not been confirmed. Notably, there has been no official news on the deal details because May 26 is a public holiday in the U.S. Many, including angel investor Paul Barron, believe Ripple will win the deal and become the new owner of USDC. This could change a lot in the stablecoin space. Cardano Supports Ripple in the Deal Hoskinson raised concerns about the growing control of a few large companies in the crypto industry. He said firms like Coinbase, now facing a new class action lawsuit , along with Circle and a16z, have built a system that mainly serves their interests. He said that growing a project outside of their group can be very difficult. Smaller projects may struggle to get listed on exchanges, gain access to stablecoins, or find enough trading support. He believes this is holding the crypto space back and making it difficult for new ideas to succeed. Furthermore, he supports Ripple in this deal. He believes Ripple would be a better leader for the stablecoin market and could help bring more fairness to the crypto world. Possible Partnership Between Ripple and Cardano Ripple and Cardano have always shown interest in working together. In late 2024, both CEOs spoke kindly of each other. Soon after, Hoskinson said Cardano might support Ripple’s stablecoin. Cardano is already in talks with Ripple to add its stablecoin, RLUSD, now live on Aave , to the Cardano blockchain. Hoskinson said his team is willing to do the work for free because they support Ripple’s community. In April, Ripple released a video about the future of tokenization, which briefly showed the Cardano logo. This led to more talk about a possible partnership, but nothing official has been confirmed.

Understanding what tokens and topics are capturing the attention of local investors and enthusiasts is crucial for anyone looking to grasp the pulse of this significant market. Last week, from May 16 to 22, the Korean Crypto Community was buzzing with activity, and thanks to data from Bitcoin World, we have a clear picture of the Top Crypto Keywords that dominated searches and discussions. What Were the Top Crypto Searches in South Korea? Search volume often indicates initial interest or curiosity about a particular asset. When the Korean Crypto Community is searching for a token, it suggests they are actively researching it, possibly considering investment, or reacting to recent news. Here are the tokens that saw the highest search volumes on Bitcoin World during the specified week: Rank Token Search Volume 1 XRP 63,860 2 ETH 26,055 3 BTC 24,968 4 NXPC 14,247 5 ONDO 14,202 6 SUI 12,208 7 OM 10,461 8 MOVE 8,569 9 TRUMP 8,201 10 SOL 7,059 It’s clear that XRP took the top spot by a significant margin, indicating strong ongoing interest, likely fueled by its legal developments and market performance. Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) follow, which is typical as they are major market indicators and investment staples. The presence of several altcoins like NXPC, ONDO, SUI, OM, MOVE, TRUMP, and SOL in the top 10 highlights the diverse interests within the community and their focus on specific narratives or projects that may have been gaining traction during that week. Which Tokens Sparked the Most Discussion? Beyond just searching, the level of discussion or mentions within the community forums and chats provides insight into which tokens are actively being talked about, debated, or shared among enthusiasts. This often reflects sentiment, recent news reactions, or trading activity. Here are the tokens that were most frequently mentioned by the Korean Crypto Community : Rank Token Mention Volume 1 BTC 1,966 2 ETH 785 3 XRP 336 4 OM 232 5 SOL 202 6 TRUMP 173 7 SUI 161 8 NXPC 117 9 ONDO 64 10 AAVE 57 Here, Bitcoin leads the pack in mentions, reinforcing its status as the primary topic of discussion in the broader market context. Ethereum and XRP remain high on the list, indicating consistent interest and conversation. Interestingly, several of the altcoins that appeared in the search list (OM, SOL, TRUMP, SUI, NXPC, ONDO) also feature prominently in the mentions list, suggesting that initial searches translated into active community dialogue. The appearance of AAVE in the mentions list, despite not being in the top searches, could indicate discussions around DeFi or specific platform developments relevant to the community. Analyzing the Crypto Trends South Korea Revealed Comparing the search and mention data offers valuable insights into the Crypto Trends South Korea experienced during this period. Several key observations stand out: Major Cryptos are Staples: Bitcoin , Ethereum, and XRP consistently rank high in both searches and mentions. This confirms their foundational role in the market and as constant points of interest and discussion for the Korean Crypto Community . Altcoin Discovery and Discussion: Tokens like NXPC, ONDO, SUI, OM, TRUMP, and SOL show strong interest across both metrics. This suggests the community is actively exploring and discussing a range of altcoins, likely driven by potential price movements, new project developments, or specific market narratives (e.g., meme coins like TRUMP, or specific sector tokens). Search vs. Mention Dynamics: While XRP had exceptionally high search volume, Bitcoin led in mentions. This might imply a large number of individuals were independently looking up XRP , perhaps reacting to specific news or price action, while Bitcoin served as a more general, overarching topic for community-wide discussion and sentiment sharing. Emerging Tokens: The presence of less commonly cited tokens like NXPC, ONDO, OM, and MOVE in the top searches and mentions highlights the community’s focus on identifying potential opportunities beyond the mainstream. Understanding the narratives around these specific tokens would provide deeper context into the week’s activities. This data from Bitcoin World provides a snapshot of the Top Crypto Keywords that were front of mind for the Korean Crypto Community . It underscores the market’s engagement with both established assets and a dynamic set of altcoins. Why Does Understanding These Keywords Matter? For investors, analysts, and projects, monitoring community sentiment and search/mention data in key markets like South Korea is incredibly valuable. It can: Identify Emerging Trends: Spotting tokens like NXPC or OM rising in searches/mentions early can signal growing interest before it becomes widely apparent. Gauge Market Sentiment: High search volume for a token might indicate FOMO or FUD depending on the context, while discussion volume shows the intensity of community engagement. Inform Strategy: Projects can understand if their token is gaining traction, and exchanges or platforms can tailor their offerings and content to align with what the community is focused on. The insights derived from analyzing the Top Crypto Keywords used by the Korean Crypto Community offer a powerful lens into one of the world’s most active crypto markets.

Aside from the crypto's impact on the market, the imminent expiry of BTC options has fueledspeculations. In particular, almost $14 billion in options are set to expire in the new week, an event that might spark immense volatility in the market and affect Bitcoin price prediction. This event also strengthened the market-wide belief that Bitcoin’s price at $107,000 would be a resistance level. Hence, there's been a massive exodus of traders from the Bitcoinecosystem and an influx into Mantix , a newbie setting the pace in the DeFi market. With its presale just kicking off its first stage, optimism is high for a sky-high 100x ROI. Bitcoin price prediction amid largest options expiry of 2025 Bitcoin price drifted across the $108,000 range on May 24 as markets prepare for the biggest monthly options expiry of 2025. Derivatives data from Laevitas.ch reports that over $13.8 billion worth of Bitcoin options will expire on May 30 and bulls are making last-ditch attempts to pin the price over $110,000. Source: Laevitas.ch The latest spot price action at press time puts bulls in control, as BTC has risen by 25% in the past 30 days. This price action stunned bearish traders who had created short positions across futures and options markets. Recent reports show open interest in Bitcoin futures at $79 billion, with a considerable part of this figure linked to sell-side exposure. Indeed, the bulls would love a Bitcoin price prediction that sees a breakout above $110,000 and are making efforts to ensure that. Still, the chances of a bearish turn are just as high. That explains why an increasing number of investors have switched portfolios to the new fast-growing Mantix project. How is Mantix attracting Bitcoin traders with one of the biggest altcoin potentials this year?

Should these expectations materialize, analysts believe XRP could see significant long-term gains. Analyst Weighs In on Ripple’s Strategic Potential Adding perspective to the conversation, the well-known pseudonymous X account “Kate Young Ju” — linked to Ki Young Ju, the founder of blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant — weighed in on the matter in a recent post. XRP gives off the vibe of a league of capital market pros. It’s got its flaws, but there’s something undeniably sharp about how it moves. There’s a rumor floating around that Ripple might acquire Circle. I don’t know if it’s true, but if it is, it’d be a very strategic move.… — Kate The Alt (@kate_young_ju) May 21, 2025 “XRP gives off the impression of a team of seasoned capital market experts,” the account remarked. “Sure, it has its shortcomings, but you can’t ignore the precision in its market behavior.” The commentary touched on the growing rumors about Ripple possibly pursuing an acquisition of Circle, framing such a move as a calculated step for Ripple as it sharpens its focus on payments and liquidity solutions. A Game-Changing Deal on the Horizon? Timestabloid recently reported that Circle has initiated informal discussions with Ripple and Coinbase , exploring the possibility of an acquisition. According to sources familiar with the matter, Circle is aiming for a sale valuation of no less than $5 billion — aligning closely with its anticipated valuation for its planned Initial Public Offering (IPO). The analyst highlighted that the rising appetite for stablecoins among institutional players — both within the crypto sphere and in traditional finance — could amplify interest in XRP if such a deal were finalized. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional Investors Could Shift Toward XRP With major investors eagerly watching the evolution of the stablecoin market, the analyst suggested that Ripple’s potential acquisition of Circle could reshape capital flows. Specifically, investors who were gearing up to back Circle’s IPO may instead divert attention — and funds — toward XRP as the broader ecosystem strengthens. “There’s chatter going around that Ripple might be looking to acquire Circle,” the analyst shared. “I can’t confirm if it’s accurate, but if it happens, it would be a brilliant strategic play . With the immense institutional interest in the stablecoin sector, those eyeing Circle’s IPO might pivot to XRP investments instead. Just to clarify — this is an independent observation; I don’t hold any XRP, nor is this a sponsored post.” What’s Next for XRP? As speculation gains momentum, the Ripple community is keeping a close watch on any developments. A successful deal with Circle would not only bolster Ripple’s position in the stablecoin arena but could also pave the way for greater institutional involvement with XRP, further fueling its long-term growth narrative. While these discussions remain unconfirmed, they signal the increasing convergence between traditional financial interests and the evolving crypto landscape, with XRP potentially standing at the center of the next wave of institutional engagement.

Legal experts are assessing how existing ethics and disclosure statutes apply to assets held in revocable trusts controlled by relatives of sitting presidents. Financial market analysts say the scale of the raise could affect liquidity in major digital assets if deployed aggressively. Trump Media & Technology Group is preparing to raise $3 billion to purchase digital assets, including Bitcoin, according to a Financial Times report published on May 27. The company, which operates Truth Social and is controlled by President Donald Trump’s family, is planning a $2 billion equity offering alongside a $1 billion convertible bond. The deal structure remains subject to change, though sources told the FT that interest in the offering has grown in recent weeks. Trump Media Eyes Crypto Market Expansion According to people familiar with the matter, the fundraising initiative may be formally announced during a crypto industry event in Las Vegas this week. Scheduled speakers include Vice President JD Vance, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and crypto policy advisor David Sacks. If completed, the capital raise would be one of the largest direct investments in cryptocurrency by a media entity. It would also expand the Trump family’s business activity in the sector, which includes two meme coins, an NFT trading card venture, and a stake in a stablecoin platform. The company’s public response to the FT report was dismissive. “Apparently, the Financial Times has dumb writers listening to even dumber sources,” it said in a statement. Trump transferred his majority stake in the company, valued at approximately $3 billion, to a revocable trust managed by Donald Trump Jr. after he re-entered office. TMTG’s approach resembles that of other firms that have acquired large amounts of Bitcoin through debt and equity markets, such as MicroStrategy. Shares of TMTG closed Friday at $25.72, valuing the firm at nearly $6 billion. “THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL” has PASSED the House of Representatives! This is arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country! The Bill includes MASSIVE Tax CUTS, No Tax on Tips, No Tax on Overtime, Tax Deductions when… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 22, 2025 President’s Activity Sparks Ethics Concerns Trump has publicly supported the expansion of crypto access and has pledged to make the United States a leading center for digital assets. Last week, he hosted a private dinner for investors in his personal meme coin project at his golf club. The planned capital raise places Trump Media in a position to act not just as a participant in crypto markets but as a large holder of digital assets under the direction of the president’s family. That development adds pressure on lawmakers to clarify the boundaries between officeholders and private financial exposure. It also raises new concerns about how policy decisions may be shaped when those in power hold material interests in the industries they oversee. The current ethics and disclosure rules may not fully account for the structure or opacity of digital asset holdings. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Could a sitting president’s family trust legally hold large digital asset positions? Current law does not prohibit family-managed trusts from holding such assets, but ethics experts warn that this creates a gray area when the officeholder may benefit indirectly. How does this differ from previous presidential financial entanglements? Unlike prior examples centered on real estate or hospitality, this case involves volatile, lightly regulated assets with price sensitivity to policy decisions. What additional oversight mechanisms exist for revocable trusts? Revocable trusts are often exempt from public disclosure unless income is transferred directly. This limits what the public or Congress can review in real time.

The move would position the company to follow the footsteps of crypto treasury companies like Strategy. Trump Media will issue $2 billion in equity and $1 billion in convertible bonds, a type of asset that can be converted into equity at a later date. The size of the raise may change, the FT cited sources familiar with the matter as saying. The equity is expected to be sold at market price as of the close on May 23. On that day, the share price closed at $25.72, marking a 4.6% increase on the day. Trump Media’s market capitalization was $5.7 billion as of May 23.

Cardano (ADA), is gaining traction thanks to its efficient proof-of-stake model and growing ecosystem of DeFi projects. Ripple (XRP) remains a top coin as it benefits from increased clarity in U.S. regulation. Solana (SOL) is back in the spotlight due to its lightning-fast transactions and growing meme coins and DeFi presence. But the real buzz is around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a low-price DeFi altcoin with analysts predicting exponential gains in 2025. The project is currently in Presale Phase 5 already raking in over $9.3 million with over 11,500 investors participating. With a public launch price of $0.06 after upcoming stages, phase 5 investors at the current price of $0.025 are in line for potential gains of 100% by the time the token hits exchanges. As BTC leads the charge, these four altcoins are generating massive investor interest. Altcoins Poised for Growth in 2025 Currently, Cardano (ADA) is trading at $0.82, reflecting a modest uptick. Analysts anticipate ADA could reach $1.88 by year-end, contingent on continued development and market momentum. Ripple (XRP) is currently priced around $2.45, with projections suggesting a potential rise to $5.50 by the end of 2025, driven by factors such as ETF approvals and broader adoption. Solana (SOL) is trading near $186.35, with analysts forecasting a possible surge to $336.25 in 2025, supported by its growing ecosystem and investor interest. While these established altcoins show promise, emerging projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also capturing investor attention for their potential in the crypto market. Mutuum Finance: Genuine Innovation in DeFi Lending Different from the legacy tokens, Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself by being the innovative two-lending scheme that includes Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality. With P2C, individuals get to freeze stablecoins in smart contract pools whose interest rates automatically adjust dynamically. The P2P, as opposed to that, bypasses intermediaries so that lending contract control rests directly with users. It all gives rise to an extremely effective and variable lending system. Security and transparency are built into the core of the project. Mutuum Finance is being third-party audited, and their open-source smart contracts are secure in design while creating trust among users. The platform is also set to be compatible with non-EVM and EVM blockchains, and the gates swing wider with more liquidity in other ecosystems. Presale Momentum At today’s $0.03, the MUTM token is of huge interest to early investors. A 16.67% price jump will give the token a boost to $0.035 in the next phase. With a listing price of $0.06 and some analysts predicting post-launch prices of up to $3, there’s plenty of room for early investors to make a profit. This has made Mutuum Finance one of the most-watched low-market-price DeFi plays. With Bitcoin smashing through $110,000, focus shifts to breakout altcoins, and leading the pack is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With over $9.3 million raised from 11,500+ investors, the $0.03 presale price now translates to a projected 100% profit at the $0.06 launch. In contrast to most tokens, MUTM’s innovative dual lending model (P2C + P2P), cross-chain capability, and live smart contract audit offer concrete DeFi utility. As ADA, XRP, and SOL prepare for 2025 profits, Mutuum is the low-cap secret gem with tremendous upside.

Originally created as a meme coin, Dogecoin surprised even its early supporters when it surged 120x, reaching an all-time high during the 2021 bull market. The climb was fueled by internet culture, celebrity endorsements, and a viral social media presence rather than technical value or real-world utility. While the returns were undeniable, they were also unpredictable, built on waves of speculation that left many retail investors chasing fleeting momentum. Dogecoin’s story serves as a classic example of what viral excitement can achieve. But for serious investors looking for exponential growth with a stable foundation, hype alone is not enough. That’s where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the picture—a rising star in decentralized finance (DeFi), purpose-built for lasting performance and long-term impact. A different kind of growth engine Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not trying to ride a social media trend or court celebrity tweets. It’s a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol that delivers real value through utility. It enables users to act as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators within a secure and automated ecosystem. With over 11,000 holders already and nearly $9.2 million raised in Phase 5 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building strong early momentum, all while flying under the mainstream radar. The current price of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sits at just $0.03. At this level, a $1,000 investment today translates to approximately 33,333 tokens. With the project confidently forecasted to reach 200x in the next bullish cycle, that same investment grows into $200,000. And this isn’t wishful thinking—this is backed by fundamentals, protocol design, and a clear development roadmap. A utility-driven ecosystem Unlike meme coins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) exists to solve real financial problems in the DeFi space. The platform allows anyone to supply crypto assets into liquidity pools to earn passive interest, while borrowers can access over-collateralized loans by depositing digital assets as security. The lending model is pooled, meaning lenders do not need to match with borrowers directly. Instead, the protocol handles liquidity management using automated smart contracts. Interest rates adjust dynamically based on supply and demand, offering balanced returns for lenders and manageable borrowing conditions. Even more importantly, lenders receive mtTokens—a tokenized representation of their deposits that automatically accrues interest over time. These tokens can also be staked to earn passive dividends through a unique buyback-and-distribute mechanism from protocol revenue, rewarding long-term contributors with MUTM tokens. This structure isn’t based on empty promises or hype—it’s built on the proven mechanics of decentralized finance, enhanced by a user-centric model and robust liquidity systems. Built for the future Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just another DeFi project. It’s creating a sustainable financial framework where users have full control over their funds and can engage with capital markets without giving up their assets. All deposits remain in non-custodial smart contracts, offering users both security and transparency. When a user borrows, they’re not selling their tokens but leveraging them, retaining potential gains while unlocking liquidity for other uses. The roadmap is clear and ambitious, with the beta version of the platform scheduled to go live as the token launches. This early functionality will showcase Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s lending and borrowing system in action, further building trust with the community and investors. To generate even more excitement, the team has also launched a $100,000 giveaway campaign, rewarding early participants and encouraging engagement. What separates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from projects like Dogecoin (DOGE) is sustainability. While Dogecoin (DOGE) relied on celebrity tweets and community memes, MUTM delivers consistent value through its lending protocol and interest-generating model. This makes it a serious contender for long-term gains, particularly for investors who understand the risks of chasing virality over substance. Projects that are grounded in utility, like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), attract a different class of investor—those looking for strategic opportunities instead of quick flips. This shift from hype to purpose creates healthier market behavior and rewards those who take the time to understand the protocol’s inner workings. Moreover, the absence of deposit limits and flexible borrowing terms makes the platform more accessible to a wide range of users, from retail traders to professional DeFi strategists. Whether you’re staking for dividends or borrowing against your crypto to invest in other opportunities, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers the tools to succeed in today’s competitive DeFi environment. Dogecoin (DOGE) gave us a spectacular rally fueled by excitement and cultural buzz. But true investment success in crypto now demands more than a viral tweet. It requires substance, utility, and intelligent design—qualities that define Mutuum Finance (MUTM). At just $0.03 with massive upside and a powerful platform preparing for launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not a meme—it’s a movement. As hype fades and the market shifts toward real value, those who recognized the vision early are set to gain the most. With a 200x trajectory and solid fundamentals, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t aiming to follow in Dogecoin’s footsteps—it’s aiming to lead a new generation of data-backed, utility-driven crypto projects.

The current price is confined between $1.75 and $2.50, with immediate support at $1.31 and resistance at $2.80. Additional support at $0.56 and resistance at $3.55 provide further context. Bullish sentiment dominates the long-term outlook, though slight bearish pressure is evident. Trading strategies focused on these levels could be advantageous for navigating the current market environment. Cardano Analysis: Trends and Key Level Insights ADA experienced a modest gain of about 7.14% over the past month while showing a decline of roughly 20.40% over the past six months. Price movement over these periods reflects variability with short-term strength but a longer-term downtrend. Volume and sentiment may have influenced this mixed performance during recent trading sessions. Current trading sits within a range of $0.5467 to $0.7807, with immediate resistance around $0.88 and support near $0.4123. Further markers are at $1.11 and $0.1783. Trend indicators remain neutral, suggesting that caution is needed. Traders may consider operating within these levels until a clearer trend emerges, with bulls facing challenges against current resistance. Conclusion XRP is poised to keep its uptrend and may reach new heights as summer approaches. Cardano 's ADA also demonstrates strong potential, bouncing off key support levels. Both coins signify optimism for investors looking for gains. The current trends suggest ongoing positive momentum for both XRP and ADA.

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is set to lower the Official Cash Rate by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent at its policy meeting on Wednesday in Wellington, according to 22 out of 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg . One respondent expects a larger, 50-point reduction. The Monetary Policy Committee is also expected to indicate that the OCR might fall below 3 percent before the end of the year. “We see the RBNZ’s OCR profile being revised down by around 20 basis points to around 2.9 percent by the end of 2025,” said Kelly Eckhold, chief economist at Westpac in Auckland. “Beyond this meeting, a data-dependent easing bias seems likely.” Last month, the RBNZ noted that it had room to drive rates lower as US tariffs pose downside risks to both activity and inflation. While some trade tensions have eased, uncertainty remains, and it is expected to weigh on New Zealand’s rebound from last year’s recession. The bank will publish its rate decision at 2 p.m. local time on Wednesday, followed by a press conference with Governor Christian Hawkesby at 3 p.m. It will also release updated economic forecasts, which should shed light on how deeply global trade strains could dent growth. Economists view US-China trade war as “net negative” to New Zealand “Despite tariff de-escalation, we continue to view the US-China trade war as a net negative to the New Zealand economy and inflation over the medium term,” said Wesley Tanuvasa, an economist at ASB Bank in Auckland. “Pronounced uncertainty means the RBNZ will want optionality on policy moves, so we’d expect cautious, data- and event-dependent commentary on the outlook for monetary policy.” Recent indicators have painted a mixed picture. Unemployment held steady at 5.1 percent in the first quarter, defying forecasts of a rise. Commodity prices remain firm, and measures of inflation expectations have edged higher. Most forecasters, as well as the RBNZ itself, expect headline inflation to pick up toward the top of the central bank’s 1–3 percent target range from its current 2.2 percent pace, before easing back next year. At the same time, the housing market is subdued, business confidence has slipped, and last week’s tight government budget is projected by the Treasury to leave scope for further rate cuts. Some economists predict the OCR will fall to 2.5 percent by year-end, while market pricing implies a fair chance of a move to 2.75 percent. “In this kind of environment, there’s plenty of leeway for strategy to play a role,” said Sharon Zollner, chief New Zealand economist at ANZ Bank in Auckland. “We continue to expect that the RBNZ will ultimately deliver an OCR of 2.5 percent, but we don’t expect them to signal such an outcome at this stage.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The network records skyrocketing new users alongside an uptick in trading volume. The surge follows a broader increase in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity and institutional inroads into crypto assets. New Addresses Tips New Upside Range Avalanche recorded significant gains last week, hitting a new all-time high in active users. According to a Dune report , network addresses soared to 1.95 million after consistently growing in May. This kicks off another bullish trend after the previous attempt in January due to a perceived broader altcoin rally. However, this wave is steered by institutional backing and frenzy in the blockchain gaming ecosystem. The launch of MapleStory Universe, the web3 version of Nexon’s RPG franchise, has boosted network demand, directly impacting sentiments. The game marked over 30 million transactions from 1 million wallets in its test phase, taking it above average in the gaming tier. The platform’s pivot to Avalanche is crucial for performance and scalability and will benefit AVAX holders on a broader scale. Recent activity spikes will drive up demand for staking and gas. While blockchain gaming suffered setbacks in Q1 2025 due to low DeFi activity, industry experts bid a smooth reversal this quarter. Similarly, on-chain data shows non-fungible token (NFT) transactions near the 2 million mark for the first time in two years. This DeFi resurgence has bolstered AVAX holders in the past weeks. When writing, AVAX price trades at $23.15, a 3.5% uptick in 24 hours, while money gains soared above 21%. Following recent network activity, bulls aim to retest the $40 price if it beats the current resistance. The short-term $27 resistance is a key breakout zone for the asset that could lead to a two-phase leap to $34 and $40. Some bulls pitched a parabolic rally to $50, which will rest on huge institutional adoption. BlackRock Backs Avalanche Institutional asset manager BlackRock has contributed immensely to Avalanche’s bullish momentum. The $9 trillion asset manager has launched BUIDL, BlackRock’s tokenized US Dollar treasury fund on Avalanche. This allows users to lock up and trade SBUIDL tokens, expanding the ecosystem to wider users. AVA Labs President John Wu lauded the growth in tokenization and BlackRock’s institutional fund. “ The financial landscape is undergoing a vast transformation. As more institutions move towards tokenization, we see significant leaps towards transformative digital financial services such as BUIDL that address investor demand and bring to bear blockchain-enabled capabilities and differentiators,” he added.",Cryptocurrency|News|Avalanche|AVAX,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|AVAX|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-26 18:40:24

According to a new Associated Press report , crypto investor John Woeltz, 37, allegedly kidnapped another investor, holding him in a Manhattan apartment, where he was beaten and had his family’s lives threatened to get him to give up his Bitcoin wallet passphrase. Woeltz was arrested after the victim escaped and flagged down a traffic officer on the street for help. He is now facing charges of kidnapping, assault, unlawful imprisonment and criminal possession of a firearm. Woeltz is being held without bail, after prosecutors said he was a flight risk due to owning a private jet and a helicopter. Woeltz’s attorney, Wayne Gosnell, declined to comment. The victim, whose name has not been released, recently arrived in New York City from Italy. It is not clear how the victim knew the alleged kidnapper. The abduction is thought to have occurred on May 6th. It appears others were involved in the scheme, including an unnamed unapprehended male. The victim was allegedly bound by the wrists and tortured for weeks inside the apartment, including being drugged, shocked with electricity, hit in the head with a firearm and dangled over a flight of stairs – all to get him to reveal his Bitcoin wallet passphrase so the suspect could steal his digital assets. The victim was reportedly able to flee when the suspect turned his back to retrieve the man’s laptop in another room after he said he would give up the password when he thought the suspect was going to shoot him. When authorities searched the apartment, they said they found cocaine, a saw, chicken wire, body armor and night vision goggles, ammunition and Polaroid photos of the victim with a gun pointed to his head. Woeltz is due back in Manhattan criminal court next week.

The petition , submitted on May 22, 2025, calls for the rescission of Item 1.05 in Form 8-K and the corresponding Form 6-K requirement for foreign private issuers, which mandate the disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents within four business days of determining their significance, citing deep concerns over national security, investor harm, and operational disruption. The groups argue that these requirements have proven burdensome, confusing, and counterproductive to cybersecurity and investor protection. “Premature disclosure of material cyber events has jeopardized incident containment, interfered with law enforcement coordination, and triggered market and legal chaos,” the petition states. U.S. Banking Groups Warn SEC Cyber Disclosure Rule Aids Hackers The SEC’s Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure rule, adopted in July 2023, was intended to enhance transparency and standardize how public companies communicate cybersecurity threats to investors. But critics say it is achieving the opposite. The petition emphasizes that registrants are forced to report incidents even when they remain ongoing, investigations are incomplete, and systems have not been fully remediated, thus potentially handing attackers an advantage. The rule has led to significant confusion over how and when companies should disclose incidents. Despite the SEC’s attempts to clarify through Compliance & Disclosure Interpretations, comment letters, and commissioner guidance, registrants are still struggling to determine whether to report under Item 1.05 and Item 8.01. Source: SIFMA According to the trade groups, this uncertainty has made the rule ineffective and legally risky, exposing firms to litigation and reputational harm while failing to generate actionable information for investors. Notably, the groups warned that ransomware gangs and other cybercriminals have started weaponizing the SEC’s disclosure timeline, using the threat of public exposure as leverage to extort victims. “The incident disclosure requirement has been exploited by ransomware criminals to further malicious objectives,” the petition notes, adding that it may even increase the likelihood of follow-up attacks once firms are known to be vulnerable. The petition’s core is a warning that the SEC’s disclosure rule undermines federal cybersecurity strategy. The groups further argue that releasing details of material cyber incidents into the public domain too early may conflict with confidential reporting requirements under laws like the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA). Investors Better Served by Existing Disclosure Frameworks Despite the SEC’s intent to enhance investor protection, the petition insists that the current cyber incident disclosure rule fails to provide “decision-useful” information to the market. Instead, it risks creating misleading narratives based on incomplete facts while harming the institutions it seeks to regulate. The banking groups argue that existing disclosure obligations such as Regulation S-K Item 105 and the pre-existing materiality framework already compel companies to report significant risks, including cybersecurity threats, in a way that preserves investor interests without compromising national security or company resilience. They assert that investors will still be protected without Item 1.05. “We believe they would be better served through the pre-existing disclosure framework for reporting material information—which may include material cybersecurity incidents—while better mitigating the concerns raised above,” the letter concludes. The SEC has yet to respond to the May 22 petition publicly.As the SEC weighs its next move, the outcome could reshape how U.S. companies balance transparency with cybersecurity resilience in an increasingly hostile ecosystem.

In TD’s latest earnings call, senior vice president and chief financial officer Kelvin Tran says the bank has undertaken a restructuring program to reduce structural costs and “create capacity to invest to build the bank for the future.” As a result of the agenda, Tran says that TD will have to lay off roughly 2,000 employees. “We expect this will result in approximately 2% reduction to our workforce. Whenever possible, we will look to achieve this through attrition, and we will redeploy talent in areas where we are accelerating our capabilities. Through this restructuring program and the strategic review more broadly, we are innovating to drive efficiency and structurally reduce the bank’s cost base.” Raymond Chun, TD Bank group president and CEO, tells shareholders that the bank will be shutting down its $3 billion point-of-sale financing operations in the US, as part of its effort to focus on core businesses. “We also communicated plans to wind down our US point-of-sale financing business, which services third-party retailers. This business is comprised of a series of bespoke arrangements with each retailer, which impacts its profitability and scalability. Exiting this business is accretive to US retail ROE (return on equity) and free up capacity to invest in a proprietary bank card business. In addition, through the strategic review, we are identifying opportunities to innovate to drive efficiencies and operational excellence. We are structurally reducing costs across the bank by taking a disciplined look at our operations and processes to find opportunities to automate and to reengineer them.” Last year, TD Bank’s American-based unit admitted to violating the Bank Secrecy Act and gave $1.8 billion to the Department of Justice and $1.3 billion to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Prosecutors say the bank failed to properly track trillions of dollars in transactions, making it easy for drug traffickers and other criminals to move huge sums of cash to notoriously risky countries.

Trump Media’s $3 Billion Crypto War Chest Mirroring Strategy’s Playbook The Truth Media is said to be planning to raise $2 billion in fresh equity and $1 billion via a convertible bond sale to invest in Bitcoin and other digital assets, the Financial Times reported on May 26. The final details of the planned raises, including their size and timing, are subject to change, according to the report. The news of the supposed capital raise comes as an increasing number of publicly traded companies are adding cryptocurrencies, mostly Bitcoin, to their balance sheets, borrowing a page from Strategy’s playbook. The Software intelligence turned Bitcoin development firm is currently the world’s largest corporate holder of the foremost crypto, holding nearly 3% of BTC’s total supply in its treasury by financing the buys through a mix of equity and debt issuances. Broader Crypto Ventures The FT report of the $3 billion capital raise comes as Trump Media, President Donald Trump, and his family deepen their ties with the crypto market. Last month, Trump Media sealed a deal with crypto exchange Crypto.com to launch a series of “made in America” crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The Trump family has also debuted a pair of meme coins, $TRUMP and $MELANIA , in addition to supporting a decentralized finance project called World Liberty Financial, and the president is attempting to create a national Bitcoin reserve — all in just the past couple of months.

Bitcoin has risen for seven consecutive weeks , and if buyers can extend the streak to eight weeks, it clears the path for further upside. Crypto analyst and trader Carpe Noctom said in a post on X that Bitcoin has only seen three instances of eight consecutive weekly positive closes, and every time, Bitcoin has been higher in the following 6 and 12 month time period.

S&P 500 Index price prediction The S&P 500 Index (SPX) turned down from 5,968 and reached the 20-day exponential moving average (5,759). SPX daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the index could gradually climb toward the overhead resistance of 6,000. Sellers are expected to pose a strong challenge in the 6,000 to 6,147 zone. The short-term advantage will favor the bears on a break and close below the 20-day EMA. The index could then plummet to the 50-day simple moving average (5,584), which is likely to attract buyers. US Dollar Index price prediction The bulls tried to push the US Dollar Index (DXY) above the 20-day EMA (100.15) on May 22, but the bears held their ground. DXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Sellers are trying to strengthen their position by pulling the price below the 99 support. If they manage to do that, the index could continue its slide to the solid support at 97.92. Buyers are expected to defend the 97.92 level with all their might because a break below it may sink the index to 95.67. Buyers will have to drive and maintain the price above the 50-day SMA (101.26) to indicate that the corrective phase may be over. Bitcoin price prediction Bitcoin bulls are trying to push and sustain the price above $109,588, indicating that every minor dip is being purchased. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory signal that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers shove the price above $111,980, the BTC/USDT pair could skyrocket to $130,000. The 20-day EMA ($104,886) is the vital support to watch out for on the downside. A break and close below the 20-day EMA could tempt short-term buyers to book profits. That could sink the pair to the psychologically crucial $100,000 level, where buyers are expected to mount a strong defense. Ether price prediction Ether ( ETH ) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($2,425) on May 25, indicating solid demand at lower levels. ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls will try to drive the price above the $2,738 obstacle again. If they succeed, the ETH/USDT pair could soar to $3,000. The bears will try to halt the up move at $2,850, but the bulls are likely to prevail. If the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are losing their grip. The pair could dip to $2,323 and then to $2,111. XRP price prediction XRP ( XRP ) has been oscillating between $2.65 and $2, signaling equilibrium between buyers and sellers. XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The flattish 20-day EMA ($2.34) and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price turns up and breaks above $2.48, the bulls will have another go at the $2.65 resistance. If they clear the overhead hurdle, the XRP/USDT pair could soar to $3. On the other hand, a break and close below the 50-day SMA could sink the pair to the solid support at $2. Buyers are expected to vigorously defend the $2 level because a break below it may sink the pair to $1.61. BNB price prediction BNB ( BNB ) has started to move toward the overhead resistance of $693 after taking support at the 20-day EMA ($652). BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate an advantage to buyers. If bulls kick the price above $693, the BNB/USDT pair could rally to the $732 to $761 overhead zone. Contrarily, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bears are trying to seize control. The pair could slump to $633 and subsequently to the 50-day SMA ($617). Solana price prediction Solana ( SOL ) took support at the 20-day EMA ($169) on May 25, indicating that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on minor dips. SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls will again attempt to drive the price above the $188 overhead resistance. If they can pull it off, the SOL/USDT pair could surge to $210 and eventually to $220. Sellers will have to pull the price below the 20-day EMA to prevent the upside. The pair could then plunge to the 50-day SMA ($151), which is likely to act as solid support. A bounce off the 50-day SMA could signal a few days of range-bound action between $153 and $188.

Network activity, chart pattern point to $300 SOL price Dogecoin price prediction Dogecoin ( DOGE ) has been trading between $0.26 and $0.21, signaling buying near the support and selling close to the resistance. DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The price has bounced off the 20-day EMA, opening the gates for a rally to the overhead resistance of $0.26. Buyers will have to pierce the $0.26 level to start the next leg of the uptrend to $0.30 and then to $0.35. Alternatively, a break and close below the $0.21 support suggests the bears are back in the game. The DOGE/USDT pair could then swing inside a large range between $0.26 and $0.14 for some time. Cardano price prediction Buyers are trying to keep Cardano ( ADA ) above the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern but have failed to start a strong rebound. ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The 20-day EMA ($0.75) is flattening out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. Buyers will have to propel the price above $0.86 to tilt the advantage in their favor. If they manage to do that, the ADA/USDT pair could rally to $1.01. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the neckline, it suggests that the bulls have given up. The pair could then drop to the $0.60 support, which is likely to attract buyers. Hyperliquid price prediction Hyperliquid (HYPE) has been in a strong uptrend for the past several days. Buyers asserted their supremacy by pushing the price above the $35.73 resistance on May 25. HYPE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls will try to maintain the momentum and push the price to $42.25, where the bears are expected to step in. If buyers do not give up much ground from $42.25, the uptrend could extend to $50. The immediate support on the downside is $35.73. If the HYPE/USDT pair rebounds off $35.73, it increases the likelihood of a rally above $42.25. Sellers will gain the upper hand on a break below $32.

According to him, North Korea hackers understand they can be tracked and traced but they perceive it as the cost of doing business. Initially, the crypto industry was sure their system would not have criminals as a vulnerability because transactions are open to everyone. However, over time, all manner of illicit activities have multiplied. Redbord says that criminals see the transparent nature of blockchain more as a feature than a bug. Blockchain being transparent is not enough Recently, the crypto industry has recorded kidnappings as a result of blockchain transparency. A crypto investor, John Woeltz, did the most recent kidnapping, among many others , this month. He allegedly beat and hanged the victim off a ledge when he refused to provide his Bitcoin password. Ari Redbord said, “I think that’s the paradox of crypto…we say bad guys should never use crypto because we see every transaction, and that’s true, but the reality is that they can also move funds faster and in larger amounts, and that’s why we just have to get better and better at what we’re doing.” The thing about crypto is that funds can be moved in minutes, if not seconds. This is very friendly to criminals. According to Michael Pearl, vice president of strategy at a blockchain security firm, security methods such as multi-factor authentication could help make forced transfers harder to execute without alerting others. On the other hand, transparency has helped blockchain technology compete with traditional assets such as Gold. Crypto users have convinced the US government that BTC is better than Gold. They reasoned it takes about 44k man-hours, 20 people and 18 months to audit the Gold Reserves in Fort Knox. But it takes about 1 second and a push of a button to audit Bitcoin. A victim scammed $2.6 million of crypto in three hours A report from Web3 security company Cyvers says the victim was scammed twice in three hours and lost $2.6 million worth of Tether’s stablecoin (USDT). 🚨ALERT🚨Our system has detected~2.6M $USDT loss from a targeted address poisoning scam involving zero-value transfers. A single victim was repeatedly scammed by the same attacker address. First, the victim lost 843K $USDT . ⏳ About 3 hours later, the same victim sent 1.75M… pic.twitter.com/WWVlrZvavK — 🚨 Cyvers Alerts 🚨 (@CyversAlerts) May 26, 2025 The victim was the target of an address poisoning scam. Usually, attackers send transactions with no value from a wallet address that looks like a real one the victim uses or interacts with. The person who was scammed first sent $843,000 in USDT to the con artist. Not even three hours later, they mistakenly sent an extra $1.7 million in USDT to the same fake address. The event shows how complicated crypto-related scams are getting. This year has been difficult for crypto investors. For instance, in April alone, over 18 big attacks were reported. The most severe one involved a fake Bitcoin (BTC) transaction, which resulted in a loss of $330.7 million. In February, hackers used malware to trick the Dubai-based exchange Bybit into approving deals that weren’t supposed to happen. The exchange lost $1.46 billion. This theft beat the previous record of $611 million stolen from Poly Network in 2021. Meanwhile, Ripple sent a message to its users telling them to be careful of scams, which tend to become more common when the crypto market goes up. The blockchain company wrote in a blog post about the rise of scams using AI-made content, such as deepfake videos of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse giving away XRP. “These posts include branding and profile pictures that look exactly like what the companies, individuals or government authorities use It’s important to spot which accounts are fake, and which posts are cryptocurrency giveaway scams.” Ripple wrote.

Analyst Predicts Monster Move Based On The Charts",https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/2700-xrp-analyst-predicts-monster-move-based-on-the-charts/,"A well-known crypto analyst, going by the name Egrag Crypto, has laid out some eye-popping targets for XRP. According to his charts, the token could climb as high as $45, a 2,700% jump from its current price. A more modest scenario would still send it to $19, up a little over 1,000%. He points to past cycles where similar moves took shape over roughly 770 days. Yet not everyone is on board with his bullish outlook. Related Reading: Investors Pour $2.75 Billion Into Bitcoin ETFs As Price Skyrockets Historical Moves And Cycle Timing Based on reports, Egrag Crypto stresses that XRP’s rallies in 2017 and 2021 followed almost identical paths. The token hit $3.25 in 2017 after surging 2,770%. Then in 2021 it jumped 1,052% to about $1.80. Each rally was marked by a bearish crossover on the 21 EMA and the 33 MA, followed by sideway trading for around 777 days after the 2018 peak and 770 days after the 2021 high. He believes the same setup started late in 2024, when XRP climbed nearly sixfold from its previous low. #XRP – Targeting $19 or $45? 🟣Charts Men lie, women lie, but charts don’t! 📊 I’m not improvising here; I’m relying on historical data to present future predictions. Will it rhyme exactly? No, because if it were that easy, everyone would be a multimillionaire! 💰 🟣Human… pic.twitter.com/YasA4k98fd — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) April 11, 2025 Bullish Targets And Risks According to the analysis, a repeat of past moves could push XRP as high as $45. A less aggressive run would still see it reach $19. Egrag Crypto even points to an intermediate target of about $27 as a likely milestone. Those numbers assume a straight path up, but markets rarely move in straight lines. Big jumps often end with sharp pullbacks. Traders chasing 2,700% gains could face long wait times and steep drops. Bearish Views Gain Ground Other voices warn against getting swept up in the hype. Market watcher Koroush says now is a time for shorts. He pegs a possible decline to $1.30. Others favor a short bias, pointing to weakening demand and faltering momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $125K By End Of Q2?

Looking Ahead The debate around XRP’s next phase is far from over. Historical charts show one side of the story. On-chain trends, legal battles, and macro factors tell another.

In a recent post on X, Dark Defender drew attention to a striking long-term technical formation: a bull flag pattern that has been developing on XRP’s charts since as far back as 2015. His message to the XRP community was clear and confident — despite years of consolidation , setbacks, and regulatory challenges, “we haven’t seen anything yet.” #XRP Bull Flags, since 2015. We haven't seen anything, yet. pic.twitter.com/32kqjo1NF1 — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) May 26, 2025 Decoding the 10-Year Bull Flag Formation A bull flag is a classic technical analysis pattern that signals a brief period of consolidation following a strong upward move, often leading to the continuation of the prior bullish trend. On shorter timeframes, bull flags typically play out over weeks or months. What makes Dark Defender’s observation so remarkable is the sheer timescale involved. He points to a multi-year bull flag stretching from XRP’s price surges in 2015, suggesting that the entire past decade has been a giant setup for an eventual breakout of historic proportions . This perspective reframes how many investors and traders perceive XRP’s long-term price action. While some have viewed XRP’s range-bound behavior since its 2018 highs as stagnation or underperformance, Dark Defender argues that this extended consolidation is part of a larger, healthy technical structure — one that could soon give way to an explosive continuation move in line with the most optimistic projections. Why “We Haven’t Seen Anything Yet” Dark Defender’s assertion that the market hasn’t seen anything yet speaks to both technical and fundamental dimensions. On the technical front, the long-term bull flag implies that the magnitude of the next major breakout could dwarf prior rallies, possibly pushing XRP to levels that most current holders have yet to witness. The pattern’s scale suggests that XRP’s price action has been coiling up energy over a near-decade-long period, and when such patterns resolve, the resulting moves tend to be swift, powerful, and far-reaching. Fundamentally, XRP’s story has also evolved in ways that support the possibility of a breakout. Potential full resolution of Ripple-SEC lawsuit and Ripple’s expanding global network of financial partners, central banks , and payment corridors has strengthened the real-world use case for XRP as a bridge currency, enhancing the underlying demand profile that can support sustained price appreciation. The Psychological Impact of Long-Term Setups What makes Dark Defender’s analysis particularly compelling is its psychological dimension. Extended consolidation patterns like decade-long bull flags often test the patience and conviction of investors. Many market participants lose interest or grow skeptical during such prolonged periods, only to be blindsided when the pattern ultimately resolves. Dark Defender’s message is both a technical observation and a rallying cry, urging the XRP community not to underestimate the potential scale of what lies ahead. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 As with all technical setups, there are no guarantees, and crypto markets remain famously volatile. But if Dark Defender’s multi-year bull flag interpretation is accurate, the coming months or years could witness XRP entering a phase of market action that redefines its position in the crypto landscape — a phase where previous highs become mere stepping stones on the path to much greater valuations. A Defining Moment Awaits XRP In sum, Dark Defender’s call serves as a potent reminder that XRP’s story is far from over. While critics point to past price stagnation or legal distractions, the technical and fundamental signals suggest that XRP may be on the cusp of its most significant chapter yet. The long-term bull flag formation dating back to 2015 frames the asset’s journey not as a series of disappointments but as a giant, decade-long setup. As the market turns its attention to the next major moves in the crypto space, Dark Defender’s analysis positions XRP as one of the most intriguing assets to watch. If his prediction proves right, XRP holders — and the broader market — truly haven’t seen anything yet. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The company said in a statement: “Circle is not for sale. Our long-term goals have not changed.” The report, based on a paid piece by Fortune, suggested that Circle was in talks with both Coinbase and Ripple at a valuation of at least $5 billion. However, Circle quickly denied those claims and reiterated that it was focused on the initial public offering (IPO) process, which it filed for in April. On April 30, it was reported that Ripple made a $4 billion to $5 billion acquisition offer to Circle, but the offer was rejected by Circle as “insufficient.” The report stated that Ripple is still interested in the deal but has not yet decided whether to make a new offer.

With OKB adjusting 0.72% down in 24 hours and SEI holding at $0.2265, attention shifts sharply to utility over hype. There’s a wave of anticipation building, and the signals are too loud to ignore. Qubetics ($TICS) doesn’t just offer a new coin; it brings a blueprint that actually addresses cross-border transaction delays, high fees, and real-time verification gaps—problems even major chains still can’t handle efficiently. Positioned as one of the best cryptos to join for long term, Qubetics is powering through its 36th presale stage, stepping beyond the experimental phase and into real-world readiness. Qubetics: Solving Real-World Problems with Blockchain Qubetics ($TICS) is a utility-focused digital asset engineered for performance, precision, and permanence. It presents a robust system designed to transform how cross-border transactions work, not in theory but in practice. Unlike most tokens that simply store value or fuel ecosystems, $TICS integrates smart contract automation with high-speed execution layers. This blend ensures seamless global transfers without relying on outdated intermediaries. A logistics firm needs to transfer operational funds across regions. Instead of waiting days due to traditional bank bottlenecks or paying massive intermediary fees, $TICS processes that same transaction within seconds with minimal overhead. Qubetics is eliminating lag in remittance, vendor payments, and digital commerce operations. This application alone qualifies it as one of the best cryptos to join for long term, serving real demand instead of speculative whims. The numbers don’t lie. Last Sunday, the price of $TICS was $0.2785, and it has now jumped to $0.3064. This marks a notable increase as the public sale progresses into its final phases, reflecting growing momentum and strong community support behind the project. The crypto presale has already raised over $17.4 million with 514 million tokens sold, and 27,100 token holders. If $TICS reaches $1, that’s a 226% return. A $5 milestone means 1,531%. And at $10 after Mainnet launch? That speaks to 3,163% ROI—figures that fuel not just ambition, but global interest. The crypto presale traction also signals growing confidence in its roadmap. The Growing Importance of Cross-Border Transactions in a Globalized Economy Cross-border transactions have become a cornerstone of the modern global economy, enabling seamless movement of goods, services, and capital across nations. As businesses expand into international markets and consumers increasingly engage in global e-commerce, the need for efficient, secure, and low-cost payment systems has intensified. Recent innovations—such as the rise of stablecoins, the international expansion of India’s UPI system, and the development of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) through initiatives like Project mBridge—are transforming the landscape. These advancements aim to reduce reliance on traditional banking intermediaries, lower transaction costs, and promote greater financial inclusion worldwide, one of the best cryptos to join for long term. OKB: Strategic Utility in a Volatile Market OKB, the native token of the OKX ecosystem, continues to evolve as a multifunctional utility tool. Currently priced with a market cap of $3.1 billion and ranked #34, OKB supports trading fee discounts, staking access, and ecosystem governance. But that alone doesn’t sustain long-term appeal. What’s driving renewed interest is its pivot towards Web3 integration, particularly in DeFi protocols and wallet services. While it saw a slight dip of 0.72% in the last 24 hours, OKB’s broader value proposition remains tied to its parent exchange’s reach. By embedding OKB into new services like decentralized launchpads and partner chains, the token gains layered utility beyond just fee rebates. It creates a value loop that grows with each new service built into the OKX brand, and stands out as the best cryptos to join for long term. SEI: The Layer-1 Designed for Speed SEI is carving out a name as a purpose-built Layer-1 optimized for trading applications. At a current price of $0.2265, it attracts builders focused on high-performance dApps that need ultra-low latency. SEI deploys a unique Twin-Turbo consensus that reduces block finality time and enhances parallel execution. That means lower slippage, fewer failed transactions, and a better user experience. The appeal is strongest among decentralized exchange protocols, gaming, and NFT marketplaces where speed and throughput define success. What sets SEI apart is its commitment to scalable architecture without compromising decentralization. In a market where many chains promise speed but sacrifice security, SEI manages both. It’s not just a playground for developers; it’s a toolkit for serious builders. Final Thoughts on Qubetics, OKB and SEI in 2025 Each of these three digital assets offers distinct advantages. Qubetics ($TICS) leads in practical solutions, particularly in cross-border finance, marking it as one of the best cryptos to join for long term . OKB provides consistent utility tethered to a global exchange brand, while SEI targets performance-driven platforms demanding low latency. Together, they represent a strategic spread of opportunities tailored for both new participants and experienced digital asset holders. With over $17.4 million raised, 514 million tokens sold, and a clear problem-solving model in motion, Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t waiting for validation—it’s building the infrastructure others will rely on.

The decisions came during the opening of a regional summit in Malaysia on Monday, the first high-level meeting since Washington imposed steep new tariffs on ASEAN exports on April 2. The 10-member bloc approved an upgraded version of the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) and adopted a bold 20-year economic roadmap known as the ASEAN Community Vision 2045. New trade deal to cut barriers and modernize customs According to Nikkei Asia, negotiations on the upgraded ATIGA have been concluded, and the formal signing is expected at ASEAN’s October summit. The revised agreement could lower residual tariffs and dismantle non-tariff barriers that strangle the “free movement” of goods across borders. Malaysian Trade Minister Zafrul Aziz called the agreement the “cornerstone” of ASEAN’s economic integration, saying the bloc has ambitions of a seamless intra-regional trade environment. “ The upgraded version features forward-looking and commercially meaningful provisions to boost regional trade, enhance supply chain resilience, and deepen intra-ASEAN integration, ” Zafrul reckoned. 90% of goods already cross borders tariff-free, but economists say the deal removes outdated customs procedures, inconsistent documentation, and a framework that currently requires products to meet strict local content thresholds to benefit from tariff breaks. Officials want to ease some of these value-added thresholds, though the final details are still under discussion. The agreement also introduces the standardized electronic exchange of trade documents, expected to simplify customs clearance and cut transaction costs. “ Further digitalization is expected to reduce trade costs within the ASEAN region ,” Kyohei Yabu of the Japan External Trade Organization from JETRO’s Bangkok office noted. World Economic Forum hails agreement The World Economic Forum (WEF) has coined ASEAN’s digital element of the agreement as a “game changer” for the region’s economic growth. The Forum referred specifically to DEFA, a digital economy framework agreement in ASEAN’s economic strategy. “ DEFA is a strategic blueprint for how our nearly 680 million people can access a digital future that is open, secure, and inclusive ,” said the WEF. DEFA includes initiatives for skills development, digital literacy, and talent mobility. According to WEF figures, 71% of all venture capital deals in the region in 2023 were tied to the digital economy, outpacing the global average by 11%. Annual investments in communications and data services surged from $777 million in 2015 to $4.4 billion in 2024. The Forum said DEFA’s implementation will accelerate this momentum and open doors for women entrepreneurs, rural innovators, and youth-led startups. Tariffs from Washington are affecting Asian markets President Donald Trump’s administration’s “reciprocal” tariffs in April targeted ASEAN exports. The new duties range from 10% on Singaporean goods to 49% on Cambodian and Laotian products. The protectionist trade policy rattled markets across Southeast Asia, especially export-dependent economies like Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. Regional leaders are now scrambling to protect their economies and consumer expenditure from fallout with eased internal trade structures. “ A transition in the geopolitical order is underway, and the global trading system is under further strain with the recent imposition of US unilateral tariffs ,” warned Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in his opening address at the meeting. “Protectionism is resurging as we bear witness to multilateralism breaking apart at the seams.” Anwar revealed he had written to Trump, proposing a meeting between the US president and ASEAN leaders to calm heads. The proposed summit could be held as early as October, though no date or location has been finalized. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

But this rise triggered a profit-taking sentiment, which caused the market to temporarily peak. Ethereum, in particular, struggled to stay above its recent high as large investors started pulling back their money. As a result, there might be a short-term correction for ETH price ahead. Ethereum Struggles in Meeting Buying Demand A market-wide rebound, driven by Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs and better overall economic conditions, helped push Ethereum’s price up to an eight-week high of $2,731. However, it’s now having trouble attracting strong buying interest, as many short-term investors have already sold to lock in profits. According to Coinglass, over the past 24 hours, more than $40.66 million in Ethereum positions were liquidated. Of this, 15.12 million from buyers and $25.54 million from sellers. Meanwhile, data from IntoTheBlock shows a sharp drop in large transaction volume, falling from $12.24 billion to $3.28 billion in just three days. Large Transaction Volume: IntoTheBlock This suggests that big investors are stepping back, which is weakening the upward momentum in ETH’s price. With whales pulling back, sellers might gain the upper hand in the short term, possibly leading to a price correction. Despite some recent price struggles, Ethereum’s defi activity continues to grow. The total value locked in Ethereum rose from $50.63 billion on April 26 to $62.7 billion by May 26, a jump of over 25% in just under a month. Also read: What’s Next for Ethereum Price? Will the ETH Price Mark A New ATH in June 2025? Some of the biggest gains came from platforms like Pendle, where deposits increased by over 50%, and Ether.fi and EigenLayer, both of which saw 48% growth. Ethereum still leads all blockchains in TVL, holding 54% of the market. For comparison, Solana holds 8%, and BNB Chain has 5% among Layer-1 networks. This strong DeFi growth could help support ETH’s price and reduce the chances of a major drop, as many investors remain bullish about a rebound. What’s Next for ETH Price? Ether recently faced resistance around $2,731, resulting in a drop below the immediate Fib levels. As bears strengthen their dominance, buyers struggle in triggering a recovery rally. As of writing, ETH price trades at $2,535, declining over 0.6% in the last 24 hours. ETH/USD Price Chart: TradingView The ETH/USDT pair might fall to the 100-day EMA (around $2,456), which is an important support level to watch. If the price bounces back strongly from that point, buyers may make another attempt to push past $2,750. If they succeed, the price could rise toward $3,000. There is some resistance around $2,870, but it likely won’t hold for long. However, if the price drops below the 100-day EMA, this bullish outlook could change. In that case, the pair might fall further toward the descending trend line at $2,329.

In an announcement , Coinbase Assets said it now supports trading for several tokens, which users in Germany can access on Coinbase.com and via iOS and Android apps. The eight crypto tokens are Rocket Pool (RPL), Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ), Renzo (REZ), Reserve Rights (RSR), Aethir ( ATH ), Syrup ( SYRUP ), Pendle ( PENDLE ) and Layer3 (L3). The price of Aethir jumped more than 12% following the news,with the decentralized physical infrastructure network’s native token surging to highs of $0.052. Rocket Pool’s price was up about 3% to $4.71, while PENGU and REZ were just in the green. Pendle and Maple Finance’s SYRUP, among the altcoins to skyrocket in recent weeks, were down 1.5% and 9% respectively despite the positive news.

45129147,https://timestabloid.com/?p=68592,1748287838,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Google Gemini Predicts Where XRP Price Will Trade In 2030,https://timestabloid.com/google-gemini-predicts-where-xrp-price-will-trade-in-2030/,"Predicting where the price of a cryptocurrency like XRP will stand in 2030 is both fascinating and speculative. The market for digital assets is shaped by a complex blend of regulatory developments, technological innovation, institutional adoption, and global economic conditions. To gain insight into XRP’s long-term prospects, we asked Google’s Gemini AI what the digital asset’s price could be by the end of the decade. The response provided a range of scenarios, from conservative to highly optimistic, offering a glimpse into how XRP’s future could unfold depending on critical market and regulatory factors. Gemini’s Price Projections The AI model estimates reflect a layered view of XRP’s potential. On the conservative side, assuming a steady but modest annual growth rate, XRP could trade between $2.96 and $3.75 by 2030. This baseline scenario is grounded in the idea that XRP will retain its current market presence without necessarily seeing explosive adoption or breakthrough institutional integration. Under a moderate growth scenario, Gemini suggests that continued institutional interest, combined with improving regulatory clarity, could push XRP’s average price to around $3.75, with potential peaks of $4.45. This projection envisions a landscape where Ripple expands its footprint, but major industry-transforming events have yet to materialize. For those who lean toward a bullish outlook, Gemini outlines a scenario where XRP’s price could soar to $12, $43 , or even higher. These predictions hinge on transformative factors such as global banking partnerships, decisive regulatory clarity, the widespread rollout of XRP-based financial products, and the token’s emergence as a key player in global cross-border settlements. Other Notable Predictions Beyond Gemini, prominent XRP-focused analysts like Dark Defender and EGRAG Crypto have shared their long-term forecasts, often tilting toward the optimistic side. Dark Defender, known for his rigorous technical analysis, frequently points to Fibonacci-based targets suggesting XRP could break above $5 in the medium term, with a path toward double-digit prices if historical wave patterns continue to play out. His confidence stems from observing repeating fractals in XRP’s price charts that mirror past market cycles. EGRAG Crypto, another widely followed XRP analyst, has even bolder projections. His analyses indicate potential long-term targets as high as $27 or more, assuming ideal market conditions. EGRAG emphasizes that XRP’s utility, particularly as a bridge currency for cross-border payments, combined with global institutional adoption, could fuel a major price surge if key legal and regulatory hurdles are cleared. Key Drivers Shaping XRP’s Long-Term Trajectory To understand where XRP might be headed, it’s essential to consider the critical forces shaping its ecosystem. Regulation remains the most significant factor: Ripple’s long-running legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cast a long shadow over XRP’s growth . Its full resolution will determine how quickly institutional players feel confident to fully engage with XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another critical driver is Ripple’s success in integrating its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product into mainstream financial systems. Ripple has already secured partnerships with banks and financial institutions across Asia, Europe, and Latin America, but unlocking U.S. market participation and scaling further could generate enormous demand for XRP as a liquidity bridge asset. Additionally, the evolution of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) — including smart contract capabilities via Hooks, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and the integration of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain — could unlock entirely new use cases, making XRP and its ecosystem far more versatile and valuable in the broader blockchain economy. Balancing Optimism and Caution While it’s exciting to consider high-end predictions, including those that place XRP at $43 or beyond, it’s essential to balance optimism with realism. The crypto market is notoriously volatile, and prices are influenced by speculation, hype, and external shocks just as much as by fundamentals. Regulatory setbacks, global economic downturns, or major security incidents could derail even the most bullish scenarios. Yet dismissing XRP’s potential entirely would overlook the structural shifts happening across global finance. As blockchain-based solutions gain traction, central banks explore digital currencies, and demand rises for faster, cheaper cross-border payments, XRP sits at a potentially transformative crossroads between traditional finance and emerging digital infrastructures. While no one can predict the future with certainty, one thing is undeniable: XRP remains one of the most watched, debated, and polarizing assets in the crypto world. As we move through the rest of the decade, the digital asset’s journey will be shaped not just by price charts but by the larger forces reshaping the global financial landscape.

At the same time, a group of visiting U.S. senators urged Canada to “give us another chance” on trade and tourism, seeking to shore up ties strained by recent tariff disputes. According to Statistics Canada’s early estimate , manufacturing sales fell 2.0 % in April from March. The agency based this figure on responses covering about 59 % of its usual monthly survey. More complete results are due on June 13. In March, manufacturing sales had already dipped by 1.4 %, the largest drop in seven months following a 0.2 % decrease in February. Analysts said the weakness reflected the first round of U.S. import tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, which took effect late in the previous quarter. Lower metal sales after four months of gains were a significant factor. That same report showed inventories slid 0.7 % in March after two months of buildup. But new orders were up 1.0 % from February, suggesting some pickup in demand. Additional data from S&P Global painted a gloomier picture. The Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index fell for the third month in a row, dropping to 45.3 in April from 46.3 in March. Any reading below 50 signals contraction, and April’s reading was the weakest since May 2020. Both output and new orders continued to weaken. US senators have been urging Canada to refresh tourism and trade relations Against this backdrop, five U.S. senators made a rare trip to Ottawa last weekend. They met Friday with Prime Minister Mark Carney, who has said he wants a fresh economic and security partnership with the United States despite what he called an end to the era of “deep integration.” Republican Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told Mercedes Stephenson on The West Block that stronger ties were vital. “We have to do this stuff together,” he said. “We’ll be better at it if we’re friends than if we’re just tolerating one another.… I’m just here to say thank you, and then to encourage Canadians to take another look and give us another chance.” Relations between the two countries have chilled since President Donald Trump imposed broad tariffs on Canadian imports and suggested Canada could become the 51st U.S. state. Tourism has taken a hit, too. Statistics Canada reported four straight months of steep year-over-year declines in U.S. visitors to Canada, and some U.S. states have responded with ad campaigns to send Canadians back. Virginia’s Democratic Senator Tim Kaine said bookings by Canadian tourists to his state are “down significantly.” He and his fellow senators wanted to ease worries in Canada. “We were aware, because we all have great friends in Canada, that there was a lot of anxiety about, well, gosh, what do Americans think of us?” Kaine said. “The five of us wanted to come to say, ‘Look, we love Canada.’” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

This unfortunate event resulted in a loss of $2.6 million worth of USDT. These incidents highlight the growing danger of phishing scams in the crypto industry. Bad actors use malicious tricks to deceive users without needing direct access to private keys. Scammer Used Zero-Value Transfer To Trick Victim As revealed earlier today, the victim lost $2.6 million in stablecoins after falling victim to two phishing scams in less than three hours. The first transaction involved $843,000 worth of USDT. Just a few hours later, a second transaction transferred another $1.75 million to a fake address. In a recent X post , Blockchain security firm Cyvers reported that the attacker used a phishing method, the zero-value transfer scam. This technique involves transferring zero tokens from the victim’s wallet to a fraudulent address. Since no real funds are moved, the transaction appears harmless but leaves a trace in the wallet’s history. When reviewing the wallet’s activity, the victim may later see this transaction and assume the fake address is legitimate. Trusting this address can lead to future transfers of actual funds to the attacker, as seen in the total losses recorded. Phishing Attacks Are Becoming More Common Phishing scams have become one of the biggest threats to crypto users. In the third quarter of 2024, phishing scams caused even more significant losses. Reports say about $127 million was stolen in September, affecting over 11,000 users. One person lost $32 million by signing a fake “permit” message, which gave the scammer complete control of the wallet. In March 2025, more than $46 million was stolen from Coinbase users through similar phishing attacks. Coinbase has said it will pay back users whose private information was shared during the attack. Other Malicious Techniques To Watch Out For Another scam used by attackers is known as address poisoning. This technique involves sending a small amount of tokens from a wallet address closely resembling the victim’s address. The goal is to plant this lookalike address in the transaction history. Later, the victim may copy a similar address, mistaking it for a trusted one during future transfers. This leads to funds being sent directly to the attacker. Scammers rely heavily on social media platforms like Telegram, X, and Discord. Bad actors often post fake links that look trustworthy to trick users. These links can lead to actions that compromise wallets or expose sensitive information. Users are urged to be very careful and double-check wallet addresses before making transfers.

Ozak AI May Hit $1 Sooner,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/bitcoin-price-forecast-long-term-250k-target-ozak-ai-may-hit-1-sooner,"Bitcoin (BTC) maintains dominating headlines with its superb price movements, even as emerging initiatives like Ozak AI (OZ) are taking images of investor interest with their ability for large returns.

BTC’s resistance zones lie at $115,000 and $120,000, with aid around $88,000 and $75,000. A damage above the $100K psychological mark ought to spark a FOMO-pushed rally towards the $180K ceiling. However, seasoned investors are aware that Bitcoin’s big market cap limits its upside in comparison to smaller-cap tokens, which could supply exponential returns with tons much less capital inflow.

This is a signal that investors are moving them from their self-custody wallets and selling them and that demand for the coin remains limited. According to on-chain data , investors have moved 4 million coins into OKX in the last 24 hours, while withdrawals stand at 3.2 million. This brings the net flow to 829k. Pi Network Exchanges Inflows and Outflows Source: PiScan The netflow to Bitget was 221,890 coins, and on Gate was 338,468. Only MEXC had net outflows in the past 24 hours. Altogether, the total inflows into exchanges stand at over 1.3 million. The odds of Pi coin bull rally Although the coin has recorded a 6% increase in the last week, the token trades at $0.7715, down by over 53% from its highest level this month, making it one of the worst-performing major coins. At first, Pi Coin was worth $3, but it quickly dropped to $0.60 on the same day. Within 34 days, it went back up to $3, but this caused a lot of people to sell as early buyers rushed to get their money back. Many people thought $3 was a good price to get out, especially since the coin had already dropped more than 80%. Currently, $0.94, $1.20, and $1.66 are important price levels that will act as instant resistance for Pi Coin. If the price can break above these levels, $3.00 will still be the next short-term bullish goal. On the downside, $0.65 is a key level of support to keep an eye on. If the price goes below this level, it could mean even bigger drops in the future. Three more unlocks in May are expected to add pressure to the price Adding to the concern, the price of Pi Coin may keep going down this week since more coins will be released. Today, 9.9 million coins will be unlocked. Over the next three days, 12 million, 15.2 million, and 13.2 million will be unlocked. This week, more than 72 million coins worth over $50 million will go live. In the next 30 days, another 280 million coins will also go live. This unlock trend will last for a while since there are already 11.1 billion in circulation. 100 billion is the most that can ever be made. If there isn’t enough desire on the other side, these unlocks could change the price. However, although prices are going up and down, the Pi Network community is quickly expanding. Analyst Kim Wong says there are now more than 100 decentralized apps (DApps) based on Pi. Some live on the Mainnet, some are being tried, and others are still being built. In addition, a $100 million Venture Fund was just launched. This fund is expected to help the Pi community grow even more. As more apps come out and more people worldwide use them, Pi’s long-term adoption continues to look good. Presently, the network now has more than 70 million users around the world. It also has 4.3 million Twitter fans and 20 million users who have been KYC-verified. Several exchanges have listed Pi Coin. It is ranked at position 26 among all crypto tokens by market cap.

Although activity on XRP has slowed down as the rules surrounding cryptocurrencies in the U.S. keep evolving. Ozak AI (OZ) is now receiving more interest from investors due to its helpful services. Because the market is growing, people are using AI projects widely and broadly and automated and decentralized finance options. With the call for more features from investors, people are also discussing what Ozak AI might do. How to Obtain Live Financial Data Using Predictive Analytics Ozak AI is used in predictive analytics and data intelligence. The platform uses machine learning and statistical approaches to assess past and present financial data. It enables users to monitor how market stocks and assets change so they can forecast more accurately and pick better investments. Regular XRP watchers may use Ozak AI to forecast possible moves ahead. Factors measured by the firm’s engine include sentiment, the volumes of trades, and AI learning. Since users get the data immediately, they can make smarter and easier choices, so they trade less often. Decentralized Security Infrastructure and Smart Contract Integration Many traders worry about security when moving to platforms without central control, using decentralized physical networks (DePIN) and EigenLayer AVS. Stop any single part from breaking and keep the system working properly. The uses of Arbitrum Orbit, which helps the network process more transactions faster. Being used to RippleNet’s popular centralized system, XRP users will welcome decentralization, which increases both transparency and security. Ozak AI reviews smart contracts with AI, so any risks to users are found and corrected early. $OZ Token Presale Attracts Early Investors The $OZ token is at the center of Ozak AI’s ecosystem and is currently in its third presale phase , priced at $0.003. The project raised over $1 million and sold over 160 million tokens. Early investors are attracted by the token’s role in platform governance, access to AI-powered tools, and its integration in data management and transaction execution. XRP has been in the market for a while and doesn’t seem likely to increase much more, unlike $OZ, which provides a way to participate in a rising AI-powered DeFi ecosystem. Those who hold tokens can stake them, join in on platform decisions, use advanced analytics, and take advantage of the platform’s quick advancement and clear system of tokenomics. The rising need for advanced analytics, enhanced security, and decentralized services draws more trade from XRP to ecosystems like Ozak AI. Due to its usefulness, new approaches and advanced technology, the $OZ token seems set to appeal to traders who like sample use. Because XRP comes with market and regulatory challenges, Ozak AI is a wise choice for investing in crypto.

In a new post on the social media platform X, Buterin comments on a report published by The Guardian about Sweden’s migration toward becoming a cashless society. The report discusses how plans for Sweden to become completely cashless by 2025 have been partially successful. However, due to geopolitical uncertainties and the war in Eastern Europe, the Swedish government is now encouraging citizens to keep more cash – krona – on them. Sweden launched a pilot program for an “e-krona” in 2017, but then ended it in 2023. The Riksbank – Sweden’s central bank – stated in March that it determined there was little need to issue a digital krona, but that it would re-evaluate the plans if the European Central Bank (ECB) issued a digital euro. Said the Riksbank, “The Payments Inquiry’s assessment in 2023 was that there was insufficient social need for the Riksbank to issue an e-krona. At the same time, the inquiry considered that the Riksbank should continue to evaluate the conditions for issuing an e-krona so that it is possible to introduce an e-krona within a reasonable time if the Riksdag takes such a decision.” Says Buterin on the Guardian story, “Nordics are walking back the cashless society initiative because their centralized implementation of the concept is too fragile. Cash turns out necessary as a backup. Ethereum needs to be resilient enough, and private enough, to be able to credibly play this kind of role.” Earlier this month, Buterin made headlines by calling Ethereum “needlessly complex.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

XRP, currently priced at $2.44, has long been a top altcoin thanks to its real-world use in cross-border payments and the potential catalyst of ETF approvals, fueling optimistic price predictions pushing it towards $3.92. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance, with its innovative DeFi ecosystem and low entry price, is generating significant buzz for delivering outsized altcoin gains in 2025. The MUTM presale has attracted over 11,500 participants ahead of a token price to rise to $0.035 at the start of the next phase. Those investing at this stage stand to make up to 100% in profit once the projected launch price of $0.06 is reached. While Ripple’s established network offers relative stability, MUTM’s fresh momentum and disruptive potential position it as a prime candidate for explosive growth. As the 2025 crypto market heats up, balancing XRP’s proven track record against MUTM’s breakthrough potential will be key for savvy investors targeting the next big win. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors due its advanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending solutions is gaining significant momentum in the market. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform has collected more than $9.3 million and accumulated 11,500 holders in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.03 before their value will grow to $0.035 within the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 100% when Mutuum Finance hits its official launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position. Social media channels will release the results of an ongoing Certik smart contract audit after the completion of this audit by the team.

Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, eschewing the collapse risks which have plagued algorithmic stablecoins. On the security front, the platform is run by open-source, third-party audited smart contracts, laying a good foundation for user trust and institutional adoption. While Ripple (XRP) remains a solid choice for investors seeking stability and real-world adoption, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as the best altcoin to invest in now for those aiming for outsized 2025 gains. With over $9.3 million raised from 11,500+ investors and a token price still at $0.03, early participants could see 100% returns by launch at $0.06.

Dogecoin (DOGE) recently saw over $40 million in whale outflows , triggering short-term consolidation around the $0.24 level. While market sentiment remains broadly positive, analysts note a pause in large accumulation as traders assess fresh momentum plays. Cardano (ADA) , in contrast, is showing consistent wallet growth and rising DeFi activity. Now holding above $0.76, ADA has recorded a year-over-year gain of 65% , and its on-chain metrics continue to improve. Analysts remain optimistic about its expansion in decentralized identity (DID) and real-world partnerships, especially in emerging markets. Avalanche (AVAX) is also gaining traction after announcing its integration into an upcoming VanEck Web3 fund — a move that has attracted new institutional support. With AVAX rebounding over 28% in one week , it’s becoming a Layer 1 network that fund managers are beginning to track more closely. But as these coins stabilize or rally, many early-stage traders are now rotating toward a high-upside alternative with a lower market cap: MAGACOIN FINANCE . The project is currently priced under $0.01 , with a $0.007 listing target and a fixed 100 billion token supply . What’s drawing the most attention is its soon-to-launch staking utility , which will allow holders to earn APY rewards — a highly requested feature by its growing community. On-chain wallet activity for MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to trend upward, and repeat buyer behavior suggests long-term conviction. Analysts now list it among the most promising early-stage altcoin entries of 2025 , especially for traders rotating out of overbought names and into assets with structured growth potential.

While often dismissed as unrealistic, recent statements suggest the idea should not be considered a joke. Instead, reaching this price point is seen as a formidable challenge requiring a combination of several favorable developments. Community Predictions and the Ongoing Debate Since its introduction in August 2020 , Shiba Inu has experienced a series of optimistic forecasts, especially after its dramatic price increase during the 2020–2021 bull market. These predictions have fueled significant interest, with one of the most talked-about price targets being $0.01. This target remains the subject of debate among investors and enthusiasts, with Shiba Inu’s marketing lead, Lucie, being one of the voices expressing belief in the token’s long-term growth potential. Introducing the $1 Discussion Amid the ongoing discussion around the $0.01 target, Lucie introduced a new topic by referencing an exchange with ChatGPT, where she explored the feasibility of SHIB reaching $1. The chatbot response indicated that although the $1 mark is extremely ambitious, it is not entirely out of reach. However, reaching this milestone would depend on several key factors. I always thought about $0.01 SHIB never $1 SHIB But I asked GPT pic.twitter.com/oQ0wh5MK1u — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) April 11, 2025 These include widespread use of SHIB in payment platforms and gaming applications, mainstream adoption of Shibarium (Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 blockchain), significant appreciation in the overall crypto market (possibly a tenfold increase), and increased utility from ecosystem tokens like BONE and TREAT. Additionally, consistent and large-scale SHIB token burns would be necessary to reduce the circulating supply. According to ChatGPT’s analysis, achieving a $1 valuation for SHIB is neither guaranteed nor impossible. It would require strong coordination across the Shiba Inu ecosystem and broader market support. Factors such as ongoing development, meaningful utility, sustained investor interest, and effective supply control would need to align for this outcome to materialize. The consistent reduction of SHIB’s circulating supply, primarily through token burns, was highlighted as a vital component in any realistic path toward such a price level. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Evaluating the Numbers At the time of writing, the token is priced at $0.00001439, representing a 1.54% gain in the past 24 hours and a 1.89% increase over the last month. For the token to reach $1, its price would have to climb by over 6.9 million percent. If SHIB’s supply remains unchanged, achieving a $1 price would place its market capitalization at approximately $589.5 trillion. This figure far exceeds the market value of any global asset, including gold, which is currently valued at about $22.54 trillion, and the total global money supply, estimated at around $129.3 trillion as of Q2 2024. A more realistic scenario would involve a massive reduction in supply. For example, if 99% of the current token supply were removed from circulation, the remaining 5.89 trillion tokens would give SHIB a market capitalization of $5.89 trillion at $1 per token. While still extremely ambitious, this figure is more aligned with the upper bounds of financial reality. The prospect of the token reaching $1 should not be treated as a casual prediction, nor should it be dismissed outright. Instead, it represents a highly challenging target that could be approached only through sustained development, strategic utility expansion, broad adoption, and significant reductions in supply.

According to a new report by Bloomberg, Ardoino says that even though the Genius Act, an industry-backed bill to regulate dollar-pegged crypto assets in the US, is making its way through Congress, Tether will remain focused overseas. “It is important for us to see how the Genius Act is distinguishing between foreign issuers and domestic issuers. For us, the main interest will remain outside of the US. We are looking at the Genius Act in a way that will allow us to be compliant. We can be compliant while still having a strong focus on foreign markets.” Tether, which is based in El Salvador, is the largest stablecoin issuer in the world but stopped serving customers in the US in 2018. However, the report says that if Tether were to focus on the US, it may run into issues such as backing USDT with Bitcoin ( BTC ), which currently isn’t allowed due to regulations. Ardoino goes on to say that since Tether isn’t focused on the US, the firm isn’t worried about major banks – such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo – venturing into the world of stablecoins and issuing their own. “We are not worried about the competitors coming from big banks, because they will look at the Western world. Our customer base are the 3 billion people unbanked that are not touching the banking system.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
