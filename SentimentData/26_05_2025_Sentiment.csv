Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor signals impending Bitcoin purchase Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor hinted at an impending Bitcoin purchase by posting the Bitcoin ( BTC ) chart the executive typically posts on Sundays to signal that the company will acquire more Bitcoin the following day when traditional financial markets open. ""I only buy Bitcoin with money I can't afford to lose,"" Saylor wrote to his 4.3 million followers in an X post . Strategy’s Bitcoin purchases. Source: SaylorTracker According to data from SaylorTracker , the company holds a total of 576,230 BTC, valued at over $62.5 billion, and is up over 55.5% on its investment, representing unrealized gains of over $22 billion at the time of this writing. The company continues to be closely watched by investors as a proxy for Bitcoin and a barometer for institutional adoption of the scarce digital asset. Pakistan allocates 2,000MW power for Bitcoin mining and AI centers Pakistan has allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity exclusively for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence centers. The move is part of a broader digital transformation plan spearheaded by the Pakistan Crypto Council and backed by the Ministry of Finance, according to a May 25 report by local news outlet 24NewsHD TV Channel. In the first phase, the government plans to channel excess power into AI infrastructure and crypto mining operations. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the decision is expected to attract billions in foreign investment while generating high-tech employment across the country. The initiative’s second phase will introduce access to renewable energy for mining operations, aiming to balance growth with environmental responsibility. Crypto ETFs won’t lose ‘their luster’ as wallet adoption grows — Cathie Wood ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood says crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will likely maintain their place in the economy no matter how big crypto wallet adoption becomes over the next decade. “I think ETFs are an important stepping stone because, you know, wallets seem so complicated, so much friction for consumers, they just wanna push a button,” Wood said at the Solana Accelerate event in New York on May 23. “So ETFs for those who want the convenience, I don’t think, will lose a lot of their luster,” she said. “But they will be a stepping stone into wallet-based.” Bitbo data suggests that there are around 200 million active Bitcoin wallets worldwide. Meanwhile, the trading week ending May 23 saw approximately $2.75 billion inflows into US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs , coinciding with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22.",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|LTC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ENA|BSV|ZK|WLD|OM|KAVA|BTG|ARKM,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-25 22:29:42

This article delves into the potential implications of these moves and explores which cryptocurrencies are poised for significant growth. As market dynamics shift, the outlook for these digital assets offers intriguing possibilities. Aave Price Surge: Month Trends and Key Level Analysis AAVE recorded strong gains with a 60.73% jump over the month and a 48.77% rise over the last six months. A one-week change of 21.38% points to recent vibrant movement, while the price has ranged from $125.84 to $191.06. Growth has been notably vigorous during both the short-term and medium-term periods, reflecting significant bullish sentiment. Price currently sits within a range bordered by support at $87.37 and resistance at $217.80. Bulls have the upper hand, with momentum indicators near 50 and an RSI of 73.06, although no clear trend has emerged. Traders may consider buying near support and monitoring resistance for potential exit points to capitalize on price movements. Ondo Price Analysis Reveals Mixed Trends and Key Levels ONDO prices showed a modest weekly gain of 2.60% but dipped by 4.18% over the past month and fell by 7.10% over the last six months. Price action remained within a range of $0.69 to $1.09, indicating a lack of a strong directional move over these periods. The data highlights a careful performance history with moderate fluctuations and subtle downtrends, lending caution to traders while hinting at potential future movement. Current price levels range from a support near $0.48 to a resistance at $1.27, with a secondary resistance at $1.67. Oscillators and momentum indicators remain close to neutral while bearish signals emerge in moving averages. Trading within these boundaries may benefit from buying near support and considering exits around resistance. Conclusion AAVE has shown strength by breaking its resistance level, signaling potential growth. ONDO , on the other hand, has dipped by breaking its channel support, facing immediate downside pressure. AAVE’s breakout could lead to further bullish momentum, while ONDO needs to reclaim lost support to stabilize. Both coins are at critical junctures that will define their short-term and possibly long-term trajectories. Monitoring these movements is essential to understanding their next steps. The market’s ongoing developments will play a significant role in their directions. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Speaking on Friday’s episode of the Pivot podcast , which he co-hosts, Galloway said Musk had alienated Tesla’s customers, one of his most important assets, by backing a president whose supporters show little interest in electric cars and the broader shift to clean transport. He then pointed to polls that showed Tesla was the 8th most reputable brand in 2021, but it has now fallen to 95th. “He’s alienated the wrong people,” Galloway said. “Three-quarters of Republicans would never consider buying an EV. So he’s cozied up to the people who aren’t interested in EVs.” Galloway went on to list sharp drops in Tesla’s sales across Europe last year, down 59% in France, 81% in Sweden, 74% in the Netherlands, 66% in Denmark, 50% in Switzerland and 33% in Portugal. Musk’s political interference drove away key European EV buyers In recent months, Musk has tried to influence several European political debates, particularly via posts on X. The Guardian reports his interference turned off many European customers, which is a key market for electric vehicles. Moreover, in April, China’s BYD outsold Tesla in Europe for the first time, according to Jato Dynamics, an automotive market intelligence firm. “This has arguably been one of the greatest brand destructions,” Galloway told co-host Kara Swisher. He added, “Tesla was a great brand. He’s alienated his core demographic.” The federal job and spending cuts trace back to Musk’s leadership of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, under Trump’s second term, which began in January. Musk secured that position after his super PAC donated $200 million to Trump’s successful November campaign to return to the White House following his 2020 defeat. Since then, opinion polls have shown widespread disapproval of Musk’s work for Trump. Some studies indicate that a majority of voters dislike how he and DOGE treated federal employees as the department worked through large job reductions. By late April, Tesla reported a 71% drop in profits. On an earnings call with investors, Musk said he would start stepping back from DOGE in May. He told shareholders that the job of getting the government’s “financial house in order is mostly done” and that his “time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly.” Although DOGE claimed it would cut about $160 billion in spending, CBS News reported that Partnership for Public Service estimated in late April that actually carrying out those cuts would itself cost around $135 billion, KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Tech|D.O.G.E|Elon Musk|Tesla,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-25 22:48:07

According to Bloomberg, the pressure is mounting right after President Donald Trump pushed his tax-heavy legislative package through the House last week, causing long-term Treasury yields to spike. But any sense of stability vanished on Friday when Trump posted that he’d impose a 50% tariff on imports from the European Union starting June 1, sending yields down again and exposing just how fragile the market still is. The impact was immediate. The 30-year Treasury yield fell 3 basis points to 5.031%, the 10-year dropped by 4 basis points to 4.509%, and the 2-year edged slightly lower to 3.993%. In the bond market, that’s movement that traders don’t ignore—especially not when it’s caused by social media posts from the Oval Office. Trump’s explanation was: “The European Union has been very difficult to deal with,” he wrote on Truth Social, before adding that the trade negotiations were “going nowhere.” Trump’s tariffs rattle markets as Apple dragged in Things got messier when Trump tossed Apple into the mix, posting that the company would be required to pay a 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured outside the US The stock tumbled, and once again, bond traders ran for safety. Treasury prices climbed as a result, pulling yields lower for the second time in a week that had already seen record-breaking movement. Peter Boockvar, the chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group, weighed in on the administration’s heavy-handed economic tactics, writing, “Capitalism works best when it is left alone as businesses and consumers are left free to trade goods and services at prices agreed upon by both sides… Unfortunately we keep straying from that basic economic concept with a muscled top-down approach.” By Tuesday of the previous week, bond markets were already on edge after Moody’s downgraded the US credit outlook, citing swelling deficits and the rising cost of servicing debt. That decision sent the 30-year yield past 5.1%, a level not seen since 2023, and pushed the 10-year over 4.5%. But the late-week drop—sparked by Trump’s tariff announcements—highlighted how fast the market is responding to political risk instead of economic fundamentals. Economic calendar packed as inflation data looms Markets are closed Monday for Memorial Day, but that’s where the calm ends. Beginning Tuesday, traders will have to process a string of high-impact reports, including new data on durable goods, capital goods, housing prices, and consumer confidence. The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge—core PCE—is due Friday, along with the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey, which has already shown inflation expectations hitting levels not seen in decades. Kathryn Kaminski, chief strategist at AlphaSimplex Group, summed it up: “Fixed income has been really difficult to trend this year as it’s been very back and forth with yields. We need more clarity on many things, including on inflation.” Fed officials will also be all over the calendar. Neel Kashkari from Minneapolis and John Williams from New York are speaking Tuesday. On Wednesday, Tom Barkin (Richmond), Austan Goolsbee (Chicago), Mary Daly (San Francisco), Lorie Logan (Dallas), and Adriana Kugler from the Fed Board will all make public remarks. Goolsbee returns on Thursday. Also on the radar are bond auctions. Tuesday will see auctions for 6-, 13-, and 26-week bills, and two-year notes. On Wednesday, the Treasury will offer 17-week bills, floating-rate notes, and five-year notes. Thursday wraps with 4- and 8-week bills and seven-year notes. Traders have little breathing room. With Trump back in the White House, tariffs back on the table, and inflation data waiting at the end of the week, the Treasury market is once again running hot. Everyone in the game is watching for numbers, watching for posts, and trying to price in what’s coming next. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The announcement followed a phone call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who had asked for extra time to reach an agreement. BREAKING: President Trump says he received a call from the President of the EU Commission asking for the 50% tariff deadline to be move to July 9th, and it was his ""privilege to do so."" pic.twitter.com/p7cP4ADVe2 — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) May 25, 2025 “We had a very nice call, and I agreed to move it,” Trump told reporters Sunday while flying back to Washington. Earlier Sunday, von der Leyen posted on X that “Europe is ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively,” but stressed that “a good deal” will need “time until July 9.” That date marks the end of the 90-day negotiation period during which the EU had been spared from the 20 percent tariffs Trump first announced in April. The 50% tariffs are here to stay, nonetheless Last Friday, the president warned he would raise the tariffs to 50 percent if he did not see faster progress. He accused the bloc of dragging its feet on talks and of targeting U.S. firms with lawsuits and extra regulations. The higher tariff threat would affect about $321 billion in U.S.-EU goods trade. According to calculations by Bloomberg Economics, it could shave nearly 0.6 percent off U.S. gross domestic product and lift prices by more than 0.3 percent. In response to Trump’s warning, the EU last week put forward a fresh trade offer, and its trade chief, Maroš Šefčovič, spoke by phone on Friday with his U.S. counterpart, Jamieson Greer. That move was part of Brussels’ effort to show willingness to compromise ahead of the looming tariff deadline. Also on Friday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News, “I would hope that this would light a fire under the EU,” referring to the higher tariff threat. A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, complained that the EU had not shown the same level of engagement as other trading partners. “We just haven’t seen anything material come out of the EU,” the official said. The Treasury and Commerce departments did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “I’m not looking for a deal,” Trump said at the White House on Friday. “We’ve set the deal — it’s at 50 percent.” If the 50 percent tariffs were to take effect on June 1, Brussels would have to decide whether to retaliate. The EU has already readied a €21 billion package of counter-tariffs on American goods such as maize, wheat, motorcycles, and clothing. It is also weighing an additional list worth €95 billion that would target items including Boeing aircraft, cars, and bourbon whiskey.

Market analysts are buzzing with speculation about these altcoins. Several factors could be at play, driving potential growth. Delving deeper into these dynamics might reveal why these cryptocurrencies are capturing attention. Find out which coins are poised for a surge and what could be fueling their rise. VeChain Market Snapshot and Key Levels Last month recorded a gain of 3.02% paired with a modest week increase of 0.77%, while the six-month performance shows a drop of 31.35%. VET ’s recent movement reveals short-term resilience contrasted by longer-term pressure. Price action during this period stayed within a confined range, hinting at cautious optimism amid overall downward momentum. VeChain trades between $0.0189 and $0.0303 with immediate resistance at $0.0352 and support near $0.0123. Indicators show a mixed outlook with a neutral RSI at 50.21 and minimal momentum. The market lacks a clear trend, suggesting traders might consider buying around support while monitoring resistance as prices test these levels. Upward Movement in Sei Amid Long-Term Decline Sei recorded a 9.02% increase over the past month, marking a recovery from a significant 66.31% drop in the last six months. Price action has been volatile, showcasing a rebound that slightly closed the gap from previous lows. Despite these short-term gains, the long-term bearish trend continues to affect overall sentiment. Indicators have demonstrated a tough road for the coin, where upward movements have not fully compensated for the steep decline experienced over the longer period. Currently, price sits between $0.15 and $0.24, with resistance levels at $0.28 and $0.37. Support hovers around $0.10. Bears are currently in control, as moving averages suggest potential further declines despite neutral oscillators. Traders might find opportunities to buy near support while monitoring for a breakout above resistance before making larger commitments. Conclusion VET and SEI could experience significant movement next week. Observing recent patterns and market sentiment around these coins reveals an upward potential. Strong fundamentals and positive announcements might drive interest and investment. It's essential to keep an eye on their performance, as both are showing signs of readiness for major shifts.

While ETH’s stability serves as a reliable anchor for the broader market, attention is increasingly turning toward early-stage projects that offer the potential for outsized returns. In this environment, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the standout contender for those seeking to capitalize on the next wave of crypto growth. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Momentum and 50x Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the spotlight as the breakout presale of 2025, with Stage 8 nearing completion and over $8 million already raised from a diverse base of participants. The project’s capped token supply and HashEx-audited contracts provide a foundation of trust and scarcity, while its politically charged narrative is fueling unprecedented demand. Investors can take advantage of a 50% token bonus by using the PATRIOT50X code before the $0.007 listing target. Analysts are now projecting returns as high as 50x, with some models suggesting even greater upside if current momentum continues. This combination of structural integrity and analyst-backed forecasts is positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as the premier early-stage opportunity for transformative gains. Ethereum (ETH): Stability and Institutional Confidence Ethereum’s technical indicators remain robust, with support at $2,400 and resistance at $2,900. Analysts anticipate that ETH will continue to test higher levels if bullish sentiment persists, though its upside is seen as steady rather than explosive when compared to early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Institutional inflows and ongoing upgrades further solidify Ethereum’s position as a core holding for diversified portfolios. XRP, TON, and Solana: Steady Growth and Ecosystem Strength XRP is trading near $2.35, with analysts forecasting a move toward $2.85–$3.40 in the near term. TON has surged to $6.45, propelled by growing NFT activity and Telegram’s expanding ecosystem. Solana is consolidating between $158 and $177, with technical indicators pointing to a potential breakout above $175. While all three assets offer solid fundamentals and growth prospects, none currently match the early-stage momentum and analyst-backed projections now surrounding MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Ethereum’s steady trajectory signals market maturity, but the most compelling opportunity for outsized gains lies with MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearly complete, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 50x ROI, MAGA is the breakout contender for 2025. For those seeking the next transformative crypto story, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands as the clear early-stage magnet—don’t miss the chance to be part of what could be the year’s defining crypto opportunity.

The South Korean media outlet Edaily quoted Min Byoung-dug, a lawmaker for the Democratic Party and the chairman of the party’s Digital Asset Committee, as stating that stablecoins could soon become an industry on an equal footing with AI or semiconductors. Min said: “South Korean is an internet powerhouse. We need to take the lead in institutionalizing stablecoins before US dollar-based stablecoins become firmly established. That is the only way we can secure a sure position in the global battle for stablecoin hegemony.” The Democratic Party lawmaker Min Byoung-dug. (Source: EDaily Issue Maker/YouTube/Screenshot) KRW Stablecoin Rollout: The Time Is Now Min added that he thought the potential for stablecoin adoption in the payments space was “limitless.” He explained: “We should not just sit back and watch it grow into a powerful new future industry on the scale of AI or semiconductors.” Min is a close Lee ally and an open advocate of crypto regulation reform. He has also previously called for tax parity between South Korean stock traders and crypto investors . Lee has repeatedly promised to launch a state-backed KRW stablecoin in response to the rapid rise of USD-pegged coins like USDT and USD Coin (USDC) . The frontrunner, who leads his closest rival Kim Moon-soo (People Power Party) in the polls by almost 10%, has called for Seoul to “enter the stablecoin market quickly.” 이재명 46.6% 김문수 37.6% 이준석 10.4%…엇갈린 서울·PK 민심 https://t.co/ULLVbHi5CQ — JTBC 뉴스 (@JTBC_news) May 24, 2025 Latest poll has Lee on 46.6%, Kim on 37.6%, and Reform Party leader Lee Jun-seok on 10.4%. Lee has warned that delaying the launch of such a coin could lead to further capital flight from the country . Min echoed Lee’s calls, telling EDaily that Seoul “must expedite the institutionalization of stablecoins.” He explained that South Korea “should not fall behind as the use of stablecoins rapidly increases, particularly in the United States.” USDT, USDC Dominance Min noted the fact that USDT and USDC “account for 90% of the stablecoin market in the United States.” He also claimed that USD-pegged coins “are already being used in some parts of Korea, such as Dongdaemun Market, where many foreign payments are made.” Source: Dune Min’s comments about Dongdaegmun Market, Seoul’s biggest clothing and textiles market, may be seen as contentious. Posters on popular South Korean crypto forums last year claimed that “mass USDT adoption” was underway at Dongdaemun, with Chinese buyers particularly keen on the coin. However, Dongaemun traders have told both Cryptonews.com and South Korean media outlets that cash, not crypto, is still king at the market . Regardless, Min said that rapid adoption at home and overseas means Seoul risks being left out in the cold. He said that if USDT and USDC continue to gain popularity worldwide, the space a won-based stablecoin could fill “will inevitably diminish.” DPK's Lee Jae-myung urges 'judgment of insurrection forces,' pledges policies to boost stock market https://t.co/NdPe030YSR — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) May 25, 2025 Could Lawmakers Act Before June 3 Elections? Min claimed that a won-based stablecoin could gain global attention and drive up global demand for won-related assets, such as the government bonds underpinning a KRW stablecoin. The lawmaker said that fans of South Korean webtoons (web-based comics) could be among the first overseas users. Readers may use a won-based stablecoin to buy webtoons, Min said. Min added that he is already pushing for the National Assembly to approve stablecoin legislation. The DP has a large majority in the house going into the elections. And with the nation essentially rudderless following the impeachment earlier this year of former President Yoon Suk-yeol, the party may yet decide to push ahead with such a bill before the June 3 elections. Min has already unveiled a private member’s bill named the Basic Act on Digital Assets, prepared with the aid of industry experts. The lawmaker said of the draft law: “I plan to submit the bill to the National Assembly after another review.” The post South Korea’s Biggest Party Urges ‘Expedited KRW Stablecoin Rollout’ appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|South Korea|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT|USDC,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-25 23:30:00

However, the real story is unfolding elsewhere: MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly outshining both in daily trading volume and community momentum, capturing the attention of both retail and institutional traders. With time running out before its presale closes, MAGA is positioning itself as the breakout contender for the year, while Cardano, Litecoin, and Bitcoin remain essential components of diversified portfolios. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Volume Surge, Scarcity, and Breakout Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the pace for early-stage altcoins in 2025, with daily volume and presale momentum eclipsing even the most established names. Here’s why traders and analysts are calling MAGA the next big crypto story: Unprecedented Volume Growth: Daily trading volume has surged, outpacing Solana and XRP in early-stage activity, as both retail and institutional buyers rush to secure their positions before the presale closes. Scarcity-Driven Model: With a capped 100 billion token supply and structured distribution, MAGA is designed for supply squeezes that historically drive explosive price gains. Viral Narrative and Community Power: The project’s politically charged, socially viral narrative has energized a passionate community, fueling organic growth and repeat buying activity. Analyst-Backed Upside: Recent forecasts project 30x–36x returns, with some models suggesting even higher upside if momentum continues. Price targets near $0.007 at listing signal massive potential for early entrants. Limited-Time Bonus: Early participants can still claim a 50% token bonus using the PATRIOT50X promo code before the $0.007 listing, making MAGA the go-to allocation for those seeking transformative gains. As each stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is not just following the market—it’s leading its own breakout cycle, with time running out for those who want to secure a ground-floor entry. Solana and XRP: Steady but Outpaced Solana remains a leader in DeFi and NFT ecosystems, with strong on-chain growth and institutional interest. XRP continues to benefit from regulatory clarity and ETF speculation, with whale accumulation signaling long-term confidence. However, both are seeing more measured upside compared to the explosive momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE, as their larger market caps limit short-term multiple expansion. Cardano (ADA): Gradual Progress, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Cardano is trading near $0.85, with forecasts suggesting a move toward $1.00–$1.30 by year-end if sentiment holds. While ADA’s fundamentals are solid, its near-term returns are modest compared to the presale-driven surge of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin (BTC): Stability and Market Anchor Litecoin is consolidating above $90, with technicals hinting at a bullish continuation toward $100–$110. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is holding firm above $108,000, serving as the market’s anchor and a core holding for long-term portfolios. Both offer stability, but their upside is outpaced by the rapid accumulation and momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion Solana and XRP remain essential assets, but the most dramatic growth potential is now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With daily volume surging, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 36x ROI, MAGA is the breakout altcoin to watch as time runs out for early entry.

A few days ago, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the procedural vote by 66 to 32, with two senators abstaining. Recall that White House officials have discredited conflict of interest fears in the president’s burgeoning cryptocurrency activities during his second term. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Regulating stablecoins, digital assets whose value is tied to another asset, most especially the U.S. dollar, has been touted by supporters of the bill as a crucial step towards wider oversight of the crypto market, and one that will strengthen U.S. innovation in the industry. However, concerns over gaps in the bill’s safeguards brought about fierce objections from Democrats. Some, especially Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, argued it would boost Trump’s chances of corruption by “supercharging the size of the stablecoin market.” What’s Next for the GENIUS Act? The bill still has a long way to go before final passage. That vote may likely come after the Memorial Day recess. And serious political risks remain.

It’s wide, painful, and according to Jim Cramer, downright “hideous.” Speaking on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street on SUnday, Jim said, “The money keeps going to these European stocks. And it’s rather amazing.” The DAX in Germany is up 19% so far this year. The S&P 500? Down more than 1%. President Donald Trump kicked off the latest round of market instability on April 2, when he announced “reciprocal” tariffs that rattled investor confidence. That same week, the bond market got hit too. Yields spiked as inflation worries grew. Tech giants like Apple and Nvidia tanked, dragged down by their global supply chain exposure and China-related revenue streams. On April 9, Trump paused certain country-specific tariffs, but left China out. That made things worse for companies deeply tied to Chinese markets. Trump’s trade moves worsen investor fears Just when things were beginning to cool off, Trump piled on more pressure. On May 12, trade tensions between China and the US eased slightly, but it didn’t last. That Friday, Trump pushed for a 25% tariff on phones not made in the United States, calling out Apple, Samsung, and others directly. Hours later, he floated a 50% tariff on European Union imports, scheduled to start June 1. Markets had no time to digest the chaos. That same evening—May 16—Moody’s dropped its rating on US government debt by one notch, matching Fitch’s downgrade from August 2023 and Standard & Poor’s 2011 cut. The original S&P downgrade crushed stocks. The Fitch downgrade hurt, but less. This time, markets barely moved, but bond yields jumped. On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield rose above 4.6% before pulling back slightly. Stocks stayed flat, but the bond market was shaken. Jim pointed out a key difference between now and previous crises. “What’s happening that didn’t happen then is there is an alternative,” he said . That alternative is Europe, which right now is attracting capital with cheaper stocks, more flexible rate policies, and stronger year-to-date returns. Wall Street reacts as Europe pulls ahead Even Barclays admitted that the “end of US exceptionalism” might be Europe’s moment. The European Central Bank has more space to cut rates. Their stocks are valued lower. Investors are taking note. In a May research note, KKR explained that institutional money is eyeing exits from the United States. “Many CIOs are considering moving assets out of the United States towards other parts of the world,” the firm said. But they also warned it’s not that easy. The US stock market is still twice the size of Europe, Japan, and India combined. KKR reminded clients that many American companies are large, liquid, and still generating strong returns on capital. Jim doesn’t believe in abandoning US stocks either. During last week’s Monthly Meeting, he listed six stocks he’s watching to buy if prices fall, and named five that worry him. At the top of his concern list? Apple. Even before Trump’s latest tariff threats, he was already nervous about the tech giant’s exposure. “There are tons of stocks I would like to buy if the prices come down,” he said. In his May 11 column, Jim talked about what he saw in Europe firsthand. “They are crushing it with stock performance that is outstanding, in many cases backed up by earnings,” he wrote. He said the US isn’t holding up. “America is hideously underperforming,” he wrote, comparing the US to its “European cousins.” He also described Europe as “safer and more predictable,” adding that markets there “can continue to climb given the momentum.” Jim says he doesn’t like the “sell America” approach. He said investors should be adjusting—not exiting. During his April 3 episode of Mad Money , right after Trump’s first tariff wave, he advised people to buy different stocks and cut exposure to riskier ones. He’s looking for domestic companies that won’t collapse during a slowdown. His ideal picks? Companies with pricing power, strong demand, low credit risk, and resilience even when the economy slips. While some investors are drawn to international markets, they may already have that exposure without realizing it. Many S&P 500 companies generate a large share of their revenue abroad, which means US stocks are more globally tied than most people think.

45098286,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=734692,1748217204,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45098286.jpeg,Trump claims Nippon Steel deal will boost US job market but the math doesn’t add up,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-nippon-steel-deal-boost-us-job-market/,"Donald Trump claimed on Friday that a “planned partnership” between Nippon Steel and US Steel would deliver “at least 70,000 jobs” to American workers and inject $14 billion into the economy. But that figure overshoots by a long shot — more than five times the number of employees US Steel currently has in the United States. The number raised eyebrows, not because it was big, but because nobody — not Nippon, not the unions, not the investors — can figure out where the hell he got it from. According to Bloomberg, after over 17 months of negotiations, Nippon Steel believed it had finally secured the $14.1 billion takeover of US Steel, but Trump’s statement muddied the waters. He didn’t actually say the buyout was approved. He just declared that US Steel would “remain American.” That line, dropped on social media, landed hard and fast. Yet, he gave no specifics, no follow-up from the White House, and no timeline for next steps. Companies scramble for clarity as shares surge Publicly, both Nippon Steel and US Steel cheered what they called a “bold” moment and embraced the idea of a new partnership. But neither addressed the actual takeover deal. US Steel’s stock, meanwhile, jumped as much as 26% in Friday trading and closed 21% higher at $52.01, even though the company had already agreed to a $55 per share buyout in cash back in December 2023. Trump’s approval, if that’s even what it was, contradicts his own words from December, when he wrote that he was “totally against the once great and powerful US Steel being bought by a foreign company.” At the time, that rare stance put him in line with Joe Biden, who blocked the deal in January on the advice of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Suddenly pivoting now raises real questions about how far Trump is willing to go to appease Japan, especially while both countries are deep in tariff talks. Last week, Ryosei Akazawa, Japan’s top trade negotiator, met in Washington with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. A few days earlier, Trump had a call with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The two agreed to meet in Canada next month during the G7 leaders’ summit. The timing is everything. The tariff issue is boiling. Japan is facing a 25% tariff on cars, steel, and aluminum, plus a 10% duty on all other goods that could rise to 24% in July if there’s no new trade deal. Car companies like Toyota have already flagged billions in profit losses, and Ishiba’s government is staring at a possible recession after last quarter’s contraction. Union rejects deal while confusion grows over future ownership Akazawa, speaking to reporters on Friday, refused to comment on the steel situation, saying they’d wait for an official statement. On tariffs, he acknowledged the June meeting but stressed, “It’s unwise to rush any agreement.” He’s expected to return to Washington on May 30 to meet Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who’s been involved in the last two rounds of negotiations. While Japan pushes for answers, the workers on the ground in America remain skeptical. The United Steelworkers union, which oversees labor at US Steel’s major integrated plants across the Rust Belt, isn’t sold on any of this. Their president, David McCall, said from the beginning that Nippon Steel didn’t consult with the union before announcing the deal. He’s not buying their promises now either. “Their ‘promise’ is always made with exceptions to back out of the statements,” McCall said in a text message this week. “Nothing makes me think this one is anything but another desperate attempt.” That “attempt” includes maintaining plants that are decades old, run on high-cost systems, and will need serious investment to stay open. Advocates of the deal say Nippon Steel will fix them up, bring in new tech, and upgrade capacity. But again, they haven’t said how much they’d spend or when they’d start. Nippon, for its part, called the partnership “a game changer” in a brief statement, saying it benefits US Steel, the American steel industry, and the broader manufacturing base. But investors want more than slogans. And so far, that’s all they’ve been handed.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) brought together its ten member states in an attempt to protect their economies, just as Trump’s White House ramps up duties on exports from the region. According to information provided by Bloomberg, the talks are focused on getting ahead of the fallout caused by Trump’s latest tariff decisions. China sent Premier Li Qiang to lead its delegation. Gulf Cooperation Council countries including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates are also in the room. But not a single official from the U.S. or its Western allies showed up. China’s presence grows as U.S. skips meeting For Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, hosting this summit is about drawing in trade from nations sitting on big cash surpluses. With China warning other countries not to sign deals that might hurt its interests, Asean leaders are walking a thin line between two superpowers. “There is no substitute for the United States,” said Shahriman Lockman, an analyst at the Institute of Strategic and International Studies in Malaysia. “Yes, we talk about diversification and autonomy. But let’s not kid ourselves — there is no real alternative in sight.” Still, trade numbers show that the U.S. is already falling behind. China’s trade with Asean hit $982.3 billion in 2024, while the U.S. only managed $476.8 billion, most of it imports from the region. That gap is now at the center of every private conversation inside the summit hall. Recent visits by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia included pitches for what he called an “Asian family,” a message aimed directly at countering the U.S. push to isolate China. Meanwhile, Indonesia joined the BRICS bloc earlier this year, and Malaysia, Vietnam, and Thailand have all been added as partner nations. That deepens economic ties with both China and Russia, giving Southeast Asia more options if Trump’s tariffs grow even harsher. Trade talks and regional conflicts collide at summit At the summit, Malaysia’s Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil told reporters the country is open to doing business with anyone. “I see this as a very good opportunity for us to show that Malaysia is a neutral country that wants to trade with any country that would like to trade with us,” he said. Inside the U.S., officials from several Southeast Asian countries are trying to negotiate with Trump’s administration one-on-one to avoid the steepest tariffs. A bloc approach, led by Malaysia, was already rejected, according to local media. The hope is that separate deals could still buy them time. But those efforts are shaky. Singapore’s Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong said Asean is working to improve an existing trade agreement. Though over 90% of goods in the region already move tariff-free, Gan admitted that wouldn’t be enough. “These are encouraging, but it doesn’t mean that the trouble is over,” he said. Asean also just wrapped up negotiations with China to upgrade their free trade agreement. The new version includes chapters on crypto-related digital sectors, clean energy, and small and medium-sized businesses, all of which are expected to boost cross-border movement of both money and services. But trade isn’t the only thing being discussed. The military crisis in Myanmar is getting attention too. Leaders plan to hold side talks on how to deal with the country’s civil war, which has dragged on with no resolution. There’s also pressure on Anwar to say something about the war in Gaza. He said last week he would “probably touch on” the issue and call for a ceasefire, while using the summit to point out the growing divide between richer nations and developing countries in the Global South. That said, expectations are low. Gregory Poling, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told reporters: “Despite rhetoric from the Malaysian government as chair, there has been very little evidence of an Asean effort here. The stakes are actually pretty low.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",News|Asia|China|tariffs,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-25 23:57:10

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 318,700 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum appears to be in the midst of a five-wave rally on the four-hour chart. Bluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to witness a five-wave surge before going through a correction. The analyst predicts that Ethereum will still hit his upside target of $3,500 even though President Trump’s latest tariff threats are weighing down markets. “Despite the trump tariff tantrum which happened legit 10 minutes after I went to sleep, I think ETH still looks ok and going to assume a range here.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $2,478. The analyst is also bullish on the Ethereum-based memecoin SPX6900 ( SPX ). Bluntz thinks that SPX is now in an uptrend and en route to a new all-time high of $2.30 by October of this year. “Bid some SPX. Going to try and hold for all-time high.” Source: Bluntz/X SPX refers to the S&P 500 index, which satirically aspires to “topple the S&P 500 by achieving a staggering $69 trillion market cap.” Fellow crypto strategist Jack is also bullish on SPX, thinking that the memecoin will skyrocket if the S&P 500 itself explodes to a new all-time high. “Since nothing makes sense anyway, it is probably a good bet to own SPX6900 if SPX motors to all-time high, because well obviously SPX going to 6900 will capture mindshare and apparently that is, besides just liquidity beta, what people will argue why SPX6900 goes up.

While BTC’s resilience and institutional inflows provide a stable foundation, the real intrigue is unfolding beneath the surface: MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly capturing the attention of major crypto whales and analysts, positioning itself as the breakout early-stage contender for 2025. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Momentum and Whale Accumulation MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the dominant presale of the year, with Stage 8 nearly full and over $8 million raised as demand accelerates. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling unprecedented accumulation from both retail and institutional buyers. On-chain data confirms a recent 72.95 ETH whale buy—valued at over $133,000—marking the largest single early-stage crypto purchase of 2025. This level of whale activity signals deep conviction and strategic positioning before listings go live. Analysts are projecting returns of 25x to 35x, with some models suggesting even higher upside if momentum continues. As each stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is solidifying its reputation as the top early-stage opportunity for those seeking transformative gains before the next wave of price discovery. Bitcoin (BTC): Market Anchor and Institutional Support Bitcoin remains the market’s anchor, trading above $108,000 with forecasts for a possible move to $118,000–$131,000 if bullish momentum returns. Institutional inflows and ETF demand continue to support BTC’s long-term outlook, but its upside from current levels is seen as more measured, prompting many investors to diversify into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Consolidation and Rotating Capital XRP is consolidating near $2.45, buoyed by regulatory clarity and ETF speculation. While XRP’s fundamentals remain strong and whale accumulation continues, its price action has become more range-bound. Analysts forecast a move toward $2.85–$3.40 in the coming weeks, but the most aggressive capital is now rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper, asymmetric returns. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Steady Growth, MAGA Outpaces NEAR Protocol is trading around $3.07, with forecasts suggesting a move toward $3.85–$5.18 by year-end. While NEAR’s ecosystem continues to expand and its technicals remain positive, its near-term upside is more modest compared to the explosive presale-driven momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL): Technical Strength, MAGA Leads Solana is consolidating between $158 and $175, with technicals pointing to a potential breakout above $175. The network’s high throughput and expanding DeFi ecosystem continue to attract users and developers. While Solana’s outlook is optimistic, its growth is steady compared to the rapid accumulation and analyst-backed projections now surrounding MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Bitcoin’s stability and Solana’s technical strength are impressive, but the most compelling upside is quietly unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE . With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 35x ROI, MAGA stands as the breakout contender for 2025.

He made the announcement late Sunday, pushing the original June 1 deadline to July 9. Data from Bloomberg shows that this delay instantly lifted US equity-index futures, reversing some of the damage done Friday when Trump had first dropped the threat. S&P 500 futures jumped 0.9% and Nasdaq 100 futures went up about 1% after the announcement. That bounce followed a rough close to last week when those same contracts dropped sharply in response to Trump’s tariff warning. Before the extension, futures for Japan, Australia, and Hong Kong had already been trading lower in early Asia sessions, echoing the Friday mood on Wall Street. Trump threats drag gold down, lift the dollar Trump’s Friday move wasn’t just about the EU. He also said he’d slap a 25% tariff on smartphones if companies like Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. didn’t start producing inside the US. That aggressive talk didn’t go unnoticed. The dollar, which had just sunk to its lowest point since December 2023, climbed early Monday. At the same time, the yen and Swiss franc, which had surged on Friday’s uncertainty, both retreated. Gold didn’t hold up either. The metal had gained 1.9% on Friday from traders looking for safety, touching $3,357 per ounce, but by Monday, spot gold was down 0.3% at $3,346.89/oz. Analysts said that even though the delay lowered short-term panic, concerns are still high over the US fiscal position. Those fears got worse after Moody’s Ratings took away the US’s top-tier credit grade this month, citing Trump’s latest tax bill that passed the House of Representatives last week and is now with the Senate. Meanwhile, the Treasury market showed little movement Friday. Yields had shot up earlier in the week as traders tried to figure out how much damage Trump’s new tax breaks might do to the national debt. Treasuries were closed Monday for a US holiday, giving investors a brief pause ahead of more data. The next big report comes Friday when the Federal Reserve releases its preferred inflation metric, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (excluding food and energy). Economists are looking for a 0.1% rise for April. US Steel deal, Japan negotiations, and shipping worries Friday also brought a curveball: Trump announced a deal between United States Steel Corp. and Japan’s Nippon Steel Corp.. The move stunned traders. Trump said the agreement would help keep US Steel in America, but gave no further details. Still, it was enough to send US Steel shares up 21.2%. Meanwhile, Nippon Steel’s ADRs rose 1.7%. Japanese stocks may stay volatile. After Trump’s comments, the yen weakened, which tends to support local exporters. But anxiety over Europe and Apple’s exposure remains. Shoji Hirakawa, chief global strategist at Tokai Tokyo Intelligence Lab, said Monday, “Japanese stocks are likely to start lower today due to concerns over tariffs on Europe and Apple, but the decline is expected to gradually narrow.” The Nikkei 225 futures touched 37,210 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, slightly higher than the last close of 37,160.47. Behind the scenes, Japan’s top trade officials are trying to close out negotiations before Trump sits down with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in June. Hirakawa also said, “Given that tariffs negotiations between Japan and the US are ongoing, it’s clear that compared to two months ago, the situation is moving toward a resolution. Stocks could turn positive.” Capital Economics thinks Trump might be bluffing. “At this stage, we are not inclined to change our working assumption that tariffs on the EU will ultimately settle around 10%, but this underlines that there are risks and that the road to an agreement could be rocky.” Back in Europe, there are signs that the ongoing trade drama is already starting to jam up major shipping ports. Some northern European hubs are facing rising congestion, which could push global shipping costs higher if the tariff threats continue into the summer. On the data front, Asia is set to release several numbers this week: Singapore’s industrial production, Hong Kong’s trade figures, and South Korea’s retail sales—all expected between now and Saturday. Traders are watching those closely as they gauge how the region is holding up under the weight of ongoing US policy moves. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Trump made the remarks to reporters on Sunday in New Jersey, just before boarding Air Force One. He appeared increasingly annoyed with Russian President Vladimir Putin and dismayed by stalled negotiations aimed at securing a ceasefire in Ukraine. “I’m not happy with what Putin is doing,” Trump said. “He’s killing a lot of people, and I don’t know what the hell happened to Putin. I’ve known him a long time—always gotten along with him—but he’s sending rockets into cities and killing people, and I don’t like it at all.” Ukrainian officials reported that at least 12 people died in the overnight air raids. The attacks prompted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to renew his appeal for stricter penalties against Moscow. The bombardment also took place amid a third day of prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine, underscoring the conflict’s complex, ongoing human toll. Trump repeatedly asked what had happened to Putin. “We’re in the middle of talking, and he’s shooting rockets into Kyiv and other cities,” he said. “I don’t like it at all.” Until now, the focus of U.S. pressure had fallen mostly on Zelenskiy to find a path to peace, even as Russia’s full-scale invasion that began in February 2022 continues to exact a heavy price. Earlier this month, Trump had shown reluctance to ramp up sanctions on the Kremlin. But he suggested new measures could target Russia’s oil trade or its state-owned oil giant, Rosneft. Russia already faces sanctions from the European Union and the United Kingdom. Earlier last week, Britain unveiled a sweeping package of sanctions against Russia’s military, energy, and financial sectors. The measures, coordinated with the EU, came in response to the largest drone assault of the war over the past weekend, which struck multiple Ukrainian cities. London said its latest sanctions hit 100 new targets. These include networks that supply Russia’s Iskander missiles, Kremlin-backed information operations, and financial outfits that help Moscow sidestep existing penalties. “We urge [President Vladimir Putin] to agree a full, unconditional ceasefire right away so there can be talks on a just and lasting peace,” UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said. Lammy added that any delay in peace efforts would only strengthen Britain’s resolve to back Ukraine’s defense and tighten sanctions on Russia’s war machine. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, together with leaders of major EU nations, has called on Washington to join in imposing harsher penalties on Moscow for refusing to halt hostilities. Among the British measures is a new round of sanctions on the Social Design Agency, a Kremlin-linked disinformation group first blacklisted in 2024. London described it as a body that sought to stir unrest in European countries. Forty-six financial institutions accused of helping Russia dodge existing sanctions were also targeted. Notable entities include the St. Petersburg Currency Exchange and the Russian Deposit Insurance Agency, which underwrites Russian banks. Eighteen additional vessels were added to the blacklist. These ships form part of Russia’s so-called “shadow fleet,” which is used to circumvent Western restrictions and keep its crude exports flowing. Finally, Britain said it is working with international partners to drive down the $60-per-barrel cap on the price Russia can fetch for its oil when using services, like insurance and shipping, from major industrial nations.

It pledged transparency , making it easier for regulators, exchanges, and compliance teams to spot fraud and other illegal activities on the platform. But what began as a basic form of on-chain oversight has evolved into a powerful weapon that savvy players now use to influence markets and even target individual users. Wallet data fuels both innovation and exploitation Many firms, such as Chainalysis, Arkham Intelligence, and Nansen, have turned blockchain data analysis into a thriving industry. These companies convert raw, bewildering onchain data into high-resolution weapons-grade surveillance. Originally designed for compliance, fraud detection, and law enforcement, these are now generally available for broader market usage. Wallet intelligence is regularly used by traders for predictive trading strategies , expecting the moves before they come up. Regulators use it to help enforce KYC (Know Your Customer) rules and fight criminal activity like money laundering. Exchanges can use it to watch for sketchy behavior — and even censor transactions they find too risky. But this visibility boom comes with danger. The knowledge available in a wallet can be good or bad. On the one hand, it also adds accountability; on the other, it puts users at the mercy of control and manipulation. Wallet data can be manipulated to move markets, suppress points of view, and reframe narratives — some of that manipulation occurs behind the closed doors of opacity and without transparency. Crypto’s privacy promise unravels under watchful eyes The whole point of cryptocurrency was privacy and freedom from centralization. Bitcoin and its ilk offered pseudonymity — you could transact without revealing your identity, escaping the prying eyes of banks and governments. However, transparency on the blockchain has a dark side. Each deal, swap, or token transfer is on an open ledger for eternity. Wallet intelligence firms collect and analyze this data to structure detailed profiles that closely monitor balances, trading behavior, and relationships across wallets. This has eroded pseudonymity in crypto transactions. Today, regulators can freeze wallets that have suspicious activity. Exchanges can proactively prevent transactions using a risk score from wallet intelligence companies. That means a handful of powerful actors determine who is “risky” or “safe” — that designation will influence user experience and access. The Mantra OM token collapse serves as a case study of transparency weaponized. The token was highly centralized—90% held by insiders—and traded with very low liquidity. These conditions alone made it vulnerable to market manipulation. When combined with wallet intelligence, this vulnerability became explosive. Coordinated attackers could use detailed wallet data to time their trades and execute massive short positions, triggering forced liquidations and market panic. The FTX collapse revealed a new kind of centralization in crypto The FTX collapse of 2022 exposed both the power and the risks of wallet intelligence. Regulators and auditors did not detect the scheme in time. But blockchain sleuths in the crypto community deployed wallet intelligence tools to track down billions of dollars in customer funds that had gone missing. They uncovered secret self-dealing between Alameda Research and FTX by tracking wallet flows, which is a welter of deception. Pocket intelligence enabled us to shine a light in places where centralized actors sought to hide. However, this power is narrowly concentrated in only a few companies. These firms have privileged access to wallet data, which allows them to determine which wallets to flag and analyze suspicious activities. This type of centralization is contrary to the decentralized principles on which cryptocurrency was based. The crypto movement is built on decentralization. It vows to give power back to users instead of letting centralized gatekeepers make decisions for us. But the promise of wallet obscurity may be undone by a growing body of wallet intelligence. When a few companies dominate the processing of wallet data, network control becomes consolidated in the hands of a few companies. It echoes “surveillance capitalism,” whereby user data is mined and weaponized for profit and control —but now wrapped in blockchain technology. This is a potential violation of user privacy, market fairness, and, ultimately, the vision of a fully self-sovereign, decentralized financial system. To maintain privacy and decentralization, individuals must take back control The battle-ready crypto community has a clear and present threat that needs to be met head-on: wallet intelligence being used as a weapon. If we want user anonymity without losing transparency, we need privacy-preserving technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs, confidential transactions or privacy-oriented blockchains. Because the power of wallet intelligence affects so many users, the governance for wallet intelligence needs to be open and decentralized to avoid centralization by a single party. Developers, regulators, and users need to come together to code safeguards that protect privacy even as they allow for accountability.

H100 said on May 25 that the funds, secured through 0% interest convertible loans, will be used to purchase Bitcoin ( BTC ) in line with its Bitcoin-buying pivot announced on May 22. Back, a longtime Bitcoin cypherpunk, contributed around $1.4 million, while the remaining $800,000 came from investment firms Morten Klein, Alundo Invest AS, Race Venture Scandinavia AB and Crafoord Capital Partners. The raise would allow H100 to buy around 20.18 Bitcoin at current market prices, which would add to the 4.39 Bitcoin that it purchased on May 22 and bring its total stash to roughly 24.57 Bitcoin. Source: H100 H100 said the convertible loans bear no interest and will mature on June 15, 2028. The loan may be converted into shares at any time at a conversion rate of 1.3 Swedish krona (11 US cents) per share. If H100’s share price maintains a volume-weighted average price of more than 33% above the conversion price for a cumulative total of 60 trading days, H100 has the right to mandate a conversion of the loan into equity. A full conversion would result in the issuance of roughly 16,153,900 new shares, corresponding to a dilution of approximately 12%. H100 shares bounced on Bitcoin buy Shares in H100 jumped 37% on the firm’s May 22 announcement and rose another 5.33% the following day to 1.29 SEK (14 US cents), Bloomberg data shows.

Andersen believes “the values of individual sovereignty highly present in the Bitcoin community aligns well with, and will appeal to, the customers and communities we are building the H100 platform for.” According to H100, the move makes it the first public company in Sweden to adopt a Bitcoin treasury policy and one of the first in Europe. The number of companies buying Bitcoin as a treasury asset is on the rise, with 112 public firms now holding the cryptocurrency , according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET data. Ten of those corporate Bitcoin holding companies are based in Europe, making H100 one of the first in the region to adopt the trend.

In a new update , Lee says he believes the current surge, which lifted the S&P 500 by 17% from recent lows to within 3% of an all-time high, reflects a powerful but underappreciated rally. “Part of this [bearish sentiment] is understandable. We had a black swan event on post-tariff liberation day, meaning an unexpected event, and we had a 20% fall in stocks in a very short period of time.” As for what’s coming next, Lee points to historical patterns where doubt after a market dump fueled rallies. “When stocks began to rally after March of 2020, many fund managers said we’re still in a bear market. And recall in the fall of 2022 after the markets made its low in October of 2022, a lot of investors were saying that this was just another bear market rally and investors are about to make a mistake… But here’s the reality – investors flip bullish as soon as you make an all-time high. So in other words, investors generally fight after a decline. They’ll fight the rally until you make a new all-time high. At a new high, they turn they turn around and become bullish and I think that that’s going to happen as soon as markets make a new all-time high.” Source: Fundstrat Lee says Bitcoin’s recent all-time high above $111,000 is another leading indicator for the S&P, because Bitcoin peaked about a month before the S&P did and they’re both tracking increased global liquidity. As for Moody’s downgrade of US government debt from AAA to AA1, Lee says he doubts it’s a negative signal for markets, noting that S&P first downgraded the US in 2011 and Fitch followed in 2023.

The insured damage, mostly from reinsurance payouts, is being carried by ten major publicly traded firms across Europe, as reported by CNBC. These companies are based mainly in Germany, the UK, Switzerland, and France, and their combined losses now account for nearly a tenth of all insured losses from the disaster. Munich Re and Hannover Re, the top two players out of Germany, are responsible for nearly $2 billion of that total. Swiss giants Swiss Re and Zurich followed close behind, clocking in around $830 million. Four UK firms — Hiscox, Lancashire, Conduit Re, and Beazley — collectively took on about $500 million in hits. Over in France, Scor logged $167 million in losses while AXA reported $100 million. That’s all real money. And none of these numbers are estimates — they’ve been reported by the companies themselves in earnings and financial statements. Swiss Re doubles loss forecast as LA fires kill 30, destroy thousands of homes The wildfires, which tore through Eaton Canyon and Palisades, left 30 dead, destroyed thousands of buildings, and displaced millions. The scale forced Swiss Re to raise its projection for total insured losses from $20 billion to $40 billion. These updated numbers now make the disaster one of the worst in California’s history. The overall economic damage is still expected to reach around $50 billion, but the chunk covered by insurers has widened fast. Michael Huttner, an analyst at Berenberg, said the size of these insurance losses caught a lot of firms off guard. “It was a combination of unusual and big,” Michael told CNBC. He added that the uncontrolled spread of the fire pushed claims far beyond what reinsurers expected. Despite that, Michael pointed out that profits across the sector still came in stronger than anticipated. He described it as a sign of “resiliency” in the face of large-scale disasters. But even with Europe eating billions in damages, its insurers are still only handling a small slice of the overall insured total. That’s because reinsurance agreements don’t kick in until the primary insurers, like Chubb, absorb the first wave. These contracts start covering losses only after about €400 million in damage has been handled by the front-line firms. So the reinsurers only got dragged in once the fire had already done some serious damage in California. Japan’s insurers hit harder than expected, deductibles up across Europe Meanwhile, insurers in Japan also got burned. Tokio Marine and Sompo disclosed wildfire losses of almost 50 billion yen, which is roughly $348 million. That number blew past JPMorgan’s initial post-fire estimate of just $63 million. If Swiss Re’s forecast of $40 billion proves accurate, this event will be four times worse than the 2018 wildfires in California, which cost insurers around $16 billion. During that earlier disaster, Munich Re took the biggest individual hit at around €500 million. That experience — along with other large events since — has led to higher deductibles across the entire European reinsurance market. Where once firms only had to wait out €100 million in primary losses, today the threshold has jumped to €400 million. Even with that buffer, it wasn’t enough to keep reinsurers from getting hit hard this time. One of the things that softened the blow, though, was the FAIR Plan — a shared fund paid into by multiple insurers operating in California. That plan is designed to absorb the first layer of losses before any individual private insurer starts paying out, and that helped ease the pressure on the bigger players — including the ones based in Europe. But with a fire this big, even that wasn’t enough to stop $3.5 billion from landing on reinsurers across the continent.

That growth has come despite James Seyffart’s speculation that the SEC’s early decisions would be an action that’s out of the norm. Seyffart anticipates that October is when decisions would likely be made. In addition, the ETF community pointed out that such delays were typical in the review process. Following XRP ETF approval odds rising , asset managers, including Bitwise, CoinShares, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale, await what the SEC will do with their applications. XRP ETF approval surges to 83% amid growing institutional investors’ interest The prediction market platform Polymarket shows a strong expectation boost for an XRP spot ETF approval. Following this, Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, spoke about the subject in the latest episode of the company’s podcast, Crypto in One Minute . He called ETFs a way for institutional investors to enter the cryptocurrency market easily. Garlinghouse highlighted that earlier, Wall Street and other institutional investors had struggled to access the crypto markets directly. However, according to him, that has changed as ETFs enable them to access the market through regulated financial products in place of crypto exchanges or self-custody wallets. He also noted the rapid expansion of Bitcoin ETFs. Based on his argument, the Bitcoin ETF was the quickest to reach $1 billion in assets. He stated that it reached $10 billion faster than any other ETF and believes institutional interest will continue to drive additional product launches, including those pegged to XRP. Notably, despite the US SEC having postponed decisions on spot ETFs, the market experienced an important change late last week. Volatility Shares introduced the first-ever XRP futures ETF on the Nasdaq exchange, using the ticker XRPI. This came after the launch of an XRP futures product on CME Group’s platform on May 19. XRP futures now allow investors to trade contracts based on the expected future price of the asset in a regulated setting. While similar products have been available for Bitcoin and Ethereum for a long time, XRP just recently joined the list. Additionally, Tectrium launched its 2x Long Daily XRP ETF, which was leveraged to provide even more choices for those interested in trading XRP-related instruments. These new offerings demonstrate a rising interest in XRP from institutional traders, which is also seen in the increasing chances of XRP ETF approvals. James Seyffart anticipates that Litecoin has a higher likelihood of getting approved first On May 21, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart shared his speculations that the SEC was more likely to approve a Litecoin ETF before any other cryptocurrency funding applications under review. His speculation came after the SEC postponed its decision on Bitwise’s request to include staking in its Ether ETF and Grayscale’s application for an XRP ETF, which analysts had anticipated. Based on the SEC’s explanation for the delay, the commission announced on May 20 that it needed an extra 45 days to decide on Bitwise’s request to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised. The agency had to either make a decision or delay it further by May 22. Furthermore, the SEC postponed its decision on Grayscale’s XRP tracking ETF and Bitwise’s Solana tracking fund while it collected public comments and started proceedings for further analysis of these proposals to ensure they met regulatory requirements. James Seyffart mentioned on X that these delays were expected because the SEC usually takes the full time to respond to a 19b-4 filing. According to Seyffart, almost all of these filings have final due dates in October, and an early decision would be out of the norm. He added, “No matter how Crypto-friendly this SEC is. There’s no conspiracy here.” Seyffart also revealed that delays on other spot crypto ETF bids were expected, and the SEC was likely to delay deciding on Litecoin ETFs, too. However, despite all this, his stand that Litecoin had a higher likelihood of getting approved first compared to others still remains.

Both big investors and regular savers are rushing to stockpile gold as a safe haven for troubled times. Marc Faber, a veteran investor known as “Dr. Doom,” has long made gold a key part of his own holdings and urged others to do the same. Faber often appears in video interviews, praising gold as a safe haven while warning of a possible economic collapse. He warns about a debt crisis, a sharp drop in asset prices, and surging inflation. “My sense is that a debt crisis is inevitable,” he said. According to Business Insider , Faber holds 25% of gold in his portfolio, and his clients follow his example, keeping a significant share of their wealth in the metal. There has been a steady move toward gold among his clients. But the rush to buy the metal has also spread to more ordinary investors. Many blame the economic uncertainty in 2025. Some of the fears voiced by Faber’s clients, from runaway inflation to even a full-scale war, may seem far-fetched. Yet analysts do not expect this wave of buying to fade soon. Global demand for gold bars rose to 257 metric tons in the first quarter of 2025, a 13% gain over the same period last year, according to the World Gold Council . Joe Cavatoni, a market strategist at the World Gold Council, said worries about the US dollar, weakness in the US economy, and the nation’s debt and deficit have helped drive demand higher. Interest in the search term “gold bars” on Google increased during significant market events, such as the announcement of tariffs on Canada and Mexico and Moody’s downgrade of US debt. Genesis Gold Group, a firm that often serves clients it calls “homesteaders” or “preppers,” says it has seen intense demand in recent quarters. Sales grew so fast that the company introduced a “prepper bar,” designed to be broken into smaller pieces for easier trade during a crisis. Jonathan Rose, the firm’s CEO, said sales of that bar jumped 20% in the first quarter of 2025, around the time President Donald Trump began laying out his tariff plans. More of Genesis’s customers are also asking to take their gold home. Rose estimates that about 70% of his clients now insist on holding physical gold, up from just 20% in past years. On the subreddit r/preppers, which has grown its membership by about 354% since 2020, by one count, users frequently ask whether to keep cash in the market or pile into gold. “It helps when a currency collapses,” one user wrote. “Cash is always king, until it collapses, then that’s where gold and silver step in.” Gold buyers to stay cautious until tariff impact on growth is clear The gold price has climbed about 25% in 2025, easily outpacing the S&P 500, which is down roughly 1% year-to-date. That rally has led some to wonder if the buying spree may have gone too far. Recently, Trump agreed to delay tariffs on Europe until 9 July. This pullback reduced some panic, resulting in a Gold dip of 0.3% to $3,346.89 on Monday from a Friday surge of 1.9%. However, experts warn that people are still uneasy about the U.S. fiscal outlook. Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone, noted that President Trump’s recent tax bill reignited worries over the US debt and deficit. But he said those fears may ease if lawmakers make changes to the bill to reassure bond investors. Moreover, Goldman Sachs cut its odds of a downturn this year from 45% to 35%, and Barclays dropped its mild-recession forecast altogether. Meanwhile, Michael Boutros, senior technical strategist at StoneX, said there is plenty of fearmongering in markets right now, though he expects gold demand to stay strong as long as people feel uneasy about the economy. Even after trade disputes get settled, Boutros believes gold buyers will remain cautious until they see how tariffs affect growth. “The rockier things get, the more this is going to find footing,” he said of gold’s momentum. Joe Cavatoni of the World Gold Council added that he sees solid price support and a continued upward path for gold through 2025.

Currently trading around $0.000015, analysts suggest SHIB could be gearing up for a short-term move toward $0.000020 if bullish momentum holds. However, the spotlight is gradually shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new viral cryptocurrency gaining massive attention. The project is in phase 5 of its presale priced at $0.03. Mutuum Finance’s presale surges past $9.2 million with over 11,500 investors already onboard. As Mutuum Finance enters Phase 6, the price will jump 16.67% to $0.035. With a jaw-dropping 12,380% price prediction circulating among bullish analysts and a low entry price of just $0.03, Mutuum Finance is being hailed as one of the best new altcoins to buy now for outsized returns in 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Eyes $0.00002 as Bullish Momentum Builds Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.000015, up a small 0.04% from the past 24 hours. The token has shown resilience, remaining above levels of support, and analysts are observing signs of a potential reversal to the bear. Technical indicators suggest that SHIB can maintain its current momentum and smash through the resistance line of $0.00001613, where it could potentially be headed to $0.00002 in the near term. This optimism is further buoyed by recent developments within the Shiba Inu universe, including token burns and work on its layer-2 solution, Shibarium, designed to enhance utility and reduce supply. While SHIB continues to draw investors, potential projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also drawing investors’ eyes for their potential in the new cryptocurrency universe. Transforming DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. This two-pronged approach maximizes security, efficiency, and decentralization and positions Mutuum Finance at the forefront of the DeFi universe. By giving users full control over their lending decisions, the platform is appealing to conservative and high-yield investors, and facilitates a more open and flexible financial system. A DeFi Disruptor Drawing Massive Investor Interest Mutuum Finance is rapidly generating buzz in the DeFi community with its game-changing lending solutions. Despite being in presale, it has already surpassed more than $9.2 million in funding and has amassed nearly 11,500 investors, making it a solid altcoin ready to experience a major breakthrough. With Phase 5 price at $0.03 and with an impending 16.67% price boost in the next phase, early investors stand to gain good returns in terms of bagging their highest returns. At launch, with an anticipated price of $0.06, profits will be 100%, and for the next bull cycle, projections see the leap over $2. Exclusive Rewards and Community Incentives Early adopters of Mutuum Finance all have enticing incentives, including a $100,000 giveaway in which 10 people will win $10,000 value of MUTM tokens. There is also a referral program that encourages community development as it rewards clients for recruiting new investors. Early backers also receive VIP access to platform updates. All these incentives not only drive early usage but also ensure long-term hold among token holders. Mutuum Finance raised over $9.2 million with nearly 11,500 investors in the presale, reflecting high demand. In Phase 5, which costs $0.03, the price will rise 16.67% to $0.035 in Phase 6, providing early investors a possible 100% return on investment. Mutuum Finance, with referrals and referral rewards, is one-of-a-kind in DeFi. Don’t miss this opportunity and invest before the next phase.

This surge in whale activity, combined with Bitcoin’s price stability and rising institutional inflows, signals renewed confidence in the broader crypto market. However, while Bitcoin and Ethereum remain foundational assets, the most aggressive capital is now rotating into early-stage, high-risk opportunities—none more prominent than MAGACOIN FINANCE. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Accumulation and 35x–40x Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the top high-risk allocation among crypto whales and early-stage investors. The project has raised over $8 million, with Stage 8 nearly full and a capped 100 billion token supply audited by HashEx. Notably, a single whale recently made a decisive 72.95 ETH purchase—valued at over $133,000—marking the largest early-stage buy of 2025 and signaling institutional-grade confidence in MAGA’s upside. Analysts are projecting 35x–40x returns from current entry levels, with some models suggesting even greater upside if momentum continues. The combination of scarcity-driven tokenomics, rapid presale sellouts, and strategic whale positioning is setting MAGACOIN FINANCE apart as the breakout high-risk play for Q3 and Q4 2025. Bitcoin (BTC): Stability and Institutional Support Bitcoin is consolidating around $110,000, supported by robust institutional inflows and ETF demand. While BTC remains the market’s anchor, its upside from current levels is seen as more measured, prompting many investors to rotate capital into higher-growth early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Ethereum (ETH): Steady Growth and Rotating Capital Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, supported by ongoing upgrades and robust institutional adoption. While ETH remains a core holding for most portfolios, the most aggressive capital is now flowing into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is far more compelling. TRUMP Coin: Volatility and Speculation TRUMP coin remains a speculative favorite, with forecasts for 2025 ranging widely from $35 to $300 depending on regulatory headlines and market sentiment. While the coin has benefited from political branding and periodic surges, its long-term value is more volatile than the structured, scarcity-driven approach of MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST Conclusion Bitcoin whales are quietly positioning for the next phase of the market, but it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that is capturing the most aggressive capital flows. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 40x ROI, MAGA stands as the top high-risk, high-reward opportunity for 2025.

33767162,[object Object],1748223003,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"2,000MW Of Pakistan’s Extra Electricity Now Reserved For Bitcoin Rigs",https://bitcoinist.com/pakistan-turns-up-the-heat-on-bitcoin-mining-with-2000mw-power-allocation/,"Pakistan’s government has moved to put its excess electricity to work in a surprising way. It has set aside 2,000 megawatts of surplus power for Bitcoin mining and artificial-intelligence centers. This decision aims to turn an energy glut into an economic boost. It comes as part of a wider plan backed by the Finance Ministry and pushed by the Pakistan Crypto Council. Surplus Power Allocation According to local reports , Pakistan’s grid often produces more power than it needs. Now, that extra juice will be sent to data halls and mining rigs. The first phase kicks off immediately. It will feed AI centers and crypto farms. Officials say this move could draw in billions in foreign cash. It should also open up tech jobs in cities and towns across the country. Pakistan’s Finance Ministry announced it will allocate 2,000 megawatts of surplus power to support Bitcoin mining and AI center development as part of its national digital transformation strategy. The government has introduced tax incentives to attract foreign firms, with several… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 25, 2025 Tax Breaks And Investment Based on reports, the Finance Ministry has rolled out special tax breaks for AI sites. Bitcoin miners will also get duty exemptions on their gear. Already, foreign delegations have been touring Pakistan to see the setup. They’re checking out potential deals for hardware, software, and data-center space. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb told reporters that clear rules and perks will make Pakistan a top spot for tech investors. Creating An Oversight Authority The government is also setting up a Pakistan Digital Assets Authority . This new body will license and regulate exchanges, wallets, and token platforms. It will keep an eye on stablecoins, DeFi apps, and other blockchain services. The digital assets body is even planning to “tokenize” national assets and public debt. In future, it could manage how surplus electricity is used for mining in a way that’s logged and audited. Environmental Balance Phase two of the plan brings a green twist. Officials promise to tap renewable sources, like solar and wind, for mining sites. That should help limit carbon emissions and ease public concerns. Pakistan already faces air-quality issues in major cities. By steering mining operations toward renewables, the government hopes to cut fuel use at thermal plants and balance power needs. In global rankings, Pakistan came in ninth on Chainalysis’s 2024 crypto adoption index. Based on Statista data, the country is on track to have over 27 million crypto users by 2025. That’s more than 10% of its 247 million people. These figures underline a fast-growing market of retail traders and institutional players alike. Critics caution that high mining loads would overburden local grids unless properly managed. They also refer to price fluctuations of Bitcoin, which might transform a profitable scheme into a monetary bet.

45101063,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=734747,1748223297,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45101063.jpeg,Google’s AI Search could erode Reddit traffic,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/googles-ai-search-could-erode-reddit-traffic/,"Google is reshaping how users find answers online, and that’s spelling trouble for Reddit. The tech giant introduced a significant update to its search engine at the Google I/O 2025 conference. The new feature , AI Mode, changes the standard Google Search bar to resemble an AI chatbot. These features provide users with direct, AI-generated answers to queries, often summarizing content from various sources, including Reddit, without requiring users to visit the original sites. AI Mode offers human answers instead of the standard list of links. It’s driven by a customized version of Google’s Gemini 2 generative AI model. The tool can answer tricky questions, search many sources at once, and give the results in a reader-friendly way. AI Mode was first launched to U.S.-based Google One AI Premium users in early 2025. Google has announced that it will be officially available to every user in the U.S. over the next few weeks. A worldwide launch is planned for later this year. “AI Mode is where we will first bring our frontier capabilities into search,” CEO Sundar Pichai said. He referred to it as a “complete overhaul” of the search experience. The change is part of a broader effort by Google to remain competitive in the battle over AI-powered search. Competitors like Microsoft, with Bing AI, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT have already incorporated similar features. Google’s answer is audacious — and possibly fraught with risk. AI Mode puts Reddit’s search traffic at risk One platform with the potential to be heavily affected is Reddit. Traditional Google Search has been very good for Reddit. You can use any search engine you want, but many of us end up on Reddit when looking for human answers to real-world problems , regardless of whether we are logged in. Google has even prioritized Reddit links in the search rankings in recent years, understanding that users can often put more trust in a forum than a cookie-cutter website. But with AI Mode, Google could start answering user questions directly from data scraped off sites like Reddit—without ever driving a click to them. So fewer people will potentially click through to Reddit properly. This is no small concern. The recent growth on Reddit has been powered largely by logged-out users—people who browse Reddit casually and find the site via search. These users are not the loyal base of Reddit, but they do have numbers. If AI Mode starts feeding Reddit-style responses without pointing to the site, that could be the quickest path to drying up a big source of visitors. That fear is already being reflected in the market. In February, Reddit’s stock tumbled more than 15% after the company announced its traffic had been “choppy” since Google’s search algorithm changed. Reddit’s chief executive, Steve Huffman, has said Google’s updates have meant that Reddit is unsure what traffic it can count on going forward. Reddit strengthens its community to offset AI traffic loss While search traffic is nice to have, the company’s strength is its logged-in user base. These regular users visit Reddit directly and participate in community discussions. These users stay longer, engage with more meaningful content, and bolster ad revenue. However, Reddit is also developing its own AI tools . In March 2025, it introduced Reddit Answers, an AI system that surfaces useful summaries from Reddit threads. Now, the platform is putting Reddit Answers front and center by adding it to its main search bar to help people find authentic, community-driven content more easily. This is a play partly in defense and partly in offense. It tries to lock users onto the platform using AI tools from Google and others. Reddit’s CEO, Steve Huffman, expressed confidence in the long-term value of human voices despite the rise of AI in search. He acknowledged that large language models (LLMs) change how people search online.

On the daily chart, XRP recently dropped below an important resistance level at $2.34. Right now, it’s finding some support around $2.30, but it keeps struggling to climb back above $2.34, which has turned into a new resistance point. If the price can break and stay above this level, the next targets would be around $2.44, and then a stronger resistance between $2.55 and $2.62. For now, the market is still within a bullish trend, meaning it’s making higher lows and higher highs — but a proper bounce is needed soon to keep that uptrend going. There’s also a chance that XRP is forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern on the daily chart. If this pattern completes and the price breaks above $2.62, it could push XRP to new highs, possibly even beyond $3. However, this pattern is not confirmed yet — it still needs to form the right side of the pattern and break above key resistance levels. Short-Term Market Movement The price has been stuck between $2.15 and $2.31 with no strong move either way. A small five-wave drop was seen from Friday’s high, but it hasn’t led to a bigger price drop. As long as the market stays below $2.43–$2.44, there’s still some downward pressure. If XRP drops further, key support levels to watch are around $2.15 and $1.95. However, this pullback looks more like a healthy correction rather than the start of a major downtrend. What’s the Bigger Picture? Even with this short-term weakness, the overall market structure still supports a bullish outlook. There was a clear five-wave move up from the April low to May 12, and now the market seems to be going through a normal pullback phase. As long as XRP stays above the important support at $1.79, the long-term bullish trend remains safe.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-26 01:46:18
45101542,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=734754,1748224503,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45101542.jpeg,Elon Musk’s X isn’t ready for super app status,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/musks-x-isnt-ready-for-super-app-status/,"On May 21, 2025, millions of X users worldwide suffered an outage for hours, the latest in a string of disruptions that have plagued the company lately. Users couldn’t log in, access timelines, or send messages, hardly the hallmarks of a platform aspiring to become a “super app.” Elon Musk’s vision for X is clear: a single, integrated platform that merges social media, payments, messaging, AI services, and commerce. But so far, the execution hasn’t matched that goal. For all of X’s ambitions, the platform struggles to maintain basic functionality, let alone support a layered suite of financial and transactional services. For some observers, this discrepancy highlights a bigger issue. Is Musk trying to do too much to be able to manage such a formidable transformation? Building a super app requires discipline, not chaos The super app model, epitomized by WeChat in China, is nuanced. In addition to an incumbent backend that can handle enormous, interlocking functions, it demands strict regulatory alignment, cultural assimilation, and relentless focus. WeChat did not evolve through improvisation; it matured under coordinated leadership, with deep cooperation from regulators and a coherent product roadmap. X, by contrast, appears to have adopted an approach defined more by urgency than discipline. In the last year alone, Musk has announced initiatives ranging from encrypted messaging and peer-to-peer payments to AI-generated news and dating features. Yet these product ambitions have coincided with frequent platform outages and a marked decline in service reliability. Super apps do not succeed by layering complexity onto unstable systems. They thrive on trust—technical, operational, and institutional. And trust is difficult to maintain when the platform itself appears brittle. Stretching leadership across six companies risks systemic failure Musk’s portfolio is without precedent in modern corporate history. He is CEO of Tesla, SpaceX , Neuralink, xAI, The Boring Company, and X. Each of these demands persistent execution, high-stakes decision-making, and deep technological engagement. Tesla alone is navigating autonomous driving challenges, supply chain pressures, and cutthroat competition in the EV market . SpaceX is scaling Starship and managing a constellation of Starlink satellites. Neuralink recently entered human trials. Under such conditions, even the most capable leader risks diffusion. The physical demands of running one high-growth, technologically complex company are immense. Running six is a structural risk. Tesla shareholders have raised issues about this very dynamic. In early 2024, investor letters questioned Musk’s focus, particularly as political rhetoric and regulatory conflicts on X drew attention away from Tesla’s core innovation agenda. SpaceX insiders have reportedly expressed similar unease over reputational spillover from X. Nowhere is the strain more visible than at X itself. The May outage, reportedly caused by delayed server patching and misconfigured fallback systems, reflects technical debt and a lack of sustained executive oversight. Such failures are less likely in environments where leadership focuses on operational resilience. Slashing staff without a clear strategy has weakened X’s core operations Compounding the problem is X’s dramatic downsizing. Since Musk’s acquisition, the company has shed more than 80% of its workforce, including infrastructure specialists, product leads, and compliance personnel. Many of these were responsible for platform reliability, trust and safety, and regulatory alignment. Layoffs of this magnitude might have been manageable under a strategically phased reorganization. Instead, X has lurched from crisis to crisis. Product rollouts have lacked cohesion. Infrastructure appears brittle. Regulatory uncertainty is another concern, particularly as the company explores payments and financial services in tightly regulated jurisdictions. To dismiss Musk outright would be premature. His track record—disrupting the auto industry, commercializing spaceflight, and vertically integrating battery supply chains—is extraordinary. The same goes for his work ethic and eye for spotting top-tier talent. Some of Musk’s supporters argue that his model of leadership—visionary, high-leverage, selectively engaged—is sufficient if paired with strong deputies. That argument has merit. If X’s operations were led by a dedicated CEO accountable for execution and platform integrity, Musk’s focus could be confined to product vision and business alliances. There are also potential synergies across Musk’s companies. Starlink could enhance X’s market reach, xAI accelerates AI integration for content moderation or personalization, and Tesla’s payment expertise could support its financial infrastructure. Yet none of these synergies remove the need for consistent, hands-on leadership within X. The core challenge is not merely technological—it is managerial. Pursuing a super app vision requires more than Musk’s ambition Even with perfect leadership, X faces formidable barriers to super app status in the West. The regulatory environment in the U.S. and Europe is more fragmented and stringent than in China. Data privacy laws, antitrust scrutiny, and payment licensing regimes impose real constraints. Moreover, X faces entrenched competitors: Apple for payments, WhatsApp for messaging, and Amazon for commerce. In this context, building a Western WeChat is not just difficult; it may be structurally unviable. The ambition may be sound. The execution model, however, must evolve. X need not abandon its super app ambitions but must rethink how it pursues them. A platform that seeks to become the central hub for communication, finance, and commerce requires unbroken focus, deep operational expertise, and robust governance. Musk has proven himself an exceptional founder and visionary. However, the role of platform steward, particularly at this stage of X’s evolution, may require different leadership. Appointing a CEO with a mandate for stability, compliance, and execution could restore confidence and increase the odds of success. And in the end, no matter how compelling the vision is, it cannot replace presence. Super apps require more than innovation; they require constancy, precision, and trust. Without X closing the gap between ambition and leadership bandwidth, its super app hopes might not be more than a dream.

ADA has held strong above $0.68 and is now targeting $0.80, with bullish traders eyeing a breakout if momentum continues. Yet, while Cardano’s technical setup is promising, the real excitement is building around early-stage opportunities that promise far greater returns. Bitcoin’s recent rally above $112,000 has reignited institutional interest, with analysts now projecting possible targets of $131,000, $163,000, or even $200,000 if the current uptrend persists. Ethereum continues to trade above $2,500, supported by robust inflows and ongoing upgrades, but its near-term upside is seen as steady rather than explosive. In this context, the spotlight is shifting to high-upside altcoins where the risk/reward profile is more compelling. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Surge and 13,000% Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly distinguishing itself as the breakout presale of 2025 . With over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full, demand from both retail and institutional investors is surging. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling this momentum. Analysts are forecasting returns as high as 13,000%, with some models suggesting even greater upside if current trends continue. Early backers can still secure a 50% token bonus using the PATRIOT50X code before the $0.007 listing, making this one of the most attractive entry points in the market. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s unique blend of scarcity-driven tokenomics, strategic rollout, and community buzz is keeping it at the top of investor watchlists. As the presale window narrows, smart money is positioning early, recognizing MAGA as a leading altcoin contender for the coming cycle. Bitcoin (BTC): Macro Strength and Institutional Flows Bitcoin’s climb above $112,000 signals renewed confidence from institutional investors. Price targets now range from $130,000 to $200,000 if momentum continues. While BTC remains a foundational holding, its ROI potential is increasingly being matched—and even outpaced—by early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Hedera (HBAR): Steady Progress, MAGA Outpaces Hedera is trading near $0.25, with forecasts for 2025 suggesting a range of $0.24–$0.27. HBAR’s enterprise partnerships and technical upgrades are impressive, but its growth is more gradual compared to the rapid ascent of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Ethereum (ETH): Reliable Growth, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Ethereum holds above $2,500, benefiting from institutional adoption and ongoing ecosystem development. While ETH remains a core asset, analysts agree that the most dramatic growth potential now lies in early-stage plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion As Cardano tests major resistance, the most compelling growth story is unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 13,000% ROI, MAGA is the breakout opportunity to watch for 2025.

Why Qubetics ($TICS) Stands Out as the Best Crypto Presale to Join in 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/missing-the-xrp-boom-why-qubetics-tics-stands-out-as-the-best-crypto-presale-to-join-in-2025/,"The cryptocurrency market has experienced another wave of volatility, prompting a surge in demand for the best crypto presale to join in 2025. Recent regulatory developments and shifting sentiment have reshaped the digital asset landscape, creating both challenges and high-value openings. XRP’s dramatic price rally earlier this year now stands as a cautionary tale for latecomers. In this environment, identifying the best crypto presale to join has never been more critical—especially as platforms like Qubetics continue gaining momentum through real-world utility, robust tokenomics, and growing institutional interest. Among emerging projects, Qubetics ($TICS) has quickly risen to prominence as the best crypto presale to join, offering innovative blockchain solutions that address persistent challenges faced by predecessors like XRP. The token’s current presale price remains accessible, making Qubetics a compelling option for participation during this pivotal period. Understanding why Qubetics is regarded as the best crypto presale to join requires examining both its technological strengths and market positioning. XRP: A Historic Surge That Many Could Not Capitalize On XRP’s journey through 2023 and into 2024 has been nothing short of remarkable, highlighted by a spectacular price rally driven largely by renewed optimism over its ongoing legal battles and adoption prospects. At its peak, XRP captured significant market capitalization and early buyers attention, spurred by partnerships with global payment processors and financial institutions aiming to harness its fast settlement capabilities. Despite these highs, XRP’s earlier challenges, including regulatory scrutiny and competition from emerging blockchain solutions, slowed its momentum. The price rally created a significant barrier for latecomers, turning what could have been an accessible entry point into a missed opportunity for many. With XRP’s token value now stabilizing at levels well above its prior lows, entry costs have escalated, reducing the appeal for new acquisitions. Price predictions for XRP remain cautiously optimistic, with some analysts forecasting moderate gains driven by expanding use cases in cross-border payments and remittances. However, the once-low entry price has long since passed, leaving many to consider alternative cryptocurrencies with greater growth potential in the presale phase. Qubetics ($TICS): The Best Crypto Presale to Join with Real-World Solutions Qubetics has swiftly gained recognition as the best crypto presale to join in 2025, propelled by its cutting-edge blockchain ecosystem designed to address real-world challenges that predecessors like XRP struggled with. Entering its 36th crypto presale stage, Qubetics has already sold over 513 million tokens to more than 26,900 holders, raising $17.3 million—an indicator of significant market confidence. The $TICS token is priced at $0.3064 during this stage, making participation accessible while promising substantial upside based on analyst projections. After the crypto presale, the token is expected to reach $1, offering a 226% return on investment, with further predictions placing $TICS at $5 and $15 following the mainnet launch, equating to 1531% and 4794% ROI respectively. Qubetics’ strength lies in its robust interoperability and decentralized infrastructure, which aims to unify disparate blockchain networks and streamline cross-border transactions. This is a critical innovation, given the fragmentation observed in earlier crypto ecosystems. By enabling seamless interaction between various chains and assets, Qubetics positions itself as an enabler of global financial inclusion. Qubetics’ Application and Interoperability: Bridging Businesses and Individuals Qubetics’ approach to blockchain technology extends beyond simple transactional use. Its interoperability solutions offer tangible benefits across multiple sectors, directly addressing the inefficiencies that hindered earlier cryptocurrencies from widespread adoption. Businesses, especially those operating internationally, stand to gain from Qubetics’ cross-border transaction capabilities. For instance, an export-import company can leverage the Qubetics network to transfer funds instantly without the need for traditional intermediaries, reducing costs and settlement times drastically. This improvement accelerates trade cycles and increases liquidity flow in emerging markets. For professionals such as freelancers and remote workers, Qubetics offers a secure, transparent payment system that eliminates delays common with conventional banking systems. Receiving payments across borders becomes streamlined, ensuring prompt access to earnings and minimizing exchange rate risks. Individual users also benefit from enhanced privacy and security features, coupled with easy-to-use wallets that support multiple cryptocurrencies through a single interface. This democratizes access to digital assets, fostering broader participation in the crypto economy. This comprehensive utility is underpinned by the ongoing presale, where $TICS tokens remain attractively priced at $0.3064. The presale not only supports network expansion but also allows early adopters to secure positions ahead of anticipated price appreciation. Why Missing XRP’s Peak Amplifies the Urgency to Join Qubetics’ Presale The rapid ascent of XRP exemplifies the volatility and opportunity inherent in cryptocurrency markets. Those who missed acquiring XRP at lower prices now face significantly higher entry barriers. This context elevates the appeal of presales like Qubetics, which offer early access at accessible prices. Joining Qubetics’ presale means participation in a project that not only promises innovative technology but also addresses key shortcomings of prior platforms. The current token price combined with bullish analyst forecasts makes it arguably the best crypto presale to join in 2025. As the crypto ecosystem matures, the emphasis shifts towards projects that provide interoperability, real-world utility, and sustainable scalability. Qubetics aligns perfectly with these criteria, promising a viable path forward beyond speculative gains. Analyst Perspectives: Strong ROI Predictions Underpin Qubetics’ Potential Market analysts have underscored the promising trajectory of $TICS tokens, citing both the technology and community backing as drivers of expected price growth. The projected rise to $1 post-presale offers a near-term ROI exceeding 200%, while the potential surge to $15 post-mainnet indicates extraordinary long-term upside. These projections reflect confidence in Qubetics’ ability to deliver scalable solutions and to capitalize on growing demand for interoperable blockchain platforms. The token’s presale success further validates market appetite, setting it apart as the best crypto presale to join amid increasing competition. Such predictions should be considered with due diligence, but the combination of presale accessibility, rising adoption, and innovative features firmly situates Qubetics as a noteworthy candidate in the evolving crypto landscape. Conclusion: Timing Is Critical—Qubetics Emerges as the Best Crypto Presale to Join Based on thorough analysis, Qubetics represents the best crypto presale to join in 2025, especially for those seeking early exposure to blockchain interoperability and real-world applications. The missed window presented by XRP’s peak heightens the urgency for timely participation in presales like Qubetics. With $TICS tokens priced affordably during the 36th presale stage, combined with strong analyst forecasts, this project clearly stands out as the best crypto presale to join at present. Qubetics’ integration of advanced technology and practical business use cases positions it to redefine crypto adoption, solidifying its status as the best crypto presale to join before the mainnet launch. Taking advantage of this opportunity may prove decisive in capturing substantial future value within a rapidly maturing market.

He also blamed Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, for worsening the war with his public statements, and said Joe Biden’s actions fueled the disaster. “This is a war that would never have started if I were president,” Trump said. “This is Zelenskyy’s, Putin’s, and Biden’s war, not Trump’s.” According to a report from RuNews24.ru, Putin responded to Trump’s recent call for a 30-day ceasefire by launching 250 drones and 14 ballistic missiles into Kyiv and other cities on Friday night. Ukrainian officials reportedly said their forces intercepted nearly 100 drones near Moscow. Putin hides war budget as secret spending surges The Kremlin has buried nearly a third of its federal spending behind classified labels. Russia’s budget law from December mentions the word “secret” 39 times, as reported by RuNews24.ru. Yakov Yakubovich, from Russia’s National Research Nuclear University, said the classified chunk of the budget is 12.12 trillion rubles, or around $152 billion, making up 29.22% of total spending. Last year, that number was 11.1 trillion rubles or $121.19 billion, according to data published by Bloomberg. Yakubovich explained the funds are most likely being used for war-related infrastructure and operations in newly seized territories. He added that publishing this information could lead to more sanctions, which is why it’s being kept out of public view. The surge in secret spending comes as Europe struggles to meet Ukraine’s growing demand for military supplies. Zelenskyy confirmed that domestic weapons production is improving, but shortages of both manpower and equipment remain. Zelenskyy, in a statement Friday, said, “With every such strike, the world sees more clearly that it is Moscow that’s prolonging this war.” He called for tougher sanctions on Russia’s economy, warning that only more pressure would bring Putin to negotiate seriously. Washington debates pressure while Trump pushes diplomacy Marco Rubio, Trump’s Secretary of State, defended the administration’s approach in Senate testimony Tuesday. He said Ukraine is still receiving arms from the US and allies, even though the administration hasn’t requested new funding or tapped into fresh stockpiles. Rubio also said the European Union is finalizing additional sanctions while the US looks to obtain more Patriot missile systems from NATO allies. When asked if Trump is being manipulated by Putin, Rubio said that wasn’t true and insisted all sanctions from the Biden era remain active. He explained that Trump wants to avoid threatening new sanctions immediately, hoping to keep Russia engaged in talks. But those talks are falling apart fast. Putin didn’t show up personally for the recent negotiation session in Istanbul. Instead, a low-level delegation was sent to meet with Rubio, who was dispatched by Trump. In Washington, Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal introduced a new bill co-signed by 81 senators, warning that if Russia refuses to negotiate in good faith, the US will respond with direct sanctions. Graham said the Senate is prepared to slap a 500% tariff on any country, including China, that keeps buying Russian gas, oil, or uranium. He said Putin has only days to submit ceasefire terms. “If it is more of the same,” Graham said, “Russia can expect decisive action from the United States Senate.” Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s Foreign Minister, said Moscow’s terms will depend on the “root causes” of the war. He said Ukraine needs a new government, one that’s “legitimate,” before a real peace deal can happen. Russia still insists that Ukraine is part of its territory and calls Zelenskyy’s government corrupt and Nazi-run. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

This surge in whale activity, combined with Bitcoin’s price stability around $68,000 and rising institutional inflows, signals renewed confidence in the broader crypto market. However, while Bitcoin and Ethereum remain foundational assets, the most aggressive capital is now rotating into early-stage, high-risk opportunities—none more prominent than MAGACOIN FINANCE. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Accumulation and 35x–40x Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the top high-risk allocation among crypto whales and early-stage investors. The project has raised over $8 million, with Stage 8 nearly full and a capped 100 billion token supply audited by HashEx. Notably, a single whale recently made a decisive 72.95 ETH purchase—valued at over $133,000—marking the largest early-stage buy of 2025 and signaling institutional-grade confidence in MAGA’s upside. Analysts are projecting 35x–40x returns from current entry levels, with some models suggesting even greater upside if momentum continues. The combination of scarcity-driven tokenomics, rapid presale sellouts, and strategic whale positioning is setting MAGACOIN FINANCE apart as the breakout high-risk play for Q3 and Q4 2025. Ethereum (ETH): Stability and Rotating Capital Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, supported by ongoing upgrades and robust institutional adoption. While ETH remains a core holding for most portfolios, the most aggressive capital is now flowing into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is far more compelling. TRUMP Coin: Volatility and Speculation TRUMP coin remains a speculative favorite, with forecasts for 2025 ranging widely from $35 to $300 depending on regulatory headlines and market sentiment. While the coin has benefited from political branding and periodic surges, its long-term value is more volatile than the structured, scarcity-driven approach of MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Bitcoin whales are quietly positioning for the next phase of the market, but it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that is capturing the most aggressive capital flows. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 40x ROI, MAGA stands as the top high-risk, high-reward opportunity for 2025.

After failing to hold a rally toward its old high of $3, the price once again dropped sharply. The coin recently hit $1.67 before falling back to around $0.77 at the time of writing. When Pi Coin was first listed, it started at $3 but quickly dropped to $0.60 on the same day. It managed to bounce back to $3 within 34 days, but this rise created strong selling pressure as early investors rushed to cash out. Many saw $3 as a good exit point, especially after the coin had previously fallen more than 80%.’ In terms of important price levels, Pi Coin is currently facing immediate resistance at $0.94, $1.20, and $1.66. If the price manages to break above these levels, the final bullish target in the short term remains at $3.00. On the downside, the critical support to watch is $0.65 — if the price falls below this level, it could lead to even steeper declines ahead. Upcoming Token Unlocks May Add More Pressure Adding to the concerns, a large number of Pi tokens are scheduled to unlock in the coming days, which could increase selling pressure: May 26: 10 million Pi will unlock May 27: 12 million Pi will unlock May 28: 15 million Pi will unlock — the biggest unlock in the next 30 days These large unlocks could add extra pressure on the price, as newly available tokens might be sold on the market. Positive Developments in the Pi Ecosystem Despite the price struggles, the Pi Network ecosystem is growing fast. According to analyst Kim Wong, there are now over 100 Pi-based decentralized apps (DApps), with some already live on the Mainnet, some being tested, and others still in development. Adding to the excitement, the recent launch of a $100 million Venture Fund is expected to help the growth of the Pi ecosystem even further. As more apps go live and adoption increases worldwide, Pi’s long-term potential continues to look bright. The network now boasts over 70 million users globally, including 20 million KYC-verified users and 4.3 million X (Twitter) followers. Pi Coin is also listed on several exchanges and ranks #26 by market cap among all cryptocurrencies.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-26 02:22:04

Coinbase investor Brady Nessler said in a May 22 lawsuit filed in a Pennsylvania federal court that the data breach and the alleged broken agreement with the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority resulted in a “precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s common shares,” causing stockholders to suffer “significant losses and damages.” Coinbase said on May 15 that its damages bill could run up to $400 million after it was hit with a $20 million extortion attempt four days earlier , with several of its customer support agents bribed to access internal systems and steal a limited amount of user account data. Nessler claimed Coinbase (COIN) shares dropped by 7.2% to close at $244 on May 15 as a result of the disclosure. However, the stock did stage a comeback, spiking 9% and hitting $266 by the closing bell on May 16, according to Google Finance. Coinbase stock closed down over 3% on May 23 at $263, falling another $1.62 after the bell. COIN is up nearly 6% so far this year. Coinbase is down from the May 23 trading session. Source: Google Finance Nessler’s complaint is seemingly the first to argue damages caused by Coinbase’s stock drop following its breach disclosure in a series of recent class-action lawsuits over the incident. The crypto exchange was hit with at least six lawsuits in the days after disclosing the data breach, all accusing it of mishandling the incident and failing to protect their data. UK agreement breach hurt stock, suit says The FCA fined Coinbase’s UK arm $4.5 million in July 2024 for breaching a 2020 voluntary agreement preventing the exchange from onboarding customers considered high risk by the regulator. The FCA said Coinbase onboarded 13,416 customers that the regulator considered high-risk and offered them crypto services . Related: Coinbase presses to axe rule banning SEC staff from holding crypto Nessler said in the suit that the fine saw Coinbase’s stock fall by over 5%, closing at $231.52 on July 25, 2024. Nessler also claimed that Coinbase didn’t disclose it had breached this agreement when the exchange first listed its shares on the Nasdaq in April 2021 , and as a result, “the market price of the Company’s securities had been artificially,” inflated. Nessler claims had she known about the agreement violation, she would not have purchased the stock at the “artificially inflated prices.” Coinbase did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The class suit was filed on behalf of anyone who bought Coinbase stock between April 14, 2021, and May 14, 2025, and is asking for damages and a jury trial. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and chief financial officer Alesia Haas are also named as defendants. Another lawsuit filed in Illinois on May 13, alleges Coinbase failed to notify users in writing of the collection , storage, or sharing of their biometric data and the purpose and retention schedule for their data.

This strategic collaboration brings together RYO Digital’s next-generation digital payment ecosystem and GRNX Global’s GrainX Protocol grain tokenization platform, creating unparalleled efficiency, transparency, and accessibility in global commodity trading.

With Injective (INJ) steady and XRP whales accumulating, both institutional and retail investors are zeroing in on MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Bitcoin as the top contenders to watch for Q3 2025’s breakout. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Moves, 50% Bonus, and Early-Stage Surge MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming 2025’s most-watched presale, with over $8 million raised and a record-setting 72.95 ETH whale buy marking the largest early-stage purchase of the year. The project’s capped supply, HashEx audit, and scarcity-driven tokenomics are driving unprecedented demand. Early buyers can still use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% bonus, making MAGA even more attractive for those seeking exponential upside. Analysts are projecting 25x–35x returns, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% if momentum continues. As Stage 8 nears completion, smart money is positioning ahead of listings, recognizing MAGACOIN FINANCE as a rare ground-floor opportunity before price discovery goes public. Bitcoin (BTC): Bullish Structure and Institutional Support Bitcoin is trading in the $110,000–$115,000 range, with technicals showing strong bullish momentum and support at $110K. The breakout above April’s highs has ended a long consolidation, and BTC is now in price discovery mode. Institutional inflows remain robust, and as long as BTC holds above $110K, analysts expect a push toward $112K–$115K in the coming sessions. This steady foundation is prompting investors to rotate some capital into higher-upside plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Whale Accumulation and Bullish Sentiment XRP is consolidating near $2.42, with recent whale transactions totaling over $300 million signaling confidence in the token’s future. The number of large XRP wallets has surged, reflecting growing influence from major investors. Analysts forecast a move toward $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks, with some bullish scenarios targeting $5.50 by year-end if momentum persists. As XRP holders seek sharper upside, many are reallocating to early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL) and Injective (INJ): Steady, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Solana is trading between $158 and $175, consolidating after a recent high near $183, with technicals suggesting a potential breakout if resistance is cleared. Injective is trading near $13, with price forecasts between $16 and $18 for 2025. However, both are being outpaced in sentiment and capital flows by the explosive momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion With Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana providing stability, the most dramatic growth potential is now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE. As Stage 8 nears completion and the 50% PATRIOT50X bonus remains, this may be the last low-entry window before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. For those seeking the next breakout, MAGA is the name to watch for Q3 2025.
