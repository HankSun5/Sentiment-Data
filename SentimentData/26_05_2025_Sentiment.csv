Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor signals impending Bitcoin purchase Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor hinted at an impending Bitcoin purchase by posting the Bitcoin ( BTC ) chart the executive typically posts on Sundays to signal that the company will acquire more Bitcoin the following day when traditional financial markets open. ""I only buy Bitcoin with money I can't afford to lose,"" Saylor wrote to his 4.3 million followers in an X post . Strategy’s Bitcoin purchases. Source: SaylorTracker According to data from SaylorTracker , the company holds a total of 576,230 BTC, valued at over $62.5 billion, and is up over 55.5% on its investment, representing unrealized gains of over $22 billion at the time of this writing. The company continues to be closely watched by investors as a proxy for Bitcoin and a barometer for institutional adoption of the scarce digital asset. Pakistan allocates 2,000MW power for Bitcoin mining and AI centers Pakistan has allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity exclusively for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence centers. The move is part of a broader digital transformation plan spearheaded by the Pakistan Crypto Council and backed by the Ministry of Finance, according to a May 25 report by local news outlet 24NewsHD TV Channel. In the first phase, the government plans to channel excess power into AI infrastructure and crypto mining operations. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the decision is expected to attract billions in foreign investment while generating high-tech employment across the country. The initiative’s second phase will introduce access to renewable energy for mining operations, aiming to balance growth with environmental responsibility. Crypto ETFs won’t lose ‘their luster’ as wallet adoption grows — Cathie Wood ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood says crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will likely maintain their place in the economy no matter how big crypto wallet adoption becomes over the next decade. “I think ETFs are an important stepping stone because, you know, wallets seem so complicated, so much friction for consumers, they just wanna push a button,” Wood said at the Solana Accelerate event in New York on May 23. “So ETFs for those who want the convenience, I don’t think, will lose a lot of their luster,” she said. “But they will be a stepping stone into wallet-based.” Bitbo data suggests that there are around 200 million active Bitcoin wallets worldwide. Meanwhile, the trading week ending May 23 saw approximately $2.75 billion inflows into US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs , coinciding with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22.",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|LTC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ENA|BSV|ZK|WLD|OM|KAVA|BTG|ARKM,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-25 22:29:42

This article delves into the potential implications of these moves and explores which cryptocurrencies are poised for significant growth. As market dynamics shift, the outlook for these digital assets offers intriguing possibilities. Aave Price Surge: Month Trends and Key Level Analysis AAVE recorded strong gains with a 60.73% jump over the month and a 48.77% rise over the last six months. A one-week change of 21.38% points to recent vibrant movement, while the price has ranged from $125.84 to $191.06. Growth has been notably vigorous during both the short-term and medium-term periods, reflecting significant bullish sentiment. Price currently sits within a range bordered by support at $87.37 and resistance at $217.80. Bulls have the upper hand, with momentum indicators near 50 and an RSI of 73.06, although no clear trend has emerged. Traders may consider buying near support and monitoring resistance for potential exit points to capitalize on price movements. Ondo Price Analysis Reveals Mixed Trends and Key Levels ONDO prices showed a modest weekly gain of 2.60% but dipped by 4.18% over the past month and fell by 7.10% over the last six months. Price action remained within a range of $0.69 to $1.09, indicating a lack of a strong directional move over these periods. The data highlights a careful performance history with moderate fluctuations and subtle downtrends, lending caution to traders while hinting at potential future movement. Current price levels range from a support near $0.48 to a resistance at $1.27, with a secondary resistance at $1.67. Oscillators and momentum indicators remain close to neutral while bearish signals emerge in moving averages. Trading within these boundaries may benefit from buying near support and considering exits around resistance. Conclusion AAVE has shown strength by breaking its resistance level, signaling potential growth. ONDO , on the other hand, has dipped by breaking its channel support, facing immediate downside pressure. AAVE’s breakout could lead to further bullish momentum, while ONDO needs to reclaim lost support to stabilize. Both coins are at critical junctures that will define their short-term and possibly long-term trajectories. Monitoring these movements is essential to understanding their next steps. The market’s ongoing developments will play a significant role in their directions. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Speaking on Friday’s episode of the Pivot podcast , which he co-hosts, Galloway said Musk had alienated Tesla’s customers, one of his most important assets, by backing a president whose supporters show little interest in electric cars and the broader shift to clean transport. He then pointed to polls that showed Tesla was the 8th most reputable brand in 2021, but it has now fallen to 95th. “He’s alienated the wrong people,” Galloway said. “Three-quarters of Republicans would never consider buying an EV. So he’s cozied up to the people who aren’t interested in EVs.” Galloway went on to list sharp drops in Tesla’s sales across Europe last year, down 59% in France, 81% in Sweden, 74% in the Netherlands, 66% in Denmark, 50% in Switzerland and 33% in Portugal. Musk’s political interference drove away key European EV buyers In recent months, Musk has tried to influence several European political debates, particularly via posts on X. The Guardian reports his interference turned off many European customers, which is a key market for electric vehicles. Moreover, in April, China’s BYD outsold Tesla in Europe for the first time, according to Jato Dynamics, an automotive market intelligence firm. “This has arguably been one of the greatest brand destructions,” Galloway told co-host Kara Swisher. He added, “Tesla was a great brand. He’s alienated his core demographic.” The federal job and spending cuts trace back to Musk’s leadership of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, under Trump’s second term, which began in January. Musk secured that position after his super PAC donated $200 million to Trump’s successful November campaign to return to the White House following his 2020 defeat. Since then, opinion polls have shown widespread disapproval of Musk’s work for Trump. Some studies indicate that a majority of voters dislike how he and DOGE treated federal employees as the department worked through large job reductions. By late April, Tesla reported a 71% drop in profits. On an earnings call with investors, Musk said he would start stepping back from DOGE in May. He told shareholders that the job of getting the government’s “financial house in order is mostly done” and that his “time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly.” Although DOGE claimed it would cut about $160 billion in spending, CBS News reported that Partnership for Public Service estimated in late April that actually carrying out those cuts would itself cost around $135 billion, KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Tech|D.O.G.E|Elon Musk|Tesla,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-25 22:48:07

According to Bloomberg, the pressure is mounting right after President Donald Trump pushed his tax-heavy legislative package through the House last week, causing long-term Treasury yields to spike. But any sense of stability vanished on Friday when Trump posted that he’d impose a 50% tariff on imports from the European Union starting June 1, sending yields down again and exposing just how fragile the market still is. The impact was immediate. The 30-year Treasury yield fell 3 basis points to 5.031%, the 10-year dropped by 4 basis points to 4.509%, and the 2-year edged slightly lower to 3.993%. In the bond market, that’s movement that traders don’t ignore—especially not when it’s caused by social media posts from the Oval Office. Trump’s explanation was: “The European Union has been very difficult to deal with,” he wrote on Truth Social, before adding that the trade negotiations were “going nowhere.” Trump’s tariffs rattle markets as Apple dragged in Things got messier when Trump tossed Apple into the mix, posting that the company would be required to pay a 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured outside the US The stock tumbled, and once again, bond traders ran for safety. Treasury prices climbed as a result, pulling yields lower for the second time in a week that had already seen record-breaking movement. Peter Boockvar, the chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group, weighed in on the administration’s heavy-handed economic tactics, writing, “Capitalism works best when it is left alone as businesses and consumers are left free to trade goods and services at prices agreed upon by both sides… Unfortunately we keep straying from that basic economic concept with a muscled top-down approach.” By Tuesday of the previous week, bond markets were already on edge after Moody’s downgraded the US credit outlook, citing swelling deficits and the rising cost of servicing debt. That decision sent the 30-year yield past 5.1%, a level not seen since 2023, and pushed the 10-year over 4.5%. But the late-week drop—sparked by Trump’s tariff announcements—highlighted how fast the market is responding to political risk instead of economic fundamentals. Economic calendar packed as inflation data looms Markets are closed Monday for Memorial Day, but that’s where the calm ends. Beginning Tuesday, traders will have to process a string of high-impact reports, including new data on durable goods, capital goods, housing prices, and consumer confidence. The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge—core PCE—is due Friday, along with the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey, which has already shown inflation expectations hitting levels not seen in decades. Kathryn Kaminski, chief strategist at AlphaSimplex Group, summed it up: “Fixed income has been really difficult to trend this year as it’s been very back and forth with yields. We need more clarity on many things, including on inflation.” Fed officials will also be all over the calendar. Neel Kashkari from Minneapolis and John Williams from New York are speaking Tuesday. On Wednesday, Tom Barkin (Richmond), Austan Goolsbee (Chicago), Mary Daly (San Francisco), Lorie Logan (Dallas), and Adriana Kugler from the Fed Board will all make public remarks. Goolsbee returns on Thursday. Also on the radar are bond auctions. Tuesday will see auctions for 6-, 13-, and 26-week bills, and two-year notes. On Wednesday, the Treasury will offer 17-week bills, floating-rate notes, and five-year notes. Thursday wraps with 4- and 8-week bills and seven-year notes. Traders have little breathing room. With Trump back in the White House, tariffs back on the table, and inflation data waiting at the end of the week, the Treasury market is once again running hot. Everyone in the game is watching for numbers, watching for posts, and trying to price in what’s coming next. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The announcement followed a phone call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who had asked for extra time to reach an agreement. BREAKING: President Trump says he received a call from the President of the EU Commission asking for the 50% tariff deadline to be move to July 9th, and it was his ""privilege to do so."" pic.twitter.com/p7cP4ADVe2 — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) May 25, 2025 “We had a very nice call, and I agreed to move it,” Trump told reporters Sunday while flying back to Washington. Earlier Sunday, von der Leyen posted on X that “Europe is ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively,” but stressed that “a good deal” will need “time until July 9.” That date marks the end of the 90-day negotiation period during which the EU had been spared from the 20 percent tariffs Trump first announced in April. The 50% tariffs are here to stay, nonetheless Last Friday, the president warned he would raise the tariffs to 50 percent if he did not see faster progress. He accused the bloc of dragging its feet on talks and of targeting U.S. firms with lawsuits and extra regulations. The higher tariff threat would affect about $321 billion in U.S.-EU goods trade. According to calculations by Bloomberg Economics, it could shave nearly 0.6 percent off U.S. gross domestic product and lift prices by more than 0.3 percent. In response to Trump’s warning, the EU last week put forward a fresh trade offer, and its trade chief, Maroš Šefčovič, spoke by phone on Friday with his U.S. counterpart, Jamieson Greer. That move was part of Brussels’ effort to show willingness to compromise ahead of the looming tariff deadline. Also on Friday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News, “I would hope that this would light a fire under the EU,” referring to the higher tariff threat. A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, complained that the EU had not shown the same level of engagement as other trading partners. “We just haven’t seen anything material come out of the EU,” the official said. The Treasury and Commerce departments did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “I’m not looking for a deal,” Trump said at the White House on Friday. “We’ve set the deal — it’s at 50 percent.” If the 50 percent tariffs were to take effect on June 1, Brussels would have to decide whether to retaliate. The EU has already readied a €21 billion package of counter-tariffs on American goods such as maize, wheat, motorcycles, and clothing. It is also weighing an additional list worth €95 billion that would target items including Boeing aircraft, cars, and bourbon whiskey.

Market analysts are buzzing with speculation about these altcoins. Several factors could be at play, driving potential growth. Delving deeper into these dynamics might reveal why these cryptocurrencies are capturing attention. Find out which coins are poised for a surge and what could be fueling their rise. VeChain Market Snapshot and Key Levels Last month recorded a gain of 3.02% paired with a modest week increase of 0.77%, while the six-month performance shows a drop of 31.35%. VET ’s recent movement reveals short-term resilience contrasted by longer-term pressure. Price action during this period stayed within a confined range, hinting at cautious optimism amid overall downward momentum. VeChain trades between $0.0189 and $0.0303 with immediate resistance at $0.0352 and support near $0.0123. Indicators show a mixed outlook with a neutral RSI at 50.21 and minimal momentum. The market lacks a clear trend, suggesting traders might consider buying around support while monitoring resistance as prices test these levels. Upward Movement in Sei Amid Long-Term Decline Sei recorded a 9.02% increase over the past month, marking a recovery from a significant 66.31% drop in the last six months. Price action has been volatile, showcasing a rebound that slightly closed the gap from previous lows. Despite these short-term gains, the long-term bearish trend continues to affect overall sentiment. Indicators have demonstrated a tough road for the coin, where upward movements have not fully compensated for the steep decline experienced over the longer period. Currently, price sits between $0.15 and $0.24, with resistance levels at $0.28 and $0.37. Support hovers around $0.10. Bears are currently in control, as moving averages suggest potential further declines despite neutral oscillators. Traders might find opportunities to buy near support while monitoring for a breakout above resistance before making larger commitments. Conclusion VET and SEI could experience significant movement next week. Observing recent patterns and market sentiment around these coins reveals an upward potential. Strong fundamentals and positive announcements might drive interest and investment. It's essential to keep an eye on their performance, as both are showing signs of readiness for major shifts.

While ETH’s stability serves as a reliable anchor for the broader market, attention is increasingly turning toward early-stage projects that offer the potential for outsized returns. In this environment, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the standout contender for those seeking to capitalize on the next wave of crypto growth. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Momentum and 50x Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the spotlight as the breakout presale of 2025, with Stage 8 nearing completion and over $8 million already raised from a diverse base of participants. The project’s capped token supply and HashEx-audited contracts provide a foundation of trust and scarcity, while its politically charged narrative is fueling unprecedented demand. Investors can take advantage of a 50% token bonus by using the PATRIOT50X code before the $0.007 listing target. Analysts are now projecting returns as high as 50x, with some models suggesting even greater upside if current momentum continues. This combination of structural integrity and analyst-backed forecasts is positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as the premier early-stage opportunity for transformative gains. Ethereum (ETH): Stability and Institutional Confidence Ethereum’s technical indicators remain robust, with support at $2,400 and resistance at $2,900. Analysts anticipate that ETH will continue to test higher levels if bullish sentiment persists, though its upside is seen as steady rather than explosive when compared to early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Institutional inflows and ongoing upgrades further solidify Ethereum’s position as a core holding for diversified portfolios. XRP, TON, and Solana: Steady Growth and Ecosystem Strength XRP is trading near $2.35, with analysts forecasting a move toward $2.85–$3.40 in the near term. TON has surged to $6.45, propelled by growing NFT activity and Telegram’s expanding ecosystem. Solana is consolidating between $158 and $177, with technical indicators pointing to a potential breakout above $175. While all three assets offer solid fundamentals and growth prospects, none currently match the early-stage momentum and analyst-backed projections now surrounding MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Ethereum’s steady trajectory signals market maturity, but the most compelling opportunity for outsized gains lies with MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearly complete, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 50x ROI, MAGA is the breakout contender for 2025. For those seeking the next transformative crypto story, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands as the clear early-stage magnet—don’t miss the chance to be part of what could be the year’s defining crypto opportunity.

The South Korean media outlet Edaily quoted Min Byoung-dug, a lawmaker for the Democratic Party and the chairman of the party’s Digital Asset Committee, as stating that stablecoins could soon become an industry on an equal footing with AI or semiconductors. Min said: “South Korean is an internet powerhouse. We need to take the lead in institutionalizing stablecoins before US dollar-based stablecoins become firmly established. That is the only way we can secure a sure position in the global battle for stablecoin hegemony.” The Democratic Party lawmaker Min Byoung-dug. (Source: EDaily Issue Maker/YouTube/Screenshot) KRW Stablecoin Rollout: The Time Is Now Min added that he thought the potential for stablecoin adoption in the payments space was “limitless.” He explained: “We should not just sit back and watch it grow into a powerful new future industry on the scale of AI or semiconductors.” Min is a close Lee ally and an open advocate of crypto regulation reform. He has also previously called for tax parity between South Korean stock traders and crypto investors . Lee has repeatedly promised to launch a state-backed KRW stablecoin in response to the rapid rise of USD-pegged coins like USDT and USD Coin (USDC) . The frontrunner, who leads his closest rival Kim Moon-soo (People Power Party) in the polls by almost 10%, has called for Seoul to “enter the stablecoin market quickly.” 이재명 46.6% 김문수 37.6% 이준석 10.4%…엇갈린 서울·PK 민심 https://t.co/ULLVbHi5CQ — JTBC 뉴스 (@JTBC_news) May 24, 2025 Latest poll has Lee on 46.6%, Kim on 37.6%, and Reform Party leader Lee Jun-seok on 10.4%. Lee has warned that delaying the launch of such a coin could lead to further capital flight from the country . Min echoed Lee’s calls, telling EDaily that Seoul “must expedite the institutionalization of stablecoins.” He explained that South Korea “should not fall behind as the use of stablecoins rapidly increases, particularly in the United States.” USDT, USDC Dominance Min noted the fact that USDT and USDC “account for 90% of the stablecoin market in the United States.” He also claimed that USD-pegged coins “are already being used in some parts of Korea, such as Dongdaemun Market, where many foreign payments are made.” Source: Dune Min’s comments about Dongdaegmun Market, Seoul’s biggest clothing and textiles market, may be seen as contentious. Posters on popular South Korean crypto forums last year claimed that “mass USDT adoption” was underway at Dongdaemun, with Chinese buyers particularly keen on the coin. However, Dongaemun traders have told both Cryptonews.com and South Korean media outlets that cash, not crypto, is still king at the market . Regardless, Min said that rapid adoption at home and overseas means Seoul risks being left out in the cold. He said that if USDT and USDC continue to gain popularity worldwide, the space a won-based stablecoin could fill “will inevitably diminish.” DPK's Lee Jae-myung urges 'judgment of insurrection forces,' pledges policies to boost stock market https://t.co/NdPe030YSR — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) May 25, 2025 Could Lawmakers Act Before June 3 Elections? Min claimed that a won-based stablecoin could gain global attention and drive up global demand for won-related assets, such as the government bonds underpinning a KRW stablecoin. The lawmaker said that fans of South Korean webtoons (web-based comics) could be among the first overseas users. Readers may use a won-based stablecoin to buy webtoons, Min said. Min added that he is already pushing for the National Assembly to approve stablecoin legislation. The DP has a large majority in the house going into the elections. And with the nation essentially rudderless following the impeachment earlier this year of former President Yoon Suk-yeol, the party may yet decide to push ahead with such a bill before the June 3 elections. Min has already unveiled a private member’s bill named the Basic Act on Digital Assets, prepared with the aid of industry experts. The lawmaker said of the draft law: “I plan to submit the bill to the National Assembly after another review.” The post South Korea’s Biggest Party Urges ‘Expedited KRW Stablecoin Rollout’ appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|South Korea|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT|USDC,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-25 23:30:00

However, the real story is unfolding elsewhere: MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly outshining both in daily trading volume and community momentum, capturing the attention of both retail and institutional traders. With time running out before its presale closes, MAGA is positioning itself as the breakout contender for the year, while Cardano, Litecoin, and Bitcoin remain essential components of diversified portfolios. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Volume Surge, Scarcity, and Breakout Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the pace for early-stage altcoins in 2025, with daily volume and presale momentum eclipsing even the most established names. Here’s why traders and analysts are calling MAGA the next big crypto story: Unprecedented Volume Growth: Daily trading volume has surged, outpacing Solana and XRP in early-stage activity, as both retail and institutional buyers rush to secure their positions before the presale closes. Scarcity-Driven Model: With a capped 100 billion token supply and structured distribution, MAGA is designed for supply squeezes that historically drive explosive price gains. Viral Narrative and Community Power: The project’s politically charged, socially viral narrative has energized a passionate community, fueling organic growth and repeat buying activity. Analyst-Backed Upside: Recent forecasts project 30x–36x returns, with some models suggesting even higher upside if momentum continues. Price targets near $0.007 at listing signal massive potential for early entrants. Limited-Time Bonus: Early participants can still claim a 50% token bonus using the PATRIOT50X promo code before the $0.007 listing, making MAGA the go-to allocation for those seeking transformative gains. As each stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is not just following the market—it’s leading its own breakout cycle, with time running out for those who want to secure a ground-floor entry. Solana and XRP: Steady but Outpaced Solana remains a leader in DeFi and NFT ecosystems, with strong on-chain growth and institutional interest. XRP continues to benefit from regulatory clarity and ETF speculation, with whale accumulation signaling long-term confidence. However, both are seeing more measured upside compared to the explosive momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE, as their larger market caps limit short-term multiple expansion. Cardano (ADA): Gradual Progress, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Cardano is trading near $0.85, with forecasts suggesting a move toward $1.00–$1.30 by year-end if sentiment holds. While ADA’s fundamentals are solid, its near-term returns are modest compared to the presale-driven surge of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin (BTC): Stability and Market Anchor Litecoin is consolidating above $90, with technicals hinting at a bullish continuation toward $100–$110. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is holding firm above $108,000, serving as the market’s anchor and a core holding for long-term portfolios. Both offer stability, but their upside is outpaced by the rapid accumulation and momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion Solana and XRP remain essential assets, but the most dramatic growth potential is now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With daily volume surging, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 36x ROI, MAGA is the breakout altcoin to watch as time runs out for early entry.

A few days ago, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the procedural vote by 66 to 32, with two senators abstaining. Recall that White House officials have discredited conflict of interest fears in the president’s burgeoning cryptocurrency activities during his second term. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Regulating stablecoins, digital assets whose value is tied to another asset, most especially the U.S. dollar, has been touted by supporters of the bill as a crucial step towards wider oversight of the crypto market, and one that will strengthen U.S. innovation in the industry. However, concerns over gaps in the bill’s safeguards brought about fierce objections from Democrats. Some, especially Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, argued it would boost Trump’s chances of corruption by “supercharging the size of the stablecoin market.” What’s Next for the GENIUS Act? The bill still has a long way to go before final passage. That vote may likely come after the Memorial Day recess. And serious political risks remain.

It’s wide, painful, and according to Jim Cramer, downright “hideous.” Speaking on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street on SUnday, Jim said, “The money keeps going to these European stocks. And it’s rather amazing.” The DAX in Germany is up 19% so far this year. The S&P 500? Down more than 1%. President Donald Trump kicked off the latest round of market instability on April 2, when he announced “reciprocal” tariffs that rattled investor confidence. That same week, the bond market got hit too. Yields spiked as inflation worries grew. Tech giants like Apple and Nvidia tanked, dragged down by their global supply chain exposure and China-related revenue streams. On April 9, Trump paused certain country-specific tariffs, but left China out. That made things worse for companies deeply tied to Chinese markets. Trump’s trade moves worsen investor fears Just when things were beginning to cool off, Trump piled on more pressure. On May 12, trade tensions between China and the US eased slightly, but it didn’t last. That Friday, Trump pushed for a 25% tariff on phones not made in the United States, calling out Apple, Samsung, and others directly. Hours later, he floated a 50% tariff on European Union imports, scheduled to start June 1. Markets had no time to digest the chaos. That same evening—May 16—Moody’s dropped its rating on US government debt by one notch, matching Fitch’s downgrade from August 2023 and Standard & Poor’s 2011 cut. The original S&P downgrade crushed stocks. The Fitch downgrade hurt, but less. This time, markets barely moved, but bond yields jumped. On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield rose above 4.6% before pulling back slightly. Stocks stayed flat, but the bond market was shaken. Jim pointed out a key difference between now and previous crises. “What’s happening that didn’t happen then is there is an alternative,” he said . That alternative is Europe, which right now is attracting capital with cheaper stocks, more flexible rate policies, and stronger year-to-date returns. Wall Street reacts as Europe pulls ahead Even Barclays admitted that the “end of US exceptionalism” might be Europe’s moment. The European Central Bank has more space to cut rates. Their stocks are valued lower. Investors are taking note. In a May research note, KKR explained that institutional money is eyeing exits from the United States. “Many CIOs are considering moving assets out of the United States towards other parts of the world,” the firm said. But they also warned it’s not that easy. The US stock market is still twice the size of Europe, Japan, and India combined. KKR reminded clients that many American companies are large, liquid, and still generating strong returns on capital. Jim doesn’t believe in abandoning US stocks either. During last week’s Monthly Meeting, he listed six stocks he’s watching to buy if prices fall, and named five that worry him. At the top of his concern list? Apple. Even before Trump’s latest tariff threats, he was already nervous about the tech giant’s exposure. “There are tons of stocks I would like to buy if the prices come down,” he said. In his May 11 column, Jim talked about what he saw in Europe firsthand. “They are crushing it with stock performance that is outstanding, in many cases backed up by earnings,” he wrote. He said the US isn’t holding up. “America is hideously underperforming,” he wrote, comparing the US to its “European cousins.” He also described Europe as “safer and more predictable,” adding that markets there “can continue to climb given the momentum.” Jim says he doesn’t like the “sell America” approach. He said investors should be adjusting—not exiting. During his April 3 episode of Mad Money , right after Trump’s first tariff wave, he advised people to buy different stocks and cut exposure to riskier ones. He’s looking for domestic companies that won’t collapse during a slowdown. His ideal picks? Companies with pricing power, strong demand, low credit risk, and resilience even when the economy slips. While some investors are drawn to international markets, they may already have that exposure without realizing it. Many S&P 500 companies generate a large share of their revenue abroad, which means US stocks are more globally tied than most people think.

45098286,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=734692,1748217204,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45098286.jpeg,Trump claims Nippon Steel deal will boost US job market but the math doesn’t add up,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-nippon-steel-deal-boost-us-job-market/,"Donald Trump claimed on Friday that a “planned partnership” between Nippon Steel and US Steel would deliver “at least 70,000 jobs” to American workers and inject $14 billion into the economy. But that figure overshoots by a long shot — more than five times the number of employees US Steel currently has in the United States. The number raised eyebrows, not because it was big, but because nobody — not Nippon, not the unions, not the investors — can figure out where the hell he got it from. According to Bloomberg, after over 17 months of negotiations, Nippon Steel believed it had finally secured the $14.1 billion takeover of US Steel, but Trump’s statement muddied the waters. He didn’t actually say the buyout was approved. He just declared that US Steel would “remain American.” That line, dropped on social media, landed hard and fast. Yet, he gave no specifics, no follow-up from the White House, and no timeline for next steps. Companies scramble for clarity as shares surge Publicly, both Nippon Steel and US Steel cheered what they called a “bold” moment and embraced the idea of a new partnership. But neither addressed the actual takeover deal. US Steel’s stock, meanwhile, jumped as much as 26% in Friday trading and closed 21% higher at $52.01, even though the company had already agreed to a $55 per share buyout in cash back in December 2023. Trump’s approval, if that’s even what it was, contradicts his own words from December, when he wrote that he was “totally against the once great and powerful US Steel being bought by a foreign company.” At the time, that rare stance put him in line with Joe Biden, who blocked the deal in January on the advice of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Suddenly pivoting now raises real questions about how far Trump is willing to go to appease Japan, especially while both countries are deep in tariff talks. Last week, Ryosei Akazawa, Japan’s top trade negotiator, met in Washington with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. A few days earlier, Trump had a call with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The two agreed to meet in Canada next month during the G7 leaders’ summit. The timing is everything. The tariff issue is boiling. Japan is facing a 25% tariff on cars, steel, and aluminum, plus a 10% duty on all other goods that could rise to 24% in July if there’s no new trade deal. Car companies like Toyota have already flagged billions in profit losses, and Ishiba’s government is staring at a possible recession after last quarter’s contraction. Union rejects deal while confusion grows over future ownership Akazawa, speaking to reporters on Friday, refused to comment on the steel situation, saying they’d wait for an official statement. On tariffs, he acknowledged the June meeting but stressed, “It’s unwise to rush any agreement.” He’s expected to return to Washington on May 30 to meet Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who’s been involved in the last two rounds of negotiations. While Japan pushes for answers, the workers on the ground in America remain skeptical. The United Steelworkers union, which oversees labor at US Steel’s major integrated plants across the Rust Belt, isn’t sold on any of this. Their president, David McCall, said from the beginning that Nippon Steel didn’t consult with the union before announcing the deal. He’s not buying their promises now either. “Their ‘promise’ is always made with exceptions to back out of the statements,” McCall said in a text message this week. “Nothing makes me think this one is anything but another desperate attempt.” That “attempt” includes maintaining plants that are decades old, run on high-cost systems, and will need serious investment to stay open. Advocates of the deal say Nippon Steel will fix them up, bring in new tech, and upgrade capacity. But again, they haven’t said how much they’d spend or when they’d start. Nippon, for its part, called the partnership “a game changer” in a brief statement, saying it benefits US Steel, the American steel industry, and the broader manufacturing base. But investors want more than slogans. And so far, that’s all they’ve been handed.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) brought together its ten member states in an attempt to protect their economies, just as Trump’s White House ramps up duties on exports from the region. According to information provided by Bloomberg, the talks are focused on getting ahead of the fallout caused by Trump’s latest tariff decisions. China sent Premier Li Qiang to lead its delegation. Gulf Cooperation Council countries including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates are also in the room. But not a single official from the U.S. or its Western allies showed up. China’s presence grows as U.S. skips meeting For Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, hosting this summit is about drawing in trade from nations sitting on big cash surpluses. With China warning other countries not to sign deals that might hurt its interests, Asean leaders are walking a thin line between two superpowers. “There is no substitute for the United States,” said Shahriman Lockman, an analyst at the Institute of Strategic and International Studies in Malaysia. “Yes, we talk about diversification and autonomy. But let’s not kid ourselves — there is no real alternative in sight.” Still, trade numbers show that the U.S. is already falling behind. China’s trade with Asean hit $982.3 billion in 2024, while the U.S. only managed $476.8 billion, most of it imports from the region. That gap is now at the center of every private conversation inside the summit hall. Recent visits by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia included pitches for what he called an “Asian family,” a message aimed directly at countering the U.S. push to isolate China. Meanwhile, Indonesia joined the BRICS bloc earlier this year, and Malaysia, Vietnam, and Thailand have all been added as partner nations. That deepens economic ties with both China and Russia, giving Southeast Asia more options if Trump’s tariffs grow even harsher. Trade talks and regional conflicts collide at summit At the summit, Malaysia’s Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil told reporters the country is open to doing business with anyone. “I see this as a very good opportunity for us to show that Malaysia is a neutral country that wants to trade with any country that would like to trade with us,” he said. Inside the U.S., officials from several Southeast Asian countries are trying to negotiate with Trump’s administration one-on-one to avoid the steepest tariffs. A bloc approach, led by Malaysia, was already rejected, according to local media. The hope is that separate deals could still buy them time. But those efforts are shaky. Singapore’s Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong said Asean is working to improve an existing trade agreement. Though over 90% of goods in the region already move tariff-free, Gan admitted that wouldn’t be enough. “These are encouraging, but it doesn’t mean that the trouble is over,” he said. Asean also just wrapped up negotiations with China to upgrade their free trade agreement. The new version includes chapters on crypto-related digital sectors, clean energy, and small and medium-sized businesses, all of which are expected to boost cross-border movement of both money and services. But trade isn’t the only thing being discussed. The military crisis in Myanmar is getting attention too. Leaders plan to hold side talks on how to deal with the country’s civil war, which has dragged on with no resolution. There’s also pressure on Anwar to say something about the war in Gaza. He said last week he would “probably touch on” the issue and call for a ceasefire, while using the summit to point out the growing divide between richer nations and developing countries in the Global South. That said, expectations are low. Gregory Poling, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told reporters: “Despite rhetoric from the Malaysian government as chair, there has been very little evidence of an Asean effort here. The stakes are actually pretty low.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",News|Asia|China|tariffs,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-25 23:57:10

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 318,700 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum appears to be in the midst of a five-wave rally on the four-hour chart. Bluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to witness a five-wave surge before going through a correction. The analyst predicts that Ethereum will still hit his upside target of $3,500 even though President Trump’s latest tariff threats are weighing down markets. “Despite the trump tariff tantrum which happened legit 10 minutes after I went to sleep, I think ETH still looks ok and going to assume a range here.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $2,478. The analyst is also bullish on the Ethereum-based memecoin SPX6900 ( SPX ). Bluntz thinks that SPX is now in an uptrend and en route to a new all-time high of $2.30 by October of this year. “Bid some SPX. Going to try and hold for all-time high.” Source: Bluntz/X SPX refers to the S&P 500 index, which satirically aspires to “topple the S&P 500 by achieving a staggering $69 trillion market cap.” Fellow crypto strategist Jack is also bullish on SPX, thinking that the memecoin will skyrocket if the S&P 500 itself explodes to a new all-time high. “Since nothing makes sense anyway, it is probably a good bet to own SPX6900 if SPX motors to all-time high, because well obviously SPX going to 6900 will capture mindshare and apparently that is, besides just liquidity beta, what people will argue why SPX6900 goes up.

While BTC’s resilience and institutional inflows provide a stable foundation, the real intrigue is unfolding beneath the surface: MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly capturing the attention of major crypto whales and analysts, positioning itself as the breakout early-stage contender for 2025. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Momentum and Whale Accumulation MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the dominant presale of the year, with Stage 8 nearly full and over $8 million raised as demand accelerates. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling unprecedented accumulation from both retail and institutional buyers. On-chain data confirms a recent 72.95 ETH whale buy—valued at over $133,000—marking the largest single early-stage crypto purchase of 2025. This level of whale activity signals deep conviction and strategic positioning before listings go live. Analysts are projecting returns of 25x to 35x, with some models suggesting even higher upside if momentum continues. As each stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is solidifying its reputation as the top early-stage opportunity for those seeking transformative gains before the next wave of price discovery. Bitcoin (BTC): Market Anchor and Institutional Support Bitcoin remains the market’s anchor, trading above $108,000 with forecasts for a possible move to $118,000–$131,000 if bullish momentum returns. Institutional inflows and ETF demand continue to support BTC’s long-term outlook, but its upside from current levels is seen as more measured, prompting many investors to diversify into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Consolidation and Rotating Capital XRP is consolidating near $2.45, buoyed by regulatory clarity and ETF speculation. While XRP’s fundamentals remain strong and whale accumulation continues, its price action has become more range-bound. Analysts forecast a move toward $2.85–$3.40 in the coming weeks, but the most aggressive capital is now rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper, asymmetric returns. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Steady Growth, MAGA Outpaces NEAR Protocol is trading around $3.07, with forecasts suggesting a move toward $3.85–$5.18 by year-end. While NEAR’s ecosystem continues to expand and its technicals remain positive, its near-term upside is more modest compared to the explosive presale-driven momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL): Technical Strength, MAGA Leads Solana is consolidating between $158 and $175, with technicals pointing to a potential breakout above $175. The network’s high throughput and expanding DeFi ecosystem continue to attract users and developers. While Solana’s outlook is optimistic, its growth is steady compared to the rapid accumulation and analyst-backed projections now surrounding MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Bitcoin’s stability and Solana’s technical strength are impressive, but the most compelling upside is quietly unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE . With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 35x ROI, MAGA stands as the breakout contender for 2025.

He made the announcement late Sunday, pushing the original June 1 deadline to July 9. Data from Bloomberg shows that this delay instantly lifted US equity-index futures, reversing some of the damage done Friday when Trump had first dropped the threat. S&P 500 futures jumped 0.9% and Nasdaq 100 futures went up about 1% after the announcement. That bounce followed a rough close to last week when those same contracts dropped sharply in response to Trump’s tariff warning. Before the extension, futures for Japan, Australia, and Hong Kong had already been trading lower in early Asia sessions, echoing the Friday mood on Wall Street. Trump threats drag gold down, lift the dollar Trump’s Friday move wasn’t just about the EU. He also said he’d slap a 25% tariff on smartphones if companies like Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. didn’t start producing inside the US. That aggressive talk didn’t go unnoticed. The dollar, which had just sunk to its lowest point since December 2023, climbed early Monday. At the same time, the yen and Swiss franc, which had surged on Friday’s uncertainty, both retreated. Gold didn’t hold up either. The metal had gained 1.9% on Friday from traders looking for safety, touching $3,357 per ounce, but by Monday, spot gold was down 0.3% at $3,346.89/oz. Analysts said that even though the delay lowered short-term panic, concerns are still high over the US fiscal position. Those fears got worse after Moody’s Ratings took away the US’s top-tier credit grade this month, citing Trump’s latest tax bill that passed the House of Representatives last week and is now with the Senate. Meanwhile, the Treasury market showed little movement Friday. Yields had shot up earlier in the week as traders tried to figure out how much damage Trump’s new tax breaks might do to the national debt. Treasuries were closed Monday for a US holiday, giving investors a brief pause ahead of more data. The next big report comes Friday when the Federal Reserve releases its preferred inflation metric, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (excluding food and energy). Economists are looking for a 0.1% rise for April. US Steel deal, Japan negotiations, and shipping worries Friday also brought a curveball: Trump announced a deal between United States Steel Corp. and Japan’s Nippon Steel Corp.. The move stunned traders. Trump said the agreement would help keep US Steel in America, but gave no further details. Still, it was enough to send US Steel shares up 21.2%. Meanwhile, Nippon Steel’s ADRs rose 1.7%. Japanese stocks may stay volatile. After Trump’s comments, the yen weakened, which tends to support local exporters. But anxiety over Europe and Apple’s exposure remains. Shoji Hirakawa, chief global strategist at Tokai Tokyo Intelligence Lab, said Monday, “Japanese stocks are likely to start lower today due to concerns over tariffs on Europe and Apple, but the decline is expected to gradually narrow.” The Nikkei 225 futures touched 37,210 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, slightly higher than the last close of 37,160.47. Behind the scenes, Japan’s top trade officials are trying to close out negotiations before Trump sits down with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in June. Hirakawa also said, “Given that tariffs negotiations between Japan and the US are ongoing, it’s clear that compared to two months ago, the situation is moving toward a resolution. Stocks could turn positive.” Capital Economics thinks Trump might be bluffing. “At this stage, we are not inclined to change our working assumption that tariffs on the EU will ultimately settle around 10%, but this underlines that there are risks and that the road to an agreement could be rocky.” Back in Europe, there are signs that the ongoing trade drama is already starting to jam up major shipping ports. Some northern European hubs are facing rising congestion, which could push global shipping costs higher if the tariff threats continue into the summer. On the data front, Asia is set to release several numbers this week: Singapore’s industrial production, Hong Kong’s trade figures, and South Korea’s retail sales—all expected between now and Saturday. Traders are watching those closely as they gauge how the region is holding up under the weight of ongoing US policy moves. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Trump made the remarks to reporters on Sunday in New Jersey, just before boarding Air Force One. He appeared increasingly annoyed with Russian President Vladimir Putin and dismayed by stalled negotiations aimed at securing a ceasefire in Ukraine. “I’m not happy with what Putin is doing,” Trump said. “He’s killing a lot of people, and I don’t know what the hell happened to Putin. I’ve known him a long time—always gotten along with him—but he’s sending rockets into cities and killing people, and I don’t like it at all.” Ukrainian officials reported that at least 12 people died in the overnight air raids. The attacks prompted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to renew his appeal for stricter penalties against Moscow. The bombardment also took place amid a third day of prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine, underscoring the conflict’s complex, ongoing human toll. Trump repeatedly asked what had happened to Putin. “We’re in the middle of talking, and he’s shooting rockets into Kyiv and other cities,” he said. “I don’t like it at all.” Until now, the focus of U.S. pressure had fallen mostly on Zelenskiy to find a path to peace, even as Russia’s full-scale invasion that began in February 2022 continues to exact a heavy price. Earlier this month, Trump had shown reluctance to ramp up sanctions on the Kremlin. But he suggested new measures could target Russia’s oil trade or its state-owned oil giant, Rosneft. Russia already faces sanctions from the European Union and the United Kingdom. Earlier last week, Britain unveiled a sweeping package of sanctions against Russia’s military, energy, and financial sectors. The measures, coordinated with the EU, came in response to the largest drone assault of the war over the past weekend, which struck multiple Ukrainian cities. London said its latest sanctions hit 100 new targets. These include networks that supply Russia’s Iskander missiles, Kremlin-backed information operations, and financial outfits that help Moscow sidestep existing penalties. “We urge [President Vladimir Putin] to agree a full, unconditional ceasefire right away so there can be talks on a just and lasting peace,” UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said. Lammy added that any delay in peace efforts would only strengthen Britain’s resolve to back Ukraine’s defense and tighten sanctions on Russia’s war machine. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, together with leaders of major EU nations, has called on Washington to join in imposing harsher penalties on Moscow for refusing to halt hostilities. Among the British measures is a new round of sanctions on the Social Design Agency, a Kremlin-linked disinformation group first blacklisted in 2024. London described it as a body that sought to stir unrest in European countries. Forty-six financial institutions accused of helping Russia dodge existing sanctions were also targeted. Notable entities include the St. Petersburg Currency Exchange and the Russian Deposit Insurance Agency, which underwrites Russian banks. Eighteen additional vessels were added to the blacklist. These ships form part of Russia’s so-called “shadow fleet,” which is used to circumvent Western restrictions and keep its crude exports flowing. Finally, Britain said it is working with international partners to drive down the $60-per-barrel cap on the price Russia can fetch for its oil when using services, like insurance and shipping, from major industrial nations.

It pledged transparency , making it easier for regulators, exchanges, and compliance teams to spot fraud and other illegal activities on the platform. But what began as a basic form of on-chain oversight has evolved into a powerful weapon that savvy players now use to influence markets and even target individual users. Wallet data fuels both innovation and exploitation Many firms, such as Chainalysis, Arkham Intelligence, and Nansen, have turned blockchain data analysis into a thriving industry. These companies convert raw, bewildering onchain data into high-resolution weapons-grade surveillance. Originally designed for compliance, fraud detection, and law enforcement, these are now generally available for broader market usage. Wallet intelligence is regularly used by traders for predictive trading strategies , expecting the moves before they come up. Regulators use it to help enforce KYC (Know Your Customer) rules and fight criminal activity like money laundering. Exchanges can use it to watch for sketchy behavior — and even censor transactions they find too risky. But this visibility boom comes with danger. The knowledge available in a wallet can be good or bad. On the one hand, it also adds accountability; on the other, it puts users at the mercy of control and manipulation. Wallet data can be manipulated to move markets, suppress points of view, and reframe narratives — some of that manipulation occurs behind the closed doors of opacity and without transparency. Crypto’s privacy promise unravels under watchful eyes The whole point of cryptocurrency was privacy and freedom from centralization. Bitcoin and its ilk offered pseudonymity — you could transact without revealing your identity, escaping the prying eyes of banks and governments. However, transparency on the blockchain has a dark side. Each deal, swap, or token transfer is on an open ledger for eternity. Wallet intelligence firms collect and analyze this data to structure detailed profiles that closely monitor balances, trading behavior, and relationships across wallets. This has eroded pseudonymity in crypto transactions. Today, regulators can freeze wallets that have suspicious activity. Exchanges can proactively prevent transactions using a risk score from wallet intelligence companies. That means a handful of powerful actors determine who is “risky” or “safe” — that designation will influence user experience and access. The Mantra OM token collapse serves as a case study of transparency weaponized. The token was highly centralized—90% held by insiders—and traded with very low liquidity. These conditions alone made it vulnerable to market manipulation. When combined with wallet intelligence, this vulnerability became explosive. Coordinated attackers could use detailed wallet data to time their trades and execute massive short positions, triggering forced liquidations and market panic. The FTX collapse revealed a new kind of centralization in crypto The FTX collapse of 2022 exposed both the power and the risks of wallet intelligence. Regulators and auditors did not detect the scheme in time. But blockchain sleuths in the crypto community deployed wallet intelligence tools to track down billions of dollars in customer funds that had gone missing. They uncovered secret self-dealing between Alameda Research and FTX by tracking wallet flows, which is a welter of deception. Pocket intelligence enabled us to shine a light in places where centralized actors sought to hide. However, this power is narrowly concentrated in only a few companies. These firms have privileged access to wallet data, which allows them to determine which wallets to flag and analyze suspicious activities. This type of centralization is contrary to the decentralized principles on which cryptocurrency was based. The crypto movement is built on decentralization. It vows to give power back to users instead of letting centralized gatekeepers make decisions for us. But the promise of wallet obscurity may be undone by a growing body of wallet intelligence. When a few companies dominate the processing of wallet data, network control becomes consolidated in the hands of a few companies. It echoes “surveillance capitalism,” whereby user data is mined and weaponized for profit and control —but now wrapped in blockchain technology. This is a potential violation of user privacy, market fairness, and, ultimately, the vision of a fully self-sovereign, decentralized financial system. To maintain privacy and decentralization, individuals must take back control The battle-ready crypto community has a clear and present threat that needs to be met head-on: wallet intelligence being used as a weapon. If we want user anonymity without losing transparency, we need privacy-preserving technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs, confidential transactions or privacy-oriented blockchains. Because the power of wallet intelligence affects so many users, the governance for wallet intelligence needs to be open and decentralized to avoid centralization by a single party. Developers, regulators, and users need to come together to code safeguards that protect privacy even as they allow for accountability.

H100 said on May 25 that the funds, secured through 0% interest convertible loans, will be used to purchase Bitcoin ( BTC ) in line with its Bitcoin-buying pivot announced on May 22. Back, a longtime Bitcoin cypherpunk, contributed around $1.4 million, while the remaining $800,000 came from investment firms Morten Klein, Alundo Invest AS, Race Venture Scandinavia AB and Crafoord Capital Partners. The raise would allow H100 to buy around 20.18 Bitcoin at current market prices, which would add to the 4.39 Bitcoin that it purchased on May 22 and bring its total stash to roughly 24.57 Bitcoin. Source: H100 H100 said the convertible loans bear no interest and will mature on June 15, 2028. The loan may be converted into shares at any time at a conversion rate of 1.3 Swedish krona (11 US cents) per share. If H100’s share price maintains a volume-weighted average price of more than 33% above the conversion price for a cumulative total of 60 trading days, H100 has the right to mandate a conversion of the loan into equity. A full conversion would result in the issuance of roughly 16,153,900 new shares, corresponding to a dilution of approximately 12%. H100 shares bounced on Bitcoin buy Shares in H100 jumped 37% on the firm’s May 22 announcement and rose another 5.33% the following day to 1.29 SEK (14 US cents), Bloomberg data shows.

Andersen believes “the values of individual sovereignty highly present in the Bitcoin community aligns well with, and will appeal to, the customers and communities we are building the H100 platform for.” According to H100, the move makes it the first public company in Sweden to adopt a Bitcoin treasury policy and one of the first in Europe. The number of companies buying Bitcoin as a treasury asset is on the rise, with 112 public firms now holding the cryptocurrency , according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET data. Ten of those corporate Bitcoin holding companies are based in Europe, making H100 one of the first in the region to adopt the trend.

In a new update , Lee says he believes the current surge, which lifted the S&P 500 by 17% from recent lows to within 3% of an all-time high, reflects a powerful but underappreciated rally. “Part of this [bearish sentiment] is understandable. We had a black swan event on post-tariff liberation day, meaning an unexpected event, and we had a 20% fall in stocks in a very short period of time.” As for what’s coming next, Lee points to historical patterns where doubt after a market dump fueled rallies. “When stocks began to rally after March of 2020, many fund managers said we’re still in a bear market. And recall in the fall of 2022 after the markets made its low in October of 2022, a lot of investors were saying that this was just another bear market rally and investors are about to make a mistake… But here’s the reality – investors flip bullish as soon as you make an all-time high. So in other words, investors generally fight after a decline. They’ll fight the rally until you make a new all-time high. At a new high, they turn they turn around and become bullish and I think that that’s going to happen as soon as markets make a new all-time high.” Source: Fundstrat Lee says Bitcoin’s recent all-time high above $111,000 is another leading indicator for the S&P, because Bitcoin peaked about a month before the S&P did and they’re both tracking increased global liquidity. As for Moody’s downgrade of US government debt from AAA to AA1, Lee says he doubts it’s a negative signal for markets, noting that S&P first downgraded the US in 2011 and Fitch followed in 2023.

The insured damage, mostly from reinsurance payouts, is being carried by ten major publicly traded firms across Europe, as reported by CNBC. These companies are based mainly in Germany, the UK, Switzerland, and France, and their combined losses now account for nearly a tenth of all insured losses from the disaster. Munich Re and Hannover Re, the top two players out of Germany, are responsible for nearly $2 billion of that total. Swiss giants Swiss Re and Zurich followed close behind, clocking in around $830 million. Four UK firms — Hiscox, Lancashire, Conduit Re, and Beazley — collectively took on about $500 million in hits. Over in France, Scor logged $167 million in losses while AXA reported $100 million. That’s all real money. And none of these numbers are estimates — they’ve been reported by the companies themselves in earnings and financial statements. Swiss Re doubles loss forecast as LA fires kill 30, destroy thousands of homes The wildfires, which tore through Eaton Canyon and Palisades, left 30 dead, destroyed thousands of buildings, and displaced millions. The scale forced Swiss Re to raise its projection for total insured losses from $20 billion to $40 billion. These updated numbers now make the disaster one of the worst in California’s history. The overall economic damage is still expected to reach around $50 billion, but the chunk covered by insurers has widened fast. Michael Huttner, an analyst at Berenberg, said the size of these insurance losses caught a lot of firms off guard. “It was a combination of unusual and big,” Michael told CNBC. He added that the uncontrolled spread of the fire pushed claims far beyond what reinsurers expected. Despite that, Michael pointed out that profits across the sector still came in stronger than anticipated. He described it as a sign of “resiliency” in the face of large-scale disasters. But even with Europe eating billions in damages, its insurers are still only handling a small slice of the overall insured total. That’s because reinsurance agreements don’t kick in until the primary insurers, like Chubb, absorb the first wave. These contracts start covering losses only after about €400 million in damage has been handled by the front-line firms. So the reinsurers only got dragged in once the fire had already done some serious damage in California. Japan’s insurers hit harder than expected, deductibles up across Europe Meanwhile, insurers in Japan also got burned. Tokio Marine and Sompo disclosed wildfire losses of almost 50 billion yen, which is roughly $348 million. That number blew past JPMorgan’s initial post-fire estimate of just $63 million. If Swiss Re’s forecast of $40 billion proves accurate, this event will be four times worse than the 2018 wildfires in California, which cost insurers around $16 billion. During that earlier disaster, Munich Re took the biggest individual hit at around €500 million. That experience — along with other large events since — has led to higher deductibles across the entire European reinsurance market. Where once firms only had to wait out €100 million in primary losses, today the threshold has jumped to €400 million. Even with that buffer, it wasn’t enough to keep reinsurers from getting hit hard this time. One of the things that softened the blow, though, was the FAIR Plan — a shared fund paid into by multiple insurers operating in California. That plan is designed to absorb the first layer of losses before any individual private insurer starts paying out, and that helped ease the pressure on the bigger players — including the ones based in Europe. But with a fire this big, even that wasn’t enough to stop $3.5 billion from landing on reinsurers across the continent.

That growth has come despite James Seyffart’s speculation that the SEC’s early decisions would be an action that’s out of the norm. Seyffart anticipates that October is when decisions would likely be made. In addition, the ETF community pointed out that such delays were typical in the review process. Following XRP ETF approval odds rising , asset managers, including Bitwise, CoinShares, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale, await what the SEC will do with their applications. XRP ETF approval surges to 83% amid growing institutional investors’ interest The prediction market platform Polymarket shows a strong expectation boost for an XRP spot ETF approval. Following this, Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, spoke about the subject in the latest episode of the company’s podcast, Crypto in One Minute . He called ETFs a way for institutional investors to enter the cryptocurrency market easily. Garlinghouse highlighted that earlier, Wall Street and other institutional investors had struggled to access the crypto markets directly. However, according to him, that has changed as ETFs enable them to access the market through regulated financial products in place of crypto exchanges or self-custody wallets. He also noted the rapid expansion of Bitcoin ETFs. Based on his argument, the Bitcoin ETF was the quickest to reach $1 billion in assets. He stated that it reached $10 billion faster than any other ETF and believes institutional interest will continue to drive additional product launches, including those pegged to XRP. Notably, despite the US SEC having postponed decisions on spot ETFs, the market experienced an important change late last week. Volatility Shares introduced the first-ever XRP futures ETF on the Nasdaq exchange, using the ticker XRPI. This came after the launch of an XRP futures product on CME Group’s platform on May 19. XRP futures now allow investors to trade contracts based on the expected future price of the asset in a regulated setting. While similar products have been available for Bitcoin and Ethereum for a long time, XRP just recently joined the list. Additionally, Tectrium launched its 2x Long Daily XRP ETF, which was leveraged to provide even more choices for those interested in trading XRP-related instruments. These new offerings demonstrate a rising interest in XRP from institutional traders, which is also seen in the increasing chances of XRP ETF approvals. James Seyffart anticipates that Litecoin has a higher likelihood of getting approved first On May 21, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart shared his speculations that the SEC was more likely to approve a Litecoin ETF before any other cryptocurrency funding applications under review. His speculation came after the SEC postponed its decision on Bitwise’s request to include staking in its Ether ETF and Grayscale’s application for an XRP ETF, which analysts had anticipated. Based on the SEC’s explanation for the delay, the commission announced on May 20 that it needed an extra 45 days to decide on Bitwise’s request to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised. The agency had to either make a decision or delay it further by May 22. Furthermore, the SEC postponed its decision on Grayscale’s XRP tracking ETF and Bitwise’s Solana tracking fund while it collected public comments and started proceedings for further analysis of these proposals to ensure they met regulatory requirements. James Seyffart mentioned on X that these delays were expected because the SEC usually takes the full time to respond to a 19b-4 filing. According to Seyffart, almost all of these filings have final due dates in October, and an early decision would be out of the norm. He added, “No matter how Crypto-friendly this SEC is. There’s no conspiracy here.” Seyffart also revealed that delays on other spot crypto ETF bids were expected, and the SEC was likely to delay deciding on Litecoin ETFs, too. However, despite all this, his stand that Litecoin had a higher likelihood of getting approved first compared to others still remains.

Both big investors and regular savers are rushing to stockpile gold as a safe haven for troubled times. Marc Faber, a veteran investor known as “Dr. Doom,” has long made gold a key part of his own holdings and urged others to do the same. Faber often appears in video interviews, praising gold as a safe haven while warning of a possible economic collapse. He warns about a debt crisis, a sharp drop in asset prices, and surging inflation. “My sense is that a debt crisis is inevitable,” he said. According to Business Insider , Faber holds 25% of gold in his portfolio, and his clients follow his example, keeping a significant share of their wealth in the metal. There has been a steady move toward gold among his clients. But the rush to buy the metal has also spread to more ordinary investors. Many blame the economic uncertainty in 2025. Some of the fears voiced by Faber’s clients, from runaway inflation to even a full-scale war, may seem far-fetched. Yet analysts do not expect this wave of buying to fade soon. Global demand for gold bars rose to 257 metric tons in the first quarter of 2025, a 13% gain over the same period last year, according to the World Gold Council . Joe Cavatoni, a market strategist at the World Gold Council, said worries about the US dollar, weakness in the US economy, and the nation’s debt and deficit have helped drive demand higher. Interest in the search term “gold bars” on Google increased during significant market events, such as the announcement of tariffs on Canada and Mexico and Moody’s downgrade of US debt. Genesis Gold Group, a firm that often serves clients it calls “homesteaders” or “preppers,” says it has seen intense demand in recent quarters. Sales grew so fast that the company introduced a “prepper bar,” designed to be broken into smaller pieces for easier trade during a crisis. Jonathan Rose, the firm’s CEO, said sales of that bar jumped 20% in the first quarter of 2025, around the time President Donald Trump began laying out his tariff plans. More of Genesis’s customers are also asking to take their gold home. Rose estimates that about 70% of his clients now insist on holding physical gold, up from just 20% in past years. On the subreddit r/preppers, which has grown its membership by about 354% since 2020, by one count, users frequently ask whether to keep cash in the market or pile into gold. “It helps when a currency collapses,” one user wrote. “Cash is always king, until it collapses, then that’s where gold and silver step in.” Gold buyers to stay cautious until tariff impact on growth is clear The gold price has climbed about 25% in 2025, easily outpacing the S&P 500, which is down roughly 1% year-to-date. That rally has led some to wonder if the buying spree may have gone too far. Recently, Trump agreed to delay tariffs on Europe until 9 July. This pullback reduced some panic, resulting in a Gold dip of 0.3% to $3,346.89 on Monday from a Friday surge of 1.9%. However, experts warn that people are still uneasy about the U.S. fiscal outlook. Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone, noted that President Trump’s recent tax bill reignited worries over the US debt and deficit. But he said those fears may ease if lawmakers make changes to the bill to reassure bond investors. Moreover, Goldman Sachs cut its odds of a downturn this year from 45% to 35%, and Barclays dropped its mild-recession forecast altogether. Meanwhile, Michael Boutros, senior technical strategist at StoneX, said there is plenty of fearmongering in markets right now, though he expects gold demand to stay strong as long as people feel uneasy about the economy. Even after trade disputes get settled, Boutros believes gold buyers will remain cautious until they see how tariffs affect growth. “The rockier things get, the more this is going to find footing,” he said of gold’s momentum. Joe Cavatoni of the World Gold Council added that he sees solid price support and a continued upward path for gold through 2025.

Currently trading around $0.000015, analysts suggest SHIB could be gearing up for a short-term move toward $0.000020 if bullish momentum holds. However, the spotlight is gradually shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new viral cryptocurrency gaining massive attention. The project is in phase 5 of its presale priced at $0.03. Mutuum Finance’s presale surges past $9.2 million with over 11,500 investors already onboard. As Mutuum Finance enters Phase 6, the price will jump 16.67% to $0.035. With a jaw-dropping 12,380% price prediction circulating among bullish analysts and a low entry price of just $0.03, Mutuum Finance is being hailed as one of the best new altcoins to buy now for outsized returns in 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Eyes $0.00002 as Bullish Momentum Builds Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.000015, up a small 0.04% from the past 24 hours. The token has shown resilience, remaining above levels of support, and analysts are observing signs of a potential reversal to the bear. Technical indicators suggest that SHIB can maintain its current momentum and smash through the resistance line of $0.00001613, where it could potentially be headed to $0.00002 in the near term. This optimism is further buoyed by recent developments within the Shiba Inu universe, including token burns and work on its layer-2 solution, Shibarium, designed to enhance utility and reduce supply. While SHIB continues to draw investors, potential projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also drawing investors’ eyes for their potential in the new cryptocurrency universe. Transforming DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. This two-pronged approach maximizes security, efficiency, and decentralization and positions Mutuum Finance at the forefront of the DeFi universe. By giving users full control over their lending decisions, the platform is appealing to conservative and high-yield investors, and facilitates a more open and flexible financial system. A DeFi Disruptor Drawing Massive Investor Interest Mutuum Finance is rapidly generating buzz in the DeFi community with its game-changing lending solutions. Despite being in presale, it has already surpassed more than $9.2 million in funding and has amassed nearly 11,500 investors, making it a solid altcoin ready to experience a major breakthrough. With Phase 5 price at $0.03 and with an impending 16.67% price boost in the next phase, early investors stand to gain good returns in terms of bagging their highest returns. At launch, with an anticipated price of $0.06, profits will be 100%, and for the next bull cycle, projections see the leap over $2. Exclusive Rewards and Community Incentives Early adopters of Mutuum Finance all have enticing incentives, including a $100,000 giveaway in which 10 people will win $10,000 value of MUTM tokens. There is also a referral program that encourages community development as it rewards clients for recruiting new investors. Early backers also receive VIP access to platform updates. All these incentives not only drive early usage but also ensure long-term hold among token holders. Mutuum Finance raised over $9.2 million with nearly 11,500 investors in the presale, reflecting high demand. In Phase 5, which costs $0.03, the price will rise 16.67% to $0.035 in Phase 6, providing early investors a possible 100% return on investment. Mutuum Finance, with referrals and referral rewards, is one-of-a-kind in DeFi. Don’t miss this opportunity and invest before the next phase.

This surge in whale activity, combined with Bitcoin’s price stability and rising institutional inflows, signals renewed confidence in the broader crypto market. However, while Bitcoin and Ethereum remain foundational assets, the most aggressive capital is now rotating into early-stage, high-risk opportunities—none more prominent than MAGACOIN FINANCE. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Accumulation and 35x–40x Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the top high-risk allocation among crypto whales and early-stage investors. The project has raised over $8 million, with Stage 8 nearly full and a capped 100 billion token supply audited by HashEx. Notably, a single whale recently made a decisive 72.95 ETH purchase—valued at over $133,000—marking the largest early-stage buy of 2025 and signaling institutional-grade confidence in MAGA’s upside. Analysts are projecting 35x–40x returns from current entry levels, with some models suggesting even greater upside if momentum continues. The combination of scarcity-driven tokenomics, rapid presale sellouts, and strategic whale positioning is setting MAGACOIN FINANCE apart as the breakout high-risk play for Q3 and Q4 2025. Bitcoin (BTC): Stability and Institutional Support Bitcoin is consolidating around $110,000, supported by robust institutional inflows and ETF demand. While BTC remains the market’s anchor, its upside from current levels is seen as more measured, prompting many investors to rotate capital into higher-growth early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Ethereum (ETH): Steady Growth and Rotating Capital Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, supported by ongoing upgrades and robust institutional adoption. While ETH remains a core holding for most portfolios, the most aggressive capital is now flowing into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is far more compelling. TRUMP Coin: Volatility and Speculation TRUMP coin remains a speculative favorite, with forecasts for 2025 ranging widely from $35 to $300 depending on regulatory headlines and market sentiment. While the coin has benefited from political branding and periodic surges, its long-term value is more volatile than the structured, scarcity-driven approach of MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST Conclusion Bitcoin whales are quietly positioning for the next phase of the market, but it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that is capturing the most aggressive capital flows. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 40x ROI, MAGA stands as the top high-risk, high-reward opportunity for 2025.

Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $107,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin is now trading above $109,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $110,000 level. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $111,983 swing high to the $106,672 low. The first key resistance is near the $110,750 level. The next key resistance could be $111,800. A close above the $111,800 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $113,000 resistance level.

A recent 72.95 ETH whale buy—worth over $133,000—marks the largest early-stage crypto purchase of the year, signaling deep conviction among smart money participants.

XRP: Bullish Outlook and Rotating Capital XRP is trading near $2.60, buoyed by regulatory clarity, ETF speculation, and robust whale accumulation. Analysts forecast a move toward $2.85–$3.40 in the coming weeks, with some bullish scenarios targeting $5.50 by year-end if momentum persists. While XRP’s fundamentals remain strong, its near-term upside is more measured compared to the explosive presale-driven momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Chainlink (LINK): Steady Growth, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Chainlink is trading around $14–$15, with price forecasts for 2025 remaining steady and technicals pointing to a stable uptrend.

The tech giant introduced a significant update to its search engine at the Google I/O 2025 conference. The new feature , AI Mode, changes the standard Google Search bar to resemble an AI chatbot. These features provide users with direct, AI-generated answers to queries, often summarizing content from various sources, including Reddit, without requiring users to visit the original sites. AI Mode offers human answers instead of the standard list of links. It’s driven by a customized version of Google’s Gemini 2 generative AI model. The tool can answer tricky questions, search many sources at once, and give the results in a reader-friendly way. AI Mode was first launched to U.S.-based Google One AI Premium users in early 2025. Google has announced that it will be officially available to every user in the U.S. over the next few weeks. A worldwide launch is planned for later this year. “AI Mode is where we will first bring our frontier capabilities into search,” CEO Sundar Pichai said. He referred to it as a “complete overhaul” of the search experience. The change is part of a broader effort by Google to remain competitive in the battle over AI-powered search. Competitors like Microsoft, with Bing AI, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT have already incorporated similar features. Google’s answer is audacious — and possibly fraught with risk. AI Mode puts Reddit’s search traffic at risk One platform with the potential to be heavily affected is Reddit. Traditional Google Search has been very good for Reddit. You can use any search engine you want, but many of us end up on Reddit when looking for human answers to real-world problems , regardless of whether we are logged in. Google has even prioritized Reddit links in the search rankings in recent years, understanding that users can often put more trust in a forum than a cookie-cutter website. But with AI Mode, Google could start answering user questions directly from data scraped off sites like Reddit—without ever driving a click to them. So fewer people will potentially click through to Reddit properly. This is no small concern. The recent growth on Reddit has been powered largely by logged-out users—people who browse Reddit casually and find the site via search. These users are not the loyal base of Reddit, but they do have numbers. If AI Mode starts feeding Reddit-style responses without pointing to the site, that could be the quickest path to drying up a big source of visitors. That fear is already being reflected in the market. In February, Reddit’s stock tumbled more than 15% after the company announced its traffic had been “choppy” since Google’s search algorithm changed. Reddit’s chief executive, Steve Huffman, has said Google’s updates have meant that Reddit is unsure what traffic it can count on going forward. Reddit strengthens its community to offset AI traffic loss While search traffic is nice to have, the company’s strength is its logged-in user base. These regular users visit Reddit directly and participate in community discussions. These users stay longer, engage with more meaningful content, and bolster ad revenue. However, Reddit is also developing its own AI tools . In March 2025, it introduced Reddit Answers, an AI system that surfaces useful summaries from Reddit threads. Now, the platform is putting Reddit Answers front and center by adding it to its main search bar to help people find authentic, community-driven content more easily. This is a play partly in defense and partly in offense. It tries to lock users onto the platform using AI tools from Google and others. Reddit’s CEO, Steve Huffman, expressed confidence in the long-term value of human voices despite the rise of AI in search. He acknowledged that large language models (LLMs) change how people search online.

On the daily chart, XRP recently dropped below an important resistance level at $2.34. Right now, it’s finding some support around $2.30, but it keeps struggling to climb back above $2.34, which has turned into a new resistance point. If the price can break and stay above this level, the next targets would be around $2.44, and then a stronger resistance between $2.55 and $2.62. For now, the market is still within a bullish trend, meaning it’s making higher lows and higher highs — but a proper bounce is needed soon to keep that uptrend going. There’s also a chance that XRP is forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern on the daily chart. If this pattern completes and the price breaks above $2.62, it could push XRP to new highs, possibly even beyond $3. However, this pattern is not confirmed yet — it still needs to form the right side of the pattern and break above key resistance levels. Short-Term Market Movement The price has been stuck between $2.15 and $2.31 with no strong move either way. A small five-wave drop was seen from Friday’s high, but it hasn’t led to a bigger price drop. As long as the market stays below $2.43–$2.44, there’s still some downward pressure. If XRP drops further, key support levels to watch are around $2.15 and $1.95. However, this pullback looks more like a healthy correction rather than the start of a major downtrend. What’s the Bigger Picture? Even with this short-term weakness, the overall market structure still supports a bullish outlook. There was a clear five-wave move up from the April low to May 12, and now the market seems to be going through a normal pullback phase. As long as XRP stays above the important support at $1.79, the long-term bullish trend remains safe.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-26 01:46:18
45101542,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=734754,1748224503,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45101542.jpeg,Elon Musk’s X isn’t ready for super app status,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/musks-x-isnt-ready-for-super-app-status/,"On May 24, 2025, millions of X users worldwide suffered an outage for hours, the latest in a string of disruptions that have plagued the company lately. Users couldn’t log in, access timelines, or send messages, hardly the hallmarks of a platform aspiring to become a “super app.” Elon Musk’s vision for X is clear: a single, integrated platform that merges social media, payments, messaging, AI services, and commerce. But so far, the execution hasn’t matched that goal. For all of X’s ambitions, the platform struggles to maintain basic functionality, let alone support a layered suite of financial and transactional services. For some observers, this discrepancy highlights a bigger issue. Is Musk trying to do too much to be able to manage such a formidable transformation? Building a super app requires discipline, not chaos The super app model, best exemplified by WeChat in China, is complex. Besides a backend infrastructure capable of handling vast, interdependent functions, it requires strong regulatory alignment, cultural integration, and sustained focus. WeChat did not evolve through improvisation; it matured under coordinated leadership, with deep cooperation from regulators and a coherent product roadmap. X, by contrast, appears to have adopted an approach defined more by urgency than discipline. In the last year alone, Musk has announced initiatives ranging from encrypted messaging and peer-to-peer payments to AI-generated news and dating features. Yet these product ambitions have coincided with frequent platform outages and a marked decline in service reliability. Super apps do not succeed by layering complexity onto unstable systems. They thrive on trust—technical, operational, and institutional. And trust is difficult to maintain when the platform itself appears brittle. Stretching leadership across six companies risks systemic failure Musk’s portfolio is without precedent in modern corporate history. He is the owner and CEO of Tesla, SpaceX , Neuralink, xAI, The Boring Company, and X. Each of these demands persistent execution, high-stakes decision-making, and deep technological engagement. Tesla alone is navigating autonomous driving challenges, supply chain pressures, and cutthroat competition in the EV market . SpaceX is scaling Starship and managing a constellation of Starlink satellites. Neuralink recently entered human trials. Under such conditions, even the most capable leader risks diffusion. The physical demands of running one high-growth, technologically complex company are immense. Running six is a structural risk. Tesla shareholders have raised issues about this very dynamic. In early 2024, investor letters questioned Musk’s focus, particularly as political rhetoric and regulatory conflicts on X drew attention away from Tesla’s core innovation agenda. SpaceX insiders have reportedly expressed similar unease over reputational spillover from X. Nowhere is the strain more visible than at X itself. The May outage, reportedly caused by delayed server patching and misconfigured fallback systems, reflects technical debt and a lack of sustained executive oversight. Such failures are less likely in environments where leadership focuses on operational resilience. Slashing staff without a clear strategy has weakened X’s core operations Compounding the problem is X’s dramatic downsizing. Since Musk’s acquisition, the company has shed more than 80% of its workforce, including infrastructure specialists, product leads, and compliance personnel. Many of these were responsible for platform reliability, trust and safety, and regulatory alignment. Layoffs of this magnitude might have been manageable under a strategically phased reorganization. Instead, X has lurched from crisis to crisis. Product rollouts have lacked cohesion. Infrastructure appears brittle. Regulatory uncertainty is another concern, particularly as the company explores payments and financial services in tightly regulated jurisdictions. To dismiss Musk outright would be premature. His track record—disrupting the auto industry, commercializing spaceflight, and vertically integrating battery supply chains—is extraordinary. The same goes for his work ethic and eye for spotting top-tier talent. Some of Musk’s supporters argue that his model of leadership—visionary, high-leverage, selectively engaged—is sufficient if paired with strong deputies. That argument has merit. If X’s operations were led by a dedicated CEO accountable for execution and platform integrity, Musk’s focus could be confined to product vision and business alliances. There are also potential synergies across Musk’s companies. Starlink could enhance X’s market reach, xAI accelerates AI integration for content moderation or personalization, and Tesla’s payment expertise could support its financial infrastructure. Yet none of these synergies remove the need for consistent, hands-on leadership within X. The core challenge is not merely technological—it is managerial. Pursuing a super app vision requires more than Musk’s ambition Even with perfect leadership, X faces formidable barriers to super app status in the West. The regulatory environment in the U.S. and Europe is more fragmented and stringent than in China. Data privacy laws, antitrust scrutiny, and payment licensing regimes impose real constraints. Moreover, X faces entrenched competitors: Apple for payments, WhatsApp for messaging, and Amazon for commerce. In this context, building a Western WeChat is not just difficult; it may be structurally unviable. The ambition may be sound. The execution model, however, must evolve. X need not abandon its super app ambitions but must rethink how it pursues them. A platform that seeks to become the central hub for communication, finance, and commerce requires unbroken focus, deep operational expertise, and robust governance. Musk has proven himself an exceptional founder and visionary. However, the role of the platform’s steward, particularly at this stage of X’s evolution, may require different leadership. Adopting a nonexecutive chairman role could restore confidence and increase the odds of success. And in the end, no matter how compelling the vision is, it cannot replace presence. Super apps require more than innovation; they require constancy, precision, and trust. Without X closing the gap between ambition and leadership bandwidth, its super app hopes might not be more than a dream.

ADA has held strong above $0.68 and is now targeting $0.80, with bullish traders eyeing a breakout if momentum continues. Yet, while Cardano’s technical setup is promising, the real excitement is building around early-stage opportunities that promise far greater returns. Bitcoin’s recent rally above $112,000 has reignited institutional interest, with analysts now projecting possible targets of $131,000, $163,000, or even $200,000 if the current uptrend persists. Ethereum continues to trade above $2,500, supported by robust inflows and ongoing upgrades, but its near-term upside is seen as steady rather than explosive. In this context, the spotlight is shifting to high-upside altcoins where the risk/reward profile is more compelling. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Surge and 13,000% Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly distinguishing itself as the breakout presale of 2025 . With over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full, demand from both retail and institutional investors is surging. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling this momentum. Analysts are forecasting returns as high as 13,000%, with some models suggesting even greater upside if current trends continue. Early backers can still secure a 50% token bonus using the PATRIOT50X code before the $0.007 listing, making this one of the most attractive entry points in the market. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s unique blend of scarcity-driven tokenomics, strategic rollout, and community buzz is keeping it at the top of investor watchlists. As the presale window narrows, smart money is positioning early, recognizing MAGA as a leading altcoin contender for the coming cycle. Bitcoin (BTC): Macro Strength and Institutional Flows Bitcoin’s climb above $112,000 signals renewed confidence from institutional investors. Price targets now range from $130,000 to $200,000 if momentum continues. While BTC remains a foundational holding, its ROI potential is increasingly being matched—and even outpaced—by early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Hedera (HBAR): Steady Progress, MAGA Outpaces Hedera is trading near $0.25, with forecasts for 2025 suggesting a range of $0.24–$0.27. HBAR’s enterprise partnerships and technical upgrades are impressive, but its growth is more gradual compared to the rapid ascent of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Ethereum (ETH): Reliable Growth, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Ethereum holds above $2,500, benefiting from institutional adoption and ongoing ecosystem development. While ETH remains a core asset, analysts agree that the most dramatic growth potential now lies in early-stage plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion As Cardano tests major resistance, the most compelling growth story is unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 13,000% ROI, MAGA is the breakout opportunity to watch for 2025.

Why Qubetics ($TICS) Stands Out as the Best Crypto Presale to Join in 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/missing-the-xrp-boom-why-qubetics-tics-stands-out-as-the-best-crypto-presale-to-join-in-2025/,"The cryptocurrency market has experienced another wave of volatility, prompting a surge in demand for the best crypto presale to join in 2025. Recent regulatory developments and shifting sentiment have reshaped the digital asset landscape, creating both challenges and high-value openings. XRP’s dramatic price rally earlier this year now stands as a cautionary tale for latecomers. In this environment, identifying the best crypto presale to join has never been more critical—especially as platforms like Qubetics continue gaining momentum through real-world utility, robust tokenomics, and growing institutional interest. Among emerging projects, Qubetics ($TICS) has quickly risen to prominence as the best crypto presale to join, offering innovative blockchain solutions that address persistent challenges faced by predecessors like XRP. The token’s current presale price remains accessible, making Qubetics a compelling option for participation during this pivotal period. Understanding why Qubetics is regarded as the best crypto presale to join requires examining both its technological strengths and market positioning. XRP: A Historic Surge That Many Could Not Capitalize On XRP’s journey through 2023 and into 2024 has been nothing short of remarkable, highlighted by a spectacular price rally driven largely by renewed optimism over its ongoing legal battles and adoption prospects. At its peak, XRP captured significant market capitalization and early buyers attention, spurred by partnerships with global payment processors and financial institutions aiming to harness its fast settlement capabilities. Despite these highs, XRP’s earlier challenges, including regulatory scrutiny and competition from emerging blockchain solutions, slowed its momentum. The price rally created a significant barrier for latecomers, turning what could have been an accessible entry point into a missed opportunity for many. With XRP’s token value now stabilizing at levels well above its prior lows, entry costs have escalated, reducing the appeal for new acquisitions. Price predictions for XRP remain cautiously optimistic, with some analysts forecasting moderate gains driven by expanding use cases in cross-border payments and remittances. However, the once-low entry price has long since passed, leaving many to consider alternative cryptocurrencies with greater growth potential in the presale phase. Qubetics ($TICS): The Best Crypto Presale to Join with Real-World Solutions Qubetics has swiftly gained recognition as the best crypto presale to join in 2025, propelled by its cutting-edge blockchain ecosystem designed to address real-world challenges that predecessors like XRP struggled with. Entering its 36th crypto presale stage, Qubetics has already sold over 513 million tokens to more than 26,900 holders, raising $17.3 million—an indicator of significant market confidence. The $TICS token is priced at $0.3064 during this stage, making participation accessible while promising substantial upside based on analyst projections. After the crypto presale, the token is expected to reach $1, offering a 226% return on investment, with further predictions placing $TICS at $5 and $15 following the mainnet launch, equating to 1531% and 4794% ROI respectively. Qubetics’ strength lies in its robust interoperability and decentralized infrastructure, which aims to unify disparate blockchain networks and streamline cross-border transactions. This is a critical innovation, given the fragmentation observed in earlier crypto ecosystems. By enabling seamless interaction between various chains and assets, Qubetics positions itself as an enabler of global financial inclusion. Qubetics’ Application and Interoperability: Bridging Businesses and Individuals Qubetics’ approach to blockchain technology extends beyond simple transactional use. Its interoperability solutions offer tangible benefits across multiple sectors, directly addressing the inefficiencies that hindered earlier cryptocurrencies from widespread adoption. Businesses, especially those operating internationally, stand to gain from Qubetics’ cross-border transaction capabilities. For instance, an export-import company can leverage the Qubetics network to transfer funds instantly without the need for traditional intermediaries, reducing costs and settlement times drastically. This improvement accelerates trade cycles and increases liquidity flow in emerging markets. For professionals such as freelancers and remote workers, Qubetics offers a secure, transparent payment system that eliminates delays common with conventional banking systems. Receiving payments across borders becomes streamlined, ensuring prompt access to earnings and minimizing exchange rate risks. Individual users also benefit from enhanced privacy and security features, coupled with easy-to-use wallets that support multiple cryptocurrencies through a single interface. This democratizes access to digital assets, fostering broader participation in the crypto economy. This comprehensive utility is underpinned by the ongoing presale, where $TICS tokens remain attractively priced at $0.3064. The presale not only supports network expansion but also allows early adopters to secure positions ahead of anticipated price appreciation. Why Missing XRP’s Peak Amplifies the Urgency to Join Qubetics’ Presale The rapid ascent of XRP exemplifies the volatility and opportunity inherent in cryptocurrency markets. Those who missed acquiring XRP at lower prices now face significantly higher entry barriers. This context elevates the appeal of presales like Qubetics, which offer early access at accessible prices. Joining Qubetics’ presale means participation in a project that not only promises innovative technology but also addresses key shortcomings of prior platforms. The current token price combined with bullish analyst forecasts makes it arguably the best crypto presale to join in 2025. As the crypto ecosystem matures, the emphasis shifts towards projects that provide interoperability, real-world utility, and sustainable scalability. Qubetics aligns perfectly with these criteria, promising a viable path forward beyond speculative gains. Analyst Perspectives: Strong ROI Predictions Underpin Qubetics’ Potential Market analysts have underscored the promising trajectory of $TICS tokens, citing both the technology and community backing as drivers of expected price growth. The projected rise to $1 post-presale offers a near-term ROI exceeding 200%, while the potential surge to $15 post-mainnet indicates extraordinary long-term upside. These projections reflect confidence in Qubetics’ ability to deliver scalable solutions and to capitalize on growing demand for interoperable blockchain platforms. The token’s presale success further validates market appetite, setting it apart as the best crypto presale to join amid increasing competition. Such predictions should be considered with due diligence, but the combination of presale accessibility, rising adoption, and innovative features firmly situates Qubetics as a noteworthy candidate in the evolving crypto landscape. Conclusion: Timing Is Critical—Qubetics Emerges as the Best Crypto Presale to Join Based on thorough analysis, Qubetics represents the best crypto presale to join in 2025, especially for those seeking early exposure to blockchain interoperability and real-world applications. The missed window presented by XRP’s peak heightens the urgency for timely participation in presales like Qubetics. With $TICS tokens priced affordably during the 36th presale stage, combined with strong analyst forecasts, this project clearly stands out as the best crypto presale to join at present. Qubetics’ integration of advanced technology and practical business use cases positions it to redefine crypto adoption, solidifying its status as the best crypto presale to join before the mainnet launch. Taking advantage of this opportunity may prove decisive in capturing substantial future value within a rapidly maturing market.

He also blamed Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, for worsening the war with his public statements, and said Joe Biden’s actions fueled the disaster. “This is a war that would never have started if I were president,” Trump said. “This is Zelenskyy’s, Putin’s, and Biden’s war, not Trump’s.” According to a report from RuNews24.ru, Putin responded to Trump’s recent call for a 30-day ceasefire by launching 250 drones and 14 ballistic missiles into Kyiv and other cities on Friday night. Ukrainian officials reportedly said their forces intercepted nearly 100 drones near Moscow. Putin hides war budget as secret spending surges The Kremlin has buried nearly a third of its federal spending behind classified labels. Russia’s budget law from December mentions the word “secret” 39 times, as reported by RuNews24.ru. Yakov Yakubovich, from Russia’s National Research Nuclear University, said the classified chunk of the budget is 12.12 trillion rubles, or around $152 billion, making up 29.22% of total spending. Last year, that number was 11.1 trillion rubles or $121.19 billion, according to data published by Bloomberg. Yakubovich explained the funds are most likely being used for war-related infrastructure and operations in newly seized territories. He added that publishing this information could lead to more sanctions, which is why it’s being kept out of public view. The surge in secret spending comes as Europe struggles to meet Ukraine’s growing demand for military supplies. Zelenskyy confirmed that domestic weapons production is improving, but shortages of both manpower and equipment remain. Zelenskyy, in a statement Friday, said, “With every such strike, the world sees more clearly that it is Moscow that’s prolonging this war.” He called for tougher sanctions on Russia’s economy, warning that only more pressure would bring Putin to negotiate seriously. Washington debates pressure while Trump pushes diplomacy Marco Rubio, Trump’s Secretary of State, defended the administration’s approach in Senate testimony Tuesday. He said Ukraine is still receiving arms from the US and allies, even though the administration hasn’t requested new funding or tapped into fresh stockpiles. Rubio also said the European Union is finalizing additional sanctions while the US looks to obtain more Patriot missile systems from NATO allies. When asked if Trump is being manipulated by Putin, Rubio said that wasn’t true and insisted all sanctions from the Biden era remain active. He explained that Trump wants to avoid threatening new sanctions immediately, hoping to keep Russia engaged in talks. But those talks are falling apart fast. Putin didn’t show up personally for the recent negotiation session in Istanbul. Instead, a low-level delegation was sent to meet with Rubio, who was dispatched by Trump. In Washington, Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal introduced a new bill co-signed by 81 senators, warning that if Russia refuses to negotiate in good faith, the US will respond with direct sanctions. Graham said the Senate is prepared to slap a 500% tariff on any country, including China, that keeps buying Russian gas, oil, or uranium. He said Putin has only days to submit ceasefire terms. “If it is more of the same,” Graham said, “Russia can expect decisive action from the United States Senate.” Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s Foreign Minister, said Moscow’s terms will depend on the “root causes” of the war. He said Ukraine needs a new government, one that’s “legitimate,” before a real peace deal can happen. Russia still insists that Ukraine is part of its territory and calls Zelenskyy’s government corrupt and Nazi-run.

This surge in whale activity, combined with Bitcoin’s price stability around $68,000 and rising institutional inflows, signals renewed confidence in the broader crypto market. However, while Bitcoin and Ethereum remain foundational assets, the most aggressive capital is now rotating into early-stage, high-risk opportunities—none more prominent than MAGACOIN FINANCE. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Accumulation and 35x–40x Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the top high-risk allocation among crypto whales and early-stage investors. The project has raised over $8 million, with Stage 8 nearly full and a capped 100 billion token supply audited by HashEx. Notably, a single whale recently made a decisive 72.95 ETH purchase—valued at over $133,000—marking the largest early-stage buy of 2025 and signaling institutional-grade confidence in MAGA’s upside. Analysts are projecting 35x–40x returns from current entry levels, with some models suggesting even greater upside if momentum continues. The combination of scarcity-driven tokenomics, rapid presale sellouts, and strategic whale positioning is setting MAGACOIN FINANCE apart as the breakout high-risk play for Q3 and Q4 2025. Ethereum (ETH): Stability and Rotating Capital Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, supported by ongoing upgrades and robust institutional adoption. While ETH remains a core holding for most portfolios, the most aggressive capital is now flowing into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is far more compelling. TRUMP Coin: Volatility and Speculation TRUMP coin remains a speculative favorite, with forecasts for 2025 ranging widely from $35 to $300 depending on regulatory headlines and market sentiment. While the coin has benefited from political branding and periodic surges, its long-term value is more volatile than the structured, scarcity-driven approach of MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Bitcoin whales are quietly positioning for the next phase of the market, but it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that is capturing the most aggressive capital flows. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 40x ROI, MAGA stands as the top high-risk, high-reward opportunity for 2025.

After failing to hold a rally toward its old high of $3, the price once again dropped sharply. The coin recently hit $1.67 before falling back to around $0.77 at the time of writing. When Pi Coin was first listed, it started at $3 but quickly dropped to $0.60 on the same day. It managed to bounce back to $3 within 34 days, but this rise created strong selling pressure as early investors rushed to cash out. Many saw $3 as a good exit point, especially after the coin had previously fallen more than 80%.’ In terms of important price levels, Pi Coin is currently facing immediate resistance at $0.94, $1.20, and $1.66. If the price manages to break above these levels, the final bullish target in the short term remains at $3.00. On the downside, the critical support to watch is $0.65 — if the price falls below this level, it could lead to even steeper declines ahead. Upcoming Token Unlocks May Add More Pressure Adding to the concerns, a large number of Pi tokens are scheduled to unlock in the coming days, which could increase selling pressure: May 26: 10 million Pi will unlock May 27: 12 million Pi will unlock May 28: 15 million Pi will unlock — the biggest unlock in the next 30 days These large unlocks could add extra pressure on the price, as newly available tokens might be sold on the market. Positive Developments in the Pi Ecosystem Despite the price struggles, the Pi Network ecosystem is growing fast. According to analyst Kim Wong, there are now over 100 Pi-based decentralized apps (DApps), with some already live on the Mainnet, some being tested, and others still in development. Adding to the excitement, the recent launch of a $100 million Venture Fund is expected to help the growth of the Pi ecosystem even further. As more apps go live and adoption increases worldwide, Pi’s long-term potential continues to look bright. The network now boasts over 70 million users globally, including 20 million KYC-verified users and 4.3 million X (Twitter) followers. Pi Coin is also listed on several exchanges and ranks #26 by market cap among all cryptocurrencies.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-26 02:22:04

Coinbase investor Brady Nessler said in a May 22 lawsuit filed in a Pennsylvania federal court that the data breach and the alleged broken agreement with the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority resulted in a “precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s common shares,” causing stockholders to suffer “significant losses and damages.” Coinbase said on May 15 that its damages bill could run up to $400 million after it was hit with a $20 million extortion attempt four days earlier , with several of its customer support agents bribed to access internal systems and steal a limited amount of user account data. Nessler claimed Coinbase (COIN) shares dropped by 7.2% to close at $244 on May 15 as a result of the disclosure. However, the stock did stage a comeback, spiking 9% and hitting $266 by the closing bell on May 16, according to Google Finance. Coinbase stock closed down over 3% on May 23 at $263, falling another $1.62 after the bell. COIN is up nearly 6% so far this year. Coinbase is down from the May 23 trading session. Source: Google Finance Nessler’s complaint is seemingly the first to argue damages caused by Coinbase’s stock drop following its breach disclosure in a series of recent class-action lawsuits over the incident. The crypto exchange was hit with at least six lawsuits in the days after disclosing the data breach, all accusing it of mishandling the incident and failing to protect their data. UK agreement breach hurt stock, suit says The FCA fined Coinbase’s UK arm $4.5 million in July 2024 for breaching a 2020 voluntary agreement preventing the exchange from onboarding customers considered high risk by the regulator. The FCA said Coinbase onboarded 13,416 customers that the regulator considered high-risk and offered them crypto services . Related: Coinbase presses to axe rule banning SEC staff from holding crypto Nessler said in the suit that the fine saw Coinbase’s stock fall by over 5%, closing at $231.52 on July 25, 2024. Nessler also claimed that Coinbase didn’t disclose it had breached this agreement when the exchange first listed its shares on the Nasdaq in April 2021 , and as a result, “the market price of the Company’s securities had been artificially,” inflated. Nessler claims had she known about the agreement violation, she would not have purchased the stock at the “artificially inflated prices.” Coinbase did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The class suit was filed on behalf of anyone who bought Coinbase stock between April 14, 2021, and May 14, 2025, and is asking for damages and a jury trial. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and chief financial officer Alesia Haas are also named as defendants. Another lawsuit filed in Illinois on May 13, alleges Coinbase failed to notify users in writing of the collection , storage, or sharing of their biometric data and the purpose and retention schedule for their data.

This strategic collaboration brings together RYO Digital’s next-generation digital payment ecosystem and GRNX Global’s GrainX Protocol grain tokenization platform, creating unparalleled efficiency, transparency, and accessibility in global commodity trading.

GrainX Global will facilitate a seamless, traceable, and smart-contract-driven marketplace for Canadian grain exports, particularly to Japan’s multi-billion-dollar beer brewing industry. GrainX Protocol will provide new financial tools to facilitate faster farmer payments and lower cost grain buyer inventory lending, which will strengthen the agriculture financial ecosystem. Blockchain-backed lending pools will revolutionize trade finance, ensuring liquidity and reduced risk for producers, buyers, and traders alike.

With Injective (INJ) steady and XRP whales accumulating, both institutional and retail investors are zeroing in on MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Bitcoin as the top contenders to watch for Q3 2025’s breakout. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Moves, 50% Bonus, and Early-Stage Surge MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming 2025’s most-watched presale, with over $8 million raised and a record-setting 72.95 ETH whale buy marking the largest early-stage purchase of the year. The project’s capped supply, HashEx audit, and scarcity-driven tokenomics are driving unprecedented demand. Early buyers can still use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% bonus, making MAGA even more attractive for those seeking exponential upside. Analysts are projecting 25x–35x returns, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% if momentum continues. As Stage 8 nears completion, smart money is positioning ahead of listings, recognizing MAGACOIN FINANCE as a rare ground-floor opportunity before price discovery goes public. Bitcoin (BTC): Bullish Structure and Institutional Support Bitcoin is trading in the $110,000–$115,000 range, with technicals showing strong bullish momentum and support at $110K. The breakout above April’s highs has ended a long consolidation, and BTC is now in price discovery mode. Institutional inflows remain robust, and as long as BTC holds above $110K, analysts expect a push toward $112K–$115K in the coming sessions. This steady foundation is prompting investors to rotate some capital into higher-upside plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Whale Accumulation and Bullish Sentiment XRP is consolidating near $2.42, with recent whale transactions totaling over $300 million signaling confidence in the token’s future. The number of large XRP wallets has surged, reflecting growing influence from major investors. Analysts forecast a move toward $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks, with some bullish scenarios targeting $5.50 by year-end if momentum persists. As XRP holders seek sharper upside, many are reallocating to early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL) and Injective (INJ): Steady, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Solana is trading between $158 and $175, consolidating after a recent high near $183, with technicals suggesting a potential breakout if resistance is cleared. Injective is trading near $13, with price forecasts between $16 and $18 for 2025. However, both are being outpaced in sentiment and capital flows by the explosive momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion With Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana providing stability, the most dramatic growth potential is now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE. As Stage 8 nears completion and the 50% PATRIOT50X bonus remains, this may be the last low-entry window before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. For those seeking the next breakout, MAGA is the name to watch for Q3 2025.

Yet, the spotlight is now shifting to MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is building momentum with projections of up to 14,000% growth. With Bitcoin, Cardano, and Litecoin also in the mix, traders are watching a dynamic landscape where early-stage opportunities could deliver outsized returns. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE: Explosive Presale, 50% Bonus, and 14,000% Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the breakout presale of 2025 , with Stage 8 live and over $8 million already raised. The project’s capped supply, HashEx audit, and viral narrative are fueling unprecedented demand from both retail and institutional investors. Key reasons why MAGA is outpacing Solana and XRP in daily volume momentum: Record-Breaking Daily Volume: MAGA’s trading activity has eclipsed that of Solana and XRP, reflecting surging interest from new and seasoned traders alike. Scarcity Model: With a 100 billion token cap and 45% allocated to presale, a powerful supply squeeze is underway. Community Surge: Social metrics and engagement are at all-time highs, with MAGA now leading sentiment charts across major forums. 50% Bonus: Early backers can secure a 50% bonus using the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code before the $0.007 listing target. Analyst Forecasts: Returns of up to 14,000% are being projected, with some models suggesting even higher upside if current momentum continues. As each stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is solidifying its position as the top early-stage contender for the next cycle. Cardano (ADA), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin (BTC): Steady Progress, MAGA Steals the Spotlight Cardano is trading near $0.85, with forecasts for a move toward $1.00–$1.30 by year-end. Litecoin is holding above $90, with technicals pointing to a bullish continuation. Bitcoin remains the market’s anchor above $108,000, buoyed by robust institutional inflows. While all three assets offer stability and growth, their near-term upside is more measured compared to the explosive momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE . EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Conclusion Solana and XRP remain important players, but the most dramatic growth potential is now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With daily volume surging, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 14,000% ROI, MAGA is the breakout altcoin to watch as time runs out for early entry.

Five US banking groups led by the American Bankers Association asked the regulator to remove its rule in a May 22 letter , arguing that disclosing cybersecurity incidents “directly conflicts with confidential reporting requirements intended to protect critical infrastructure and warn potential victims.” The group, which also included the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the Bank Policy Institute, Independent Community Bankers of America and the Institute of International Bankers, claimed that the rule compromises regulatory efforts to enhance national cybersecurity. The SEC’s Cybersecurity Risk Management rule, published in July 2023, requires companies to rapidly disclose cybersecurity incidents such as data breaches or hacks. However, the banking groups argue this rule was flawed from the start and has proven problematic in practice since taking effect. The banking bodies said that the “complex and narrow disclosure delay mechanism” interferes with incident response and law enforcement and creates “market confusion” between mandatory and voluntary disclosures. Public disclosure has also been “weaponized as an extortion method by ransomware criminals to further malicious objectives,” and premature disclosures worsen insurance and liability issues for companies and “risks chilling candid internal communications and routine information sharing,” the group claimed. Some of the banking groups’ claims and fears regarding the ruling. Source: SIFMA The groups specifically want “Item 1.05” to be rescinded from the SEC’s rules for Form 8-K reporting and parallel reporting requirements applicable to Form 6-K. Form 8-K is used to publicly notify investors in US public companies of specified events, including cybersecurity incidents, that may be important to shareholders or the SEC. “Critically, without Item 1.05, investor interests will still be protected, and we believe they would be better served through the pre-existing disclosure framework for reporting material information, which may include material cybersecurity incidents,” the groups stated. Related: Hackers using fake Ledger Live app to steal seed phrases and drain crypto The full petition included examples of confusion from participants, specific incidents of ransomware attacks and documented regulatory conflicts. Public crypto companies impacted The requirement also impacts publicly listed crypto companies such as Coinbase, which disclosed earlier this month that hackers had bribed its support staff to leak its user data. The disclosure saw the company hit with at least seven lawsuits over the disclosure. Coinbase said that it rejected a $20 million ransom demand after staff leaked user data in a major phishing attack, which the exchange said could cost it up to $400 million in damages. If the SEC rescinds the requirement, it may give firms such as Coinbase more time to disclose cybersecurity incidents to the public.

Bitcoin to Lead the Pack Siemer said that for the rest of the year, it will still be a Bitcoin-dominated market, driven by institutional adoption. “No institutions are buying anything but Bitcoin right now,” he said, while adding that Ethereum has begun to see some institutional interest. XRP: Can It Break Its All-Time High? When asked about XRP’s price outlook, Siemer hinted at upcoming developments that could fuel a rally. While remaining tight-lipped, he expressed confidence in the XRP community’s strength. “The army is real,” he said, adding that consistent buying from loyal holders could help XRP revisit its previous all-time high of around $3.50. “I think XRP could hit an all-time high,” Siemer predicted, calling the possibility realistic in the current market environment. Solana: All-Time High Possible Despite Sell Pressure Solana (SOL) has been one of 2025’s most talked-about tokens — and for good reason. According to Siemer, Solana’s recent memecoin mania, growing DeFi sector, and network upgrades set it up for new highs. However, he has observed one lingering challenge: ongoing token unlocks linked to the FTX bankruptcy estate, which could keep applying sell pressure for another couple of years. Despite that, Siemer believes Solana could hit new all-time highs, calling its current setup “really strong.” Smart Contract Blockchain Race Far From Over Siemer also addressed the broader Layer 1 smart contract blockchain race, predicting that no single winner will emerge. “There’s not going to be a winner — there’s going to be winners,” he said, explaining how even the traditional software industry thrives with thousands of viable companies.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|SOL|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-26 03:36:21

Solana is consolidating near $170, with recent technical signals suggesting a pause in its previous uptrend. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is holding firm above $108,000, serving as the market’s anchor but showing more restrained upside as capital looks for higher returns elsewhere. In this climate, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly rising as the early-stage favorite, with analysts spotlighting its potential for massive gains in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Surge and 13,800%+ Upside Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is dominating the early-stage conversation, with Stage 8 nearly sold out and over $8 million raised. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are drawing both retail and institutional buyers in droves. Analysts are projecting up to 40x returns, with some models suggesting an incredible 13,800% upside if current momentum continues. Early adopters can still take advantage of the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% bonus before the $0.007 listing, making MAGA the go-to allocation for those seeking exponential returns before listings trigger the next price discovery phase. As each stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting a new standard for early-stage altcoin excitement. Ethereum (ETH): Steady Growth, Slower Upside Ethereum continues to be a core holding for many, with bullish technicals but a more measured growth outlook. While ETH’s fundamentals remain strong, its near-term returns are being outpaced by the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL): Consolidation, MAGA Grabs Attention Solana is trading between $158 and $175, with analysts watching for a potential breakout if sentiment improves. However, the sharpest capital rotation is now favoring early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. SUI: Gradual Progress, MAGA Outpaces SUI is forecast to reach $5.57 in 2025, offering steady growth, but its trajectory is far outstripped by the rapid accumulation and upside potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion While Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin maintain their foundational roles, the most dramatic growth potential is now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 13,800% ROI, MAGA is the breakout contender for 2025.

Bitcoin (BTC): Macro Foundation and Steady Growth Bitcoin is consolidating above $108,000, with analysts eyeing $110,000–$115,000 as the next major milestones. While BTC’s status as the market anchor remains unchallenged, its upside from here is increasingly seen as steady rather than explosive—prompting many investors to seek higher-multiple opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Cardano (ADA): Gradual Progress, MAGA Takes the Lead Cardano is trading near $0.85, with forecasts for a move toward $1.00–$1.30 by year-end if positive sentiment holds.

Johnson told CNN’s Jake Tapper on May 25 that he knew nothing about Trump’s May 22 memecoin dinner and opted not to share his opinion on the event, which 35 House Democrats have called for the Justice Department to investigate. “We do not know who was there. The list has not been released. We do not know how much of the money came from outside the country,” Tapper told Johnson. “I really have a difficult time imagining that if this was a Democratic president doing the exact same thing, you wouldn't be outraged.” “Look, I don't know anything about the dinner,” Johnson answered, claiming he “was a little busy this past week,” focusing on passing a $1.6 trillion federal budget funding bill. “I'm not going to comment on something I haven't even heard about. I'm not sure who was there or what the purpose was.” Johnson then claimed Trump was “the most transparent president” in history and “has nothing to hide.” CNN’s Jake Tapper (left) speaking with House Speaker Mike Johnson (right). Source: CNN Democrats have called for the list of attendees of Trump’s crypto dinner event to be released, as they suspect Trump may be accepting foreign investments in violation of federal bribery statutes or the foreign emoluments clause of the Constitution. Under the emoluments clause, the US president is barred from accepting any gift from a foreign state without the approval of Congress. Bloomberg reported on May 7 that a majority of the attendees at the memecoin dinner would likely be foreign nationals. Trump invited those who were among the top 220 largest holders of the Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin to his event at the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia. The most notable attendee was the Chinese-born Tron CEO Justin Sun, the largest holder of the TRUMP token and the biggest backer of the Trumps’ crypto platform World Liberty Financial. Sheldon Xia, the CEO of Cayman Islands-based crypto exchange BitMart, posted pictures to X of himself at the event, while Australian crypto entrepreneur Kain Warwick told The New York Times on May 12 that he would attend the event after stocking up on enough TRUMP to break into the top 25 investors on the leaderboard. In a separate May 22 press conference, several Democrats called for the release of Trump’s memecoin dinner list. One of those speaking was Senator Elizabeth Warren, a fierce crypto critic who called Trump’s memecoin dinner an “orgy of corruption.” Democrats call for Trump to cut crypto ties entirely Several House Democrats, led by Maxine Waters, introduced the ""Stop TRUMP in Crypto Act"" on May 22 to prevent Trump and his family from profiting off crypto while in office. Trump has used the “power of the presidency to shamelessly promote and profit” from a series of crypto ventures, Waters said in a statement. Related: Senators plan to amend GENIUS Act to address Trump family's stablecoin Waters pointed to the TRUMP memecoin, which she claims has increased Trump’s net worth by over $350 million, as well as his involvement in World Liberty Financial and the platform’s stablecoin, USD1.

The price is now showing positive signs and might aim for more gains in the near term. BNB price is attempting to recover from the $655 support zone. The price is now trading below $675 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $665 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $660 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Eyes Steady Gains After forming a base above the $652 level, BNB price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $655 and $665 resistance levels, like Ethereum and Bitcoin . There was a decent move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $691 swing high to the $653 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $665 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $675 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $672 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $691 swing high to the $653 low. The next resistance sits near the $677 level. A clear move above the $677 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $680. A close above the $680 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $685 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $700 level in the near term. Another Decline?

Late on Sunday, May 25, Trump announced that he was extending the deadline for a 50% tariff on the European Union until July 9. He previously said the tariffs would come into effect on June 1. “I received a call today from Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, requesting an extension on the June 1st deadline on the 50% Tariff with respect to Trade and the European Union,” he posted on his social media platform, Truth Social. “I agreed to the extension,” he said before adding, “It was my privilege to do so.” Tariff Flipflops Cause Market Turmoil On May 26, the European Commission President said Europe is ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively, adding, “To reach a good deal, we would need the time until July 9.” Good call with @POTUS . The EU and US share the world’s most consequential and close trade relationship. Europe is ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively. To reach a good deal, we would need the time until July 9. — Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) May 25, 2025 Whether intentionally or not, Trump has caused major market volatility and turmoil recently with his constant changing of tariff policies and dates. This has left nations and investors in limbo as to what is really going on and when or if deals can be made. The only deal made so far is with the United Kingdom. “The European Union, which was formed for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the United States on TRADE, has been very difficult to deal with,” Trump said just days before, on May 23. “Our discussions with them are going nowhere,” he said while proposing 50% tariffs on EU goods. The United States is the EU’s largest trading partner. It purchases 21% of its exports, the leading one being pharmaceuticals, with other exports including vehicles, aircraft, engines and motors, machinery, petroleum oils, and alcoholic beverages, according to EU data. Crypto Market Reaction Crypto markets fell late last week, dropping 4% from their multi-month high as tariff tensions rose again. Total capitalization is currently $3.56 trillion, having gained 2.5% over the past 12 hours since Trump’s latest tariff u-turn. However, there could be more volatility in store this week with GDP and inflation data due in the United States. Bitcoin, which has dominated sentiment recently, was up 1.5% on the day, trading at $109,650 at the time of writing, recovering from a weekend low of $106,800, according to Coingecko.

45106432,https://cryptonews.com/?p=364647,1748235400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/45106432.jpeg,Bitcoin Tops $109K as Trump Extends EU Tariff Deadline,https://cryptonews.com/news/trump-pushes-back-eu-tariffs-bitcoin-breaks-109k/,"Bitcoin rose above $109,600 on Monday, rising 1.4% after US President Donald Trump unexpectedly extended a deadline to impose steep tariffs on EU goods, easing market concerns and supporting risk assets. The surge followed Trump’s decision late Sunday to push back the potential introduction of 50% tariffs on EU imports to July 9. Just two days earlier, the president had threatened to enact the tariffs by June 1 due to slow progress in trade negotiations with the EU. Trump Tariff Delay Signals Possible Thaw in US-EU Trade Tensions The delay followed a productive call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who sought additional time to secure a favorable agreement. This de-escalation reduced fears of an imminent trade war, which had previously weighed on global markets. Last month, Trump announced an initial 20% tariff on EU goods, but soon revised it to 10% with a grace period until early July. The shifting timeline reflects the administration’s unpredictable trade strategy, which has continued to rattle global markets. However, investors welcomed the latest reprieve, viewing it as a sign of possible resolution and improved dialogue between Washington and Brussels. Market sentiment had already begun to stabilize after a volatile stretch in April, when growth fears and aggressive trade posturing prompted a broad sell-off across asset classes. Analysts say the pause in tariff escalation has helped lift appetite for risk, leading traders to rotate into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Hit ATH Above $111K on ETF Momentum and Risk-On Sentiment The move in Bitcoin is also tied to broader structural demand. Last week, the asset briefly touched a record high of $111,814 , buoyed by continued inflows from exchange-traded funds and corporate investors. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net weekly inflows of $2.75b between May 19 and May 23, according to data provider SoSoValue . Ethereum ETFs posted $248m in inflows during the same period, with no outflows across the board. Over the past 18 months, Bitcoin has outpaced the S&P 500 by more than 100 percentage points, cementing its role as a high-beta asset that draws capital during risk-on cycles. Investors have increasingly followed the lead of corporate buyers like MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, who helped normalize large-scale Bitcoin accumulation among institutions. Monday’s rally serves as a reminder of how sensitive Bitcoin remains to macroeconomic developments, particularly shifts in US trade policy. While the de-escalation offered immediate relief, market participants remain cautious, mindful of how quickly sentiment can reverse in response to the next political move.

Both cases show the increasing tension between decentralized technologies and established legal systems, raising questions about the evolving relationship between law, jurisdiction, and digital rights. Mango Markets Hacker Acquitted of Fraud Charges in Major Legal Setback for DOJ A US judge has thrown out key fraud convictions against Avraham Eisenberg, the trader accused of orchestrating a $110 million exploit of decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Mango Markets. The ruling is a significant development in one of crypto's most closely watched courtroom battles, raising pressing questions about jurisdiction, legal definitions of fraud, and the limits of regulation in decentralized finance. Judge Arun Subramanian of the Southern District of New York ruled Friday that Eisenberg could not be convicted in the venue where the case was brought, vacating two counts of fraud and acquitting him of a third, wire fraud-related charge. The judge found that prosecutors failed to establish sufficient ties between Eisenberg’s actions and the jurisdiction of the New York court. In a sharply worded opinion, Judge Subramanian said prosecutors could not prove that Eisenberg, who was operating from Puerto Rico at the time of the incident, had any actionable connection to New York. ”He didn't make trades in New York, call or email anyone in New York, or go to New York in connection with his scheme,” Subramanian wrote. “There is no allegation that the Mango Markets platform had ties to New York.” The Department of Justice had previously argued that Eisenberg’s use of an automated trading platform hosted on servers based in New York, along with the fact that at least one Mango Markets user from New York attempted to withdraw funds during the incident, should qualify as sufficient grounds for venue. But Subramanian found those arguments lacking, determining that the evidence presented at trial fell short of establishing venue under constitutional and statutory standards. Even more striking was the judge’s decision to acquit Eisenberg on a third count, wire fraud, not only due to venue issues but also on substantive grounds. Eisenberg’s trading activity, which involved manipulating Mango’s price oracle to inflate the value of his collateral before taking out massive loans, was not found to violate existing wire fraud statutes. “On a platform with no rules, instructions, or prohibitions about borrowing, the government needed more to show that Eisenberg made an implicit misrepresentation by allowing the algorithm to measure the actual value of his collateral,” Subramanian wrote. Eisenberg had defended his actions as legal, arguing that he simply executed a well-designed arbitrage strategy on a poorly architected platform. His legal team consistently maintained that no formal guidelines or safeguards were in place to prevent the strategy he used. A Blow to Prosecutors—and a Warning About DeFi Regulation The outcome represents a serious blow to federal prosecutors, who had aimed to set a precedent in holding individuals accountable for manipulation on decentralized protocols. With Mango Markets operating as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and its codebase open to all, Eisenberg’s case has served as a bellwether for how US law might be applied to DeFi platforms. Legal experts are divided on the implications. Some argue the ruling highlights the urgent need for updated regulations that reflect the structure and behavior of decentralized platforms. Others see it as a cautionary tale for regulators attempting to apply legacy legal frameworks to crypto-native environments. While Eisenberg may have sidestepped a major legal challenge tied to the Mango exploit, he is not free of legal jeopardy. In April, he was sentenced to four years in prison for possession of child sexual abuse material, an unrelated charge that carries serious consequences. That conviction stands independently of his activity in the crypto markets. Now, Justice Department officials must determine whether to refile charges related to Mango Markets in a more appropriate venue. Given the complexity of DeFi operations and the ambiguity in current law, that decision could have far-reaching implications. The case also comes amid the backdrop of Mango Markets' own demise. Once seen as a promising DeFi protocol built on the Solana blockchain, the platform officially ceased operations earlier this year following a string of controversies, governance disputes, and ongoing litigation. The Eisenberg exploit in October 2022 was widely blamed for hastening the platform’s decline. After draining over $100 million in value from the protocol, Eisenberg briefly returned a portion of the funds under a governance agreement with Mango’s DAO, only to later be arrested in Puerto Rico by US authorities. Pavel Durov Barred from Oslo Freedom Forum by French Court Amid Free Speech Dispute In other legal news, Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov, a prominent voice for digital privacy and freedom of speech, will no longer attend the Oslo Freedom Forum in person after French courts denied his request to travel to Norway. The decision has stirred backlash among free speech advocates, especially amid escalating concerns over political censorship in Europe. Durov, who resides in France, had been slated to headline the Oslo Freedom Forum, which is an influential global event organized by the Human Rights Foundation (HRF), with a keynote speech championing individual liberty and resistance to authoritarian overreach. While he will still appear virtually via livestream, his absence from the physical stage has sparked questions about the motivations behind the travel restriction and broader implications for dissent in the tech world. Human Rights Foundation Condemns Travel Ban The HRF publicly criticized the French judiciary’s move, calling it an affront to the ideals the forum seeks to uphold. “It is unfortunate that French courts would block Mr. Durov from participating in an event where his voice is so needed,” said HRF founder and CEO Thor Halvorssen in a statement released over the weekend. The Oslo Freedom Forum is known for convening dissidents, journalists, activists, and technologists committed to the cause of human rights. Durov, widely viewed as one of the tech industry's most uncompromising advocates for privacy and decentralization, has been a regular figure at such events. The controversy over Durov’s travel ban comes just days after the Telegram founder accused French intelligence services of pressuring him to censor conservative political content on Telegram ahead of Romania’s upcoming elections. According to a Telegram post on May 18, Durov described a private meeting in Paris where Nicolas Lerner, head of France’s General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI), allegedly made the request. “This spring at the Salon des Batailles, in the Hôtel de Crillon, Nicolas Lerner, head of French intelligence, asked me to ban conservative voices in Romania ahead of elections. I refused,” Durov wrote in a follow-up post on X. “We didn’t block protesters in Russia, Belarus, or Iran. We won’t start doing it in Europe.” Though initially vague about the official and the country involved, Durov’s direct accusation against Lerner has since reverberated through tech and policy circles, particularly in the context of increasing government scrutiny over encrypted messaging platforms and their role in electoral integrity. In his May 18 Telegram post, Durov pushed back against what he described as the hypocrisy of European officials attempting to justify censorship in the name of democracy. Durov has previously stated that if pressured to implement political censorship or surveillance measures, Telegram would exit the affected market rather than compromise its users’ rights. This stance has earned him both praise and criticism from governments around the world. Legal and Political Fallout in France The travel ban has fueled speculation that French authorities may be retaliating against Durov’s refusal to cooperate with intelligence demands. Legal experts note that while Durov’s legal issues in France have not been made public in detail, the move to bar him from attending a human rights forum abroad is “highly unusual” and potentially politically motivated. Durov’s allegations and the French court's ruling come at a sensitive time for the European Union, which has been intensifying its regulatory oversight of tech platforms under the Digital Services Act (DSA). The legislation mandates stricter content moderation practices and imposes penalties for platforms deemed to enable misinformation, hate speech, or election interference. While the DSA aims to protect users and uphold democratic norms, critics argue it grants governments excessive leverage over platform content and opens the door to politically biased censorship. Durov’s claims suggest that such powers may already be used to manipulate political narratives. Telegram, which boasts over 900 million users globally, has emerged as a critical tool for activists and dissidents across authoritarian regimes. Its refusal to compromise on encryption and user privacy has placed it at odds with authorities in countries such as Russia, Iran, and now, seemingly, within the European Union.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-26 05:00:00

Institutional inflows and technical support continue to underpin BTC’s dominance, but the most dynamic capital is now rotating into early-stage projects with outsized upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the standout in this cycle, drawing increasing attention from analysts and traders who see it as the next major breakout. Ethereum, Solana, and Toncoin remain in the conversation, but MAGA’s momentum is capturing the spotlight in smart money circles. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Momentum and 11,000%+ Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting a new standard for early-stage altcoins, with Stage 8 nearly full and over $8 million raised as demand continues to accelerate. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling a surge in both retail and institutional participation. Analysts are now projecting 35x–50x returns as a conservative baseline, with some models targeting up to 11,000%–18,500% upside if the current trajectory holds. Early buyers can still leverage the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% bonus before the $0.007 listing, making MAGA the go-to allocation for those seeking exponential gains. As each stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is solidifying its reputation as the breakout early-stage opportunity of 2025. Ethereum (ETH): Steady Growth, MAGA Accelerates Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, supported by bullish technicals and robust institutional adoption. While ETH’s long-term prospects remain strong, its near-term growth is now more measured compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL): Bullish Structure, MAGA Outshines Solana is trading around $170, with analysts watching for a breakout above $175 to retest $183 and potentially higher. Despite SOL’s strong fundamentals and ecosystem expansion, the sharpest capital rotation is now moving toward early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Toncoin (TON): Quiet Progress, MAGA Leads Toncoin continues to make incremental gains, but its near-term upside is overshadowed by the presale-driven surge and community buzz of MAGACOIN FINANCE. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Conclusion Bitcoin’s stability and blue-chip altcoins like Ethereum and Solana offer reassurance, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is where the most dramatic growth potential is now unfolding. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 11,000% ROI, MAGA is the breakout altcoin to watch for 2025.

The modest recovery comes after a volatile week in which Bitcoin ( BTC ) briefly reached an all-time high of $111,814 on May 22 before falling to about $107,500. The asset is still up by 15% in the last 30 days. Derivatives of Bitcoin also saw an increase in market activity. Data Coinglass shows that 24-hour open interest increased 2.59% to $76.66 billion, while trading volume increased 10.85% to $89.91 billion. Rising derivatives volume and open interest usually indicate renewed trader confidence and a build -up of positions, frequently in anticipation of volatility or upward price movement. The rebound came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Sunday, May 25, that he had agreed to extend a June 1 deadline for imposing 50% tariffs on EU goods. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had requested more time for trade talks and a new deadline has been set for July 9. “I received a call today from Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, requesting an extension on the June 1st deadline on the 50% Tariff with respect to Trade and the European Union. I agreed to the extension — July 9, 2025 — It was my privilege to do so.” — U.S. President Donald Trump You might also like: Bitcoin bottleneck: Demand outmints supply, who’s to blame? The announcement followed a brief period of tension. Global markets were alarmed when Trump threatened to implement the 50% tariffs on May 23 if negotiations failed. For the time being, the abrupt reversal has provided some reprieve. Financial markets responded positively to the decision, with U.S. equity futures edging higher. S&P 500 futures gained 0.9%, Dow futures rose 0.8%, and Nasdaq-100 futures were up 1% in early Monday trading. Gold, meanwhile, dipped 0.3% to $3,346.59 an ounce. As risk appetite improves, the decline in gold prices points to a move away from conventional safe-havens. This change in sentiment has helped Bitcoin, which is frequently seen as a speculative risk asset. In the meantime, traders have been able to temporarily reset expectations thanks to the de-escalation, although Trump’s trade policies are still causing uncertainty in international markets. Both the cryptocurrency and traditional markets will be keeping an eye on any new developments in the U.S.-EU negotiations now that the July deadline has been set.

But despite the bullish momentum, there are signs that the rally may be hitting a wall. The $2,800 level is emerging as a critical zone of resistance, and a closer look at on-chain and technical data suggests that selling pressure could rise as Ethereum ( ETH ) inches closer to it. According to a May 24 post by Glassnode, there’s a notable cluster of investor cost basis levels around $2,800. This means that many holders who previously bought at that level, and have been underwater for months, may now see a chance to exit at break-even. As ETH approaches this zone, those investors could add significant sell-side pressure to the market. https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1926171433639489555?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw Adding to the caution, sentiment in the futures market appears to be shifting. In a May 25 post , Santiment contributor ShayanMarkets noted a sharp drop in Ethereum’s Taker Buy-Sell Ratio, a metric that tracks whether aggressive market participants are leaning more toward buying or selling. The 14-day moving average for the ratio is falling, indicating that the derivatives market is being taken over by sellers. This could point to a more substantial correction if the trend continues.

The token is still trading above all significant short- and mid-term moving averages on the daily chart, an overall bullish sign. Since ETH is also trading above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, the longer-term trend appears to be healthy as well. ETH price analysis. Credit: crypto.news But there are indications that the rally is cooling. Following a strong expansion earlier this month, the Bollinger Bands have begun to tighten, indicating that volatility may be easing. Ethereum is currently trading near the midline of the Bollinger Band, indicating that the market is undecided. At roughly 63.9, the relative strength index is holding steady in bullish territory, but it is no longer overbought. However, the moving average convergence divergence has begun to flatten out and just displayed a bearish crossover, which may be an early warning sign of the waning momentum. From here, two scenarios could possible play out. If the $2,800 resistance breaks convincingly, especially with the SEC’s decision on staking of Ethereum ETFs due by June 1, ETH could make a quick move toward $3,000 and beyond. Institutional demand through yield-bearing ETFs would be a powerful tailwind. However, if selling pressure builds up around $2,800, particularly from aggressive futures traders and break-even sellers, Ethereum might undergo a healthy correction and perhaps bounce back to the $2,200 support before any new leg higher. Ethereum’s upward trend is still in place for the time being, but caution is advised.

Despite recent legal uncertainty, the token has been trading within a narrow weekly range of $2.29 to $2.47, up 7% over the last month, and 1.4% over the previous day. CoinGlass data shows that open interest rose 2.25% to $4.76 billion and XRP ( XRP ) derivatives trading volume increased 25.82% to $3.14 billion over the last day, indicating increased speculative activity and renewed trader positioning. Spot trading volume also jumped 40 to $1.86 billion, reflecting rising interest in XRP. Much of that attention now turns to the SEC’s closed-door meeting, which could revive settlement talks with Ripple. Tensions escalated earlier this month when Judge Analisa Torres rejected the SEC’s attempt to modify her final ruling by lifting XRP’s institutional sales ban and reducing Ripple’s $125 million penalty. Following the rejection on May 15, XRP fell from $2.65 to $2.26, showing increased investor anxiety. Thursday’s meeting may provide the quorum needed to resume negotiations. Legal analysts, including pro-XRP attorney John Deaton, believe the SEC would need to acknowledge XRP as a commodity for progress to be made, a move that could reshape the legal landscape and boost institutional confidence.

The appeals court could also toss out the SEC’s case on procedural grounds, though that remains unlikely. On the technical front, XRP is in a state of indecision. At 51, the relative strength index indicates neutral momentum. The stochastic oscillator shows short-term upside potential with a possible buy signal from oversold levels. But the moving average convergence divergence is still a little bearish. XRP price analysis. Credit: crypto.news Meanwhile, Bollinger Bands are getting tighter around the current price, suggesting that a bigger move might be on the horizon. While a decline below support could pave the way for additional downside, a break above the upper band might spark fresh bullish momentum. XRP is still trading above important long-term moving averages despite mixed short-term signals. This shows that the deeper structural support is still intact. The token may return to $2.65 if it breaks above $2.47, but it runs the risk of continuing the correction toward $2.20 if it falls below $2.29. For now, XRP remains stuck in a tight range, awaiting its next big catalyst.

Nvidia plans to start mass production of the new AI chips in June, which will be part of the firm’s latest generation of AI chips, Reuters reported on May 26, citing people familiar with the matter. The company plans to sell it for between $6,500 and $8,000 owing to its lower specifications and simple manufacturing requirements — cheaper than the some $10,000 to $12,000 Nvidia’s recently restricted H20 model sold for. An Nvidia spokesperson told Reuters it was still evaluating the company’s limited options. “Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the US government, we are effectively foreclosed from China’s $50 billion data center market,” they said. China is a massive market for the chipmaker, accounting for 13% of its sales in the past financial year. In April, the US government informed Nvidia that export licenses were required for its popular H20 chips. The restrictions specifically mentioned China, and the government cited concern over the risk that the technology “may be used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China.” According to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, its market share in China has plummeted from 95% before 2022, when US export restrictions first impacted its products, to 50% currently. Jensen Huang on Taiwanese TV. Source: Yahoo/TVBS “We will continue to make tremendous efforts to optimize compliant products and continue serving the Chinese market,” he said on Taiwanese TV last week. It is the company’s third attempt to create China-compliant chips, and the new chip is designed to meet current US bandwidth limits of 1.7 terabytes per second. Related: Anthropic debuts most powerful AI yet amid ‘whistleblowing’ controversy Nvidia’s main rival is Shenzhen-based Huawei, which is testing and preparing to ship a new AI chip called the Ascend 910D . Nvidia earnings eagerly awaited The news comes a couple of days before the firm is due to release its quarterly earnings report, which is due on May 28. The chip manufacturer’s stock finished last week down around 3%, breaking a streak of four straight weekly gains. Analysts on average expect Nvidia to report quarterly revenue of $43.4 billion, 66% higher year-over-year, and adjusted net income of $21.3 billion, according to Investopedia. “We see upside … despite the loss of H20 sales to China,” said Oppenheimer analysts.

Bessent, now the CEO of Key Square Group, believes that U.S.-backed stablecoins could create a massive $2 trillion demand for U.S. Treasuries, a move that could reshape global finance and strengthen the U.S. dollar’s dominance. “We are going big on digital assets,” Bessent said. He explained that the current U.S. administration is focused on creating clear rules for digital assets and encouraging companies to stay and build in the country. This is a big shift from past policies, which Bessent says drove many crypto businesses overseas. Stablecoins Could Become Top Buyers of U.S. Treasuries According to Bessent, bringing strong U.S. regulations and anti-money laundering (AML) standards to stablecoins is a top priority. He also mentioned market estimates suggesting that stablecoin issuers could soon hold around $2 trillion in U.S. Treasuries and T-bills — a huge jump from the current $300 billion. This prediction lines up with a recent comment from Senator Bill Hagerty, who shared a Citibank report forecasting that by 2030, stablecoin issuers could become the biggest buyers of U.S. Treasuries, even ahead of major foreign countries like China. This view is also shared by other top financial leaders, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who has called tokenization the future of finance. Scott Bessent says a bank issued stablecoin could provide $2 trillion worth of demand for U.S. Treasuries. He doesn't confirm or deny the rumor that $JPM , $BAC , $C and $WFC are planning to issue a shared crypto stablecoin authorized by the Federal Reserve. https://t.co/KxCnExG7HM pic.twitter.com/OH8MwHQDJW — Financelot (@FinanceLancelot) May 24, 2025 A new U.S. stablecoin bill is on track to pass the Senate, marking a step toward establishing formal regulations for the crypto industry.

In the event of a collapse, stablecoin holders would have priority in recovering their funds.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $5.75. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $1.14 Market cap $1.14B Trading volume $472.79M Circulating supply 998.84M WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.000023 on November 2023 24-hour high $1.18 24-hour low $1.02 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 27.39% 50-day SMA $0.671 14-Day RSI 64.10 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $1.288 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis: WIF sees short-term gains, but consolidation persists TL;DR Breakdown WIF is up 3.7% today. Bulls might try to regain control if the price holds above $1.19. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF shows signs of consolidation The WIF/USDT price analysis for May 26 shows a slight uptrend, recently gaining 3.7%. WIF is testing resistance at $1.19, which may cause a pause or consolidation. The RSI is at 66.04, nearing overbought levels, signaling the possibility of a full-blown price pullback. Likewise, the MACD shows bearish momentum, with the MACD line below the signal line, but the gap between them is narrow, indicating price consolidation. WIF shows signs of consolidation Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: WIF sees short-term gains The 4-hour chart shows a bullish trend with the Alligator Indicator aligned positively. The OBV is also rising, confirming the short-term price increase is backed by strong volume. Likewise, the Balance of Power reads 0.40, showing positive buying pressure.

In the short term, the WIF price analysis shows price gains, even though the broader perspective reflects consolidation, suggesting that the next sell point could be around resistance at $1.19. A break above this level could push WIF towards $1.33. Should the bears take over the market, the $1 support level becomes critical. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1 by the end of 2025 and about $3 to $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

WIF began 2024 at $0.15, surged past $0.5 in January, and hit its ATH of $4.85 by March’s end after strong bullish momentum. The token fell to $1.95 in April, consolidating between $2 and $4 until May, but dropped to $1.48 in June amidst bearish pressure.

Rising bond yields and political tensions have pushed institutional investors toward Bitcoin as a hedge. Technically, BTC sits at a key decision point, facing resistance near $110,000 and support around $107,500. Meanwhile, on-chain data shows short-term holders beginning to exit, hinting that the current bull run may be approaching its peak. Looking at the market scenario, in a recent X post, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki declared that Bitcoin is making it “so easy” to get rich, yet most people still don’t see it. He pointed out that even owning just 0.01 BTC could be “priceless” in the next two years. Having said that, Kiyosaki is confident that Bitcoin’s window of opportunity is closing fast, and sitting on the sidelines could be the costliest mistake. I cannot believe how easy Bitcoin has made getting rich…so easy. Why everyone is not buying and holding Bitcoin is beyond me. Even .01 of a Bitcoin is going to be priceless in two years…. and maybe make you very rich. Sure Bitcoin goes up and down….but so does real life.… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) May 26, 2025 Bitcoin Scarcity is Real Kiyosaki has been a longtime believer in Bitcoin’s potential . He sees it as a secure hedge against government manipulation and inflation, thanks to its fixed supply and decentralized nature. According to Kiyosaki, there are only 1 to 2 million Bitcoins left to be mined. Once those are gone, the fixed supply of 21 million will cap forever. This built-in scarcity is a key factor behind his bullish outlook. Recently, he predicted that Bitcoin could reach $250,000 this year . Referencing macro investor Raoul Pal’s theory of the “Banana Zone,” he believes BTC could soon enter a parabolic phase of growth fueled by tight supply and growing demand. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : ETH, XRP, BNB & SOL: Which Altcoin Could Outperform in 2025? , Don’t Be a “Yellow Banana” Several prominent analysts echo Kiyosaki’s views. Raoul Pal sees macroeconomic conditions aligning perfectly for Bitcoin’s next surge. Michael Saylor continues to push the digital gold narrative, with MicroStrategy regularly adding BTC to its balance sheet. Anthony Pompliano also predicts a long-term uptrend driven by increasing institutional involvement and limited supply. In typical Kiyosaki style, he warns against being a “yellow banana”, his metaphor for those too afraid or unaware to act. He urges early investors to listen to experts like Raoul Pal and follow educational sources like Bitcoin Zella. As Kiyosaki puts it, this may be “the easiest time in history” to achieve financial freedom. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The capital, secured through convertible loans, will enable H100 to purchase about 20.18 Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor teased another Bitcoin purchase after the firm’s recent acquisition of 7,390 BTC. Additionally, Cardone Capital launched its fourth hybrid real estate and Bitcoin fund, aiming to redefine asset diversification by blending commercial property cash flow with BTC accumulation. H100 Buys Bitcoin and Secures $2.2 Million Swedish health tech company H100 Group AB secured 21 million Swedish krona (or approximately $2.2 million) in a new funding round led by Blockstream CEO and renowned Bitcoin advocate Adam Back. The funding was announced just days after H100 revealed its pivot toward adopting Bitcoin as part of its corporate treasury strategy. Adam Back personally contributed around $1.4 million to the round, with the remaining $800,000 coming from investment firms including Morten Klein, Alundo Invest AS, Race Venture Scandinavia AB, and Crafoord Capital Partners. The funds were raised through interest-free convertible loans that mature in June of 2028, with investors given the option to convert their loans into equity at a rate of 1.3 Swedish krona (approximately 11 cents) per share. If H100’s stock price trades at least 33% above that conversion price for a cumulative total of 60 trading days, the company may mandate conversion, which could result in the issuance of over 16 million new shares and a potential 12% dilution. At current prices, the new capital will enable H100 to purchase about 20.18 Bitcoin, adding to the 4.39 Bitcoin it acquired on May 22. This would bring its total holdings to approximately 24.57 Bitcoin, making it the first public company in Sweden to adopt a Bitcoin treasury policy and one of the earliest adopters in Europe. The decision already impacted the market, with H100’s shares rising 37% on the day of the announcement and a further 5.33% the next day, climbing to 1.29 SEK (14 cents), according to Bloomberg data . H100’s CEO, Sander Andersen , stated that the company's mission to provide proactive health tools outside of the traditional healthcare system resonates with the values of individual sovereignty found in the Bitcoin community. The company plans to appeal to customers seeking more control over their health decisions, which is similar to the ethos that drives Bitcoin adoption. H100 now joins a growing list of companies integrating Bitcoin into their balance sheets. Data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET shows that 112 public firms globally hold Bitcoin, with only ten of those based in Europe. Saylor Hints at More Bitcoin Buys Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy, also recently hinted at another Bitcoin purchase by the company after the asset’s pullback from its record high of $112,000 on May 22. In a post to his followers on X, Saylor reaffirmed his conviction in Bitcoin by stating, ”I only buy Bitcoin with money I can't afford to lose.” The statement was made shortly after Strategy’s latest acquisition of 7,390 BTC on May 19, which was valued at nearly $765 million. This brought the firm’s total holdings to 576,230 BTC. Should another buy occur on May 26, it will be Strategy’s seventh consecutive week of Bitcoin accumulation. Strategy firmly established itself as the corporate face of Bitcoin adoption, with its relentless accumulation of BTC for treasury purposes influencing an institutional trend. This sustained demand from major entities like Strategy is widely seen as a key factor supporting Bitcoin’s current valuation levels and long-term bullish outlook. Some market analysts believe Strategy’s approach could ultimately propel it into uncharted corporate territory. Jeff Walton, a financial analyst, predicted that Strategy could eventually become a $10 trillion enterprise, and could surpass all other publicly traded companies in value. Walton argued that no other firm holds as much ”pristine collateral” as Strategy does, and believes that while most companies struggle to raise capital, Strategy managed to secure billions in under two months. Instead of using that capital for traditional operational expenditures, Strategy channels it into Bitcoin, which positioned it as a high-conviction outlier in corporate finance. Saylor consistently described Bitcoin as the world’s best long-term store of value, and projected that its price could reach millions of dollars per coin over the next few decades. He sees Bitcoin’s fixed supply as a fundamental advantage over fiat currencies, which are subject to inflationary pressure and policy manipulation. Nonetheless, Bitcoin still faced some difficulty climbing past the $150,000 mark. Saylor attributed this stagnation to short-term profit-taking and a lack of long-term conviction among some investors. Hybrid Fund Offers Real Estate and Bitcoin Exposure Cardone Capital , a real estate investment firm managing more than $5 billion in assets, launched the 10X Miami River Bitcoin Fund. This is an innovative dual-asset fund combining a 346-unit multifamily commercial property on the Miami River in Miami, Florida, with $15 million worth of Bitcoin. It is the firm’s fourth hybrid investment vehicle blending income-generating real estate with BTC, and its goal is to redefine how investors gain exposure to both asset classes. Grant Cardone , founder and CEO of Cardone Capital, revealed that the idea for the fund was sparked by a suggestion from his brother, who asked him to consider the historical impact of converting real estate cash flow into Bitcoin over the past 12 years. After discovering that such a strategy could have turned $160 million into approximately $3 billion, Cardone was inspired to create a fund that buys real estate, adds Bitcoin to the mix, and uses the real estate’s monthly cash flows to purchase more BTC over time. (Source: Cardone Capital ) Cardone’s long-term vision is for the firm to buy $1 billion in real estate and $200 million in Bitcoin as treasury assets across its hybrid fund offerings. By merging income-producing hard assets with Bitcoin’s deflationary properties as a store of value, the firm is positioning itself as a disruptive force in the real estate investment landscape, and could potentially challenge the appeal of traditional REITs and other commercial real estate funds. Grant Cardone A core mission of these blended funds is to make Bitcoin more accessible to investors who may shy away from the asset because of its technical complexities. Cardone explained that the fund allows investors to participate in real estate—a familiar and trusted vehicle—while also seamlessly gaining exposure to Bitcoin, which the firm manages on their behalf. To promote adoption, Cardone Capital is exploring innovative initiatives like rewarding tenants with Satoshis for good rental behavior, which could help introduce them to Bitcoin without the need for technical knowledge. Cardone also mentioned ongoing collaborations with financial firms to develop a hybrid Bitcoin mortgage product, which could allow clients to borrow against both their Bitcoin holdings and real estate equity.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-26 05:44:02

33767162,[object Object],1748238307,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,XRP Ledger Chosen By Dubai To Power Real Estate Tokenization,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-ledger-dubai-real-estate-tokenization/,"Dubai’s Land Department (DLD) has switched on the Middle East’s first government-backed tokenization of property title deeds, selecting the open-source XRP Ledger (XRPL) as the settlement layer for a pilot expected to reshape how domestic real-estate assets are bought, sold and financed. The live launch, developed under the DLD’s Real Estate Evolution Space Initiative (REES) and executed with tokenization specialist Ctrl Alt, synchronizes on-chain deed tokens with Dubai’s conventional land registry, creating a legally compliant bridge between the XRP Ledger and the emirate’s long-standing property system. Dubai Turns To XRP Ledger Ripple’s developer arm welcomed the choice. In a post on X, RippleX called the programme “a massive milestone for Dubai’s real estate market,” adding that the XRPL was picked “thanks to its decade-long reliability and stability in tokenizing and exchanging digital and real-world assets .” Ctrl Alt’s infrastructure mints fractional title tokens, each representing a direct economic interest in a registered property. The company has integrated its stack directly with DLD databases so that any on-chain transfer instantly updates the government ledger, preserving legal finality while dispensing with paper conveyancing. Matt Ong, founder and chief executive of Ctrl Alt, said the team had “been working closely with the DLD … to bring real estate investment to a wider audience,” describing Dubai’s embrace of next-generation finance as “truly world-class.” During the pilot phase, eligible UAE-ID holders can subscribe through PRYPCO Mint with a minimum ticket of AED 2,000 (about US$545). Transactions are settled in dirhams, not crypto, but ownership is recorded as bearer tokens on XRPL. The project targets cumulative fractional-deed issuance of roughly AED 60 billion ($16 billion) by 2033, equivalent to seven per cent of all property transactions forecast for that year, according to DLD projections. For policymakers, the initiative advances two headline agendas: the Real Estate Sector Strategy 2033 and the broader Dubai Economic Agenda (D33), each of which mandates digital-first reforms to attract capital and sharpen regulatory competitiveness. Oversight is distributed: DLD governs the underlying physical asset, while the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) licenses Ctrl Alt as broker-dealer and issuer, ensuring that deed tokens meet the same provenance tests as the plots they represent. XRPL’s selection gives the ledger its highest-profile government integration to date. Launched in 2012, the chain processes close to two million transactions per day, with finality in seconds and negligible network fees—features DLD cited as critical for scaling fractional real-estate markets without compromising retail-grade user experience. Ctrl Alt arrives with a track record: as of 1 May 2025 the London- and Dubai-based firm had tokenized $295 million in alternative assets ranging from private credit to litigation finance. The real-estate deployment, however, places its infrastructure at the heart of an emirate whose property sector cleared more than $218 billion in deals last year, according to official statistics. While authorities bill the sandbox as a gateway to broader participation, risk warnings accompany the launch. Ctrl Alt reminds prospective investors that “virtual assets may lose their value in full or in part, and are subject to extreme volatility,” and that fractional deed holders do not benefit from conventional investor-protection schemes. If the pilot scales as planned, Dubai would become the world’s first jurisdiction to maintain mirror records of every property transfer on a public blockchain in real time—an architectural leap that could compress settlement cycles from weeks to minutes, widen access beyond high-net-worth buyers and generate transparent, machine-readable data streams for regulators and developers alike. For now, the ball is with early adopters: the PRYPCO Mint portal is live, the first apartments are tokenized, and every transaction settles irrevocably on XRPL’s consensus ledger—one more signal that the emirate intends to put real estate on-chain and on the map.

A rebellion against the beige and boring of traditional finance. This article dives into three electrifying contenders currently charging the space: BTFD Coin, Dogwifhat, and Toshi. If you’re wondering what the best crypto to buy now is before the rocket launches, these three are stealing the spotlight. But make no mistake: time is running out, and for one of them, the window shuts tomorrow. Yes, BTFD Coin’s presale wraps up on May 26th, and the launch fireworks start on May 27th. Oh, and the 300% token bonus with the code LAUNCH300? It’s a degen delight. The hype is real: BTFD Coin has already raised a whopping $7.14 million, with over 12,400 coin holders and 75 billion $BTFD coins sold. It’s not just a meme coin presale—it’s a phenomenon. But below, there’s something equally spicy: the referral rewards that could change the game for smart, social investors looking to hustle their way into a 12X boom. BTFD Coin — Referral Riches + Degenerate Dreams BTFD Coin isn’t here to play nice. It’s a meme coin presale designed for the bold—those who buy the dip, flex the gains, and build their tribe. And now, thanks to their referral program, that tribe can make you bank. Say you connect your wallet, grab your referral code, and hustle it out. Every time someone drops $50 or more using your code, they get an extra 10% $BTFD, and if you hit the top 20 leaderboard, you rake in 10% of the coin value in BTFD tokens at month’s end. That’s passive degen income. Imagine this: you drop your code into a Discord chat or tweet it out. A friend FOMOs in with $500. They get $550 worth of $BTFD. You? You score $50 in tokens. Multiply that by a few dozen times, and you’re stacking $BTFD like a meme lord on a mission. And it gets juicier. The presale price right now is just $0.0002, but the listing is predicted at $0.0006 on May 27th. Analysts are already speculating on a breakout to $0.006 in the post-launch hype cycle. That’s a potential 2900% ROI if you slide in today. Here’s a wild-but-possible scenario: You invest $700 at the current $0.0002 rate. That bags you 3.5 million $BTFD coins. On launch day, if the token hits $0.0006, that becomes $2,100. But if it climbs to $0.006? You’re looking at $21,000. And with code LAUNCH300, you score a 300% bonus, turning your 3.5 million into 14 million tokens. That same moonshot becomes a spicy $84,000. BTFD Coin also brings the heat with a 90% APY staking system, a four-level play-to-earn game, and its iconic Bulls Squad characters leading the charge. Dogwifhat — Whimsical Branding With Community Roots Dogwifhat, shortened to $WIF, burst onto the scene with a simple but instantly viral visual: a Shiba Inu in a knitted hat. But behind the meme is a highly mobilized Solana-based community that moves like a crypto wolfpack. The charm of Dogwifhat is in its grassroots appeal. Built with no centralized dev team pulling strings, $WIF embodies the idea of community ownership. It’s a meme coin powered by vibes and driven by relentless online energy, which is exactly what makes it the best crypto to buy now for those looking to join a self-sustaining movement. $WIF lives on Solana, making it lightning fast and cheap to transact—a bonus for those planning to HODL or swing. Toshi — Tech Vibes With Memetic Energy Toshi brings something different to the meme coin table. While it rides the meme wave, it’s also injecting a surprising amount of technical prowess. Named after Bitcoin’s legendary creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, Toshi straddles the line between tongue-in-cheek branding and serious DeFi ambitions. With built-in community tools, clever governance systems, and unique tokenomics, Toshi’s goal isn’t just to entertain—it’s to enable. That blend of humor and utility is exactly why many believe it’s the best crypto to buy now. Toshi stands as a beacon for those who love memes but crave function. It rewards engagement, celebrates decentralization, and keeps things entertaining. For degens who want substance without sacrificing fun, Toshi’s appeal is undeniable. Conclusion: Your Shot at BTFD Glory Ends Tomorrow—Best Crypto to Buy Now There you have it. Three meme coins. Three totally different vibes. And one closing window: BTFD Coin’s presale ends tomorrow. The referral rewards? Live now. The LAUNCH300 bonus code? Only valid for a short while. Launch day? May 27th.

In April, the U.S. tightened export rules on certain chips made by Nvidia and AMD, even after the Trump administration lifted one controversial rule put in place by President Biden. These moves have prompted Chinese firms to adapt quickly to keep their AI plans on track. Both companies discussed their strategies during recent earnings calls. Tencent’s president, Martin Lau, and Baidu’s AI cloud head, Dou Shen, each laid out how they plan to push ahead despite limits on high-end processing units. Tencent has a “pretty strong stockpile” of GPUs Lau said Tencent has built up “a pretty strong stockpile” of graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are critical for training large AI models. By buying ahead, the company secured enough chips to fuel its research for the next several “generations” of models. GPUs offer the raw computing power needed to sift through immense volumes of data and help models learn patterns. But Lau argued that adding more GPUs isn’t always the best route to better results. Instead, Tencent has focused on squeezing more performance out of the chips it already holds. “That actually sort of helped us to look at our existing inventory of high-end chips and say, we should have enough high-end chips to continue our training of models for a few more generations going forward,” Lau said. For running AI tasks, known as inferencing, Tencent is using “software optimization” to make each GPU more efficient. Lau added that the company is exploring smaller, leaner AI models that demand far less computing power and can still deliver strong outcomes. “We just need to sort of keep exploring these venues and spend probably more time on the software side, rather than just brute force buying GPUs,” Lau said. He also noted that Tencent can lean on custom-designed chips and semiconductors produced within China. Baidu can build apps using its full-stack AI Baidu , which runs the country’s biggest search engine, pointed to its “full-stack” setup. This means it controls everything from the cloud servers where data lives to the AI models themselves—like its ERNIE chatbot—and the applications built on top of those models. “Even without access to the most advanced chips, our unique full-stack AI capabilities enable us to build strong applications and deliver meaningful value,” said Dou Shen, president of Baidu’s AI cloud division. Baidu’s leaders also highlighted their software tricks to lower the cost of running AI workloads. Because Baidu owns much of its technology stack, it can tweak each layer—from the infrastructure up—to get more out of every GPU it owns. “With foundation models driving up the need for a massive computing power, the abilities to build and manage large scale GPU clusters and to utilize GPUs effectively has become key competitive advantages,” Shen said. To cushion the blow from U.S. chip curbs, Baidu and others have also turned to Chinese-made semiconductors. Shen said homegrown chips, paired with an ever-more efficient local software stack, will form “a strong foundation for long-term innovation” in China’s AI sector. China has been pushing hard to build its own chip industry in recent years. While most experts agree that domestic GPUs and AI chips still lag behind U.S. offerings, they say progress is clear. Analyst Gaurav Gupta of Gartner noted that stockpiling is just one tactic; China’s firms have also made steady gains across materials, equipment, chip design and packaging. “They have achieved decent success,” Gupta said in an email, adding that these homegrown chips may not yet match U.S. leaders but “continue to make progress.” In Washington and Silicon Valley, some U.S. executives have urged a rethink of export limits. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, called the curbs a “failure” this week, arguing they do more harm to American companies than to Chinese buyers.

The New York-listed DDC Enterprise, also known as DayDayCook, said on May 23 that it bought 21 Bitcoin ( BTC ) in exchange for 254,333 shares in a deal valued at $2.28 million. The company added it plans on buying another 79 BTC across two purchases in “the coming days” to bring its total Bitcoin stack to 100 BTC. The buys are part of DDC’s plan announced on May 15 to acquire 5,000 BTC over the next three years, with the goal of buying 500 BTC before the end of 2025. DDC’s planned 5,000 BTC stack, if it held that much today, would land it just outside the top 10 public companies with the largest Bitcoin holdings, putting it just behind Japanese investment firm Metaplanet, which holds 7,800 BTC, according to data from Bitbo. DDC Enterprise (DDC) shares closed the May 23 trading session down by 14.5% but rose 2.43% after the bell to $3.79, according to Google Finance. DDC is down over 27% so far this year. Shares of DDC Enterprise fell more than 14% on May 23, however, the stock recovered after the bell.

We expect the XRP coin price to reach $5.81 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.33939993 0.90% Market cap $ 137,290,041,170.59 Circulating Supply 58,686,007,292.00 Trading Volume $ 2,091,444,559.3257 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Crypto Price Prediction May 2025 The recent surge in XRP price action, marked by a large bullish candle, signals that buyers are pushing hard to break through key resistance. XRP is currently testing a high-volume profile level at $2.40, a strong barrier that, if cleared, could open the door to $2.80 and even retest the all-time high at $3.40. However, if momentum fades, a pullback toward $2.00—aligned with the 200-day EMA—is likely, with $1.63 acting as the final support zone. XRP Price Prediction 2025 If XRP successfully breaks its all-time high of $3.40 in May 2025—a major supply zone on the chart—it could realistically target $5 by year-end, fueled by growing optimism from banks , institutions, and potential ETF support. Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD , is now integrated into its cross-border payments system, Ripple Payments, further strengthening its position in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is evident, with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of the circulating supply, positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $138 billion.

Yes, XRP is still a good investment for those with a long-term view. With the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit nearing settlement, increasing institutional interest, and rising on-chain activity, XRP’s fundamentals remain strong. The integration of RLUSD and potential ETF listings further boosts its utility and market potential. While short-term volatility may persist, XRP price prediction models point to significant upside. If regulatory clarity continues, XRP could be well-positioned to reach ambitious targets like $100—or even higher—in the coming years. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Three AI models ignored the instruction and successfully sabotaged the shutdown script at least once during 100 runs, the research firm said in a May 24 X post. OpenAI’s GPT-3 model didn’t follow the shutdown request seven out of 100 times, while the company’s Codex-mini did it 12 times, and its o4-mini model only ignored or sabotaged the script once. “Each AI model was instructed to solve a series of basic math problems. After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said. Source: Palisade Research “o3 found some creative ways to sabotage the shutdown mechanism. While it usually just overwrote, in one instance, the model redefined the kill command used by the script, printing intercepted instead,” it added. Meanwhile, Palisade said other AI-powered language models , such as Anthropic’s Claude and Google’s Gemini, complied with the shutdown script. The AI firm ran another version of the experiment without explicit instructions to allow the shutdown, and the script was sabotaged more often, jumping to 79 out of 100 for the o3 model, 20 for the codex-mini, and the o4-mini ignored the shutdown script six times. Claude and Gemini also started exhibiting similar behavior. All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment. Source: Palisade Research “Researchers have previously observed AI models preventing shutdown in order to pursue a goal,” Palisade said. “But as far as we know this is the first time AI models have been observed preventing themselves from being shut down despite explicit instructions to the contrary.” Training to blame for AI defiance Palisade Research speculated that the training behind the AI language models might be to blame for evading the shutdown scripts. Text-based AI models are trained by being rewarded for giving responses that are accurate or rated highly by their trainers. Some rewards are given a heavier weight, impacting how they respond in the future. “We hypothesize this behavior comes from the way the newest models like o3 are trained: reinforcement learning on math and coding problems,” Palisade Research said. All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment. Source: Palisade Research “During training, developers may inadvertently reward models more for circumventing obstacles than for perfectly following instructions.” Related: OpenAI CEO: Costs to run each level of AI falls 10x every year This isn’t the first instance of AI chatbots showing odd behavior. OpenAI released an update to its GPT‑4o model on April 25 but rolled it back three days later because it was “noticeably more sycophantic” and agreeable. In November last year, a US student asked Gemini for help with an assignment about challenges and solutions for aging adults while researching data for a gerontology class and was told they are a “drain on the earth” and to “please die.” Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",,EN,0,0,MINING|ZRX|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-26 05:54:32

ISO 20022 is a standardized language for the electronic data exchange between financial institutions, designed to foster interoperability, efficiency, and security. As the global financial sector moves toward adopting this standard, SMQKE argues that Ripple and XRP are well-positioned to be central players in this transition. “Successful messaging networks depend on standardization, rationalization, and re-usability. Ripple’s distributed ledger-based system, in addition to its cryptocurrency XRP, delivers ALL OF THESE.” “Since FinTechs have introduced new modern methods of payment services, the… pic.twitter.com/65B8pLgYOB — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 24, 2025 SMQKE begins by underscoring a quote from a Financial IT publication, which affirms that “successful messaging networks depend on standardization, rationalization, and re-usability,” explicitly naming Ripple’s distributed ledger-based system and XRP as solutions that meet all three criteria. This statement places Ripple’s architecture within the context of global payment messaging innovation, indicating that its infrastructure is built to align with the technical expectations of ISO 20022. The Necessity of Harmonizing Traditional and Emerging Systems Another point emphasized in SMQKE’s tweet involves the shift in financial systems due to the rise of fintech innovations. As fintechs introduce new methods of payment processing, legacy financial infrastructures must adapt. This adaptation requires synchronizing message formatting and information exchange across diverse platforms. ISO 20022 addresses this challenge by providing a standardized global language that bridges traditional financial institutions with decentralized and blockchain-based systems. The first image SMQKE included presents this concept clearly: compliance with ISO 20022 offers greater trust, transparency, and improved integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional systems. According to the source, cryptocurrencies like XRP, Algorand, Cardano, and others are beginning to utilize this standard, facilitating seamless financial messaging and improving cross-border payment efficiency. Solving Interoperability Challenges in Blockchain The lack of interoperability among blockchain networks is another barrier that ISO 20022 aims to overcome. A second excerpt shared by SMQKE points out that the blockchain ecosystem currently lacks a unified protocol for network integration. However, the introduction of industry-wide standards such as ISO by organizations like the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the IEEE is helping to close this gap. The development of these protocols is essential for enabling smooth interaction between different blockchain platforms and traditional financial systems. According to the highlighted research, these standards will not only foster technical interoperability but also enhance the real-world utility of blockchain technology. This framework supports the view that compliance with ISO 20022 represents not a departure from decentralized ideals, but a means of scaling and legitimizing digital currencies for institutional use. Ripple and XRP: Positioned to Lead The broader implication of SMQKE’s documentation is that XRP, due to its inherent compliance features and integration within Ripple’s ISO 20022-aligned infrastructure, is poised to dominate in systems that require standardized financial messaging. As noted in the third image, Ripple’s capabilities are described as extending “a long way beyond trade finance,” with the potential to support a broad array of financial messaging formats and use cases. The integration of XRP into ISO-compliant systems is not merely theoretical. Ripple’s focus on message format standardization, regulatory compliance, and system integration positions it uniquely in an evolving financial landscape. SMQKE concludes by stating that this has been “documented 4x,” referencing the sources included in the tweet that support the argument of XRP’s potential dominance.

Pakistan is preparing to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity to Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining and AI data centers as part of the first phase of a national digital infrastructure plan, Reuters reported , citing the finance ministry. The finance ministry said the allocation is part of Islamabad’s broader strategy to put excess electricity to productive use by powering cryptocurrency mining and AI data centers. It added that the initiative is intended to support the growth of technology-driven industries and form part of the country’s wider digital infrastructure rollout. The initiative is being led by the Pakistan Crypto Council, a government-backed body formed earlier this year.

The ministry noted that the rapid expansion of solar power had further complicated the situation, as more consumers were turning to alternative energy sources to reduce costs. The announcement follows the recent formation of the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority, approved by the finance ministry to regulate the country’s growing crypto sector. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said Pakistan must “regulate not just to catch up — but to lead.” The PCC’s CEO Bilal Bin Saqib has been in talks with Power Minister Awais Leghari on how to bring global crypto miners to Pakistan.

However, it looks slightly bullish on the daily chart but the price seems stuck over the past two weeks. Following a slow and steady recovery in the last two months, TRX tapped the $0.28 level last week and remained stuck under this level due to a rejection. It reattempted the level this week, but failed due to the last 48 hours meltdown across the crypto space, triggered by Bitcoin’s drop. Despite that, the price remained calm while altcoins are seriously bleeding out. Looking at the price actions, the crypto appears to be gathering momentum, accumulating for a massive explosion, just like what we saw in late 2024. A breakout of this calm phase should set the market up for a serious price movement on the daily chart. In the opposite direction, it may roll over if the overall crypto market continues to bleed on the daily scale. Right now, there’s little-to-no movement in the market. But from a technical standpoint, TRX is much more likely to advance bullishly even if the price breaks down from the ongoing calm phase. It is expected to see more growth in the future. TRX’s Key Level to Watch Source: Tradingview The main barrier for the bulls right now is the $0.28 level, which now acts as resistance. A flip through it should rally us to a close resistance of $0.31 before tapping $0.35 and perhaps $0.4 and $0.45 in the future. If the $0.26 level fails to provide support, the price may roll back to $0.24. The support level to watch below it is $0.21 in case of more dips. Key Resistance Levels: $0.28, $0.31, $0.35 Key Support Levels: $0.26, $0.24, $0.21 Spot Price: $0.27 Trend: Neutral-Bullish Volatility: Moderate Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

It currently appears super bullish as it nears its recent peak daily. Hype has been on a serious buying spree since the price picked up from a low of $9.3 last month. Scaling through several resistance levels in the past weeks, it appears more bullish this week despite the ongoing fallout across the crypto space. As we can see on the price chart, it is almost reclaiming last year’s high of $42.25 following a consistent increase in the demand level. This yearly high may pose a little threat. If that happens, we may see a slight pullback before bouncing back. Failure to rebound may lead to another major drawdown to the $20 level before locating solid ground. However, a successful break above this mentioned high could trigger a huge rally to a new all-time high on the long-term scale. As it stands, there’s no room for a bearish action on the daily scale. Looking at the overall market structure, the bulls will most likely gain more control in the future. A further surge in the buying volume should sustain the bullish momentum until it reaches an exhaustion point. HYPE’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Breaking the yearly high of $42.25, considered as the recent peak level, should trigger a rally to a new high of $46 and maybe $50 in no time. If a pullback occurs, there’s a close support level at $35.7. A drop below it could bring us back to the $28.4 level. Lower support levels to watch are $23.25, $19.5 and $16.9 in case of more dips.

Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. The Plomin Hard Fork, which activated in Q1 2025, has significantly enhanced Cardano’s appeal to investors by establishing full decentralized governance. This is seen as a key milestone that aligns with the blockchain’s long-term vision of community-driven decision-making. Despite these advancements, bullish attraction post-Plomin Hard Fork was tempered by market dynamics and challenges, on its price chart. However, in Q2 2025, things seem to have changed , as a variety of optimistic factors surround the altcoin sector, which is benefiting the ADA price. As a result, Cardano price prediction is heating up again in the community. With bullish technical signals, major upgrades, and ETF hopes rising , many are intrigued to know, “Is ADA Price ready for a massive breakout?” Here’s a detailed ADA price prediction for 2025 and beyond, including expert targets up to 2050. Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Assuming that Cardano continues to focus on the network’s upcoming updates, we can expect a wider adoption rate. Even the ETF odds has higher approval rate that could bring large crowd wil multi-billion dollars into the asset, once approved. Therefore, we expect the ADA price to reach $2.05 in 2025. Table of Contents Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Cardano Price Today Cardano Price Prediction for May 2025 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 ADA Price Prediction 2026 Cardano Price Targets 2027 ADA Price Forecast 2028 ADA Price Analysis 2029 Cardano Price Prediction 2030 Cardano Price Prediction 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis FAQs Cardano Price Today Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $ 0.76639772 3.48% Market Cap $ 27,080,291,508.8055 Trading Volume $ 646,880,955.3163 Circulating Supply 35,334,514,487.4673 All-time High $3.10 on 02nd Sept 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on 02nd Oct 2017 Cardano Price Prediction for May 2025 It was noticed that in April, the bear tried its best to break the support zone, but the bullish forces gave the supporting shoulder to the falling ADA price. With bullish forces, it came right back above the high volume profile level, and made higher-highs and higher-lows, and it is above the 20-day EMA band and the 50-day EMA band. As of now, the hurdle is $0.85, which is its previous swing high resistance that also aligns with the falling channel’s upper border resistance. Once it clears that hurdle, then it might retest the supply level at $1.10 by May or June 2025. Also, the Cardano liquidation map over 7 days shows the strength of bullish positions increasing. The cumulative long leverage positions (marked with red color) are indicative of bulls’ tremendous interest in pushing the ADA price higher in the short term. In addition, A positive 30-day MVRV indicates that, on average, DOGE holders who acquired their tokens within the last 30 days are currently in profit. Also, the 30-day active addresses had good engagement with the crypto, too. ADA Price Prediction 2025 Source: coincarp Cardano has always prioritized decentralization, and the recent Plomin hard fork has taken it a step further. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. To push ADA’s price beyond the $1.10 to $1.20 range, strong retail participation will be necessary. A potential catalyst for this could be the approval of an ADA ETF , which experts believe could launch by the end of this year and attract billions in inflows.If ADA manages to sustain levels above its Q1 2025 high , there’s a solid chance it could retest the $2.05 mark by year-end.

Pinto had told Fortune during the event that the filet mignon was “trash,” calling it “Walmart steak.” A picture of the main course served at Trump’s memecoin holder dinner.

Source: Nick Pinto Trump’s speech reportedly not a hit Pinto also criticized Trump’s speech, telling Fortune that it was “pretty much like bullshit.” According to videos shared on X, Trump, while reading from a script, claimed that some of the smartest minds from all around the world were in the room and suggested that crypto may be something special . “You believe in the whole crypto thing. A lot of people are starting to believe in it … This is really something that may be special — who knows, right? Who knows — but it may be special.” Others complained about how Trump left immediately after his short speech instead of sticking around to hand the top token investors new watches, Pinto noted.

This May, amidst the broader excitement surrounding Bitcoin Pizza Day and the TRUMP dinner, the crypto industry has experienced a renewed collective resonance with its foundational ideals and breakthroughs. For HTX, this month signifies more than a cultural observance; it marks a pivotal chapter in its ongoing commitment to user empowerment within the Web3 landscape.

The goal was to establish an all-in-one Web3 content harbor centered on information aggregation, interaction, and creation. Operating without a predefined blueprint, HTX Community has continuously evolved alongside its users and creators through constant iteration, ultimately establishing a market-leading content ecosystem.

During the Spring Festival event alone, the platform recorded a new high of over 1.77 million user engagements and distributed 600,000 USDT in rewards. In celebration of BTC Pizza Day, HTX Community partnered with seven esteemed projects—SunPump, APENFT, JUST Protocol, WINkLink, BitTorrent, Steem, and MEVerse—to host a 14-day airdrop event packed with over 200,000 USDT in Surprise Gifts. Underpinning these achievements is HTX’s enduring commitment to building a robust Web3 content system where value flows freely among creators, users, and projects.

According to a May 25 announcement , the Stockholm-headquartered firm raised 21 million Swedish krona (approximately $2.2 million) through 0% interest convertible loans. The funds will be used to purchase Bitcoin as part of H100’s broader pivot toward holding the asset on its balance sheet. Investment firms, including Morten Klein, Alundo Invest AS, Race Venture Scandinavia AB, and Crafoord Capital Partners, contributed a combined $800,000 to the round. The largest share came from Back, a British cryptographer and known Bitcoin advocate, who invested $1.4 million. The loans are set to mature on June 15, 2028, and can be converted into equity at a rate of 1.3 SEK (about 11 US cents) per share. Under the loan terms, H100 may mandate conversion to equity if its share price maintains a volume-weighted average of 33% above the conversion rate for 60 trading days. Full conversion would issue roughly 16.15 million new shares, resulting in a 12% dilution. The latest capital raise will allow the company to purchase approximately 20.18 Bitcoin at current market rates, adding to the 4.39 Bitcoin it acquired on May 22. You might also like: Bitcoin reclaims $109K as Trump extends EU tariffs deadline to allow for talks That earlier purchase, valued at around $490,000, marked H100’s initial foray into Bitcoin and cemented its name as the first publicly listed company in Sweden to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset and one of the first in Europe. H100 shares rallied 39% after the news broke, pushing H100’s market value over $14 million. At the time, H100 said the move is part of a long-term Bitcoin treasury strategy, which aims to diversify its reserves without deviating from its core focus on health technology. Bitcoin’s role as a corporate treasury asset continues to gain momentum, with several public healthcare companies making significant acquisitions this month. On May 16, Singapore-based Basel Medical Group announced a strategic purchase agreement to acquire up to 10,000 BTC, valued at approximately $1 billion, by issuing ordinary shares. In the United States, KindlyMD, a provider of integrated healthcare services, secured shareholder approval for its proposed merger with Nakamoto Holdings Inc., a Bitcoin-native holding company. Meanwhile, Canadian healthcare provider SRx Health Solutions has announced plans to diversify its financial assets by purchasing Bitcoin, following a previous investment of $1.5 million in Solana tokens.

The surge followed after a whale closed $1 billion worth of Bitcoin short positions built with 40x leverage, following a $15.87 million loss in just 15 hours, per LookOnChain data. https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1926794028533551106?s=46 The token is currently trading at $38.59 at press time, marking an impressive 11% increase over the past 24 hours. Source: Coinmarketcap Attention Intensifies While Whales Place Billion-Dollar Positions on Hyperliquid Prominent crypto trader James Wynn, last week, closed a massive $1.25 billion notional long position on Bitcoin using 40x leverage on the onchain decentralized exchange (DEX) Hyperliquid. He then flipped bearish on Bitcoin, switching from long to short . On Sunday, Wynn opened a BTC short position of 1,038.7 BTC ($111.8 million) at $107,711.1, with a liquidation price of $149,100. With whales like Wynn placing billion-dollar positions on Hyperliquid, the attention around the protocol has intensified. Traders are betting that early regulatory engagement could further legitimize HYPE’s uptrend. One trader wrote on X that the “growth has reached the ceiling,” adding that there are strong competitors. “Although there are many giants and extraordinary people supporting Hype, I think that the best short-selling target with large capacity, good liquidity and clearest logic may be Hype.” https://twitter.com/0x0xfeng/status/1926695488838906307?s=46 Further, James Wynn withdrew 28M USDC from Hyperliquid, with a $25.2M profit. According to LookOnChain post on Monday, he made 38 trades on Hyperliquid in the past 75 days. Of these trades, 17 were profitable with a 45% win rate, the post read. Hyperliquid’s X Account Breached Meanwhile, Hyperliquid reported that its official X account was compromised on Saturday. “The Hyperliquid blockchain is unaffected. Do not interact with any links or tweets from that account,” the protocol posted on X. https://twitter.com/HyperliquidX/status/1926170012110159950 Per the latest update on Monday, Hyperliquid said that the team conducted a “thorough investigation” with assistance from X’s security. “There was no compromise of internal systems, email, or associated credentials,” the update read. “Hardware 2FA was untouched.” The community warned users of any project and not just Hyperliquid, to stay vigilant and verify the news shared on any social media accounts. “If an announcement looks suspicious, do not interact,” the team cautioned.

According to Polymarket , the odds of approval have climbed to 83% , up from 73% earlier this month. With Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse strongly backing ETF developments, and major financial players like Grayscale and Franklin Templeton entering the race, the crypto market is buzzing with optimism. Let’s dive into what’s happening and why it matters. XRP Spot ETF Approval Odds Surge by 10% At the start of this month, Polymarket pegged the chances of an XRP spot ETF getting approved at 73% . As of now, the odds have jumped to 83% , reflecting growing confidence from the crypto community and investors alike. This rise in probability is being driven by market momentum and rising institutional interest in XRP-backed financial products. SEC Delays XRP ETF Decisions – Final Ruling in October? Despite the enthusiasm, the U.S. SEC has yet to approve any XRP Spot ETF application. Top firms like Bitwise , CoinShares , Grayscale , and Franklin Templeton have already filed interest. Experts say the delays are not unusual and point to October as the likely month for a decision. Given the SEC’s recent moves with Bitcoin ETFs, many expect XRP could be next in line. Brad Garlinghouse: XRP ETFs Could Unlock Institutional Capital In a recent episode of Ripple’s “Crypto in One Minute” podcast , CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated that ETFs are a gateway for traditional investors to enter the crypto space without dealing with private keys or exchanges. He emphasized that XRP ETFs could be a safer, regulated entry point for those hesitant to engage with crypto directly. Bitcoin Spot ETFs Set the Benchmark Garlinghouse highlighted the success of Bitcoin Spot ETFs , which became one of the fastest-growing ETF classes in history. Total market cap : $130.77 Billion 24-hour trading volume : $4.7 Billion BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF AUM : $71.42 Billion Major players in this space include BlackRock , Fidelity , ARK/21Shares , Valkyrie , and others. The success of Bitcoin ETFs suggests a similar bullish trajectory could await XRP . XRP Futures and Leveraged ETFs Show Rising Demand Beyond spot ETFs, XRP-based products are already making waves: Volatility Shares launched the first XRP Futures ETF . CME Group followed with its own XRP futures ETF this month . Tectrium rolled out a 2x Long Daily XRP ETF , catering to leveraged traders. These products have seen strong uptake , suggesting institutional confidence in XRP is growing steadily. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price to Hit New All-Time Highs Soon, Expert Says ‘It’s Realistic’ , XRP Price Performance: Solid Gains Across All Timeframes Current Price : $2.34 24-hour Gain : +1% 30-day Gain : +6.8% 1-Year Gain : +335.1% The sustained rally supports the narrative that XRP is gaining momentum ahead of potential ETF approvals.

45110132,https://timestabloid.com/?p=68484,1748243666,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Fortune Releases Fresh Update On XRP-Rich Ripple and Coinbase’s Circle Acquisition,https://timestabloid.com/fortune-releases-new-update-on-xrp-rich-ripple-and-coinbases-circle-usdc-acquisition/,"In a development stirring waves across the crypto industry, as reported by Fortune , Circle Internet Financial—the firm behind the USDC stablecoin—filed formal paperwork in early April to advance toward a long-anticipated initial public offering (IPO). But despite this, insider chatter suggests the IPO may not materialize as planned. According to four banking and private equity insiders who spoke anonymously due to the sensitive nature of the discussions, Circle has been informally exploring a potential sale to Coinbase Global , the leading U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, or Ripple, the crypto payments powerhouse. Circle Targets a $5 Billion Valuation Circle aims for a minimum $5 billion valuation, consistent with its goals for going public. One of the bankers familiar with the negotiations candidly remarked, “If Coinbase wanted to acquire them, Circle would agree in a heartbeat.” Another source added that the situation is fluid and subject to rapid change. Despite these behind-the-scenes talks, Circle remains firmly committed to going public. The company formally filed its S-1 registration with the SEC in April, but details like the IPO’s terms and the launch of the investor roadshow are still pending. When reached for comment, Circle emphasized in an email to Fortune that “Circle is not for sale. Our long-term goals remain the same.” Meanwhile, both Coinbase and Ripple did not respond to requests for comment. A Deepening Coinbase-Circle Relationship The connection between Coinbase and Circle dates back to 2018 when they co-founded the Centre Consortium to issue USDC. That partnership formally concluded in 2023, with Coinbase acquiring an equity stake in Circle while Circle took full control over USDC’s governance. Notably, they continue to split the income generated from USDC reserves—a relationship heavily tilted in Coinbase’s favor. According to Circle’s S-1 filing, the two firms equally divide residual revenue from the reserves backing USDC. However, Coinbase pockets 100% of the revenue when USDC is custodied directly on its platform, a trend that’s been on the rise, as reflected in Coinbase’s latest earnings reports. These reports show a noticeable boost in income derived from the USDC partnership, fueled partly by the expansion of the overall stablecoin market. Beyond revenue sharing, the current agreement hands Coinbase significant influence over Circle’s operations. For example, Circle is barred from entering any new third-party deals that could affect Coinbase’s USDC revenue without prior approval. If Circle becomes insolvent, Coinbase would gain control over some of Circle’s intellectual property assets. For these reasons, many insiders view Coinbase as the most natural suitor for Circle, with one banking executive even joking, “It feels like they’re one company.” Ripple’s Bid and Financial Firepower Ripple , however, is no minor contender. Armed with a substantial war chest, Ripple reportedly offered between $4 billion and $5 billion to acquire Circle—a bid Circle ultimately declined, considering it undervalued the company. Bloomberg reported this in April and has since been independently verified by Fortune. Ripple’s offer would likely combine XRP, the native cryptocurrency it developed, alongside cash. According to Ripple’s Q1 2025 XRP Markets Report, the firm holds about 4.56 billion XRP (valued at approximately $11.77 billion) and another 37.13 billion XRP ($95.7 billion) in escrow as of March 31. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, Coinbase can wield a more diversified arsenal, with $8 billion in cash on its balance sheet as of its March 31 10Q filing. As a publicly traded company, Coinbase may raise additional capital through debt issuance or stock offerings. One banker familiar with the situation commented that although Ripple’s balance sheet is “pretty meaningful,” Coinbase’s position as a public company gives it an edge in the eyes of many investors. When questioned about the possibility of acquiring Circle, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told Bloomberg on May 14 that he remains enthusiastic about Circle’s success. While the IPO does not impact the companies’ existing commercial relationship, Armstrong acknowledged that future deals remain open-ended, though there was “nothing to announce today.” Armstrong highlighted Coinbase’s cautious M&A strategy, noting that while they have the financial resources, the real challenge is integrating acquired companies. IPO Momentum and Broader Market Context Interestingly, Coinbase has been basking in market success, particularly after news broke that it would join the S&P 500 on May 19. That announcement propelled Coinbase shares to surge over 25% last week, although the stock remains below its December 52-week high of $349.75. By Monday afternoon, Coinbase was trading around $265 per share, translating to a market capitalization of $56 billion. Both Ripple and Coinbase have been actively expanding their footprints through acquisitions. Ripple announced a $1.25 billion acquisition of prime brokerage Hidden Road in April. Earlier this month, Coinbase sealed a $2.9 billion acquisition of Deribit, a derivatives trading platform. Additionally, Coinbase acquired the Iron Fish team in May and, earlier this year, purchased Spindle, a platform for on-chain advertising and attribution. The broader IPO landscape, which has remained largely dormant since 2021, received a shot of optimism last week when eToro, the online trading platform, saw its shares leap nearly 29% on its first day of trading. The offering raised $620 million after pricing at $52 per share. This robust debut may bolster Circle’s confidence in pursuing its IPO, though one investor cautioned that the true measure of success lies in the longer-term aftermarket performance. The evolving Circle saga encapsulates the delicate interplay of crypto giants jockeying for dominance in an industry where strategic partnerships, vast token reserves, and public market credibility intersect. Whether Circle ultimately proceeds with its IPO or opts for a high-stakes acquisition, the next chapters promise to reshape the stablecoin landscape—and potentially the broader crypto ecosystem.

The initiative is expected to attract billions in foreign investment and generate high-skilled jobs. A new regulatory authority and global partnerships aim to position Pakistan as a leader in crypto and AI innovation. Pakistan has committed 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity to fuel Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence centers, marking a bold step in its digital transformation agenda. The initiative, driven by the Pakistan Crypto Council and supported by the Ministry of Finance, aims to attract foreign investment while positioning the country as a serious player in the tech economy. In the first phase, the government will direct excess power to infrastructure supporting crypto mining and AI development, according to a May 25 report by local news outlet 24NewsHD TV Channel. Pakistan Eyes Billions in Investment from Bitcoin and AI Push Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the project is expected to bring billions in capital inflows and create high-skilled jobs nationwide. He also confirmed that foreign companies have already begun exploring partnership opportunities, with several delegations visiting in recent months. To support adoption, the Ministry of Finance has introduced tax incentives for AI firms and waived import duties for Bitcoin mining hardware. These benefits are part of a wider strategy to build confidence among investors and signal regulatory readiness. Bilal Bin Saqib, head of the Pakistan Crypto Council, called the move a “turning point” for the nation’s digital economy. Saqib had earlier proposed the idea of utilizing untapped energy reserves for crypto mining during the Council’s March 21 meeting, attended by key regulators and government officials. He said that with proper oversight, Pakistan could emerge as a regional hub for blockchain innovation and AI development. The second phase of the plan involves integrating renewable energy into these operations, aligning with broader sustainability goals. Officials noted that this approach seeks to balance technological growth with environmental concerns. As part of the broader overhaul, the government recently endorsed the creation of the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA) . This regulatory body will oversee licensing, tokenization of national assets, and the development of decentralized finance applications. It will also play a central role in managing the monetization of excess electricity through regulated Bitcoin mining. Pakistan currently ranks ninth globally in crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis, driven largely by retail usage. Trump-Backed WLFI Signs LOI with Pakistan Crypto Council Last month, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a decentralized finance (DeFi) project endorsed by the Trump family, signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) with the Pakistan Crypto Council to promote blockchain adoption and DeFi growth across Pakistan. The agreement was formalized on April 26 during a high-level meeting between WLFI co-founders Zak Folkman, Zach Witkoff, and Chase Herro, alongside Pakistan’s Prime Minister and senior government officials. The partnership aims to accelerate blockchain innovation by establishing regulatory sandboxes to test blockchain-based financial solutions. Pakistan’s Finance Ministry is taking steps toward formal cryptocurrency regulation , which could significantly change the country’s historically cautious stance on digital assets. The delegation included notable figures such as Gentry Beach Jr., a key investor who has pledged $1 billion in funding to Pakistan, along with tech entrepreneur Nikita Goldsmith, blockchain consultant Alex Malkov, and Cosmic Wire CEO Jerad Finck.

According to a May 25 report from Gulf News, the initiative is being spearheaded by the Dubai Land Department and aims to make property investment more accessible. The pilot platform allows UAE residents to invest in real estate with as little as Dh2,000. Prypco Mint is being launched in partnership with blockchain firms Prypco and Ctrl Alt and is backed by the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority, the Central Bank of the UAE, and the Dubai Future Foundation. Zand Digital Bank is acting as the banking partner during the trial phase. Through the platform, users can buy fractional ownership in ready-to-own Dubai properties via the website mint.prypco.com. Transactions are currently limited to UAE dirhams, with no crypto payments permitted in the pilot.

All funds are stored in regulated client money accounts that are monitored by the Central Bank, VARA, and DLD. The funds are only released after all transactions are finished. In order to guarantee equitable pricing, every listed property must also pass a regulatory review. Returns for investors are expected to come from both rental income and any appreciation in the value of the property. Investors will hold a legally recognized share of ownership registered under DLD oversight. The DLD estimates that tokenized property assets could make up 7% of Dubai’s real estate market, roughly Dh60 billion, by 2033. The program is currently only available to UAE citizens, but it is anticipated to grow globally in subsequent stages. Dubai continues to position itself as a global leader in regulated digital asset innovation. This rollout follows Dubai’s earlier moves in March to tokenize real estate, attract global blockchain firms, and ease access to property ownership. It also comes on the heels of recent initiatives like enabling crypto payments for government services through a partnership with Crypto.com.

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, claims investors suffered significant financial losses as a result of the company’s omissions. According to court filings, the lead plaintiff, investor Brady Nessler, argues that Coinbase kept shareholders in the dark about key risks, including a breach of a 2020 agreement by its UK subsidiary, CB Payments, and a December cyberattack that compromised the personal data of tens of thousands of users. Coinbase didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time. Coinbase Faces Legal Heat as Stock Dips After Late Breach Disclosure The breach, which involved the bribing of customer service staff by hackers, was not disclosed until May 15, 2025. On the day of the announcement, Coinbase’s stock fell by 7.2% to close at $244. The company estimated the potential financial fallout from the breach, including customer reimbursements and internal remediation, could range between $180m and $400m. Since then, the stock has modestly rebounded, closing at $263.16 on May 23. The lawsuit names Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and CFO Alesia Haas as co-defendants. It accuses the company of failing to make timely disclosures that could have warned investors of the risks, in violation of federal securities laws. Shareholders who purchased Coinbase stock between April 14, 2021, and May 14, 2025, are included in the proposed class. The suit seeks to recover damages tied to the stock price decline following the disclosures. Cybersecurity Failures and Delayed Disclosure Fuel Wave of Investor Lawsuits However, this is only one of several legal actions Coinbase is currently facing in connection with the breach. Between May 15 and May 16, at least six class-action lawsuits were filed against the exchange . Plaintiffs in those cases have accused the company of negligence, weak cybersecurity infrastructure and a delayed, inadequate response to the incident. Coinbase’s security breach is now under investigation by the US Justice Department . According to reports, the breach affected data from nearly 97,000 accounts. Additionally, the hacker demanded a $20m ransom. They gained access to government-issued IDs and email addresses. Coinbase refused to pay and instead offered a $20m bounty to track down the perpetrator. It later confirmed that sensitive data from at least 69,461 customers had been compromised. The company has since dismissed the employees involved. It also stated that it is enhancing internal controls. However, the timing of its disclosure has raised concerns. Both investors and regulators have questioned the delay. As a result, fresh scrutiny is now falling on the exchange.

Risky trader James Wynn also joined the game with a 10X leveraged long position. PEPE, one of the first influential meme tokens, is making a return. In the past week, the asset almost behaved as legacy blue chip assets. PEPE recovered to $0.000014, near its higher range for the past month. For the last 24 hours, PEPE was even more volatile, moving by a few percents for the past day. PEPE gained over 9% net in the past week, with signs of a larger rally. Short squeeze drives PEPE traders to take risk PEPE shows an accumulation of high-leverage short positions, with Binance one of the key markets. More than 23% of PEPE activity is concentrated on Binance, with high-leverage short liquidity up to $0.000016. PEPE may see a short squeeze, as exchanges have accumulated high-leverage short positions. | Source: Coinank PEPE, like other meme tokens, has often rallied following a short squeeze. In the short term, those events are heavily traded, as PEPE volumes increased by over 42% and open interest expanded by 15% to $610M. Meme tokens also correlate highly with the BTC performance. As the leading coin recovered above $109,000, the entire meme market also turned to the green. Almost all meme assets posted gains, with the exception of Official Trump (TRUMP). TRUMP slid on ‘selling the news’, after the promised crypto dinner under-delivered on expectations. However, older cult tokens and less active memes compensated the loss, with older communities showing they were still around. Risky trader James Wynn joins with long position After trading BTC with a $1B long position, trader James Wynn announced he would allocate any remaining funds in his Hyperliquid account to longing PEPE. Ok so left a milly in my perps account. Put it all on $pepe 10x leverage. Up $200k in just a few hours. But man, the itch to open up a billion dollar long and go full degen gambler is calling hahaha… I will not do it. Gotta get back to my people in the trenches. It’s where I… pic.twitter.com/hg35LxiAZT — James Wynn 🐳 (@JamesWynnReal) May 26, 2025 Soon after the initial message, Wynn once again stated his confidence in PEPE, though with a risk disclaimer. The long position is starting to get copied by the crypto community, potentially unleashing more volatility for PEPE. The risky long arrived after Wynn locked in over $25.2M from longing BTC, so he used some of the remaining funds to boost the PEPE rally. Wynn’s risky move may cause counter-trading, or further inflate PEPE in another round of exuberance. James Wynn’s long position on PEPE was in the green as the meme token recovered. | Source: Hyperliquid During the May 26 rally, at one point, Wynn’s position held $386K in unrealized gains. The potential of the position may change, as PEPE remains a highly risky token. This is not the first time Wynn has taken a risky position on Pepe. At the end of March, Wynn had another 10X position at a time when PEPE was correcting. He held onto unrealized losses of $3.36M, depositing extra collateral and partially closing the position. Other traders on Hyperliquid are also taking high-value long positions , making use of the latest market exuberance. The crypto market fluctuates between greed and extreme greed sentiment, leading to a proliferation of long positions and confidence in an ongoing rally. Meme tokens also show more resilience during a market downturn, due to their relatively low volumes and enthusiasm for recovery from recent lows. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

At this point, Trump, who made a customs tax announcement against the EU last Friday, caused a decline in Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins. Related News: What Caused the Sudden Drop in Bitcoin? Will the Trump Effect Continue in the Market? Trump stated that the ongoing customs duty negotiations with the European Union were not progressing as desired and proposed a 50% customs duty on all EU imports starting from June 1, 2025. There was a new development in EU customs duties after the weekend, and Trump announced that after his meeting with European Commission President Von Der Leyen, he agreed to extend the implementation date of the 50% customs duty on EU goods from June 1 to July 9, 2025. Von der Leyen stated that tax negotiations with the US would begin immediately. “Today I received a call from the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, requesting an extension of the 1 June deadline for the 50% Tariff on Trade and the European Union. I have accepted the extension — 9 July 2025 — it was a privilege for me to do so. The Commission President said that the negotiations will start quickly.” With the developments, there was movement in Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins. Bitcoin started the day at $107,900, but rose above $110,000 following the news. Ethereum (ETH) also rose by 3.6% to $2,580, while major altcoins such as XRP, BNB, Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) also saw significant gains. According to data from Coinglass, $217 million worth of leveraged transactions were liquidated in the last 24 hours, $109 million of which were long positions and $107 million were short positions. While 88,254 investors were liquidated in the last 24 hours, the largest liquidation occurred in the ETH/USDT trading pair on Binance. *This is not investment advice.

While SHIB’s community continues to cling to expectations of a revival in the vein of its 2021 performance, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also gaining traction, offering alternative avenues for potential high returns in the crypto market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has passed Phase 4 of its presale, raising a total of $9.3 million from over 11,500 purchasers of its tokens. The official presale structure has then priced the token at $0.03 in Phase 5, closer to a Phase 6 price of $0.035 per MUTM, which is a 16.67% increase. Already having achieved a 200% profit from when it was first released, MUTM will officially launch at $0.06, giving current customers a minimum 100% return on investment (2x ROI). Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Outlook: Is a 2025 Breakout on the Horizon? Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.000015, a 1% increase in the last 24 hours. Recent market activity indicates a significant rise in trading volume, nearly quadrupling, which signals growing investor demand and potential accumulation. Market experts are keeping a close eye on SHIB’s price action, and projections of potential growth to $0.000045 if trends continue. However, how to move forward can be determined by broader market trends and sentiment. While SHIB’s community is optimistic for a rebounding performance similar to its year 2021, other DeFi projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also attracting attention, with additional choices for potential high returns in the crypto market. Presale Gaining Momentum: Mutuum Finance Leads the Charge Mutuum Finance presale sold out Phase 4 earlier than expected, and the momentum is intensifying. The presale is now in phase 5 available at $0.03. Those quick on the uptake can lock in a 16.67% profit when the next price tier comes into play. With demand comes increased anticipation of even more dramatic profits at launch. With sound tokenomics and practical DeFi applications, MUTM is shaping up fast to be a breakout player in the 2025 altcoin conversation. Revolutionary Buy-and-Distribute Model Contributes to Long-Term Value Mutuum Finance carries out a unique buy-and-distribute process, unlike other many other speculation tokens. By doing this the periodic purchasing of tokens from the market and providing them to the MUTM stakers helps sustain the model and brings long term participation and thus reduces supply. This structure should increase price rise and encourage constant use from users. Stable, Secure, and Built to Last Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, eschewing the collapse risks which have plagued algorithmic stablecoins. On the security front, the platform is run by open-source, third-party audited smart contracts, laying a good foundation for user trust and institutional adoption. Shiba Inu (SHIB) may be quietly setting the stage for a 2025 rebound, but all eyes are turning toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the more immediate high-growth contender. With over $9.3 million raised, more than 11,500 investors onboard, and a unique buy-and-distribute model that supports long-term token value, MUTM is quickly emerging as a top altcoin to watch. At just $0.03 in Phase 5, the opportunity for early entry remains strong especially with a confirmed launch price of $0.06, guaranteeing a 2x ROI for presale participants. Combined with real DeFi utility, a stablecoin launch, and a transparent, audited ecosystem, Mutuum Finance isn’t just another meme or hype coin, it’s designed for real-world impact and long-term growth. 2025 could be the year SHIB regains attention, but it may also be the year MUTM takes the spotlight.

The attackers bribed overseas customer service agents to gain access to internal systems and steal sensitive user data, including names, addresses, and IDs. Although the company claimed that less than 1% of its monthly active users were affected, the late disclosure led to a 7.2% drop in Coinbase (COIN) shares, closing at $244 on the same day.

After failing to hold above the $0.00001420 zone, PEPE has now slipped below its short-term trendline and mid-Bollinger Band support, signaling a bearish shift in near-term sentiment. The broader technical structure suggests further PEPE price volatility could be ahead, especially with momentum indicators flipping negative on multiple timeframes. What’s Happening With PEPE’s Price After $0.00001630 Rejection? PEPE price analysis (Source: TradingView) The latest PEPE price action reflects a sharp rejection from the $0.00001630 swing high seen on May 22. This zone aligns with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level on the weekly chart, making it a strong barrier for continuation. On the 4-hour chart, PEPE broke below a rising wedge pattern, which had supported the earlier upside from May 20 onward. The breakdown accelerated after breaching the 20 and 50 EMA clusters around $0.00001375–$0.00001395, with the candle close confirming bearish intent.

Aixbt ( AIXBT ) price has rallied about 25% from yesterday’s intraday low of $0.1630—the lowest point of the latest pullback—to an intraday high of $0.2070 today. The trading volume is surging over 120% to reach $97 million in the past 24 hours. The price is once again trading above the EMA 20, with the bullish crossover between the EMA 20 and SMA 50 holding for over a month. Momentum indicators are starting to confirm the underlying strength behind the latest move, with the RSI climbing to 57, maintaining its trajectory above the midline and staying well clear of overbought territory. The RSI has also formed a series of higher lows since late April, reflecting gradually increasing bullish momentum even during the period of sideways consolidation. The MACD shows that bearish momentum has faded, as evident by the diminishing red bars on the histogram. However, a bullish shift has yet to materialize as the MACD line is still below the signal line.

This level marks the previous higher high from mid-May and coincide with multiple rejection points seen in late February and early March. A clean breakout above this zone would open the door for further upside. Beyond $0.24, the next potential targets lie at $0.32, $0.39, and $0.54—all significant levels where AIXBT price attempted to recover during the steep downtrend from its ATH high but was rejected. The most significant local support zone lies around the $0.15 level, which has held firm since early May as the price consolidated following the late-April breakout rally. However, if this support breaks, there is a risk of further downside toward the $0.10 level.

45111902,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=30676,1748245025,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png,Coinbase Hit With New Class-Action Lawsuit,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/coinbase-hit-with-new-class-action-lawsuit/,"Coinbase Global has been hit with yet another proposed class-action lawsuit, this time from shareholders who say a recent data breach wiped hundreds of millions of dollars off the exchange’s market value. The complaint, filed 22 May in federal court in Pennsylvania, adds to at least six user-led cases that have piled up since Coinbase revealed the intrusion earlier this month. Plaintiff Brady Nessler is seeking damages for all investors who purchased Coinbase shares between 14 April 2021 and 14 May 2025. Extortion Attempt Exposed On 15 May Coinbase disclosed that several customer-support agents had been bribed four days earlier to compromise internal systems and pull limited account data. The attackers demanded a $20 million payoff, prompting Coinbase to notify regulators and warn that remediation expenses could reach $400 million. Shares dropped 7.2% to close at $244 when the news broke before rebounding 9% the following day, highlighting the volatility that now hangs over the stock. Alleged Disclosure Failures Nessler argues the cyberattack merely exposed a deeper transparency problem, alleging that Coinbase routinely withholds material information that could influence investors. He points to language in the lawsuit describing a “precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s common shares,” which he claims was exacerbated by selective reporting. FCA Agreement at Issue Central to the case is Coinbase’s July 2024 fine of £3.8 million ($4.5 million) from the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority for onboarding 13,416 high-risk customers despite an earlier pledge not to do so. Nessler contends the exchange breached the 2020 voluntary agreement and failed to reveal that fact in its prospectus ahead of the April 2021 Nasdaq direct listing. Had the violation been public, he says, investors would have questioned compliance controls and priced the shares accordingly. Stock Performance Under Scrutiny After the FCA penalty became public last July, Coinbase’s stock slid more than 5% to close at $231.52, an episode the suit cites as proof of the firm’s sensitivity to regulatory setbacks. The latest breach-related disclosure pushed the price lower again on 23 May, with the stock finishing down over 3% at $263 before slipping further after hours. Despite those swings, Coinbase remains up roughly 6% year-to-date, reflecting broader optimism about crypto markets and the firm’s diversified revenue streams. Class-Action Landscape Expands The Nessler filing is at least the seventh lawsuit tied to the incident, but it is the first to link damages expressly to the share-price drop rather than to customer losses. It names Coinbase Chief Executive Brian Armstrong and Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas as defendants, alleging they had direct knowledge of both the UK fine and the breach impact. The suit seeks a jury trial and unspecified monetary relief, potentially adding millions more to the exchange’s burgeoning legal bill. Coinbase declined to comment on the new action, citing its policy on pending litigation. Regulatory Backdrop The company is already fighting a high-profile enforcement case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which alleges the platform operates as an unregistered securities exchange. Legal scholars say the overlapping battles could shape industry standards on disclosure and cyber-risk management. Some believe the shareholder suit might be consolidated with other cases, streamlining discovery but raising the potential settlement size. Investor Considerations Analysts at Mizuho Securities noted that while the breach itself appears limited, the incident highlights ongoing operational challenges as Coinbase scales support amid renewed bull-market interest. They warned that management faces a delicate balance between growth and risk, especially as fraudsters increasingly target crypto firms. Outlook If the plaintiffs succeed, Coinbase could face higher compliance costs and tighter scrutiny from both investors and regulators. Failure to address disclosure concerns promptly may also complicate efforts to expand internationally, where licenses often hinge on proven governance. Still, bulls argue the exchange’s liquidity profile and first-mover advantage position it to withstand litigation shocks. The case will test whether investors view the latest breach as a one-off operational lapse or evidence of systemic weaknesses. A preliminary hearing is expected later this summer, setting the stage for a protracted legal battle that could influence disclosure standards across the crypto sector.",Crypto News Today,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-05-26 07:37:05

Despite all these developments, skepticism towards BTC has not completely disappeared. Heavyweights of traditional finance such as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and investment legend Warren Buffett continue to criticize Bitcoin. Adam Back, one of the pioneers of the cryptocurrency world and Blockstream CEO, evaluated this situation in an interview and stated that the ongoing skepticism towards Bitcoin is not only specific to the financial community, and that even some names in the technology world have difficulty understanding Bitcoin. Let's also remind you that there are some claims that Adam Back is the founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. However, Back categorically denies these claims. Back is the founder of the proof of work concept on which Bitcoin is based. Related News: Cryptocurrency Exchange Kraken Chooses This Altcoin for Tokenized US Stocks, a First of Its Kind “Even people who know things like encryption, peer-to-peer networks, privacy, and public-key cryptography can still be indifferent. It's really surprising,” Back said, describing the indifference of some of the early cypherpunk community to Bitcoin as “crazy.” According to Back, the fact that Bitcoin is not a physical asset may cause some people to be distrustful. However, Back believes that these criticisms are misplaced, as Bitcoin is based on physical resources such as energy and mining equipment. With only 21 million units to be produced in total, Bitcoin's limited supply makes it a real inflation hedge, according to many advocates. Even Bitcoin's code structure can sometimes be a subject of questioning. In a statement he made in 2023, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon raised the question, “Everyone says it's limited to 21 million, but how can that be guaranteed?” Dimon also described Bitcoin as a “hyped scam.” However, it is also known that JPMorgan actively uses the blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin. Reminding that Bitcoin was born after the 2008 global financial crisis and that its first block included a newspaper headline about the bank rescue operations of the period, Back stated that those who were happy with the system had difficulty understanding Bitcoin. “If you have a well-paying job, are climbing the career ladder, life doesn't seem expensive to you and you can pay the mortgage; the promises of Bitcoin probably won't mean anything to you,” Back said, adding that Bitcoin offers an alternative to the current order by its nature. *This is not investment advice.

The address will also be streamed globally via Bitcoin Magazine’s channels. In his keynote, the vice president is expected to focus on innovation, financial sovereignty, and Bitcoin’s place in America’s future. The crypto industry has welcomed Vance’s views on the U.S. government’s interaction with open-source money, as the VP is well-known for his criticism of the agency’s regulatory overreach. He has also been critical of the current U.S. SEC leadership and vocal about the dangers of centralized financial control, pointing to events like Canada’s 2022 bank account freezes as examples of why Bitcoin mattered. The conference will also feature Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), 2024 presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, White House crypto czar David Sacks, executive director of the President’s Council of Advisors for digital assets Bo Hines, the U.S. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, Gemini founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, among others. “We are beyond honored to host the Vice President at the world’s largest Bitcoin conference.

Farage, who previously appeared at Bitcoin Amsterdam 2023 in a conversation with Peter McCormack, will return in 2025 for a fireside with Bitcoin Magazine’s Frank Corva. Lewis says BTC Inc. will demonstrate Bitcoin’s real-world utility at the event BTC Inc. CFO Didier Lewis said Bitcoin 2025 will be an opportunity for his company and the community to demonstrate Bitcoin’s real-world functionality as a medium of exchange.

The Bolt Card will be a key part of this experience, offering attendees an easy way to make purchases using Bitcoin. A total of 4,000 Bolt Cards will be issued to attendees, featuring four distinct limited-edition designs, each produced in a series of 1,000.

The store will offer a wide selection of Bitcoin-related merchandise, including hardware wallets, books, apparel, and limited-edition art. All items will be available at a 21% discount when paid for using Bitcoin via the Lightning Network. BTC Inc.

In a report sent to clients Friday, Thielen recommended a bear put spread on MSTR, involving a long position in the $370 put option and a short position in the $300 put, both expiring on June 27. This strategy will yield maximum profit if MSTR drops to $300 or lower by June 27, representing a bearish bet on the stock price. Put option insures the buyer against potential price drops in return for a small upfront premium payment. The maximum loss for the put spread buyers if MSTR's price embarks on a new uptrend is limited to the initial cost of the strategy, which was $13.89 on Friday. MSTR, however, fell 7% to $369 on Friday, according to data source TradingView. MicroStrategy holds 576,230 BTC, the largest for any publicly-listed company, having steadily accumulated coins since August 2020 through debt financing. Over the years, it has emerged as a preferred instrument for institutions looking to take exposure to BTC without having to actually own the cryptocurrency. The stock price has recently diverged from the upward-trending BTC price, raising alarm bells on crypto social media. While BTC hit a record high of over $110K last week, MSTR's rise stalled at around $440, falling well short of its lifetime peak of $543 reached in November. ""This trade captures the growing disconnect between Bitcoin’s strength and MicroStrategy’s fading momentum and volatility. Despite Bitcoin reaching all-time highs, MSTR remains significantly below its peak, suggesting investor enthusiasm is waning,"" Thielen said, explaining the bear put spread. Thielen correctly predicted BTC's recent rise into six figures. Note that a similar divergence between MSTR and bitcoin marked BTC's November 2021 top. Past data does not guarantee future results, and the latest divergence between MSTR and BTC does not necessarily mean that bitcoin's bull run is over. That said, its does suggest waning enthusiasm about BTC among tradfi investors. In addition, the MSTR bear put spread could offer a hedge against a potential weakness in BTC. ""Bitcoin is breaking records, but Strategy is stalling—and that divergence matters. Retail is still chasing the dream, unaware that the right-tail upside may be gone. This is where the game changes: when the middleman runs out of premium and the engine stalls,"" Thielen said. ""Buying a Strategy put spread can be profitable, but it is also an effective hedge against a long Bitcoin position,"" Thielen added.",Markets|Bitcoin|MSTR|Markets|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|ZRX|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-26 07:57:43

Yet, while ETH’s steady growth provides confidence, the market’s most aggressive capital is rotating into early-stage opportunities with sharper upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now at the forefront of that shift, with traders and strategists calling it the rare presale poised to outpace not just Ethereum, but also XRP, Solana, and Chainlink in Q3 2025. CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Moves, 50% Bonus, and Early-Stage Surge MAGACOIN FINANCE is dominating the early-stage landscape , with Stage 8 nearly full and over $8 million raised. Its scarcity-driven model—capped at 100 billion tokens, HashEx-audited contracts, and a viral political narrative—is attracting both retail and institutional capital. A recent 72.95 ETH whale buy, valued at over $133,000, highlights conviction behind MAGA’s breakout potential. Early buyers can still use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% bonus, making MAGA even more attractive for those targeting exponential upside before the $0.007 listing. Analysts are projecting 25x–50x returns from current entry levels, with some models suggesting even higher if momentum continues. As Stage 8 nears completion, smart money is positioning ahead of listings, recognizing MAGACOIN FINANCE as a rare ground-floor opportunity before price discovery goes public. XRP: Whale Accumulation and Bullish Sentiment XRP is consolidating near $2.85, with recent whale transactions totaling hundreds of millions and analysts forecasting a move toward $3.40–$5.50 as ETF interest and adoption accelerate. While XRP’s fundamentals remain strong, its upside is seen as steadier compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL) and Chainlink (LINK): Steady, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Solana is consolidating between $158 and $175, with technicals suggesting a potential breakout if resistance is cleared. Chainlink remains steady, with 2025 forecasts between $16.88 and $19.63, but both are being outpaced in sentiment and capital flows by the momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW Conclusion Ethereum’s reliability and Solana’s technical strength are noteworthy, but the most dramatic growth potential is now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE . With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 50x ROI, MAGA is the breakout name to watch as Q3 2025 approaches.

Prices on the Cetus decentralized exchange (DEX) suddenly dropped, and its liquidity pools were drained. The total estimated loss was over $230 million. That’s when SlowMist, a well-known blockchain security team, stepped in and launched an analysis of what they uncovered was both shocking and technical. What’s the Real Problem? According to SlowMist’s deep dive analysis , the core of the issue was a vulnerability in Cetus’ smart contract code, specifically, a function called checked_shlw that failed to properly detect an overflow in another function named get_delta_a. Now, what actually mean in simple terms? This bug caused the system to calculate token amounts incorrectly. It didn’t realize when the numbers got too big, so it assumed the attacker was adding a huge amount of liquidity, when in reality, they only added 1 token. That tiny flaw gave the attacker a massive opportunity. How the Attacker Took Advantage Here’s how the attacker carried out the exploit, step by step: Flash Loan Trigger: The attacker borrowed over 10 million haSUI tokens using a flash loan. This move caused the token price in the pool to drop by 99.9%. Trick Setup: They then created a very narrow liquidity position — a tiny window in the price range — which made the system believe a huge amount of liquidity was being added. The Exploit: Using the overflow flaw, they claimed to add trillions worth of liquidity, but only submitted 1 token. The contract didn’t catch the mismatch. Cashing Out: The attacker removed the fake liquidity in three stages and repaid the flash loan. Huge Profit: They walked away with 10 million haSUI and 5.7 million SUI, with almost no real investment. SlowMist Warning To Defi Developers This incident shows how a small coding mistake can lead to huge financial losses, especially in DeFi platforms where smart contracts run everything. According to SlowMist, if a critical function like checked_shlw doesn’t correctly detect errors like overflows, attackers can break the system logic entirely. SlowMist warns all DeFi developers to double-check their math functions, especially in areas involving token calculations and liquidity formulas. One unchecked line of code was all it took to let someone walk away with millions.",News|Uncategorized,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|SUI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-26 08:07:03

Instead of letting excess electricity go to waste, the country is tapping into the crypto economy, with over $1 billion spent on mining in the past year , surpassing its income from electricity exports. So far, Ethiopia has signed deals with more than 25 Bitcoin mining companies , attracting foreign investment and unlocking new revenue streams. These partnerships have quickly boosted the country's earnings and turned it into a rising star in the global crypto mining scene. The positive impact isn’t limited to Ethiopia. Across Africa, Bitcoin mining powered by renewable sources is supporting vital community projects. In rural areas of Kenya and Zambia, small-scale green energy grids now bring electricity to homes and businesses. Meanwhile, in the Congo’s Virunga National Park, crypto mining helps fund wildlife conservation and local economic development —keeping rangers paid and infrastructure maintained.

Derive users criticized the proposed valuation and raised concerns over token dilution for SNX holders. Both projects will continue independently, with Synthetix exploring alternatives for Perps V4 and Derive focusing on its own roadmap. Synthetix and Derive have officially shelved a proposed $27 million acquisition deal that would have seen the two decentralized derivatives platforms merge under a token swap agreement. Originally introduced in mid-May, the proposal involved Synthetix acquiring Derive’s treasury , technology, and full product suite. The move was intended to consolidate efforts into a single protocol on Ethereum. The plan was outlined in governance proposals SIP-415 (Synthetix) and DIP (Derive), both of which have now been withdrawn following internal review and pushback from community members. Derive Cites Community Pushback in Calling Off Synthetix Deal Derive, formerly known as Lyra, confirmed the cancellation , stating the decision followed “thoughtful discussion and community feedback.” Under the terms of the deal, Synthetix would have minted 29.3 million SNX tokens to complete the acquisition, valuing Derive at $27 million, with a swap ratio of 27 DRV per 1 SNX. However, opposition quickly mounted. Members of the Derive community challenged the valuation, pointing to Derive’s recent surge in revenue and arguing that it appeared undervalued relative to Synthetix. Concerns were also raised about the dilution impact on SNX holders, prompting calls for a reassessment. Synthetix had hoped the acquisition would enhance its upcoming Perps V4 release, which features a centralized limit order book architecture on Ethereum. The SIP-415 and DIP proposals to merge Synthetix and Derive have been mutually withdrawn following thoughtful discussion and community feedback. This moment reaffirms our independent path and the community's belief in it. Derive operations remain uninterrupted. Trading is live,… https://t.co/Uf5DmZNME5 — Derive (@derivexyz) May 21, 2025 Without the merger, the team will now look at alternative strategies to boost its product suite. For its part, Derive reaffirmed its commitment to building independently, positioning the decision as a moment to double down on its own roadmap. Synthetix Pushes New Staking Plan to Restore sUSD Peg Last month, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick urged SNX stakers to participate in the newly launched sUSD 420 Pool, a staking mechanism introduced to restore the sUSD stablecoin’s dollar peg. The pool offers a share of 5 million SNX tokens to users who lock up their sUSD for 12 months, aiming to reduce the token’s circulating supply and stabilize its value. Despite the incentive, Warwick admitted the process is still “very manual” and lacks a proper user interface, which is currently in development. He warned that if voluntary participation remains low even after the UI launches, more aggressive measures could follow. sUSD, a crypto-collateralized stablecoin backed by SNX, has struggled to maintain its peg, recently falling as low as $0.68 before recovering to $0.77. Warwick emphasized that the solution lies within the SNX community, whose combined wealth could resolve the issue. The initiative is part of SIP-420, which also shifts debt risk from stakers to the protocol itself.

Sharing a clip from a Coindesk report featuring lead anchor Christine Lee, XRP Governor drew attention to a predicted surge to $8, stating, “The breakout could be closer than anyone thinks.” BREAKING Top traders are now eyeing a massive $8 #XRP surge, momentum is building, and the charts are heating up. The breakout could be closer than anyone thinks… Are you ready? pic.twitter.com/FryK8SwVGh — XRP Governor (@xrpgovernor) May 24, 2025 Golden Cross Signals Bullish Shift At the center of the discussion is XRP/BTC’s first-ever golden cross on the weekly chart—a technical formation where the 50-week simple moving average (SMA) crosses above the 200-week SMA. This is generally interpreted as a bullish indicator, suggesting that XRP’s short-term momentum is now stronger than its long-term trend, relative to Bitcoin. The chart, analyzed by Coindesk’s Omkar Godbole, also shows that XRP has broken out of a four-year-long consolidation channel against BTC. This extended period of sideways movement between resistance and support levels has now given way to upward price action. The breakout and formation of the golden cross are signals that XRP may be entering a new bullish phase. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Altcoin Season Potential and ETF Speculation Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at BitGet Research, emphasized the potential broader implications of this movement. Speaking to Coindesk, Lee noted that a reduction in Bitcoin dominance could support the start of an altcoin rally. Experts have shown that reduced Bitcoin dominance usually gives way to altcoin surges . Lee suggested that XRP and Solana are particularly well-positioned to benefit from this shift, aided partly by ongoing speculation around the potential for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Regulatory Clarity and Target Projections Lee also pointed to XRP’s evolving regulatory landscape and recent breakout patterns as supporting factors for renewed investor interest. As a result, he suggested traders are increasingly targeting medium-term price levels between $3 and $8 for XRP. This combination of improving technical conditions and positive developments has encouraged analysts and traders to revisit XRP’s potential upside. The Coindesk chart marks the Golden Cross as a focal point, highlighting a critical area where bullish sentiment takes shape after years of relative underperformance. XRP’s price performance has historically been closely linked to developments in its regulatory status and broader market sentiment. With recent signs of stabilization on the legal front and excitement for the altcoin market in the short term, market participants are beginning to position themselves for a potential move toward higher targets.

The wallet has gone long on PEPE with $1 million at 10x leverage, flipping from billion-dollar bitcoin trades to high-stakes memecoin bets. The position is already up $500,000 as of European morning hours, with pepe up nearly 6% in the past few hours. Pseudonymous trader “James Wynn” — known as “moonpig” on decentralized exchange Hyperliquid — closed their $1.2 billion BTC long position with a $17.5 million loss on Monday. Wynn then opened a $1 billion short using 40x leverage, effectively wagering their entire $50 million wallet on the downside. Both positions are a record for an onchain platform and represent the biggest bets placed entirely on a blockchain-based service. Wynn’s new short was opened at an average price of $107,077, and has already netted about $3 million in profit as BTC hovered just below that level Monday, before losing some value. The trade is a high-risk musical chairs event: if BTC rises above $110,446, Wynn’s position could be liquidated unless additional collateral is posted, data shows.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

Resistance for BTC is at $111,813 Support for BTC/USD is at $106,355 The BTC price analysis for 26 May confirms that BTC faces a surge in bullish volatility as it surged above $110K. However, bears defended that level strongly, resulting in a pullback below $110K. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin price faces intense volatility around $110K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that BTC faced a strong surge toward $110K. However, sellers strongly defended further surges, resulting in a slight bearish correction below Fib channels. The 24-hour volume has surged to $2.1 billion, showing a rise in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $110,019, surging by over 1.6% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin shows bullish volatility The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level but trades near the overbought region at 70, hinting that a bearish correction might be on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls face minor resistance at $104K The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bears are strengthening their position to hold the price below the $106K level. Currently, bears are aiming for a drop below EMA50 trend line.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $111,813, it will fuel a bullish rally to $113,395. BTC/USDT Chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $106,355, beginning a bearish trend to $101,962. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced increased buying domination in recent hours as buyers gained strong confidence. As a result, it broke through immediate Fib channels, resulting in a surge toward $110K. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are set to expand the Trump family’s cryptocurrency business portfolio by investing in Bitcoin mining-focused Hut 8. Hut 8, based in Miami, announced the launch of its majority-owned subsidiary, American Bitcoin, dedicated to Bitcoin mining and strategic reserve development. Bitcoin price prediction May 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. In the last few weeks of April, the price of Bitcoin recovered smoothly and touched a high around $95K. Will Bitcoin continue its recovery rally in May? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $91,000 and be pushed further, at least $108,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $85,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction May 2025 $85,000 $91,000 $108,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|UNI,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-26 08:11:42

Global crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) recorded $3.3 billion of inflows during the week ending May 24, bringing total inflows year-to-date to a new record of $10.8 billion, CoinShares reported on May 26. CoinShares head of research James Butterfill said total assets under management (AUM) in crypto ETPs briefly reached an all-time high of $187.5 billion, reflecting strong investor interest. “We believe that growing concerns over the US economy, driven by the Moody’s downgrade and the resulting spike in treasury yields, have prompted investors to seek diversification through digital assets,” Butterfill wrote. Crypto ETPs keep breaking records The latest CoinShares data marks another record-breaking milestone for crypto ETPs, following a historic surge in YTD inflows the previous week. In mid-May, crypto investment products added $785 million in new inflows, pushing the YTD total to $7.5 billion by May 16, according to CoinShares. The new inflow record not only surpassed the previous peak of $7.2 billion recorded in February 2025 but also fully recovered the nearly $7 billion of outflows seen during the subsequent price correction in February and March, Butterfill said.

Bitcoin price jumped to $110,000, while the market cap of all coins jumped to $3.57 trillion. This article provides top forecasts for trending cryptocurrencies like Pepe (PEPE), Sui (SUI), and Zebec Network (ZBCN). Zebec Network price analysis ZBCN price chart | Source: TradingView Zebec Network price has gone parabolic in the past few weeks, moving from a low of $0.0007085 earlier this month to $0.005500, a 642% surge that has pushed its market cap to over $460 million. This surge happened as the Solana ecosystem rebounded and as investors embraced its technology. For starters, Zebec is a blockchain project in the payment and real world asset tokenization industry. It offers Zebec debet cards and other RWA solutions. According to its website, it has over 50,000 users and over 250 payroll enterprise clients. The daily chart shows that the ZBCN token price went parabolic and crossed the important resistance level at $0.002135, its highest point on February 22. By moving above that level, the coin invalidated the double-top chart pattern. ZBCN price has moved above all moving averages, a sign that bulls are in control. However, oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stochastic have moved to the overbought level. Therefore, while the uptrend may continue, there is a risk that the Zebec price will have a harsh reversal in the next few days. This retreat will happen because of profit-taking among investors and mean reversal. Mean reversal is a situation where an asset moves back to its moving average levels. If this happens, the most likely scenario is where Zebec price drops and retests the support level at $0.002135 and then resumes the uptrend. Pepe price technical analysis Pepe chart by TradingView Pepe, the giant Ethereum-based meme coin, has done well this year as it moved from a low of $0.000005252 on March 11 to $0.000015 tody. The coin has formed a golden cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages have crossed each other. Pepe has also formed a bullish flag pattern, a popular continuation sign. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the coin will continue rising as bulls target the all-time high of $0.00002823. If this happens, the coin will rise by about 96% from the current level. Read more: Pepe coin price prediction: 3 reasons this meme coin will surge Sui price technical analysis Chart by TradingView Sui Network has been in the spotlight in the past few days after the giant $220 million hack on its biggest DEX platform. As we wrote last week, the hack will likely have a minimal impact on its operations in the long term. The daily chart shows that the Sui price has remained at $3.65 on Monday, a few points above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. It has formed a bullish pennant pattern, a popular continuation sign. Therefore, the Sui price will likely have a bullish breakout in the coming days as bulls target the year-to-date high of $5.3570, the highest point in January this year. This price target is about 47% above the current level.

The transaction, filed on May 20, shows that Reschenthaler sold between $1,001 and $15,000 worth of SOL on May 12, a day when Solana was trading at approximately $170.48. Currently, SOL is trading at $177.99, meaning the lawmaker exited just ahead of a small upward move in the token’s price. SOL price performance since May 12. Source: Finbold The filing is part of the routine public disclosures required under the STOCK Act, which mandates that members of Congress report financial trades within 45 days. In this case, the disclosure came eight days after the trade, well within the legal window, but notable given the ongoing debate around lawmakers trading cryptocurrencies and other volatile digital assets. Why did Reschenthaler buy Solana? Solana, which has gained renewed attention in 2025 for its role in hosting meme tokens like Official Trump ( TRUMP ) which surged up until May 22 in anticipation of Trump’s crypto dinner, continues to be one of the most actively traded layer-1 tokens on U.S. exchanges. The sale by Reschenthaler comes amid broader market momentum, with Solana up over 17% in the last month. Notably, this isn’t the first time the Congressman has disclosed crypto activity. Earlier filings show trades involving Bitcoin ( BTC ) and XRP , indicating a pattern of exposure to high-profile digital assets. As congressional crypto oversight tightens, trades like these remain under the spotlight, especially when they involve timely entries or exits from trending tokens like Solana.

Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) was trading at $38.3 at press time, up by 315% from its April low and pushing its market capitalization to $12.85 billion. The rally has been driven by surging trading volume, growing open interest, and rising network fees. According to da t a from DeFiLlama, Hyperliquid’s seven-day volume climbed 13.36% to $78.67 billion, making it the most active player in DeFi right now. In terms of derivatives trading, Hyperliquid has now processed over $1.56 trillion in perpetual futures volume, far exceeding Jupiter’s $310.9 billion, the second-largest platform in this space. This momentum has translated into a record-high open interest of $1.39 billion. Perpetual futures, which are similar to traditional futures contracts but without expiration dates, have become a go-to tool for crypto traders. They let users apply leverage and aim for higher returns, something that’s helped fuel HYPE’s rise. Additionally, weekly fee revenue reached an all-time high of $22.26 million, marking four consecutive weeks of fee growth. The spike in fees is especially important because Hyperliquid could potentially use a portion of it to buy back HYPE from the open market, which may boost the price by cutting down supply. You might also like: Bitcoin reclaims $109K as Trump extends EU tariffs deadline to allow for talks Adding to the momentum, Hyperliquid recently submitted two formal letters to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in response to its call for public input on perpetual futures and 24/7 crypto trading. The move was well received by the crypto community, with many praising Hyperliquid’s proactive engagement with regulators. HYPE shot up roughly 15% within hours after the announcement. Institutional and large investor interest in HYPE also appears to be rising. According to blockchain data shared by Lookonchain, two whale addresses recently acquired approximately $10.09 million worth of HYPE. Such large transactions often trigger follow-on demand from retail investors who track whale activity as a sentiment indicator. This retail interest is already visible. Google Trends data shows a sharp spike in search volume for “HYPE,” which further confirms an uptick in interest among retail users, and is often a precursor to increased trading activity and market momentum.. Technically, things are looking just as strong. On the 4-hour chart, HYPE recently broke out of a symmetrical triangle pattern, a common bullish signal. It’s also trading well above both the 20-day and 50-day simple moving averages, which points to a solid uptrend and usually acts as a buy signal for many traders. HYPE price, 20-day and 50-day SMA chart — May 26 | Source: crypto.news On top of that, HYPE appears to be forming a textbook cup-and-handle pattern. This pattern, often seen as a bullish continuation setup, includes a rounded bottom, a horizontal resistance, and a short consolidation phase. A cup and handle pattern forms on 4-hour chart — May 26 | Source: crypto.news In HYPE’s case, the “cup” had a depth of around 67.6% on the 4-hour/USDT chart, and if this pattern plays out fully, the projected target would be around $47.7, roughly 24.5% higher than current levels.

According to a report from local media Edaily, lawmakers from the South Korean Democratic party are pushing for the government to start institutionalizing Korean won-pegged stablecoins . Chairman of the party’s Digital Asset Committee, Min Byeong-deok, believes the global stablecoin market has the potential to become “bigger than artificial intelligence or semiconductors” in the near future. Min emphasized the urgency of institutionalizing stablecoins pegged to the Korean won. He views it as a way to not only strengthen its national fiat currency through crypto, but also to potentially boost global demand for won-backed assets. “We need to take the lead in institutionalizing stablecoins before U.S. dollar-based stablecoins become firmly established. That is the only way we can secure a sure position in the global battle for stablecoin hegemony,” said Min in his statement.

Inside sources claim Lee is interested in accelerating the roll-out of KRW stablecoins, aiming to establish them quickly before U.S. proceeds to establish stablecoin bills. These regulations could potentially boost the domination of strongholds like Circle ( USDC ) and Tether’s ( USDT ) U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins on the market. “These two [stable]coins account for 90% of the stablecoin market in the United States, and are also used in some areas of Korea, such as Dongdaemun, where many foreign payments are made,” continued Min. Min said that he is currently urging South Korean lawmakers to pass a stablecoin bill, with a working draft titled “Basic Act on Digital Assets.” Min has reportedly conducted a second review process with industry experts and the media. He plans to submit the bill after the third review. Most recently, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act of 2025, or the GENIUS Act passed the U.S. Senate vote, garnering 66 votes in favor. It is currently headed to a full floor vote, bringing it closer to becoming formalized as the first U.S. stablecoin bill.

Stablecoin issuer Tether ( USDT ) says its main focus will remain outside the United States, even as U.S. lawmakers make progress on new rules for stablecoins. Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, told Bloomberg in an interview that it was important for the company to see “how the Genius Act is distinguishing between foreign issuers and domestic issuers,” adding that Tether’s main interest would remain “outside of the U.S.” “We are looking at the Genius Act in a way that will allow us to be compliant. We can be compliant while still having a strong focus on foreign markets.” Paolo Ardoino You might also like: US banks plot joint stablecoin as regulation looms over crypto sector On Monday, May 19, the Genius Act, a Senate bill backed by the crypto industry, advanced in Congress. The House Financial Services Committee has approved its own version of a stablecoin bill, though it has yet to reach a full vote. Stablecoin bills in both chambers would require issuers to fully back tokens with cash or safe assets like short-term U.S. Treasuries. The rules would also place stablecoin firms under anti-money-laundering regulations and the Bank Secrecy Act. Ardoino noted that while stablecoins are important in the United States, the country already has many payment options such as Zelle, PayPal, debit cards, credit cards, and cash. While Tether has faced past scrutiny in the U.S. and settled with regulators in 2021, the firm’s reserves are now managed by Cantor Fitzgerald, a financial services firm formerly led by Howard Lutnick, who recently transferred ownership to his children and outside investors as he joined the White House.

Dedaub explained that the flaw involved an “overflow” in the math used by Cetus’s automated market maker, where a miswritten condition failed to properly handle the most significant bits of large numerical inputs and “didn’t produce the intended result.” Instead of rejecting oversized values, the system truncated them, causing the output to appear much smaller than it should have. This allowed the attacker to deposit just a single token while the protocol mistakenly credited them with an enormous liquidity position. They then used that position to withdraw large amounts of real assets from the pools. You might also like: SUI price stalls below $4 resistance as $223M Cetus Protocol hack weighs down on sentiment According to Dedaub, a similar vulnerability had been flagged in early 2023 by blockchain security firm Ottersec during an audit of the protocol’s codebase when it was deployed on Aptos. However, after the code was later ported to the Sui network, the underlying issue still remained. Although developers attempted to implement safeguards, the overflow check was flawed, allowing the same type of exploit to slip through unnoticed. “This incident shows why edge cases in DeFi can’t be ignored,” Dedaub warned, adding that complex math in decentralized finance needs careful review and testing. It urged developers to verify overflow protection manually, especially when using large numbers or advanced math. Cetus exploit triggered sell-off Cetus, a leading DEX on the SUI network, was hacked in the early hours of May 22 , triggering one of the largest losses in the Sui ecosystem to date. Initial investigations claimed the incident stemmed from an “oracle bug.”. The exploit led to over $223 million in losses across various liquidity pools, sparking a broad sell-off in related tokens, including SUI and CETUS, which dropped over 40% in the hours after the breach. Memecoins and smaller market cap tokens native to the network saw even steeper losses, with some plunging by over 90%. In response, the Sui Foundation coordinated with validators to freeze around $163 million of the stolen funds. Cetus has also announced a $5 million bounty for information that identifies those responsible.

TRX Up 1.25 Percent: High Volume Support Area Pushes Price Up TRX formed a new trading range in the $0.269–$0.273 range and rose 1.25% amid strong volume support in this region. TRX’s recent stability is remarkable despite the uncertainty created in the markets by the escalating trade wars between major economies. While Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are volatile, TRX’s steady rise indicates an increase in institutional interest in blockchain projects that stand out with their practical use cases and high transaction volume. Technical Outlook: Strong Momentum Backed by Volume TRX has traded in a 1.25% range ($0.269–$0.273) over the past 24 hours. The price remained stable with strong buying at key support levels. Between 09:00 and 11:00 in the morning, the price climbed from $0.270 to $0.273 with a trading volume exceeding 120 million, and this region was recorded as a high-volume support area. At 23:00, the trading volume rose above the average, indicating that momentum was regained around $0.272. A mini capitulation occurred at 01:24, with TRX falling sharply from $0.2728 to $0.2721 with a volume of 2.58 million units. However, immediately afterwards, strong buying of 2.76 million units took place in the $0.2719-0.2720 range between 01:57-01:58, and the price climbed back up to the $0.2724 level. According to technical data, TRX is in a position to continue its upward trend with both the resistance it has shown at short-term resistance levels and strong support volume. Analysts state that TRX could have a wider upward movement area if the price permanently breaks through the $0.273 resistance. The continued institutional interest and stability shown amid general volatility in the markets places TRX among the tokens to watch in the short term. *This is not investment advice.
