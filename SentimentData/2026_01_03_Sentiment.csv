56744739,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=887900,1767389125,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56744739.jpeg,"International stocks returned roughly 33% to U.S. investors in 2025, far outpacing the S&P 500's 18% return",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/foreign-stocks-just-had-their-best-year-against-wall-street/,"Americans who put money in foreign stocks last year did way better than those who stayed within the home market. An exchange-traded fund tracking the MSCI all-country world ex-U.S. index brought in roughly 33% returns to U.S. investors in 2025. The index cover s 85 % of stock investments available outside America. The S&P 500 returned about 18% over the same period. Two things matter when you invest overseas. How stocks perform in their local markets, and what happens with the dollar. When the dollar gets weaker, your foreign holdings are worth more dollars back home. The dollar dropped around 9% last year against a basket of other currencies , Fa ctSet data shows. That helped pump up returns. “De-dollarization” was everywhere in 2025. Concerns about U.S. government spending and political turmoil sent investors looking elsewhere. Foreign stocks got attention. So did gold and crypto. Foreign markets beat U.S. without currency help Currency moves don’t tell the whole story, though. Goldman Sachs analysts had pushed clients toward global diversification in 2025. They broke down major market performance using four measures: earnings growth, valuations, dividends, and currency shifts. Almost every major index they studied beat the S&P 500 through mid-December, even withou t cu rrency gains. France’s CAC 40 was the exception. Japan’s MSCI index returned around 25% in 2025 despite the yen staying flat against the dollar. South Korea’s benchmark soared about 100% in dollar terms. Spain’s index climbed more than 60% in euros alone. Valuations drove a lot of this, Goldman Sachs found . Investors paid more for each unit of earnings in these markets. Take the price-earnings-growth ratio. The gap between U.S. and international PEG ratios narrowed by almost a third through mid-December 2025, according to Goldman Sachs. American stocks still traded at a premium. By mid-December, that premium stood at more than double the average since 2005. Some analysts expect the gap to keep closing. Yardeni Research recently said it “no longer makes much sense” to recommend clients “overweight” U.S. stocks. The firm had given that advice since 2010. International stocks look cheaper based on forward price-to-earnings ratios. Plus, corporate earnings globally have stayed solid. “It’s a big world with many countries having large populations that aspire to a better standard of living. Globalization isn’t dead,” Yardeni Research wrote. Tech stocks still dominate overseas indexes Banks and financial companies make up the biggest chunk of the MSCI all-country ex-U.S. benchmark. But here’s something interesting – the top five individual stocks are all tech companies . Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the Netherlands’ ASML, China’s Alibaba and Tencent, and Korea’s Samsung Electronics. Does this mean international stocks don’t really diversify away from America’s tech-heavy market? Peter Oppenheimer, Goldman’s chief global equity strategist and head of macro research in Europe, says not necessarily. Tech stocks started moving more independently in 2025, he noted. Picking winners got riskier because you’re more likely to pick a loser. “What you should be doing is seeking more diversification within tech,” Oppenheimer says. Nobody can predict what 2026 will bring. Maybe the dollar strengthens. Foreign earnings could stumble. U.S. valuations might shift. But the odds of everything moving together are slim. That’s the whole point of spreading bets globally – the advantages come from different directions.

56744454,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=871854,1767389425,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/56744454.jpeg,XRP Enters A Make-or-Break Zone As This Long-Term Support Cracks,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-make-or-break-zone/,"XRP is facing a critical turning point as key long-term support gives way for the first time in over 400 days. After consolidating near $2, the recent break below the 200-day moving average signals mounting pressure, putting the cryptocurrency in a high-stakes zone where the next move could define its near-term trajectory. Price Stalls Below The $2 Wall As Volatility Compresses In an X post, Umair Crypto noted that XRP has faced heavy resistance near the psychological $2 level, forcing the price into a tight consolidation range between $1.85 and $1.88. Such conditions often precede a sharp move, suggesting XRP may be nearing a decisive breakout or breakdown phase. Related Reading: Expert Says XRP ‘Haters’ Miss The Bigger Picture: Here’s What It Is On the daily timeframe, XRP still displays signs of resilience despite the overhead pressure. Buyers have so far managed to defend nearby support zones, preventing a clean breakdown in structure. This defensive price action keeps the broader bullish scenario alive, especially if momentum improves and XRP reclaims higher levels with stronger volume confirmation. However, a wider view from the 3-day chart introduces caution. The current support region aligns closely with the 200-day simple moving average. XRP’s latest close below this moving average marks the first time in more than 400 days, highlighting a notable technical shift that could weigh on sentiment if not quickly reversed. This development places XRP at a critical inflection point. The chart shows a relatively thin historical structure following the explosive November 2024 rally that lifted the price from $0.50 to $3. With fewer well-defined demand zones beneath, any acceleration in selling pressure could lead to faster downside moves. Umair Crypto identified interim support levels around $1.45, $1.10, and $0.69 as potential downside targets if a confirmed breakdown unfolds. Attention remains firmly on the coming sessions, particularly as Ripple’s recent $1 billion token unlock introduces additional supply, adding another layer of pressure to an already sensitive market setup. XRP Former Ceiling Turns Into A Structural Floor According to a monthly XRP update shared by crypto analyst Chad, the asset is currently holding above a key level that previously acted as resistance and has now flipped into support. This shift suggests that buyers are still defending the structure, keeping the broader setup constructive despite recent price action hesitation. Related Reading: XRP Price Slides Under Support, Bearish Continuation Signals Emerge A clear double-top formation can be spotted on the chart. However, Chad notes that it does not have to fully play out as long as XRP continues to hold above the 0.786 logarithmic Fibonacci level. Overall, XRP appears to be in a consolidation phase rather than a decisive move. Price action is currently contained within the 0.786 to 0.886 log Fibonacci range, signaling a period of balance as the market awaits a clearer directional catalyst.

It normally occurs when massive property goes decelerating and capital begins searching for the next dimension of expansion. These moments are not initiated loudly. They manifest themselves in the form of stable involvement, reduction in supply and increased infrastructure indicators. This change is reemerging in 2026. One new DeFi cryptocurrency that is priced at only $0.04 only at the time is starting to enter the market conversation more frequently. Not in the form of hype, but as a programmed procedure toward implementation. The Presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Has Shaped Up Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now selling at $0.04. This price was launched with the initiation of Phase 7, which was preceded by an increase of close to 20%compared to the previous phase. The presale itself started in early 2025 and started at $0.01 at Phase 1. The token has been in several systematic stages since its launch. MUTM has advanced into a 300% growth at a price range of $0.01 to $0.04. The initial price of the MUTM launch is set at $0.06 and this puts the Phase 1 participants in a position to appreciate at approximately 500 %. The protocol has already raised $19.45 million. It has increased the number of participants to 18,650 to the holder base. These figures indicate that this has dispersed widely and not a few who have dominated supply. Phase 7 is active and the remaining supply is tightening at an even faster rate than in previous phases. Mutuum Finance also accepts card payments and this has enlarged access to crypto native users. There is a participation leaderboard displayed every day and 24 hours to encourage daily involvement, as opposed to high turnover. The Protocol Level Overview Mutuum Finance is a DeFi crypto that is aimed at lending infrastructures. This protocol is based on dual lending markets. This implies that it is the sustenance of two parallel systems that have clear rules. One of the sides enables borrowers to provide assets to lending pools. These pools yield on the basis of the demand to borrow. The other side facilitates the lending agreements in a structured manner that has fixed terms. These systems, together with one another, are supposed to balance flexibility with predictability. One of the major components of this design is mtTokens. These tokens indicate the share of lending in the protocol of a user. The development of usage causes accrual-based value to be reflected in the price of mtTokens that is in relation to actual protocol performance. Security has not been an add on, it has been approached as a core layer. Halborn Security reviewed the project. Furthermore, one of the CertiK token scans showed a score of 90 out of 100. There is also a bug bounty system of $50,000 to serve as a motivation to keep on code testing. Phase 7 and V1 Protocol Launch Phase 7 is currently advancing. This coincides very well with the V1 launch developments . V1 will be able to trigger core lending functionality and open the protocol to live usage, according to official statements. This combination matters. The supply is tightening now when utility is slightly about to be launched. In the past this overlap frequently occurred as a transition in the value of a token by the markets. The indications of bigger allocations during recent phases have also been taken. Whale sized inputs imply increased confidence among the participants who have longer term horizons. Such allotments lead to still lower supply. A Growth Story Heading Into Q1 2026 The best cryptocurrencies do not imply substituting it. It is being discussed as a serious option in another category. Mutuum Finance is not a meme coin, nor the copy of existing giants. It is establishing itself as DeFi crypto based on lending, flow of revenue and controlled growth. MUTM is currently being valued at a point in the early stages of its roadmap at $0.04. The project is in build mode as it shifts to the execution with Phase 7 in progress, V1 approaching, and infrastructure layers matching. Adoption and delivery will determine whether it will be as large as top 10 discussions allude. The fact is that the invisibility of Mutuum Finance is no longer as such. It is emerging as one of the cheapest crypto projects that are keeping the eyes of its market participants as the year 2026 nears.

That sharp month-to-month decline was driven by fewer large-scale heists, but the damage that did occur was still significant. Reports have disclosed a mix of scams and technical failures that together made December anything but risk-free. December Losses Fall 60% PeckShield tracked roughly 26 major exploits during the month. The largest single hit was an address poisoning scam that took about $50 million. In that scheme, victims were tricked into sending funds to an address that looked almost identical to a legitimate one. Other large losses included a $27 million drain from a multi-signature wallet tied to a private key leak, about $7 million tied to a Trust Wallet exploit, and roughly $3.9 million linked to issues involving the Flow protocol. These figures were reported across multiple outlets and match the totals PeckShield compiled. #PeckShieldAlert December 2025 witnessed ~26 major crypto exploits, resulting in total losses of ~$76M. This figure represents a decrease of over 60% from November’s total of $194.27M, marking a significant reduction in monthly losses. Notably: Wallet 0xcB80…819 lost $50M… pic.twitter.com/CNW3R6646j — PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) January 1, 2026 Major Scams Still Cause Big Damage Address poisoning stood out because it relies on human error rather than a broken protocol. A small mistake — copying the wrong address — could wipe out a large transfer. Trust Wallet’s loss was linked to a browser extension weakness that allowed attackers to move funds. In some cases, reimbursements were being discussed by affected services. Reports have disclosed that private key exposure, even in wallets meant to be secure, continues to be a common root cause of big losses. Some experts say the fall in dollar losses reflects fewer massive breaches, not a vanishing of threats. Security teams have been more active, and some wallets tightened checks. But the methods used by attackers did not disappear. Scams that prey on mistakes, like the address trick, are still in play, and sophisticated intrusions remain possible. It was observed that a handful of incidents accounted for the bulk of December’s total, which helps explain the large swing in monthly totals. Close monitoring into these trends by regulators and other stakeholders like platform operators will continue as well. There have been growing pressures to provide better protections for exchanges and other wallets when there has been a breach; and for more timely actions after the compromise has been identified.

His exit from federal custody was made possible through the First Step Act, a prison reform law signed by Donald Trump during his first term in office. The news broke Thursday night after Ilya posted the announcement himself on X, saying, “Thanks to President Trump’s First Step Act, I have been released from prison early.” Ilya had been sentenced in November 2024 to five years behind bars. That came after he pleaded guilty to helping move billions of dollars in stolen crypto and confessed to the Bitfinex hack, which at current market prices totals more than $4 billion. His prison term factored in time already served after his 2022 arrest, giving him credit that slashed down his time inside. Trump’s First Step Act reduces sentences and puts crypto offenders on home confinement The First Step Act, passed in December 2018, was introduced as a bipartisan attempt to reduce the size of the U.S. federal prison system. It allowed inmates to earn early release or home confinement if they met certain behavior requirements and were deemed low risk under a federal assessment system. Ilya appears to have qualified, and as of Friday morning, a federal inmate search showed him set for official release on February 9. According to CNBC, a Trump administration official confirmed that Ilya “has served significant time on his sentence and is currently on home confinement consistent with statute and Bureau of Prisons policies.” Heather Morgan, Ilya’s wife, also confirmed his early return in her own X post, two minutes after his, writing that,“The best New Years present I could get was finally having my husband home after 4 years of being apart,” and attached a photo of them smiling together. The best New Years present I could get was finally having my husband home after 4 years of being apart. 💜🙏🪬 https://t.co/toUJ0Bz70h pic.twitter.com/plsnktmJ5l — Heather ""Razzlekhan"" Morgan (@HeatherReyhan) January 2, 2026 Heather had pleaded guilty alongside Ilya in the same case for helping launder the stolen funds and was sentenced to 18 months in February 2025, only to announce her early release in October. In a video posted on October 26, Heather appeared in a bathtub wearing just a towel and addressed her followers: “Why hello Razzlers, I have missed you,” using her rap alias, Razzlekhan. She ended with a nod to Trump: “It is very good to be back, and I want to give a shout out to Papa Trump for making my 18-month sentence shorter.” The timing of his release lines up with the White House’s expanded use of the law in 2025 under Trump’s second term. On his first day back in office, Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht, the Silk Road founder who had been serving a life sentence. Then, in October, he pardoned Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, the founder of Binance. CZ had pleaded guilty in 2023 to enabling money laundering on the platform.

The new law was signed on Thursday by President Serdar Berdimuhamedov. New Legislation According to the report by Associated Press, the law places virtual assets under civil law and introduces a licensing framework for cryptocurrency exchanges overseen by the central bank. However, digital assets will not be recognized as a means of payment, currency, or security. Internet access in Turkmenistan also remains tightly restricted by the state, which may limit the practical use of cryptocurrencies. The move comes as the Central Asian nation continues to rely heavily on its natural gas sector to support the economy. It is currently developing a pipeline project to supply gas to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India. Turkmenistan is gradually moving toward greater use of digital systems in both public administration and economic policy. In April 2025, authorities approved a law allowing electronic visas to make it easier for foreigners to enter the country. After becoming independent in 1991, Turkmenistan gained a reputation for strict border controls, and many visa requests were denied without clear reasons. In 1995, it declared itself a neutral state under then-president Saparmurat Niyazov, who limited foreign influence and ran a highly controlled political system until his death in 2006. During that period, the economy remained heavily dependent on gas exports, and now China happens to be its primary buyer. Since taking office in 2022, President Serdar Berdimuhamedov has shown signs of limited opening. Kyrgyzstan’s MoU With Binance Founder CZ Another former Soviet Central Asian republic, Kyrgyzstan, is also working towards strengthening its digital asset ambitions in April after Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the country’s National Investment Agency (NIA). Announced on April 3 by President Sadyr Zhaparov, the agreement aims to support the development of Kyrgyzstan’s cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem. The partnership will see cooperation on regulatory consulting, infrastructure development, and education programs. According to officials, the focus will be on improving technological infrastructure, enhancing digital asset security, and training local specialists in areas such as blockchain, cybersecurity, and virtual asset management. The NIA said the collaboration is intended to help position Kyrgyzstan as a regional hub for blockchain innovation in Central Asia.

According to the model, all three could see some serious volatility in the weeks ahead, with sharp moves possible in both directions. Below is a breakdown of Qwen3-MAX’s two-sided forecasts, covering both bullish upside targets and bearish downside risks for each asset as 2026 gets underway. Ripple (XRP): Alibaba AI Predicts Rally Toward $5 by Year-End Under its bearish scenario, Alibaba’s AI projects that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could slide from its current price near $1.90 to roughly $1.50 and stay in that range as a worst-case outcome. You can already hear the loudest “I would take it” from XRP holders if that is truly the worst-case scenario. Source: Ailbaba AI Prediction On the optimistic side, Alibaba’s model envisions a powerful breakout, with XRP potentially jumping 82% to reach $3.50 or even $5 before the end of the year, nearly two times its previous all-time high. The launch of U.S.-listed spot XRP ETFs could act as a catalyst for fresh institutional inflows during the new year, mirroring early demand patterns seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Source: XRPUSD / TradingView There are three key levels to focus on right now on the XRP chart. To remain in a bullish structure, XRP must continue holding above $1.80 as we move into Q1. It just broke above the first level at $1.90. If that rally continues, a retest of the $2.00 psychological resistance should be expected. The RSI is around 64, which still leaves room for a short-term push toward $2.20. Solana (SOL): Alibaba AI Forecasts a 400% Upside Move Alibaba AI’s bull case for Solana SOL going into 2026 is to target $300 to $400 price range. That is almost 400% from the current price. Solana still looks like the coin of the cycle. Alibaba’s AI outlook points to Solana’s unmatched speed, booming DeFi activity, and growing institutional interest as the main drivers. With all of that happening while price continues to hold above its 18-month support, Solana could be quietly setting up for a big move heading into 2026. From a technical angle, SOL has now pushed above the short-term resistance around $128. If it can hold and stay above the $127.50 to $130.50 zone, momentum could pick up quickly. That would open the path to $133 first, followed by a retest of the channel top near $139 to $140. If it fails to hold this area, $118 comes back into focus, with $112 sitting as the next deeper support to watch. If it fails to rally, Alibaba AI predicts the price could drop below the $100 mark in the bearish scenario. Bitcoin (BTC): Alibaba AI Says Bitcoin Could Surge Past $150K After closing 2025 in the red and breaking the classic four-year cycle, Alibaba’s AI expects Bitcoin to come back swinging and push past $150K by the end of the year. The call is driven by accelerating spot ETF inflows and macro conditions that favor hard assets. In a stronger scenario, the model even sees Bitcoin peaking around $175K. Bitcoin is heading into 2026 at a pretty critical point. Price is getting squeezed, RSI is starting to curl up, and institutions keep stacking, even though prediction markets are not convinced a fast six-figure breakout is coming. On Polymarket, $120,000 is still seen as the most likely outcome, while BTC continues to coil inside a tight range around $89,000. Whatever move comes next is likely going to set the mood for the rest of the year. If Bitcoin can get a clean close above $90,500, that would break the triangle to the upside and likely send the price toward $92,800 first, then $95,000. A break below $87,000 would hurt the setup and open the door to a move down toward $85,800. For now, though, the structure still slightly favors the upside. Maxi Doge Is Built For Moments Like This When the market is having violent swings, uncertainty, and two-sided chaos across majors like XRP and Solana. History shows one thing clearly: memecoins thrive when conviction disappears. This is where Maxi Doge stands out. Maxi Doge is not trying to compete with Layer 1 narratives, ETF headlines, or institutional timelines. It exists for pure momentum, community-driven upside. It also reflexive moves when traders rotate out of crowded trades and into asymmetric bets. Every cycle, when majors stall or chop, capital looks for something louder, faster, and unapologetically speculative. That is exactly where Doge-style assets explode, and Maxi Doge is positioned as a high-beta expression of that rotation. The hype is already showing in the numbers. The $MAXI presale has raised almost $4.4 million, while early backers are earning up to 71% APY through staking rewards. No promises of revolution. No overengineered roadmap. Just liquidity, attention, and crowd psychology. If 2026 starts with volatility, indecision, and sharp rotations, Maxi Doge is designed for that environment, not despite it.

Her time with the agency saw her garner a reputation for being a crypto skeptic or anti-crypto. However, she retained her seat after fellow skeptic Gary Gensler departed the commission until she served out her term. Caroline Crenshaw is moving forward According to the SEC, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw devoted over a decade of her life to service, providing distinguished service to the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to an official release from the SEC, over those years Crenshaw served, she was a steadfast advocate for the agency’s mission – demonstrating clarity of purpose and generosity of spirit even in the face of hostility from industry leaders who thought she was not bullish enough on crypto. Commissioner Crenshaw was said to have listened carefully, engaged substantively, and approached every day with the sole purpose of protecting investor interests and strengthening markets. “We join our colleagues across the agency in thanking Commissioner Crenshaw for her service and in wishing her every success in the chapters ahead,” the official release read. “We know that she will continue to have a profound and positive influence wherever her dedication leads her next, and we thank her once again for her exemplary service.” With her exit, the SEC is now led by a 3-0 Republican majority, two of whom were nominated by President Donald Trump. At this time, the President has not announced plans to bring in a replacement that can restore the commission’s bipartisan balance. As such, the agency’s future stance on digital assets remains uncertain, especially as it faces increasing pressure from lawmakers and industry stakeholders who want more clarity in regulations. Crenshaw is yet to publicly disclose her plans after leaving the SEC. However, there is little doubt her influence on crypto policy will be felt long after her departure. Crenshaw exits amid broader shift among US regulators Caroline Crenshaw’s exit from the SEC did not come as a surprise, and for many in the crypto industry, it could not have come early enough. Still, her exit is happening amid a reshuffling of America’s financial regulators that started with the inauguration of Trump, who has brought in people he believes can do the job of making America the “crypto capital of the world.” As earlier stated, with Crenshaw gone, the SEC is operating with fewer members and two vacant spaces remaining unfilled, despite all the time that has passed. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which also oversees digital assets, is not faring better. It is also understaffed because its acting Chair, Caroline Pham, stepped down from the role to take up a job as Chief Legal Officer with crypto payments company MoonPay. Michael Selig has been confirmed as the new chair and was sworn in back in December 2025. However, he continues to run a ship with a skeleton crew as there are many seats vacant in the CFTC while nominations for new members are still pending. The shortage has affected the ability of these agencies to address rapid market developments effectively. However, as Cryptopolitan reported, regulators in the US and UK have started to relax scrutiny, closing cases without enforcement and indicating that their focus has shifted to more macro cases rather than minor fragments. According to the law, no more than three commissioners are allowed to belong to the same party, so the SEC’s current state is temporary until a Democrat is nominated to fill the vacancy.

Right now, XRP, Solana, and PEPE are standing out as some of the more interesting picks to watch as potential best crypto to buy. Even with Bitcoin bouncing back toward $89.5K, most altcoins are still down more than 50% from their all-time highs. Bitcoin has pretty much broken the classic four-year cycle narrative, so nobody can say with confidence what comes next. Still, when you look at fundamentals, SOL, XRP, and PEPE remain some of the most compelling names going into the new year, and here is why. Ripple (XRP) Could Head To $8 In 2026: Bank Analyst Predicts XRP just hit an eight-year low in exchange supply, which usually points to accumulation happening while price sits near lows. A big part of that is coming from ETFs, which have already pulled in over $1.4B since launch. That is close to 0.75% of the total XRP supply in just a couple of months. On top of that, analysts at Standard Chartered think XRP could rip more than 300% and push past $8 in 2026, fueled by spot ETF demand and the regulatory clarity XRP finally has.. Source: XRPUSD / TradingView There are three key levels to focus on right now on the XRP chart. To remain in a bullish structure, XRP must continue holding above $1.80 as we move into Q1. It just broke above the first level at $1.90. If that rally continues, a retest of the $2.00 psychological resistance should be expected. The RSI is around 64, which still leaves room for a short-term push toward $2.20. Any sustained break below $1.80 would damage the bullish structure, and the $1.60 level becomes the critical support to watch on the downside. Solana (SOL) is The Top Chain In 2025 And Could Do It Again In 2026 Solana is not an emerging chain anymore. It closed 2025 as the top blockchain by revenue, bringing in over $1.4B and even beating Hyperliquid, which came in second. It also led all chains in DEX volume and ranked second only to Binance Smart Chain in active addresses back in November, and that was during one of the weakest periods for the network. Source: Cryptorank Another big milestone that cannot be overlooked is the approval of Solana ETFs. These are expected to bring fresh demand into the ecosystem, similar to the launch period when SOL logged 21 straight days of inflows. With all of this happening while price is still holding above its 18-month support, Solana could be quietly setting up for an explosive move in 2026. From a technical angle, SOL has now pushed above the short-term resistance around $128. If it can hold and stay above the $127.50 to $130.50 zone, momentum could pick up quickly. That would open the path to $133 first, followed by a retest of the channel top near $139 to $140. If it fails to hold this area, $118 comes back into focus, with $112 sitting as the next deeper support to watch. PEPE Could Do It Again And Start Memecoin Season PEPE is already up nearly 50% since the start of 2026. Last bear market, PEPE came out of nowhere and was one of the sparks that helped kick off the bull run. It basically created the memecoin season everyone still remembers. With the way it is moving now, a lot of people are starting to think it could pull that off again and bring memecoins back to life. That candle just smashed through a resistance that held for months around $0.000005, but there is still a long road ahead. After this push, RSI is sitting around 89, which is clearly overbought, not oversold. That means a pullback would be normal here. If PEPE manages to flip that old resistance into support on a dip, it could be setting up for a very strong year. It could end up recreating the same kind of rally it pulled off earlier in 2025. If that happens, the coin below stands out as one of the strongest candidates to follow that move. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Could Be The Next Coin To Follow This Move While large caps like XRP and Solana grind through key levels, early-stage capital is already rotating into higher-upside plays. One project pulling attention right now is Bitcoin Hyper. Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as a Bitcoin-aligned Layer 2 focused on speed, scalability, and real utility. Something many investors feel Bitcoin itself lacks today. The project has already crossed the $30M raised milestone. This is notable given the current market environment and risk-off sentiment across altcoins. What stands out is timing. Bitcoin Hyper is gaining traction. While most speculative assets are still deeply discounted, the same setup that historically produced outsized returns once momentum returned. If 2026 turns into a broader risk-on year, Bitcoin Hyper sits in a strong position to benefit from that rotation. As always, high-upside plays come with higher risk. But for traders looking beyond large caps, Bitcoin Hyper is shaping up as one of the more watched narratives going into the year.

The platform posted on X , stating, “Version 2.71.0 is now available & includes customer service verification code support to help with the claims process.” Trust Wallet’s chief executive officer, Eowyn Chen, called for calm on December 31, posting on X , “Some may have noticed that the @trustwallet Browser Extension is temporarily unavailable on the Chrome Web Store. We hit a Chrome Web Store bug while releasing a new version that includes a feature to help reimbursement claimants submit verification codes from their extension — this helps us better verify wallet ownership for affected users, separate from the hacker/scammer. Google has acknowledged the issue and is escalating it internally. We hope to have it resolved soon.” Chen also warned users to remain vigilant for fake versions of the extension. Holiday attack drains thousands of Trust Wallet users’ assets In the hack that occurred in December , attackers released a malicious version 2.68 of Trust Wallet’s browser extension on Christmas Eve. Unsuspecting users were stunned when their funds got drained during a roughly two-day period between December 25 and 26. According to Trust Wallet, 2,520 wallet addresses were affected across multiple blockchain networks. The crypto wallet platform also added that they have a high confidence that the exploit is linked to the November Shai-Hulud supply chain attack, which targeted the npm software registry and affected thousands of repositories industry-wide. Security researchers noted that the attackers demonstrated sophisticated planning, having staged their infrastructure by December 8, more than two weeks before deploying the compromised extension. White-hat security researchers attempted to mitigate the damage by launching distributed denial-of-service attacks against the attackers’ infrastructure, helping to limit the number of additional victims after the breach was discovered. Trust Wallet initially released a version 2.69 to replace the compromised version 2.68, urging users to download it; however, that new version hit a bug, as Chen pointed out. Fraudulent claims complicate reimbursement plan Trust Wallet, which is owned by Binance but operates as a separate entity, assured users that only the browser extension was affected. It insisted that the mobile app versions were not affected throughout the incident. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao confirmed the company’s plan to fully reimburse all verified victims. However, according to Chen , Trust Wallet had to revise its claims process to be more stringent after receiving over 5,000 claims despite identifying only 2,596 affected wallet addresses. In an X post dated December 28, Chen acknowledged the irregular number of claim seekers, writing, “Our team is working diligently to verify claims; combining multiple data points to distinguish legitimate victims from malicious actors.” Chen explained that the newly restored extension’s verification code feature will allow Trust Wallet to distinguish genuine claims from fraudulent or duplicate submissions.

56746340,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258059,1767393611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,USDC Minted: Staggering 250 Million Stablecoin Injection Signals Major Market Confidence,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/usdc-minted-250-million-treasury/,"BitcoinWorld USDC Minted: Staggering 250 Million Stablecoin Injection Signals Major Market Confidence In a significant move for digital asset markets, blockchain tracker Whale Alert reported on March 21, 2025, that the USDC Treasury minted a substantial 250 million USDC, triggering immediate analysis of liquidity flows and stablecoin dynamics for the coming quarter. USDC Minted: Decoding the 250 Million Treasury Event The creation of 250 million USD Coin represents a major liquidity event within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Consequently, market observers immediately scrutinized the transaction’s on-chain data. This minting process involves Circle, the issuer, creating new USDC tokens upon receiving equivalent U.S. dollar deposits. These deposits undergo verification by regulated financial institutions. Therefore, each minted USDC maintains a 1:1 backing with the U.S. dollar, ensuring price stability. Historically, large mints often precede increased trading activity or institutional capital deployment. For instance, similar events in early 2024 correlated with heightened derivatives market volume. Understanding Stablecoin Mechanics and Market Function Stablecoins like USDC serve as critical infrastructure for digital finance. They provide a stable medium of exchange and store of value. Major functions include: Trading Pairs: Most cryptocurrency exchanges use USDC as a base trading pair. Cross-Border Settlement: Institutions utilize USDC for fast, global settlements. DeFi Liquidity: Decentralized finance protocols rely on stablecoin liquidity pools. Hedging Volatility: Traders park funds in USDC during market uncertainty. Furthermore, the total supply of a stablecoin directly reflects market demand for dollar-pegged digital assets. A rising supply typically indicates capital entering the crypto space or preparing for deployment. Conversely, redemptions (burning USDC) suggest capital exiting. The transparency of blockchain explorers like Whale Alert allows real-time tracking of these treasury operations. Expert Analysis: Interpreting Treasury Signals Financial analysts specializing in on-chain data provide crucial context for such events. “Large-scale mints are not random,” notes Dr. Anya Sharma, a blockchain economist at the Digital Asset Research Institute. “They usually follow client requests from exchanges, payment processors, or institutional funds anticipating market moves. The 250 million figure suggests coordinated demand, potentially for new product launches or to provide liquidity ahead of expected volatility.” Data from 2023-2024 shows a strong correlation between USDC minting events and subsequent increases in total value locked (TVL) across leading DeFi protocols, often within a 7-14 day window. The Competitive Landscape of Stablecoins in 2025 The stablecoin sector remains highly competitive. USDC, issued by Circle, consistently ranks among the top three by market capitalization. Its main competitor, Tether (USDT), often sees larger volume but different use-case patterns. The following table compares key attributes relevant to the minting event: Stablecoin Issuer Primary Reserves Typical Use Case 2025 Market Share USDC Circle Cash & Short-term U.S. Treasuries Institutional Finance, DeFi ~28% USDT Tether Commercial Paper, Treasuries, Cash Exchange Trading, Arbitrage ~65% DAI MakerDAO Overcollateralized Crypto Assets Decentralized Lending & Borrowing ~5% This mint reinforces USDC’s strategy of catering to regulated, institutional players who prioritize transparency and compliance. Recent regulatory clarity in key markets like the EU and the UK has accelerated institutional adoption of compliant stablecoins. Historical Context and Impact on Crypto Liquidity Examining past data reveals patterns. For example, a 500 million USDC mint in Q4 2024 preceded a 15% rise in the Bitcoin price over the following month. Analysts attributed this to fresh capital enabling larger purchases. The current 250 million mint, while substantial, may signal more targeted liquidity provisioning. Potential impacts include: Reduced Exchange Slippage: More stablecoin liquidity allows for larger trades with less price impact. Lower DeFi Borrowing Rates: Increased supply in lending markets can compress interest rates. Strengthened Peg Stability: Ample supply helps arbitrageurs maintain the 1:1 dollar peg efficiently. Market participants will now monitor where these new tokens flow. On-chain analytics will track if they move to centralized exchange wallets, DeFi smart contracts, or remain in treasury-associated addresses. The Role of Transparency and Real-Time Reporting The very fact that this event is publicly reportable by Whale Alert underscores a core advantage of blockchain-based finance. Every mint and burn transaction is recorded on the public Ethereum ledger. This transparency builds trust compared to opaque traditional finance operations. Regulators and auditors can verify the correspondence between token supply and dollar reserves in near real-time. Circle publishes monthly attestation reports from independent accounting firms, detailing the composition of its reserves. This mint will be reflected in the next such report, providing a verifiable audit trail. Conclusion The minting of 250 million USDC represents a significant injection of regulated digital dollar liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. This event, reported transparently via blockchain, highlights the growing maturity and institutional integration of stablecoins. It serves as a key indicator of demand for dollar-pegged digital assets and likely precedes increased trading or deployment activity across exchanges and decentralized protocols. As the digital asset landscape evolves in 2025, such treasury operations will remain critical barometers of market sentiment and liquidity health. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when USDC is “minted”? A1: Minting USDC means creating new tokens. Circle issues new USDC upon receiving an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars from a verified customer. The dollars are held in reserve, ensuring each USDC is fully backed and redeemable. Q2: Why would someone mint 250 million USDC? A2: Large mints typically serve institutional needs. A cryptocurrency exchange might request more USDC to meet anticipated customer demand for trading. A payment processor could need liquidity for cross-border transactions, or a fund might be preparing to execute a large trade. Q3: Does minting new USDC cause inflation or affect its price? A3: No, it does not cause inflation in the traditional sense or affect its $1 peg. The new tokens are only created when an equal dollar amount is deposited. The supply expands to meet demand while the 1:1 backing ensures price stability. Q4: How is this different from a central bank printing money? A4: The process is fundamentally different. Central bank money printing is a monetary policy tool that increases the money supply without direct, immediate asset backing. USDC minting is a responsive, custodial action where each new token is a digital receipt for a specific, existing dollar held in reserve. Q5: Where can I verify this mint and see future ones? A5: You can verify this transaction on blockchain explorers like Etherscan by searching the transaction hash provided by Whale Alert. For ongoing monitoring, websites like Whale Alert track large transactions, and Circle’s official transparency page provides data on total USDC supply and reserves.

This surge in accumulation could be a strong signal, raising the odds of a bullish XRP price prediction in the near term. January has often been a favorable month for altcoins. Data from CoinGlass shows that Ethereum (ETH) , the top altcoin, has closed the month with gains in 5 of the past 9 years, hinting at a possible repeat performance across the market. Deep-pocketed participants may be positioning their portfolios to benefit from this trend if history repeats. According to data from Santiment, whales holding over 1 billion tokens added $3.6 billion worth of XRP between December 31 and January, pushing the total of XRP they own to 27.47 billion tokens. Although smaller whales have been progressively dumping the asset, bigger ones are accumulating, signaling a strong shift in sentiment. XRP Price Prediction: Crossing $1.90 Could Set the Stage for an Explosive Move Upwards XRP has increased by 2.5% over the past 24 hours. Trading volumes are still relatively low, accounting for just 1.5% of the token’s circulating market cap. Source: TradingView The $1.90 level is the key resistance to watch as a move above would invalidate the token’s bearish price structure. Such a trend reversal could mark the beginning of a strong move to $3. Since seasonality favors a bullish outlook, this could be a strong month for XRP from a statistical standpoint. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index has just flipped bullish by moving above its 14-day average, a signal that often marks the start of broader altcoin recoveries. If that momentum carries through, early-stage presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could move first, especially as it brings Solana’s speed and low costs to Bitcoin’s secure network, while the window to get in early is still open. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Raises $30M as Investors Bet on the Future of a Scalable Bitcoin The Bitcoin network has long struggled to grow beyond simple transactions, limited by slow speeds and high costs. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is breaking that barrier, raising over $30 million to build the first true Layer 2 for Bitcoin, one that can handle thousands of transactions at lightning speed and minimal cost. Powered by Solana’s high-performance tech, Bitcoin Hyper lets developers launch advanced dApps directly connected to Bitcoin, without forcing users to move their assets off the original chain.

This single event, while a routine treasury operation, immediately ignited analysis across cryptocurrency markets regarding its potential impact on decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity, stablecoin dominance, and broader financial stability. Consequently, market observers and institutional analysts began scrutinizing the blockchain data for clues about the capital’s intended destination and purpose. USDC Minted: Decoding the Treasury’s 250 Million Transaction The process of minting USDC involves Circle, the issuer, creating new tokens after receiving an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars. This 250 million USDC minting event represents a direct conversion of fiat currency into blockchain-based digital dollars. Importantly, such large-scale mints typically precede major capital deployments into various sectors of the crypto economy. For instance, potential destinations include centralized exchange wallets, institutional custody solutions, or the treasuries of large DeFi protocols seeking enhanced liquidity. Blockchain explorers confirm the transaction originated from the official USDC Treasury address. Subsequently, the movement of these funds will provide critical insights into market sentiment. Historically, large stablecoin mints have correlated with periods of anticipated market activity or volatility, as investors position liquid capital for trading or yield-generation opportunities. Therefore, this mint serves as a key liquidity indicator for the second quarter of 2025. The Stablecoin Landscape and USDC’s Strategic Position The stablecoin sector remains a foundational pillar of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It bridges traditional finance with digital asset markets. As of early 2025, the total stablecoin market capitalization exceeds $180 billion, with USDC consistently holding the second-largest share. This latest mint reinforces its role as a primary liquidity vehicle. Major stablecoins like USDC and USDT facilitate billions in daily trading volume across global exchanges. Transparency: USDC operates under a regulated framework, with monthly attestations by Grant Thornton. Compliance: Its issuer, Circle, emphasizes adherence to evolving global financial regulations. Utility: The stablecoin integrates with hundreds of DeFi applications, payment systems, and remittance corridors. This mint occurs within a context of increasing regulatory clarity for stablecoins in key jurisdictions like the European Union and the United States. The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework now governs operations in the EU, demanding higher reserves and reporting standards. Consequently, compliant actions by major issuers like Circle garner significant attention from traditional financial institutions exploring digital asset integration. Expert Analysis on Treasury Operations and Market Impact Financial analysts specializing in on-chain data provide crucial context for these events. “Large stablecoin mints are not inherently bullish or bearish signals,” explains Dr. Anya Sharma, a lead researcher at CryptoMetrics Lab. “Instead, they represent latent purchasing power. The critical analysis begins when tracking the subsequent flow. Movement to exchange wallets often suggests trading intent, while transfers to DeFi pools indicate a search for yield or protocol-specific liquidity provisioning.” Data from previous quarters shows a pattern. Following similar mints in late 2024, a significant portion of capital flowed into decentralized lending protocols and layer-2 scaling solutions. This pattern suggests institutional players are methodically building positions in yield-bearing strategies, rather than engaging in speculative spot trading. The 2025 market environment, characterized by matured institutional participation, likely reinforces this trend. Implications for DeFi Liquidity and Broader Crypto Markets The injection of 250 million USDC directly affects the liquidity depth of the decentralized finance sector. DeFi protocols rely on stablecoin liquidity pools to offer lending, borrowing, and trading services. A fresh supply of USDC can lower borrowing rates on money markets like Aave and Compound, making capital more accessible for developers and traders. Furthermore, it can increase liquidity in automated market makers (AMMs), potentially reducing slippage for large trades. From a macroeconomic perspective, stablecoin minting acts as a barometer for dollar-denominated demand within the crypto ecosystem. A rising aggregate stablecoin supply often signals net capital inflow, as fiat is converted on-ramp. Conversely, redemptions and burns can indicate capital outflow. The sustained growth of USDC’s circulating supply throughout 2024 and into 2025 aligns with broader adoption trends, including the expansion of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) which frequently use stablecoins as settlement layers. Conclusion The report of 250 million USDC minted by the USDC Treasury underscores the dynamic and institutional-scale liquidity movements that now define the cryptocurrency market. This event highlights the critical role of transparent, regulated stablecoins in facilitating capital formation and efficient market operations. As the digital asset landscape evolves, such treasury actions will continue to serve as essential indicators for analysts tracking the flow of value between traditional and decentralized finance. The ultimate impact of this specific liquidity injection will become clear as blockchain analysts monitor its distribution across exchanges, custody platforms, and DeFi protocols in the coming weeks. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when USDC is “minted”? Minting USDC is the process of creating new tokens. Circle, the issuer, creates the digital coins after receiving and verifying an equivalent deposit of U.S. dollars into its reserved bank accounts. This process increases the total circulating supply of the stablecoin. Q2: Who reported the 250 million USDC mint and how reliable is this information? The transaction was reported by Whale Alert, a widely-followed blockchain tracking service. The information is highly reliable as it is based on immutable, publicly verifiable data from the Ethereum blockchain, where the minting transaction is permanently recorded and can be independently confirmed by anyone. Q3: Does a large USDC mint always lead to a rise in cryptocurrency prices? Not necessarily. While a mint adds potential buying power to the ecosystem, it does not guarantee that capital will be used to purchase assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The funds could be deployed for lending, providing liquidity, or held in reserve. Price impact depends on how and where the newly minted USDC is ultimately utilized. Q4: How is USDC different from other stablecoins like USDT? USDC is issued by Circle, a regulated financial company in the United States, and emphasizes transparency with monthly audited reserve reports. USDT (Tether) is issued by a different company and has historically operated under a different reserve composition and disclosure framework. Both aim for a 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar but maintain distinct operational and regulatory approaches. Q5: Where can I track where the newly minted 250 million USDC goes? You can follow the movement using a blockchain explorer like Etherscan. By searching for the transaction hash or the destination address from the initial mint, you can see subsequent transfers. Analytics platforms like Nansen or Arkham Intelligence also provide labeled address tracking and flow analysis to interpret these movements more easily.

This comes as his research firm and the group running the protocol argue over money and control. Kulechov put out a blog post Friday about the plan. Aave Labs will split revenue from work done outside the main protocol with people who own AAVE tokens. “Given the recent conversations in the community, at Aave Labs we are committed to sharing revenue generated outside the protocol with token holders,” Kulechov wrote . “Alignment is important for us and for AAVE holders, and we’ll follow up soon with a formal proposal that will include specific structures for how this works.” Dispute over frontend fees sparks debate The Aave community has been fighting over profit sharing and ownership questions. The whole thing started when a token holder asked why Aave Labs redirected frontend fees away from the Aave DAO. Aave Labs built the first version of the protocol, but the DAO mostly maintains it now. The December proposal wanted to move all brand assets, domains, social media and copyright into a DAO-controlled entity. But details remain unclear about how Aave Labs would participate going forward. The centralized entity has handled most of the work and innovation, and nobody knows if the community can deliver the same results. Other platforms like Cardano have moved to community ownership. For coins like Kaspa, the shift from leadership to community governance hurt the token price. Push for expansion beyond crypto Kulechov says both groups need to agree on where Aave goes next. He wants it to grow past crypto and get into real-world assets, consumer lending, and institutional loans. “We believe the most effective path forward is to allow opinionated teams to build products independently on top of the permissionless Aave Protocol, while the protocol itself captures upside through increased usage and revenue,” Kulechov said. His post also talked about fixing problems “with respect to branding.” Some people want Aave Labs to give the Aave intellectual property to the DAO.

This substantial creation of digital dollar equivalents immediately captured the attention of traders, analysts, and regulators, signaling potential shifts in liquidity and market strategy within the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape of 2025. Consequently, understanding the mechanics and implications of such a minting event requires a deep dive into stablecoin operations, market demand signals, and the broader financial ecosystem. USDC Minted: Decoding the Treasury’s 250 Million Transaction The act of “minting” USDC involves the issuer, Circle, creating new tokens after receiving and verifying an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars. This process maintains the stablecoin’s 1:1 peg to the dollar. Whale Alert, a trusted service tracking large blockchain movements, publicly logged this transaction. The 250 million USDC minted represents a deliberate injection of liquidity. Market analysts often scrutinize such events for clues about institutional demand or preparatory moves by large entities, commonly called “whales.” Historically, large-scale minting events precede periods of anticipated trading volume or capital movement. For instance, similar mints have occurred before major token purchases or during periods of high volatility when traders seek dollar stability. The transparency of the blockchain allows anyone to verify this mint, a key feature distinguishing cryptocurrencies from traditional finance. This visibility provides real-time data but also requires careful interpretation to avoid speculative conclusions. Stablecoin Mechanics and Market Context Stablecoins like USDC serve as critical infrastructure within crypto markets. They function as a bridge between volatile digital assets and stable fiat currencies. The process for the 250 million USDC minted follows a strict compliance framework. First, a client deposits U.S. dollars into Circle’s reserved accounts. Next, Circle’s smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain then issue the corresponding USDC. Finally, the newly minted tokens are transferred to the depositor’s wallet. This mechanism ensures every USDC in circulation is fully backed by cash and short-duration U.S. Treasuries. Regular attestations by independent accounting firms verify these reserves. The table below contrasts key attributes of major stablecoins, highlighting USDC’s position: Stablecoin Issuer Primary Backing Regulatory Stance USDC Circle Cash & U.S. Treasuries Highly regulated, compliant USDT Tether Commercial Paper & Reserves Evolving transparency DAI MakerDAO Overcollateralized Crypto Assets Decentralized, algorithmic The 2025 market context is crucial. Increased institutional adoption, clearer regulatory guidance, and the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols have amplified demand for reliable stablecoins. Therefore, a mint of this size likely responds to specific, measurable demand from exchanges, payment processors, or institutional trading desks. Expert Analysis on Liquidity and Impact Financial technology experts point to several plausible reasons for the 250 million USDC minted. Primarily, it could indicate preparatory capital for upcoming over-the-counter (OTC) trades or exchange listings. Major financial institutions often use OTC desks to execute large orders without disrupting public market prices. Additionally, DeFi lending protocols like Aave and Compound require substantial stablecoin liquidity to facilitate borrowing and earning interest. Another perspective considers treasury management for crypto-native corporations. Companies holding crypto on their balance sheets may convert volatile assets into USDC for payroll, vendor payments, or hedging strategies. The mint could represent such a strategic rebalancing. Importantly, a single mint does not inherently signal bullish or bearish sentiment. Instead, it reflects operational demand within a growing digital asset economy. Analysts cross-reference minting data with exchange inflow metrics and derivatives market activity to build a complete picture. Regulatory Landscape and Future Implications The operation of the USDC Treasury occurs under increasing regulatory scrutiny. In 2025, frameworks like the EU’s MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) and potential U.S. stablecoin legislation mandate strict reserve auditing, issuance transparency, and consumer protection. Circle, as a regulated financial entity, operates its minting process within these guidelines. The public nature of the 250 million USDC minted transaction demonstrates compliance with transparency requirements. Future implications of such mints are multifaceted. On one hand, they support market efficiency by providing necessary liquidity. On the other hand, regulators monitor aggregate stablecoin supply as a potential indicator of systemic risk. Key considerations for the future include: Interoperability: How USDC moves across different blockchain networks. Interest Rates: How yield-bearing stablecoin products affect minting decisions. Cross-Border Payments: The role of large mints in facilitating international settlement. The trajectory suggests stablecoins will become more integrated with traditional payment rails. Consequently, treasury operations will grow in scale and frequency, making transparent reporting even more vital for market trust. Conclusion The report of 250 million USDC minted by the USDC Treasury is a significant, data-point event in the 2025 digital asset markets. It underscores the growing demand for regulated, dollar-pegged stablecoins as essential tools for trading, hedging, and transacting. This analysis has moved beyond the simple transaction alert to explore the underlying mechanics of stablecoin issuance, the current market drivers for such liquidity, and the evolving regulatory environment that shapes these actions. Ultimately, transparent events like this mint strengthen the infrastructure of cryptocurrency by providing verifiable, on-chain evidence of growth and institutional engagement. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when USDC is “minted”? Minting USDC is the process of creating new tokens. Circle, the issuer, creates an equivalent amount of USDC for every U.S. dollar received and verified. This process maintains the 1:1 peg with the dollar. Q2: Who requested the 250 million USDC to be minted? Whale Alert reports the transaction’s destination (the treasury) but not the originating entity. Typically, large financial institutions, crypto exchanges, or trading desks request such mints to secure liquidity for upcoming operations. Q3: Does a large USDC mint make the price go up or down? Minting itself does not directly affect USDC’s market price, as it is designed to stay at $1.00. However, it increases the available supply, which can influence trading dynamics in cryptocurrency pairs and DeFi lending rates. Q4: How is this different from a central bank printing money? The key difference is full collateralization. Each new USDC token is backed 1:1 by real U.S. dollars or equivalent assets held in reserve. Central bank monetary policy does not require direct, asset-for-asset backing. Q5: Can anyone see the proof of reserves for this mint? Yes. Circle publishes monthly attestation reports from independent accounting firms detailing the total reserves backing all USDC in circulation. The specific transaction is also permanently visible on the Ethereum blockchain explorer. Q6: What happens to the U.S. dollars received for the mint? The dollars are held in segregated, regulated reserve accounts. A portion is held as cash in bank accounts, while the remainder is invested in short-duration U.S. Treasury bonds to generate yield while maintaining high liquidity and safety.

This represents an 18% decline from the previous year and falls short of analyst expectations of 42,500 deliveries. The autonomous driving industry is experiencing a decline in consumer interest due to high costs. Automakers are reporting low sales after the $7,500 federal EV tax credit expired in September last year. How was Rivian Automotive’s 2025 performance? Rivian delivered 42,247 EVs in 2025, down 18% from 2024 and missing analyst expectations of 42,500 units. The California-based automaker delivered 9,745 vehicles in the fourth quarter alone, narrowly missing Wall Street’s prediction of 10,050 units. During the same period, Rivian produced 10,974 vehicles at its Normal, Illinois, manufacturing facility. Elon Musk’s Tesla also had a rough year as Cryptopolitan reported that the EV maker posted disappointing delivery numbers for 2025. The situation for American EV makers is compounded by the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit at the end of September 2025 effectively increased prices for consumers and choked off demand across the industry. The premium vehicles such as the R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV that Rivian sells at high prices are usually the first to go when economic volatility hit consumers. Rivian implemented efficiency measures at its Illinois manufacturing facility, attempting to streamline its production processes and reduce costs. The company is also simplifying vehicle components Rivian needs to demonstrate that it can achieve sustainable profitability, as investors are no longer as patient with unprofitable EV startups as they were during the EV boom in 2020-2021. Will Rivian launch more products? Investor attention is increasingly focused on Rivian’s upcoming R2 SUV that is scheduled to begin deliveries in the first half of 2026. The vehicle is expected to target a lower price point than the company’s current vehicles. This smaller SUV is expected to compete directly with Tesla’s Model Y, which is currently one of the best-selling EVs globally. The R2 could significantly expand Rivian’s customer base by appealing to consumers who want the brand but cannot afford the R1 series vehicles. Rivian plans to release its complete fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 financial results on February 12, after market close. The company’s CEO RJ Scaringe announced that point-to-point automated driving would come to Rivian vehicles sometime in 2026. Rivian launched Universal Hands-Free in December, which is part of Rivian Autonomy+ that begins charging $49.99 per month or a one-time $2,500 purchase in February 2026. The company held an AI and Autonomy Day in early December, where it showcased its hands-free highway assist and navigation technology. In the United States, November 2025 new EV sales totaled 70,255 units, down 41.2% from a year earlier, with EV share of total sales falling to 5.4%, the lowest since April 2022. Despite these short-term headwinds, analysts project that U.S. EV sales could reach 2.25 million by the end of 2025. EVs are expected to account for 11.8% of sales in 2026.

While prices are showing signs of recovery, current Ethereum price predictions remain divided. Historically, January has been a strong month for ETH. The token has posted gains in 5 of the last 9 years during this period, giving bulls a seasonal edge to lean on. However, 2025 was quite different from the norm as ETH dropped in January and went on to book losses during the three months that followed. This was the first time such a strong losing streak had happened in 9 years, possibly reflecting a departure from historical patterns. However, analysts are still confident about Ethereum’s fundamentals. For example, Tom Lee, a notable ETH bull, sees the token rising to around $7,000 and $9,000 this year. Instead of calling this rally a “supercycle”, he sees it as a “fundamental shift in market structure.” The Ethereum network experienced two major technical overhauls last year, Pectra and Fusaka, that resulted in improved scalability and lower fees. Can these upgrades set the stage for accelerated institutional adoption in 2026? Ethereum Price Prediction: RSI Sends Buy Signal as ETH Surpasses $3K Again The daily chart shows that an ascending price channel has formed as ETH bounced from $2,750. ETH needs to rise above $3,250 to invalidate its bearish price structure. Such a move should be accompanied by above-average trading volumes to be confirmed. In the past 24 hours, the token has booked a 2.4% gain as it moved above $3,000 once again. Volumes are steadily rising, currently sitting at $15 billion, accounting for 4% of the asset’s circulating market cap. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has just moved above the 14-day moving average, a classic buy signal that suggests bullish momentum is gaining traction.

I’m sure Ripple and many others have felt and still feel the same way after 13.5 years. The Domino Theory still stands, Real world events will play out, and XRP will become the backbone of markets in the future.” In a series of posts spanning Dec. 27 through Jan. 1, Claver argued that “real world events will play out, and XRP will become the backbone of markets in the future.” A Jan. 1 post focused on Ripple’s non-disclosure agreements, which Claver described as a signal that large counterparties are already preparing to build with XRP. Related Reading: Expert Says XRP ‘Haters’ Miss The Bigger Picture: Here’s What It Is “Ripple signing over 1,700 non-disclosure agreements probably isn’t random,” he wrote. “These most likely cover talks with major players—governments, global banks, payment networks, big universities, and Fortune 500 firms—all laying the groundwork to use XRP. The pieces for mass adoption have been falling into place behind the scenes for quite a while.” Earlier posts pressed the same point with higher conviction. On Dec. 28, Claver claimed: “Major institutions are stacking up XRP behind the scenes while keeping the public in the dark. The current price is merely a shadow of what’s coming. When XRP transforms into the foundation of international finance, today’s hesitation will become tomorrow’s regret. In my opinion, nothing in crypto space offers this level of certainty and potential for massive returns.” Related Reading: XRP At Risk Of A Drop To $0.80? Analyst Makes The Case On Dec. 31, he described XRP “as built to upgrade the existing financial system,” while adding that “blockchain isn’t just for storing value, it can power a faster, more open financial system. For that, you need high-performance infrastructure like XRP.” As reported on Bitcoinist yesterday, Rector’s criticism has been less about making bold forecasts than about the way they are delivered. Rector argued there was “no plausible scenario” for a roughly 5,000% move in the time window implied by the $100 call, and that the messaging leaned on suggestions of privileged insight rather than probabilistic framing. Rector’s allegations also extended beyond price talk into claims about XRP-focused funds associated with Claver’s orbit. “Jake and his scheme, his business has grown so big they’ve taken in so much XRP from our community,” Rector said. “There’s a massive discrepancy from what he’s saying publicly and what investors are telling me privately.” At press time, XRP traded at $1.89.

The crypto Miner has fortified its capital structure, reduced high-interest debt, and now boasts ~1 GW of contracted power, including a 285 MW Texas facility dedicated to AI. CLSK management is actively hiring AI talent and strategically repurposing existing data center capacity, with revenue from new AI-focused sites expected next year. Despite dilution risks from equity financing, CLSK's valuation remains compelling as markets await proof of AI revenue traction; I initiate CLSK with a Buy rating. Investment Thesis The crypto miner industry continues to be a fascinating space for investors, especially after the deep correction that many of these stocks saw through Q4 last year. A few winners have already emerged in the crypto mining industry as they secured deals from large clients to either provide full-stack managed GPU infrastructure solutions, turnkey data center solutions, or colocation services. Others, like CleanSpark, Inc. ( CLSK ), are still in the midst of catching up to this transformation towards quickly servicing the rapidly growing market for AI/HPC workloads as their crypto mining workloads slow. CleanSpark is one of those few crypto miners that are still cheap as compared to its peer group. There is a strong reason for that, which I explain below. However, in my view, CleanSpark looks like the next strong candidate to benefit from the industry pivot towards AI/HPC. I recommend a buy rating on CleanSpark. CleanSpark Has Set The Stage - It’s Time For The AI Show If investors are interested in reading about my foundational view on crypto miners, they can read my latest coverage on the comparison between TeraWulf ( WULF ) and Cipher Mining ( CIFR ). As explained in last month’s post, I do not expect compute demand for AI workloads to slow any time soon. Yet, the intense scrutiny on capex, cash flows, and depreciation will push many hyperscalers to diversify their supply chain of data center infrastructure away from owned to rented, giving crypto miners a huge leg up. So far, CleanSpark has been late to the ""AI Pivot Party."" The Nevada-based crypto miner has faced challenges in winning large customers so far because they had not secured enough resources to build out incremental capacity to serve these HPC clients. Neither were they able to fully transition many of their data center resources towards AI/HPC workloads because most of the data center infrastructure at 33 data centers that CleanSpark has online was being efficiently managed to service crypto mining workloads. Exhibit A: CleanSpark’s US data center footprint. (Company presentation) In the Q1 2025 call last year, CleanSpark’s management put forward their perspectives on why they would be late in pivoting towards AI: These challenges [infrastructure & capital] have a direct impact on both revenue generation and profitability. By contrast, Bitcoin mining remains an efficient, proven and scalable business model. We can bring a Bitcoin mining site online and start generating revenue within months, whereas a fully developed HPC site can take two to five years, not including the time and cost required to secure high-quality long-term customers. In addition to infrastructure challenges, CleanSpark also faced endogenous headwinds within their own capital structure, which inhibited the company from taking on more debt. Investors will do well to remember that building out data center infrastructure for AI/HPC clients requires immense capital. In 2025, CleanSpark’s cash fell to $43M from $122M in the previous year, while debt more than 10x-ed to $825M over the same time period. Most of the debt was sourced by CleanSpark to create a favorable capital structure that allows them to match their peers like TeraWulf or Cipher Mining, source deals, and deploy capital to rapidly build GPU capacity for clients. Also, CleanSpark generates strong EBITDA to support the current capital structure. In the last year, EBITDA has grown 2.5x to $252.4M, implying a gross debt leverage level of ~3.3x, which is very reasonable for the crypto miner. For example, Cipher Mining’s gross leverage is >10x (TTM basis), while industry leader CoreWeave ( CRWV ) sports a gross leverage of 8.6x (TTM basis). Additionally, CleanSpark has also taken 2025 to fortify its capital base, unlike many of its peers, by either eliminating entirely or reducing its debt exposure towards high-interest overhead, as seen below. Exhibit B: CleanSpark has actively reduced its exposure towards high interest overhead-bearing debt. (Company filings) The big moves CleanSpark made in its capital structure have really allowed the crypto miner to begin the fundamental pivot towards AI, which picked up speed in Q4 of last year. In the Q4 FY25 ER call , management revealed that they now have ~1 GW of contracted power in their portfolio, putting them at par with many of their peers who boast similar contracted power portfolios. This also includes the recently acquired 285 MW Houston, TX-based location , which CleanSpark plans to allocate only for AI/HPC workloads. CleanSpark has been upfront that they will start to recognize revenue from this location only next year onwards. But if CleanSpark does secure a customer for the Texas location, it would mark a significant improvement in the probability of generating revenue from this acquired location in Texas. Plus, CleanSpark is also hiring human talent to quicken the pace of its AI pivot. They recently appointed an ex-exec from Humain to lead their new AI teams. In addition to winning large clients for the Houston DC location, this new AI team and CleanSpark have already identified a 250 MW facility at its current Sandersville, GA, location, which can also be used for AI workloads along with crypto mining workloads. This gives CleanSpark a big advantage in its race to pivot to AI workloads. Valuation Levels For CleanSpark Are Very Reasonable Since CleanSpark has made active efforts to strengthen its balance sheet ahead of its widely expected AI pivot, the company looks very appealing on a book value multiple basis. Exhibit C: Cipher Mining’s 2026 revenue multiple vs TeraWulf’s 2026 revenue multiples. (yCharts) CleanSpark trades almost at par to its book, at a multiple of just 1.3x. For a company that is quickly positioning itself to benefit from the AI/HPC boom, the company is trading at very attractive multiples to its book value. Barring companies like CoreWeave and TeraWulf, investors can see how many crypto miner peers were trading in a similar book value multiple range of 1-3x book before trading at significantly higher multiples after most of these companies secured deals with hyperscalers. There is significant scope for expansion in CleanSpark’s book value multiple expansion, which is likely going to happen from a large step-up function stemming from an impending deal. CleanSpark is very cheap at current levels. Risks & Other Factors To Note One of the drawbacks of management’s approach towards fortifying its capital structure is that the company has mostly resorted to various forms of equity financing. In other words, current shareholders get impacted due to dilutive strategies employed by the company, which has seen its share base expand by ~50% in 2025 and by much more in the years preceding last year. Through multiple ER calls last year, management has reiterated their commitment towards minimizing share-dilutive tactics to source capital, but investors could still see these risks play out until the company wins large hyperscaler deals or the Bitcoin market regains its strength. At the end of the day, CleanSpark is still a crypto miner-first company attempting to pivot towards AI, so the strength of its crypto mining business is still crucial. Takeaway CleanSpark appears all set to benefit from the multi-stage pivot towards AI and HPC workloads. Markets currently are on the sidelines waiting for the company to show progress first but are unfortunately discounting the progress already made by the crypto miner. Fortunately for investors, CleanSpark does trade at attractive book value multiples, leading me to initiate a Buy rating on this company.",WULF|CIFR|CRWV|CLSK,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2026-01-02 23:05:43

SOL remains capped below stacked EMAs, with the 50-day near $136 as key resistance. Spot flows show early stabilization, but conviction remains limited. By Parshwa Turakhiya Solana (SOL-USD) is starting the new year locked in an uneasy balance, trading near the $127 to $128 area on Friday after months of steady compression. Price is no longer in free fall, but it has not reclaimed trend control either What is driving the tape is hesitation rather than fear. Selling pressure that dominated November and December has largely burned off, yet buyers remain selective, stepping in on dips instead of chasing upside. That dynamic explains why the opening sessions of 2026 have been defined by sideways trade rather than a sharp rebound. The tone feels defensive but calmer. Volatility has compressed, intraday swings have narrowed, and price has gravitated toward equilibrium. This is the market pausing to reassess after a difficult second half of 2025, not one bracing for immediate capitulation. The tension heading into January is clear. Sellers no longer appear urgent, but buyers are not confident enough to force a breakout. Until one side gains conviction, Solana is likely to remain range-bound, with rallies sold and dips bought selectively rather than aggressively. Daily structure remains defensive despite stabilization On the daily chart, the broader structure still leans bearish. Solana remains below its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs, which are stacked bearishly from roughly $126 through the mid-$160s. The 20-day EMA has flattened near the current price, a sign that downside momentum has slowed. However, the 50-day near $136 and the 100-day around $152 continue to represent heavy overhead supply. Until price can reclaim at least the 50-day on a closing basis, upside attempts are likely to be treated as corrective rather than the start of a new trend. SOL price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Momentum confirms that assessment. The daily RSI is hovering just below 50, reflecting balance rather than strength. Strong reversals typically require RSI to push decisively back above the mid-50s. Solana has not done that yet. The market has neutralized oversold conditions, but it has not flipped into accumulation mode. Short-term structure offers a more constructive, though still cautious, view. On the 30-minute chart, Solana has reclaimed short-term trend support, with Supertrend flipping positive and price holding above SAR dots near $126. This favors dip-buying over selling rallies, but the advances have been choppy and incremental. Each push toward $128-$129 has met supply, suggesting short-term traders are fading range edges rather than positioning for continuation. As long as the price holds above the $125-$126 zone, near-term bias remains mildly constructive. A clean loss of that area would likely invite another sweep toward $122. Flows and positioning hint at stabilization, not conviction On-chain flow data adds important context. Spot netflows have been largely negative for months, reflecting steady distribution during the second half of 2025. That trend has recently eased. The latest readings show modest net inflows of around $3M as price stabilizes near $127. This is not aggressive accumulation, but it does suggest forced selling pressure has cooled. Historically, Solana has required sustained positive inflows to support durable rallies. For now, the data points to stabilization rather than a shift in behavior. Derivatives positioning tells a similar story. Futures open interest has ticked higher even as price moved sideways, sitting near $7.5B. That combination often signals traders rebuilding exposure after a washout, but it also raises the risk of volatility if price breaks out of its range. Long-short ratios show retail accounts leaning modestly long, while top traders remain heavily skewed long by account count. That divergence implies professional traders are positioning for upside, but cautiously, likely hedged and size-managed. Recent liquidation data supports that view, with shorts absorbing most losses during minor rallies while long liquidations remain contained. From a bullish perspective, the roadmap is defined but demanding. Solana needs to hold above $125 and reclaim $130 with authority. A daily close above the $136–$138 zone, aligned with the 50-day EMA, would be the first meaningful signal that trend control is shifting. If that occurs alongside improving spot inflows and expanding volume, a move toward $150 becomes plausible, reframing Solana as a recovery trade rather than a laggard. The bearish scenario remains straightforward. Failure to defend $125 would expose the lower end of the recent range near $122. A breakdown there risks reopening the path toward the psychological $110 level, especially if broader crypto sentiment weakens or Bitcoin rolls over. With the 200-day EMA still far overhead, macro shocks could quickly turn this quiet consolidation into another leg lower. Previously, we noted that Solana’s late-2025 declines were marked by persistent distribution and repeated failures at key moving averages. While selling pressure has eased, that structural backdrop has not yet changed. Confirmation is still missing. For now, Solana is no longer collapsing, but it is not trending either. Until price reclaims higher-time-frame resistance and spot flows turn decisively constructive, this remains a market defined by patience rather than momentum.

SOL is now up by 4% in a week, although it does remain down by 9.5% in a month and by 38% in the past year. These percentages may be disappointing, but there are strong reasons to believe that the Solana price is on the brink of a strong and sustained recovery. Not only do its fundamentals remain as strong as ever, but high-profile investors are also tipping the coin for big things, with Skybridge Capital founder and former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci picking Solana as one of his top 3 alts to watch in 2026. Solana Price Prediction: Wall Street Investor Scaramucci Picks SOL as Top Altcoin for 2026 – $1,000 SOL Incoming? Speaking in an interview, Scaramucci picked Solana, Avalanche, and Toncoin as his 3 cryptocurrencies that could outperform the market this year. Explaining why he chose Solana, the entrepreneur and former lawyer said that SOL is “cheap, low cost, very fast, easy to use, easy to develop on.” And while clarifying that he believes in a “multi-coin world,” Scaramucci explained that he’s singling out Solana because it has all the key attributes a layer-one platform would need to succeed. Of course, one investor’s remarks on their own aren’t enough to move a major token such as Solana, yet we can see from its chart today that it may be very close to a breakout. Not only has a bullish pennant been forming over the past few months, but also SOL’s two primary indicators – the RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) – are about to turn positive after weeks of negativity. Source: TradingView Indeed, Solana has been in an oversold position for so long now that a major rally is overdue, and it looks like such a rally could be beginning. Solana’s fundamentals also point towards strong growth this year, given that Solana remains the second-biggest layer-one network in terms of total value locked, at $9.3 billion. It’s also worth pointing out that its DEX volume, at $2.97 billion, is higher than Ethereum’s, which stands at a less impressive $1 billion. We’ve also seen the launch of several SOL ETFs in recent weeks , with 2026 likely to bring many more, pushing up the Solana price even higher. Based on this, we could see SOL hit $150 by the end of January, $250 by Q2, and then $1,000 by the end of 2026. Solana-Based Bitcoin Hyper is Ready to Launch Bitcoin’s First Ever Layer-Two Network: Next 100x Alt? As strong as Solana looks right now, traders may want to maintain a diversified portfolio in order to increase their exposure to potential gains. One way of doing this is to allocate some funds to presale coins, which, under the right conditions, can rally strongly when they list for the first time. This is what Solana-based layer-two network Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is hoping to do, with its sale now having raised $30 million so far. Ringing in 2026 in style. 30M Raised! https://t.co/VNG0P4GuDo pic.twitter.com/dZ4WkGMSvv — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) January 1, 2026 This makes Bitcoin Hyper’s one of the biggest presales of the last 12 months, and indicates that it could become very popular once it launches. What’s interesting about Bitcoin Hyper is that it’s in the process of launching an L2 network for Bitcoin, one that is aiming to provide investors with a whole DeFi ecosystem in which to put their BTC to work. It harnesses Solana’s Virtual Machine, giving it a level of speed and scalability that will make it one of the fastest L2s around, while also making it compatible with Solana-based dapps. By depositing BTC with Bitcoin Hyper’s smart contract, users will receive a corresponding amount of HYPER, which they can then use with the L2’s growing range of dapps and protocols. In other words, they will be able to lend out the value of their Bitcoin, or they could stake their tokens and earn a yield, which currently stands at 39% APY. This is why Bitcoin Hyper has performed so well during its sale, which investors can join by going to the project’s official website . HYPER currently costs $0.013515, although this price will continue to rise for as long as the sale lasts.

In a Jan. 1 post on X, Jeff Yan framed “integrity” and “credible neutrality” as design constraints, not marketing language. Hyperliquid Reaffirms ‘No Insiders’ Ethos “Integrity has always been one of Hyperliquid’s core values. The house of all finance must be credibly neutral. This means no private investors, no market maker deals, and no protocol fees to any company,” he wrote , drawing a straight line between governance legitimacy and the absence of paid counterparties. That posture also extends to the origin story. “The initial state of any blockchain is a crucial part of its story that can never be erased. The original ethos of Bitcoin was a permissionless network accessible to all. Hyperliquid’s genesis distribution followed this spirit, going entirely to early users with core contributors excluded,” the post continued, adding that “the full distribution is verifiable onchain without obfuscation.” The founder acknowledged that this approach is not always convenient for would-be partners or ecosystem builders accustomed to preferential terms. “This principle of fairness frustrates a few users and builders who are used to special treatment,” he said, arguing it forces the community to “do things the hard way”, including “zero tolerance” for “integrity yellow flags” among team members. It is not the first time he has put the stance in blunt terms. In a January 2024 post, he summarized the policy as: “No investors. No paid market makers. No fees to the dev team… No insiders @HyperliquidX.” Lighter Debut Sparks Controversy The timing matters because the on-chain perpetuals category is now fighting not just over latency and liquidity, but over distribution optics, and Hyperliquid’s most visible new rival has become a live case study. Lighter, an Ethereum-based perpetual futures exchange that also operates as an Ethereum layer-2, launched earlier this week and has climbed quickly in the rankings. On Dec. 30, it airdropped 250 million LIT tokens, 25% of its 1 billion total supply, to early users, with another 25% set aside for future growth programs. The controversy is the other half. Lighter allocated 50% of supply to employees and investors, subject to a one-year lockup and three-year vesting, a structure that has triggered debate across DeFi about whether “community-first” narratives still hold when insiders retain an equal share of the cap table. In other words, Lighter’s launch has intensified the same ideological fault line Hyperliquid is trying to own: whether the cleanest on-chain market structure is primarily about product performance or about refusing the incentives that come with investors, paid liquidity, and insider allocations.

Officials say the deal threatens national security. The government is forcing HieFo Corp., a Delaware-based business, to give back chip assets it purchased from Emcore. A Chinese citizen set up HieFo and controls it, which officials say creates security problems. The companies said they wrapped up most of the deal in 2024. It was worth nearly $3 million. Semiconductor experts say Emcore’s technology has potential military uses. It could also improve AI computer systems, which worries the Trump administration. HieFo and Emcore haven’t commented on the decision. Cfius orders complete reversal of transaction The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. reviewed the purchase. The committee, called Cfius, examines foreign investments for security risks. Now HieFo has to sell everything it got from Emcore and undo the whole transaction. Trump’s China policy on technology has mixed signals. He’s relaxed some trade restrictions during negotiations with Chinese leaders. He’s also allowed China to buy certain AI chips from Nvidia and other US companies. But the administration still blocks some exports and investments for security reasons. Trump let Nvidia sell its advanced H200 AI chips to “approved customers” in China, but with a catch. Nvidia has to pay the government 15% of what it earns from those sales. Senator Elizabeth Warren and other Democrats called this dangerous for national security. As reported by Cryptopolitan previously, China ended up rejecting the H200 chips anyway. Instead, China chose semiconductors made at home. Beijing mandates domestic equipment for chip production China is pushing hard to build its own chip industry. Three people with knowledge of the policy told Reuters that China now requires chipmakers to source at least 50% of their equipment domestically when adding new production capacity. The rule isn’t published anywhere, but government officials have been informing companies about it in recent months when they apply to build or expand factories. Companies must prove through their purchasing bids that Chinese-made equipment will account for half or more of their orders. This marks one of Beijing’s strongest moves yet to cut dependence on foreign technology. The push accelerated after the US tightened export controls in 2023, banning sales of advanced AI chips and semiconductor equipment to China. Those American restrictions only stopped the most sophisticated tools from being sold. But China’s 50% requirement means manufacturers pick Chinese suppliers even when they can still legally buy equipment from the US, Japan, South Korea, and Europe. The US Trade Representative’s office released findings last month from a nearly year-long investigation into China’s semiconductor sector. Biden launched the inquiry in his final weeks as president, leaving Trump to decide what to do. Trump has since made a trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping that calmed global markets. The government isn’t imposing new tariffs on chip imports right away. The tariff rate stays at zero for 18 months. On June 23, 2027, it will increase to a rate the government will announce at least 30 days beforehand. A Federal Register notice said China’s effort to dominate semiconductors “is unreasonable and burdens or restricts U.S. commerce and thus is actionable.” Get seen where it counts.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP have all risen by around 2%, while the big winners in the top 100 include Pepe (26%), Pump.fun (11%), Polkadot (10%), and Ondo (10%). After an anticlimactic end to 2025, it now seems that the market may be in for a period of sustained growth, especially as new crypto ETFs continue to launch . In view of this bullish turn, we’ve highlighted the best new meme coin to 100x in 2026, picking soon-to-launch mining token PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , which could rally strongly when it lists next week. Best New Meme Coin to 100x in 2026 – January 2 Running on Ethereum, PEPENODE opened its presale in Q4 of last year and has since gone on to raise just over $2.5 million . This is a hugely encouraging figure, testifying to the interest the coin is generating among investors. And there’s a reason why PEPENODE is standing out from the crowd of new meme coins, which is that it’s launching a platform that will make mining tokens much more accessible to the average crypto user. Instead of requiring investment in expensive mining equipment and facilities, PEPENODE enables investors to build their own virtual mining rigs, which they can run in order to earn mining rewards in external tokens, such as Pepe and Fartcoin (and others). By spending PEPENODE tokens on new virtual mining nodes, users can increase the power of their rigs, earning bigger rewards in the process. In fact, users can also upgrade their nodes and combine them in novel ways, expanding their earning potential even further. And when they’ve finished mining, they can sell on their nodes, earning back PEPENODE in the process. This has the potential to make PEPENODE one of the most profitable new projects in the market in 2026, which helps to explain why its presale is doing so well. On top of this, holders can stake the coin for a passive income, with its protocol currently paying out a yield of 537% APY . PEPENODE Will Launch Next Week: Here’s How to Buy Before It’s Too Late But as mentioned in this article’s introduction, PEPENODE’s presale is ending very soon, with only 6 days left to buy the coin early. Investors can do this by going to the project’s official website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet. PEPENODE is selling at its final sale price of $0.0012161, with the coin exchangeable for ETH, USDT, BNB, or fiat currency. Happy New Year from PEPENODE. An amazing 2025 turns into a 2026 takeover. Celebrate tonight because tomorrow it's back to mining . https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/rJtemwAITp — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) January 1, 2026 Given its growing popularity, there’s every chance that it will rally well beyond this price once it launches next week. This is particularly the case when the market appears to be regaining bullishness, and just at the right time. This is why PEPENODE is our best new meme coin to 100x in 2026, and why investors should consider allocating a portion of their portfolios to it.

This announcement, made in early 2025, follows a contentious governance vote and signals a strategic evolution in how major DeFi protocols manage growth, value creation, and community alignment. The move addresses fundamental questions about value accrual and decentralization that have challenged the sector since its inception. Aave Revenue Sharing Model: The Core Announcement Stani Kulechov, the founder of the pioneering crypto lending protocol Aave, detailed a new framework for value distribution. According to his statement, revenue generated from business activities outside the core Aave protocol will be shared with holders of the AAVE governance token. This revenue will stem from ventures including real-world asset tokenization, institutional lending products, and consumer-facing financial applications. Kulechov emphasized that a formal governance proposal outlining the specific mechanics will follow soon. This model represents a departure from traditional protocol fee-sharing, focusing instead on value generated by the core development team’s expansion efforts. The announcement comes directly after the failure of a recent, more radical governance proposal. That proposal sought to make Aave Labs a formal subsidiary of the Aave DAO by transferring its intellectual property and equity to the decentralized autonomous organization. The proposal did not achieve the necessary consensus, highlighting ongoing tensions within the community regarding the appropriate relationship between a foundational development team and a decentralized governance body. Context and Precedent: The Failed Governance Proposal To understand the significance of the new revenue-sharing plan, one must examine the governance event that preceded it. The community recently voted on Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) 2025-01, which proposed a full absorption of Aave Labs into the Aave DAO. Proponents argued this would perfect decentralization by aligning all incentives under a single token-holder governed entity. However, the proposal faced substantial opposition over concerns about operational agility, legal complexity, and the dilution of the founding team’s ability to execute swiftly. A particularly notable aspect of the vote was Kulechov’s own actions. Public blockchain data revealed that the founder purchased a substantial amount of AAVE tokens prior to the vote, which he then used to exercise his voting rights. This action sparked immediate debate within the crypto community. Critics raised concerns about centralization and the potential for founder influence to override broader community sentiment. Defenders argued it demonstrated a significant financial commitment and alignment with the protocol’s future. This event underscores the complex and often messy reality of on-chain governance, where capital concentration can directly translate to voting power. The Centralization Debate in DeFi Governance The incident highlights a persistent structural challenge in DeFi: the balance between efficient leadership and decentralized decision-making. While decentralized autonomous organizations promise community-led governance, early founders and large token holders often retain significant influence. Kulechov’s large token purchase, while transparent, brought this tension into sharp focus. Analysts from institutions like CoinShares and Delphi Digital have frequently noted that governance participation rates in major DAOs often remain low, sometimes allowing concentrated holders to sway outcomes. The new revenue-sharing model can be seen as a response to this critique, offering tangible value to all token holders as the ecosystem expands, potentially incentivizing broader and more sustained participation. Strategic Pivot: Seeking Growth Beyond Core DeFi Kulechov’s rationale for the new business direction is rooted in competitive and strategic necessity. He argued that the Aave protocol must explore new revenue streams beyond its established decentralized lending and borrowing markets. The founder identified several key growth verticals: Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization: Bringing traditional financial assets like treasury bills, real estate, and corporate debt onto the blockchain as collateral. Institutional Lending: Creating tailored, compliant products for hedge funds, family offices, and other traditional finance entities. Consumer Financial Products: Developing user-friendly applications that leverage Aave’s liquidity for savings, payments, or credit. Kulechov contended that funding these ventures directly through the DAO treasury would be “inefficient and uncompetitive.” Instead, he proposed a model where Aave Labs, with its dedicated team and resources, incubates and develops these products. The successful ventures would then generate revenue, a portion of which flows back to the AAVE token holders. This approach mirrors strategies seen in traditional tech, where a core company spins out new business units, but with a crypto-native twist of direct value sharing with the community. Comparative Analysis: Value Accrual in DeFi Protocols How a protocol captures and distributes value is a fundamental differentiator in DeFi. The Aave announcement places it within a spectrum of existing models. The table below contrasts the new Aave approach with other major protocols: Protocol Primary Value Accrual Model Token Utility Aave (New Model) Protocol fees + Shared non-protocol business revenue Governance, Safety Module, Revenue Share Compound (COMP) Governance rights over protocol parameters Pure Governance Uniswap (UNI) Governance rights (fee switch inactive as of 2025) Pure Governance Maker (MKR) Governance and surplus buffer recapitalization Governance, Recapitalization Curve (CRV) Fee distribution and vote-locking for gauge weights Governance, Fee Share (veTokenomics) This new hybrid model could strengthen the AAVE token’s investment thesis by adding a direct cash-flow component alongside its established governance and staking utilities. It responds to a common critique that many governance tokens lack clear value accrual mechanisms beyond speculative trading. Potential Impacts and Market Implications The proposed shift carries several potential implications for Aave and the broader DeFi sector. Firstly, it could enhance AAVE’s attractiveness as a yield-bearing asset, potentially drawing in a new class of investors focused on real yield and cash flow. Secondly, it may set a precedent for other foundational DeFi teams considering how to scale their operations while maintaining community trust. Projects like Compound Labs or the Uniswap Foundation may face increased community pressure to explore similar value-sharing arrangements for their off-protocol initiatives. However, the model also introduces new complexities. The definition and transparent reporting of “non-protocol revenue” will be crucial. Token holders will require robust, verifiable accounting to trust the system. Furthermore, the legal and regulatory treatment of such revenue sharing remains an open question in many jurisdictions. Could distributing profits from business activities turn a governance token into a security in the eyes of regulators? These are questions the forthcoming formal proposal must address with clarity. Expert Perspectives on Protocol Sustainability Industry observers have long debated the sustainability of pure governance tokens. David Hoffman, co-founder of Bankless, has written extensively on the need for “protocol-owned value” and sustainable treasury management. The Aave move aligns with this school of thought, seeking to diversify revenue sources. Conversely, some purists argue that a protocol’s value should derive solely from its utility and that off-protocol ventures distract from core development. The success of this model will likely depend on Aave Labs’ ability to execute on these new ventures without diverting resources from maintaining and improving the core, battle-tested lending markets that made Aave a leader. Conclusion The announcement by Aave founder Stani Kulechov to share non-protocol revenue with AAVE token holders marks a pivotal experiment in DeFi governance and value distribution. It emerges from the practical realities of a failed full-integration proposal and addresses core concerns about centralization and value accrual. By proposing a hybrid model where Aave Labs pursues growth initiatives and shares the proceeds, the protocol seeks to balance entrepreneurial agility with community alignment. As the formal proposal takes shape, the crypto community will watch closely. Its structure, transparency, and execution could well define a new template for how foundational teams and decentralized communities collaborate to build and capture value in the evolving financial landscape. The success of this Aave revenue sharing model may influence the trajectory of decentralized governance for years to come. FAQs Q1: What exactly is Aave Labs proposing to share with token holders? Aave Labs proposes to share a portion of the revenue generated from new business ventures outside the core Aave lending protocol. This includes future income from areas like real-world asset tokenization, institutional products, and consumer finance apps, not the standard fees from the existing DeFi platform. Q2: Why did the previous proposal to make Aave Labs a DAO subsidiary fail? The previous governance proposal (AIP 2025-01) failed to pass due to community concerns about operational inefficiency, legal complexity, and potentially slowing down the development team’s ability to compete and innovate in fast-moving markets. Q3: How does Stani Kulechov’s token purchase affect governance? Kulechov’s purchase of a large amount of AAVE before the vote allowed him to cast more votes. This action highlighted the ongoing tension in DAOs between founder influence and decentralized decision-making, as voting power is directly proportional to token ownership. Q4: How does this model differ from other DeFi protocols like Uniswap or Compound? Unlike Uniswap (pure governance) or Compound (pure governance), Aave’s new model adds a direct revenue-sharing component from external business activities. This hybrid approach combines governance rights with a potential cash-flow mechanism, similar in spirit to but distinct from Curve’s fee-sharing model. Q5: What are the main risks or challenges with this new revenue-sharing plan? Key challenges include defining and transparently reporting “non-protocol revenue,” ensuring the core protocol development is not neglected, and navigating potential regulatory scrutiny regarding whether the revenue share could affect the legal classification of the AAVE token.

Instead of a broad-based rally, most altcoins suffered deep and prolonged drawdowns, erasing years of gains and forcing many investors out of the market. As 2026 approaches, sentiment around altcoins remains fragile. A growing number of analysts now warn that the worst may not be over, arguing that structural weakness, declining liquidity, and fading retail participation could drive another leg lower across the sector. Related Reading: Ethereum Liquidity Rebuilds On Binance: December Inflows Signal Strategic Repositioning Market data reinforces this cautious outlook. The Crypto Total Market Cap, excluding the top 10 assets—commonly referred to as the OTHERS index—has collapsed by more than 50% since December 2024. Market capitalization has fallen from roughly $451 billion to around $182 billion in just twelve months, highlighting the scale of capital destruction across mid- and small-cap tokens. This sharp contraction reflects aggressive de-risking, weak demand, and sustained selling pressure across the altcoin market. However, not all analysts are convinced the altcoin cycle is finished. A smaller group points to historical precedents, arguing that periods of extreme underperformance and investor capitulation have often preceded powerful altcoin recoveries. From this perspective, 2026 could mark the delayed arrival of an altcoin season—if liquidity conditions improve and capital rotation resumes. Altcoin Trading Activity Remains Elevated Despite Price Weakness A recent CryptoQuant report challenges the widely held belief that this cycle has produced “no altcoin season.” According to the data, centralized exchange trading volume for altcoins—excluding the top five assets—has reached levels significantly higher than those seen in previous market cycles. In other words, altcoins are being traded more actively than ever, even as prices remain deeply depressed across much of the market. This divergence between volume and price helps explain the prevailing confusion. While many tokens have lost a substantial portion of their value, on-chain and exchange data show that activity has not disappeared. Instead, the market has undergone a structural shift. Retail participation has largely faded after months of losses, with many smaller investors capitulating and exiting positions. Their absence, however, has not resulted in lower overall trading activity. CryptoQuant’s analysis suggests that altcoin dominance has increasingly concentrated among larger players. Whales and professional participants now account for a growing share of altcoin volume, using periods of low liquidity and weak sentiment to accumulate positions or actively rotate capital. From this perspective, the current phase may not signal the absence of an altcoin cycle, but rather its transformation. If whale-driven positioning continues and broader market conditions improve, these participants are likely to push prices higher to maximize returns. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Distribution Re-Emerges: BTC Enters A Fragile Price Phase OTHERS Market Cap Shows Prolonged Compression The OTHERS chart, which tracks the total crypto market capitalization excluding the top 10 assets, highlights the depth and duration of the ongoing altcoin correction. After peaking near $450 billion in late 2024, the market has lost more than half of its value, stabilizing around the $200–210 billion zone. This sharp contraction confirms that the altcoin market has experienced a full reset rather than a shallow pullback. From a technical perspective, the structure reflects prolonged compression. Price is currently oscillating around the 200-week moving average (red), a level that historically acts as a long-term equilibrium zone during transitions between bearish and recovery phases. The failure to reclaim the 100-week and 50-week moving averages suggests that upside momentum remains weak and that buyers lack conviction at higher levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Sets The Stage For Bullish Cross In Q1 2026 Volume dynamics reinforce this view. While periodic spikes appear during sell-offs and relief rallies, there is no sustained expansion in volume that would signal broad-based accumulation. This implies selective positioning rather than widespread risk appetite. Importantly, the market is no longer making aggressive lower lows, indicating that forced selling may be largely exhausted. However, the absence of higher highs keeps the structure neutral-to-bearish. For a meaningful altcoin recovery, OTHERS would need to reclaim the $260–280 billion range and hold above key moving averages. Until then, the chart suggests consolidation, dominance by larger players, and a market still searching for a durable bottom rather than the start of a classic altcoin season.

The conversation addressed how investors can structure their portfolios for the future and how assets such as XRP can be used for long-term retirement without liquidation. Shifting Views on Retirement During the interview, Paul Barron noted that a growing number of individuals in their 40s are setting retirement goals earlier than previous generations. This reflects changing work expectations, as more people seek financial independence sooner rather than planning to remain in traditional employment for several decades. Claver explained that people typically move through different financial stages as they age. He observed that early adulthood is often shaped by learning through experience, while the following years focus on building wealth through careers, investment, and entrepreneurship. By midlife, priorities commonly shift toward restructuring personal goals and enjoying the results of earlier financial decisions. In later years, he stated that many begin to prioritize community support, knowledge sharing, and charitable work, especially when financial stability has already been secured. He added that the modern financial landscape offers more opportunities for wealth creation than previous eras, particularly because of the growth of digital assets. Diversification in Wealth Building Claver emphasized the value of diversification across all age groups. According to him, younger adults usually have a higher tolerance for risk and can allocate more resources to growth-oriented investments. As people approach retirement, he noted they tend to prefer safer assets and consistent returns. He referenced strategies commonly used by high-net-worth families. These approaches often allocate roughly 20–30% to liquid, low-risk holdings such as cash and government securities, another 20–30% toward equities, and approximately 10–20% to real estate due to its benefits for income generation and taxation. Business ownership is also an important component for wealth generation, while cryptocurrency typically represents a smaller allocation, usually between 1–5%, though more aggressive investors may choose to increase this portion based on risk preference.

He noted interest in assets including XRP, Bitcoin, HBAR, XLM, and yield products from networks such as Flare. Claver stated that DAG prioritizes helping clients establish proper structures for asset management rather than advocating for a specific product. He highlighted Wyoming as one of the most advantageous jurisdictions for digital asset ownership due to legal protections and favorable regulations. He revealed that his firm has assisted clients in forming nearly 7,500 limited liability companies in the state, many of which are used to store assets such as XRP, ETH, Solana, MATIC, Chainlink, and others. These LLCs are generally created as holding entities rather than trading entities so that assets qualify for long-term capital gains treatment and remain shielded from operational risk. He further noted that these structures can provide legal protection, as creditors cannot seize assets directly but may only request a charging order. To complement LLCs, DAG often integrates living trusts for clients. These trusts, which may be revocable or irrevocable depending on preference, ensure smooth inheritance without probate processes. Claver stated that the firm currently establishes living trusts for $500, with an upcoming increase to $1,000. Trusts can hold various assets, including digital currencies, property, vehicles, precious metals, and valuable possessions. Claver’s perspective illustrates how digital assets such as XRP can play a role in long-term retirement planning when combined with proper legal structure, diversification, and strategy. Rather than relying solely on selling tokens for profit, investors can position assets within LLCs and trusts to preserve wealth, maintain control, and pass holdings to future generations.

According to data analysis from The Block, PEPE’s price surged over 32% in a single day, catalyzing substantial gains across the broader memecoin landscape and contributing to a notable altcoin market recovery. This early-year movement has captured analyst attention, suggesting a potential reversal from the prolonged sideways trading that characterized the latter part of 2024. PEPE Leads a Memecoin Market Resurgence The January 2nd rally placed the often-volatile memecoin sector at the forefront of cryptocurrency gains. PEPE’s remarkable performance was not an isolated event. Consequently, other prominent memecoins demonstrated considerable short-term strength. For instance, Solana-based token POPCAT followed closely behind PEPE’s lead. Additionally, established names like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) posted gains. Meanwhile, newer entrants such as Bonk (BONK), Floki (FLOKI), and dogwifhat (WIF) also participated in the upward movement. This collective surge provided a stark contrast to the sector’s performance in late 2024. Importantly, the rally extended beyond memecoins. The artificial intelligence (AI) crypto sector and several newly launched tokens also recorded significant appreciation. This pattern indicates a broader risk-on sentiment returning to the digital asset markets. The simultaneous growth across these speculative segments often signals renewed trader confidence and capital inflow. Analysts Decipher the January Rally Drivers Market analysts have provided context for this early-year surge, linking it to historical patterns and recent market trauma. VanEck analyst Matt Sigel highlighted a recurring seasonal trend. He noted that assets demonstrating poor year-end performance historically tend to experience stronger rebounds in January on average. This “January effect,” observed in traditional finance, appears to manifest in the crypto markets as well. Jake Kenis, an analyst at blockchain analytics firm Nansen, offered a more specific catalyst. He pointed to the major crypto liquidation event on October 10, 2024, as a critical point. Kenis stated that memecoins were arguably the hardest-hit sector following that volatility. The early 2025 capital flow into these assets, therefore, suggests traders are strategically building positions. They are anticipating a sustained upward move after months of consolidation and recovery. A Note of Caution Amid the Optimism However, Kenis injected a note of necessary caution into the analysis. He emphasized that while the initial price action is notable, it requires confirmation on longer-term charts to be considered a definitive, sustainable trend. This analytical prudence underscores the inherent volatility of memecoins. Their price movements can be driven heavily by sentiment and social momentum rather than fundamental utility. Therefore, sustained volume and a break above key resistance levels will be crucial watchpoints for validating the rally’s longevity. The Broader Altcoin Market Context in 2025 The memecoin surge occurs within a specific macroeconomic and technological landscape shaping 2025. Understanding this context is vital for a complete picture. Regulatory Clarity: Increased regulatory frameworks in key jurisdictions may be reducing systemic uncertainty for altcoins. Layer-1 Innovation: The performance of Solana-based memecoins like POPCAT and BONK highlights the ongoing competition among blockchain networks for developer and user activity. Market Cycle Position: Many analysts view early 2025 as a potential accumulation phase following the 2024 market correction, setting the stage for new growth cycles. Furthermore, the parallel rise of the AI crypto sector suggests a bifurcation in trader interest. Some capital is chasing pure meme-driven narratives, while other allocations are flowing into tokens linked to technological frontiers like artificial intelligence. This diversification within the altcoin complex can contribute to overall ecosystem resilience. Historical Performance and Volatility Considerations Memecoins, by their nature, present unique risk-reward profiles. Their historical price charts are typically characterized by extreme peaks and steep drawdowns. For example, the following table contrasts the utility-driven growth of a sector like AI tokens with the sentiment-driven rallies of memecoins: Asset Type Primary Driver Typical Volatility Example (Jan 2 Gain) Memecoin (e.g., PEPE) Social Sentiment, Community Extremely High +32%+ AI Sector Token Technological Roadmap, Adoption High Significant Major Layer-1 (e.g., ETH) Network Usage, Staking Yield Moderate-High Moderate This comparison underscores why analyst caution is warranted. The rapid influx of capital into PEPE and its peers demonstrates high-risk appetite. However, it does not guarantee a stable long-term trend. The sustainability of this rally will depend on whether the momentum transitions from short-term speculative trading to longer-term holder accumulation. Conclusion The dramatic PEPE memecoin surge on January 2, 2025, served as a powerful catalyst for a broader altcoin market recovery. Led by PEPE’s 32% gain, the movement rejuvenated the entire memecoin sector and spilled over into AI and new tokens. Analyst insights point to a combination of seasonal rebound patterns and strategic positioning after the October 2024 liquidation event as key drivers. While the initial price action signals a potential shift from sideways trading, experts stress the need for confirmation on longer-timeframe charts. Ultimately, this event highlights the continued influence of sentiment and community in cryptocurrency markets, reminding participants of the high-reward yet high-risk nature of assets like PEPE in the evolving 2025 landscape. FAQs Q1: What caused PEPE’s price to surge over 32% on January 2, 2025? The surge was part of a broader memecoin and altcoin market recovery. Analysts attribute it to seasonal “January effect” rebounds for underperforming assets and traders building positions after months of consolidation following the major market liquidation in October 2024. Q2: Were other cryptocurrencies besides PEPE affected by this rally? Yes. The rally was sector-wide. Other memecoins like POPCAT, DOGE, SHIB, BONK, FLOKI, and WIF saw gains. Additionally, the artificial intelligence (AI) crypto sector and several newly launched tokens posted significant increases. Q3: What do analysts say about the sustainability of this memecoin surge? Analysts like Nansen’s Jake Kenis caution that while the initial capital flow is notable, the movement needs confirmation on longer-term charts to be considered a definitive, sustainable trend, due to the high volatility typical of memecoins. Q4: How does the October 2024 liquidation event relate to this January 2025 rally? The memecoin sector was hit particularly hard by the October 10, 2024, liquidation event. The January inflow is seen by some analysts as capital returning to rebuild positions in these assets after a period of recovery and sideways trading. Q5: What is the “January effect” mentioned by analysts? The “January effect” is a historical market pattern where assets that performed poorly at the end of the previous year tend to experience stronger rebounds in the month of January. VanEck analyst Matt Sigel applied this concept to the crypto market context.

56749134,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258073,1767399911,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitmain’s Bold Bet: Mining Giant Stakes Additional $259 Million in Ethereum, Signaling Major Confidence",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitmain-ethereum-staking-billion-dollar-bet/,"BitcoinWorld Bitmain’s Bold Bet: Mining Giant Stakes Additional $259 Million in Ethereum, Signaling Major Confidence In a move that underscores the deepening institutional commitment to blockchain’s future, mining hardware titan Bitmain has executed a colossal $259 million Ethereum stake, a decision that reverberates through the cryptocurrency markets and signals a pivotal strategic shift. According to a report from on-chain analytics provider Onchain Lens, an address strongly associated with Bitmain (BMNR) staked an additional 82,560 ETH within a single hour, amplifying its already massive position in the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. This action is not an isolated event but part of a calculated, long-term accumulation strategy, bringing Bitmain’s total staked Ethereum to a staggering 544,064 ETH, valued at approximately $1.7 billion. The transaction, observed globally on March 21, 2025, represents one of the most significant single-entity staking maneuvers of the year, prompting analysis from industry experts and market observers. Bitmain’s Ethereum Staking Strategy: A Deep Dive into the Data On-chain data provides a transparent ledger of Bitmain’s escalating commitment to Ethereum. The recent transaction of 82,560 ETH follows a consistent pattern of accumulation by the identified BMNR address. Consequently, the cumulative total now positions Bitmain as one of the largest known corporate entities participating in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This mechanism, which replaced the energy-intensive proof-of-work model in 2022, requires validators to lock, or “stake,” ETH to secure the network and process transactions. In return, validators earn rewards, typically ranging from 3% to 5% annually on their staked assets. Therefore, Bitmain’s $1.7 billion stake is not merely a passive holding; it is an active, revenue-generating investment in the network’s infrastructure and security. The strategic implications are multifaceted. Firstly, this move demonstrates a significant pivot for a company historically synonymous with Bitcoin mining hardware. Secondly, it represents a substantial vote of confidence in Ethereum’s long-term viability and economic model. Moreover, by locking such a vast quantity of ETH, Bitmain effectively reduces the circulating supply available for trading, which can contribute to reduced market volatility under certain conditions. Industry analysts point to this as a maturation signal, showing how legacy crypto-native firms are diversifying their treasury strategies beyond simple asset acquisition. The Broader Context of Institutional Crypto Staking Bitmain’s latest move fits into a larger, accelerating trend of institutional participation in cryptocurrency staking. Major financial entities, including publicly traded companies and asset managers, have increasingly allocated portions of their treasury to staked digital assets. For instance, several regulated investment funds now offer clients exposure to staking yields. Similarly, traditional finance custodians have developed secure staking services for institutional clients. This trend validates staking as a legitimate yield-generating activity within the digital asset ecosystem. The following table illustrates the scale of Bitmain’s position relative to other known large stakers, based on publicly available on-chain data and corporate disclosures: Entity / Pool Approximate ETH Staked Estimated Value (USD) Bitmain (BMNR Address) 544,064 ETH ~$1.7 Billion Lido DAO (Liquid Staking Protocol) Over 9 Million ETH ~$28 Billion Coinbase (Exchange Staking Service) Over 4 Million ETH ~$12.5 Billion Kraken Exchange Over 1.2 Million ETH ~$3.8 Billion While decentralized protocols like Lido command a larger total, Bitmain’s position as a single corporate entity is exceptionally notable. Furthermore, this activity highlights the growing importance of on-chain analytics tools like Onchain Lens. These platforms provide real-time transparency, allowing markets to react to and analyze the behavior of major holders, often referred to as “whales.” Expert Analysis: Deciphering the Strategic Motives Financial analysts specializing in digital assets point to several rational drivers behind Bitmain’s aggressive staking strategy. Primarily, staking provides a predictable return on a core treasury asset, diversifying revenue streams beyond the cyclical hardware sales business. Additionally, by becoming a major network validator, Bitmain gains deeper influence and insight into the Ethereum ecosystem, which could inform future product development and strategic partnerships. The company may also be hedging against potential declines in its primary mining market by building a substantial position in a complementary, yield-bearing asset. “This isn’t a speculative trade; it’s a strategic allocation,” notes a veteran crypto-market strategist from a leading fintech research firm. “The scale and consistency point to a formal treasury management policy. Bitmain is effectively converting a portion of its balance sheet into a productive, network-aligned asset. This move signals a maturation in corporate crypto strategy, mirroring actions seen from companies like MicroStrategy in the Bitcoin domain, but with the added component of network participation and yield.” The strategist further emphasizes that such large-scale staking adds to Ethereum’s network security , as it becomes exponentially more expensive for a malicious actor to attack a network secured by billions of dollars in staked value. Potential Market Impact and Future Implications The immediate market impact of a single staking transaction, even of this size, is often absorbed without major price dislocation. However, the cumulative effect of sustained institutional staking has profound long-term implications. A significant portion of the ETH supply becomes illiquid, locked in staking contracts. This reduction in readily available sell pressure can create a firmer price foundation. Conversely, it also means a large amount of ETH will eventually enter the market upon withdrawal, a dynamic that future market models must account for. For the cryptocurrency mining industry, Bitmain’s pivot is particularly instructive. It demonstrates a viable path for mining companies to leverage their expertise and capital to engage with proof-of-stake networks. Other mining firms may follow suit, exploring staking services or launching their own validation operations. Key considerations for the future include: Regulatory Clarity: How securities regulators worldwide classify staking rewards will significantly impact corporate participation. Technical Risk: Staking involves smart contract and slashing risks, where funds can be penalized for network downtime or malicious actions. Market Cycles: The attractiveness of staking yields fluctuates with network activity and the broader crypto market cycle. Ultimately, Bitmain’s action reinforces Ethereum’s position as critical infrastructure for the next generation of the internet. It also showcases the evolution of crypto-native corporations into sophisticated digital asset managers and network stakeholders. Conclusion Bitmain’s decision to stake an additional $259 million in Ethereum is a landmark event that transcends a simple portfolio adjustment. This Bitmain ETH stake , bringing its total commitment to $1.7 billion, reflects a strategic, long-term bet on the Ethereum ecosystem’s sustainability and growth. The move highlights the maturation of institutional involvement in cryptocurrency, shifting from pure speculation to active, yield-generating network participation. As on-chain data continues to provide unprecedented transparency, actions by major holders like Bitmain will serve as key indicators for market sentiment and strategic trends. This substantial commitment not only bolsters Ethereum’s security and economic model but also sets a precedent for other industry giants, signaling that deep engagement with blockchain networks is becoming a cornerstone of advanced corporate digital asset strategy. FAQs Q1: What does it mean to “stake” Ethereum? Staking is the process of actively participating in transaction validation on a proof-of-stake blockchain like Ethereum. Validators lock up a certain amount of the native cryptocurrency (ETH) as a form of security deposit. In return for helping to secure and operate the network, they earn rewards, similar to earning interest. Q2: Why is Bitmain, a mining hardware company, staking Ethereum? Bitmain is diversifying its business model. While its core revenue comes from selling Bitcoin mining hardware, staking Ethereum provides a separate, predictable yield on its capital. It also gives the company direct involvement in the second-largest blockchain ecosystem, which is strategically valuable. Q3: How does large-scale staking by entities like Bitmain affect the Ethereum market? It reduces the circulating supply of ETH available for immediate trading, which can decrease selling pressure and increase price stability. It also significantly enhances the network’s security, as attacking a network secured by billions in staked value becomes prohibitively expensive. Q4: What are the risks associated with staking such a large amount of ETH? Risks include “slashing,” where a portion of staked funds can be penalized for validator downtime or malicious behavior; smart contract vulnerabilities in the staking protocol; and the opportunity cost of having capital locked up and unable to be sold during market volatility. Q5: Where does the data about Bitmain’s staking come from? The data comes from on-chain analytics firms like Onchain Lens. These firms analyze public blockchain transaction data, cluster addresses based on behavioral patterns and known labels, and report on the activities of major market participants, often referred to as “whales.” This post Bitmain’s Bold Bet: Mining Giant Stakes Additional $259 Million in Ethereum, Signaling Major Confidence first appeared on BitcoinWorld .",Crypto News|Bitmain|BLOCKCHAIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETHEREUM|Staking,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|MINING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2026-01-03 00:25:11
56749255,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258075,1767400212,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Critical Support Tests Threaten Alarming Drop to $50,000",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-analysis-critical-support-tests/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Analysis: Critical Support Tests Threaten Alarming Drop to $50,000 Global cryptocurrency markets face heightened volatility as Bitcoin confronts its most significant technical challenges since early 2023, with multiple analysts warning that failure to hold crucial support levels could trigger a dramatic decline toward $50,000. This analysis examines the complex technical landscape, historical precedents, and market dynamics shaping Bitcoin’s current trajectory. Bitcoin Technical Analysis Reveals Critical Support Battleground Technical analysts worldwide are closely monitoring Bitcoin’s price action as the cryptocurrency tests pivotal support levels established during April’s market correction. The monthly chart currently shows Bitcoin finding tentative support near its 20-month exponential moving average (EMA), a level that successfully contained the previous major correction. However, market observers note that repeated tests of this crucial zone could weaken its effectiveness over time. According to recent technical assessments, a monthly close below both the 20-month EMA and April’s low would represent a significant break in Bitcoin’s established uptrend. Such a development could potentially initiate a downward trajectory targeting the $50,000 psychological support level. This scenario gains additional credibility when examining historical patterns and market structure developments. Bearish Technical Indicators Converge on Cryptocurrency Markets Multiple technical warning signals are emerging simultaneously across different timeframes. On weekly charts, analysts observe the potential formation of a “dead cross” pattern, where the 20-week EMA threatens to fall below the 50-week simple moving average (SMA). This technical event last occurred in January 2022 and preceded significant market declines throughout that year. The technical landscape reveals several concerning developments: Support Level Erosion: Repeated tests of the April support zone may diminish its strength Pattern Formation: Potential Head and Shoulders pattern development suggesting trend reversal Momentum Shifts: Declining volume and weakening buying pressure across exchanges Timeframe Alignment: Bearish signals appearing simultaneously on weekly and monthly charts Bitcoin Key Technical Levels and Implications Technical Level Current Status Bullish Implication Bearish Implication 20-Month EMA Testing Support Holds as springboard for recovery Break triggers trend reversal April Low Support Under Pressure Establishes higher low pattern Confirms breakdown structure Weekly Dead Cross Forming Avoided through price recovery Confirms medium-term bearish shift $50,000 Level Psychological Support Major accumulation zone if reached Next major support if breakdown occurs Historical Context and Market Psychology Market analysts emphasize the importance of historical context when evaluating current technical developments. The cryptocurrency market has experienced similar technical setups during previous cycles, with outcomes varying based on broader market conditions, institutional participation levels, and macroeconomic factors. The current technical warnings mirror patterns observed before significant corrections in both 2018 and 2022, though market structure has evolved substantially since those periods. Institutional adoption has changed market dynamics considerably since previous bearish technical formations. Traditional financial institutions now participate more actively in cryptocurrency markets, potentially altering how technical patterns play out. However, technical analysis principles remain relevant as they reflect collective market psychology and trader behavior across all participant categories. Divergent Analyst Perspectives on Market Direction While technical charts currently favor bearish interpretations, cryptocurrency analysts remain divided about Bitcoin’s immediate future. Some market observers argue that current technical warnings may represent temporary volatility rather than sustained trend reversal. These analysts point to fundamental factors including institutional adoption, regulatory developments, and technological advancements as counterbalancing forces. Alternative perspectives suggest that technical breakdowns could represent buying opportunities rather than reasons for panic. Historical data shows that significant corrections often precede substantial rallies in cryptocurrency markets. However, proponents of the bearish outlook emphasize that risk management requires respecting technical warnings until proven invalid by price action. The analytical community generally agrees on several key points: Current technical setup warrants cautious positioning and risk management April support represents a critical line in the sand for market structure Volume and momentum indicators will provide crucial confirmation signals Broader market conditions will ultimately determine technical pattern outcomes Market Structure and Pattern Development Implications Technical analysts are particularly concerned about potential pattern developments that could amplify downward pressure. The possible formation of a Head and Shoulders pattern represents one such concern, as this classical technical formation typically signals trend reversal when confirmed. Pattern completion would involve breaking below the “neckline” support level, potentially triggering algorithmic selling and stop-loss orders. Market structure analysis reveals additional complexities. The relationship between spot markets and derivatives markets has created interconnected risks that can accelerate price movements in either direction. Liquidity conditions across different exchanges and trading pairs also influence how technical patterns develop and resolve. These structural factors add layers of complexity to straightforward technical interpretations. Macroeconomic Factors Influencing Cryptocurrency Valuation Beyond pure technical analysis, macroeconomic conditions significantly influence cryptocurrency valuations. Interest rate policies, inflation data, and traditional market correlations all impact Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Current macroeconomic uncertainty creates additional headwinds for risk assets including cryptocurrencies, potentially exacerbating technical weaknesses. Historical analysis reveals that cryptocurrency markets often experience increased volatility during periods of macroeconomic transition. The current environment features multiple uncertain factors including monetary policy normalization, geopolitical tensions, and shifting regulatory landscapes. These external factors interact with technical patterns to create complex market dynamics that challenge simple predictive models. Several macroeconomic considerations currently affect cryptocurrency markets: Central bank policy shifts and their impact on risk appetite Traditional market correlations and decoupling patterns Regulatory developments across major jurisdictions Institutional adoption pace and capital flow patterns Conclusion Bitcoin price analysis reveals a cryptocurrency at a critical technical juncture, with multiple indicators warning of potential declines toward $50,000 if key support levels fail. The convergence of bearish technical signals across different timeframes warrants cautious market observation and appropriate risk management. While analyst opinions remain divided about ultimate outcomes, current technical evidence suggests respecting support level tests and pattern developments until market structure provides clearer directional signals. The coming weeks will prove crucial for determining whether Bitcoin maintains its broader uptrend or enters a more significant corrective phase. FAQs Q1: What is the 20-month EMA and why is it important for Bitcoin? The 20-month Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is a technical indicator that smooths price data over 20 months, giving more weight to recent prices. It’s important because it has historically acted as dynamic support during bull markets and resistance during bear markets, making its current test significant for trend determination. Q2: How reliable are “dead cross” patterns in predicting Bitcoin price movements? While dead cross patterns (when a shorter-term moving average crosses below a longer-term one) have preceded significant declines historically, they’re not infallible predictors. Their reliability depends on confirmation from other indicators, trading volume, and broader market context. The 2022 dead cross did precede declines, but false signals can occur. Q3: What would invalidate the bearish Bitcoin technical outlook? The bearish outlook would be invalidated by a strong weekly close above current resistance levels, particularly with increasing volume. Sustained movement above the 20-week EMA with momentum confirmation would suggest the technical breakdown was false. Fundamental catalysts like major institutional adoption could also override technical warnings. Q4: How does current Bitcoin technical analysis compare to previous market cycles? Current technical warnings share similarities with 2018 and 2022 patterns but occur in a fundamentally different market context. Institutional participation, derivatives markets, and regulatory frameworks have evolved significantly. While technical patterns repeat, their outcomes may differ due to changed market structure and participant behavior. Q5: What time horizon do these Bitcoin technical warnings apply to? These technical analyses primarily address medium-term timeframes ranging from several weeks to several months. Short-term price movements can deviate from these patterns due to news events or liquidity conditions. Long-term trends require analysis of broader fundamentals including adoption metrics, technological developments, and macroeconomic conditions.

Binance announced that it will delist some Flow trading pairs and add FLOW and other volatile tokens to its “Watchlist.” This label was introduced to notify users about elevated risk profiles. According to a Friday announcement, Binance stated that it would eliminate nine spot trading pairs from the exchange, effective Saturday, including one for FLOW/BTC. In a separate notice, the company included FLOW and three other tokens on its monitoring tag list. Flow hack exposes vulnerabilities and sparks market turmoil On December 27, 2025, the Flow network was hacked by a hacker who exploited a weakness to mint fraudulent FLOW tokens, sparking a rapid sell‑off and liquidity crisis on exchanges. The hack is said to have shaved about 40% off Flow’s market price in the immediate days after the attack. The label is applied to tokens that exhibit “notably higher volatility and risks compared to other listed tokens,” the exchange stated, noting that the monitoring flag indicates the risk of tokens no longer meeting listing requirements. Binance stated that the decisive moves followed “recent reviews” of the tokens, but did not explicitly mention the Flow exploit on Saturday. Reporters reached out to the exchange for comment on the exploit, but had not received a response at the time of publication. In a preliminary post-mortem report on the exploit, Flow said it was “concerned by one exchange’s handling of this incident,” referring to an “AML/KYC failure” that allowed the hackers to deposit the stolen FLOW tokens, convert some to Bitcoin, and withdraw the funds. Some users speculated that, based on Flow’s description, the unnamed exchange could have been Binance. Restoration underway as exchanges and developers respond As of Friday, the Flow Foundation noted that it was working on fully restoring the blockchain ecosystem as part of a plan to address the $3.9 million exploit. According to the platform, the only steps remaining in the plan were to address user account restoration and remediate fraudulent tokens. “What was initially projected as a sequential, multi-day process has been executed in parallel, restoring both Cadence and EVM [Ethereum Virtual Machine] functionality while maintaining surgical precision in removing fraudulent assets and preserving legitimate transaction history,” said Flow The delisting news follows the scrapping of a proposal from earlier this week that included a rollback of the blockchain, which it halted amid criticism from many users. According to the platform, it expected to release a comprehensive post-mortem report on the hack “within 48 hours” with “complete ecosystem restoration expected this week.” In an official update, Binance stated that it had traced and frozen the hacker’s remaining funds held on its platform to protect users, while urging the Flow project team to provide a detailed post-mortem of the exploit. Binance also emphasized that if the Flow team implements any recovery mechanism, exchange wallets should be excluded from such rollbacks to prevent complicating user balances.

Senior CryptoQuant analyst Julio Moreno has identified critical flaws in how the cryptocurrency community interprets on-chain metrics, specifically warning that exchange wallet activities are creating misleading signals about whale behavior. This discovery comes at a crucial time for Bitcoin investors navigating complex market conditions in early 2025. Understanding the Bitcoin Whale Accumulation Narrative For years, cryptocurrency analysts have monitored whale addresses as key indicators of market sentiment. These large holders, typically controlling between 100 and 10,000 BTC, traditionally signal market direction through their accumulation or distribution patterns. However, recent data interpretations suggesting substantial whale accumulation may stem from fundamental misunderstandings of blockchain data structures. According to Moreno’s analysis, most circulating transaction data fails to properly filter exchange holdings from genuine whale activity. The cryptocurrency market has increasingly relied on on-chain analytics for investment decisions. Platforms tracking whale movements have gained significant traction among both retail and institutional investors. Nevertheless, the complexity of blockchain data interpretation presents substantial challenges. Exchange wallet reorganizations, for instance, can create artificial spikes in apparent whale activity that inexperienced analysts might misinterpret as accumulation signals. The Mechanics of On-Chain Data Distortion Blockchain analysis requires sophisticated filtering to distinguish between different types of wallet activities. Major cryptocurrency exchanges typically manage thousands of wallets containing customer funds, institutional holdings, and operational reserves. When these entities reorganize their storage systems, the movement of substantial Bitcoin amounts between addresses can appear identical to whale accumulation patterns on basic analytical platforms. Moreno emphasizes that data excluding exchange addresses actually indicates decreasing BTC holdings among genuine whales. This trend extends to addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC, a category that increasingly includes exchange-traded fund (ETF) holdings. The distinction between ETF custodial wallets and traditional whale addresses further complicates accurate data interpretation. Expert Analysis from CryptoQuant’s Senior Analyst Julio Moreno brings substantial expertise to this analysis, with years of experience interpreting cryptocurrency market data. His previous accurate predictions about market cycles lend credibility to his current warnings about data misinterpretation. Moreno previously stated his belief that Bitcoin has already passed its cycle high and is heading toward a low, making his current analysis particularly relevant for investors assessing market direction. The implications of this data distortion extend beyond academic interest. Investment decisions based on misinterpreted whale accumulation signals could lead to substantial financial losses. Retail investors following apparent accumulation trends might enter positions at inopportune times, while institutional players could make allocation decisions based on flawed premises. Historical Context of Cryptocurrency Data Interpretation Blockchain data analysis has evolved significantly since Bitcoin’s inception. Early analysts worked with limited tools and basic metrics, while today’s sophisticated platforms offer hundreds of indicators. This evolution has created both opportunities and challenges for accurate market interpretation. The table below illustrates key differences between genuine whale activity and exchange-related movements: Characteristic Genuine Whale Accumulation Exchange Wallet Reorganization Transaction Pattern Consistent purchases from multiple sources Large transfers between known exchange addresses Address Behavior Long-term holding after acquisition Frequent movement between custodial wallets Timing Often correlates with market conditions Occurs during exchange infrastructure updates Data Source Reliability Requires exchange-filtered analysis Appears in unfiltered on-chain metrics Understanding these distinctions requires specialized knowledge of both blockchain technology and exchange operations. Analysts must consider multiple factors when interpreting apparent accumulation signals: Address clustering techniques to identify exchange-controlled wallets Historical behavior patterns of specific addresses Correlation with exchange announcements about wallet upgrades Verification through multiple data sources before drawing conclusions Market Impact and Investor Implications The potential misinterpretation of whale accumulation data carries significant consequences for cryptocurrency markets. Investment strategies based on flawed premises could amplify market volatility and create artificial price movements. Furthermore, the credibility of on-chain analytics as a decision-making tool faces challenges if basic metrics prove unreliable without expert interpretation. Institutional investors increasingly incorporate blockchain data into their analysis frameworks. Hedge funds, family offices, and asset managers have developed sophisticated models using whale movement indicators. The discovery of potential data distortions necessitates reevaluation of these models and their underlying assumptions. Retail investors face particular challenges in navigating this complexity. Without access to advanced analytical tools or expertise in blockchain data interpretation, they risk making decisions based on incomplete or misleading information. Educational resources about proper data interpretation become increasingly valuable in this environment. The Role of Analytical Platforms in Data Transparency CryptoQuant and similar platforms play crucial roles in improving data transparency. By developing more sophisticated filtering algorithms and educating users about interpretation challenges, these services enhance market efficiency. The ongoing development of better analytical tools represents a positive trend for cryptocurrency market maturation. Platform improvements might include: Enhanced exchange wallet identification algorithms Clear labeling of potentially distorted metrics Educational content about data interpretation limitations Multiple data visualization options showing filtered and unfiltered views Broader Trends in Cryptocurrency Market Analysis The challenge of accurate data interpretation extends beyond whale accumulation metrics. Multiple aspects of cryptocurrency analysis face similar complexities requiring expert navigation. Market participants must develop more sophisticated approaches to data evaluation as the ecosystem matures. Several trends are shaping cryptocurrency market analysis in 2025: Increased institutional participation bringing traditional financial analytical rigor Regulatory developments affecting data reporting requirements Technological advancements in blockchain analytics platforms Growing recognition of data interpretation as a specialized skill These developments collectively push the industry toward more reliable and sophisticated analytical practices. However, the transition period creates challenges for investors accustomed to simpler metrics and interpretations. Conclusion The apparent Bitcoin whale accumulation that has captured market attention may represent a significant data distortion rather than genuine institutional accumulation. Julio Moreno’s analysis highlights critical flaws in how exchange wallet activities can mimic whale behavior in unfiltered on-chain metrics. This discovery emphasizes the importance of sophisticated data interpretation in cryptocurrency markets, particularly as institutional participation increases. Investors must approach whale accumulation signals with appropriate skepticism and seek multiple verification sources before making decisions based on these metrics. The maturation of cryptocurrency markets requires parallel development in analytical sophistication, with this revelation about data distortion serving as an important milestone in that evolution. FAQs Q1: What exactly is meant by “Bitcoin whale accumulation data distortion”? This refers to the phenomenon where exchange wallet reorganizations and movements appear identical to genuine whale accumulation in basic on-chain analytics, creating misleading signals about large investor behavior. Q2: How can investors distinguish between real whale activity and exchange movements? Investors should rely on analytical platforms that filter exchange addresses, examine transaction patterns for consistency with accumulation behavior, and correlate movements with exchange infrastructure announcements rather than market conditions. Q3: Why does this data distortion matter for cryptocurrency investors? Misinterpreted whale signals could lead to poor investment timing and decisions based on flawed premises, potentially resulting in financial losses and increased market volatility. Q4: What does CryptoQuant’s analysis suggest about actual whale behavior? According to Julio Moreno’s filtered data analysis, genuine whale holdings (excluding exchange addresses) are actually decreasing, contradicting unfiltered metrics suggesting accumulation. Q5: How has cryptocurrency data analysis evolved to address these challenges? Analytical platforms have developed more sophisticated address clustering algorithms, better exchange wallet identification, and educational resources to help users properly interpret complex blockchain data.

According to verified data from Bitcoin World and CoinMarketCap, this development marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing evolution of digital asset hierarchies. The move represents more than just numerical trading; it signals changing investor sentiment and market dynamics within the blockchain ecosystem. This analysis provides comprehensive context about this market movement and its potential implications for the broader cryptocurrency landscape. XRP Market Cap Surge: Analyzing the Numbers Market data reveals compelling figures behind XRP’s recent ascent. CoinMarketCap reports show XRP’s market capitalization reaching approximately $123 billion, surpassing BNB’s roughly $121.3 billion valuation. Consequently, XRP now occupies the fourth position in overall cryptocurrency rankings. Excluding dollar-pegged stablecoins like Tether (USDT), the asset effectively ranks third among purely volatile digital currencies. XRP currently trades at $2.02, representing an impressive 8.08% increase during this repositioning period. These numbers demonstrate substantial momentum for the Ripple-associated digital asset. Several factors contribute to this market cap realignment. First, increased institutional interest has driven substantial trading volume. Second, regulatory clarity in certain jurisdictions has improved investor confidence. Third, technological developments within the XRP Ledger ecosystem have enhanced utility perceptions. Market analysts observe that trading patterns show consistent accumulation by both retail and institutional participants. The volume-to-market-cap ratio indicates healthy liquidity conditions supporting this price movement. Historical Context: The XRP-BNB Rivalry The competition between XRP and BNB represents one of cryptocurrency’s most watched rivalries. Historically, XRP frequently held the third position behind Bitcoin and Ethereum during earlier market cycles. However, BNB’s rapid ascent through 2021 and 2022 challenged this hierarchy significantly. Binance’s native token benefited tremendously from the exchange’s expanding ecosystem and innovative tokenomics. This created a dynamic where both assets vied for position based on fundamentally different value propositions. XRP derives its primary value from cross-border payment solutions and banking partnerships. Conversely, BNB’s utility centers around exchange fee discounts, decentralized applications, and the broader Binance Smart Chain ecosystem. Their competing approaches created an interesting market narrative about whether payments or ecosystem tokens would dominate the sub-top tier. This recent shift suggests renewed confidence in payment-focused blockchain solutions, particularly as global remittance markets continue digitizing rapidly. Expert Perspectives on Market Movements Financial analysts emphasize several technical and fundamental factors behind this development. Market structure analysis reveals that XRP’s momentum began building three weeks prior to the overtaking event. On-chain data shows decreasing exchange reserves, indicating reduced selling pressure. Additionally, the number of large wallet addresses (holding 1 million+ XRP) increased by 4.2% in the preceding month. These metrics suggest accumulation by sophisticated investors anticipating positive developments. Regulatory developments also play a crucial role in this equation. Recent court decisions in the United States have provided clearer guidelines for XRP’s classification. This regulatory clarity reduces uncertainty that previously suppressed institutional participation. Meanwhile, BNB faces its own regulatory considerations as global exchange oversight intensifies. These contrasting regulatory environments create different risk profiles that institutional investors must weigh carefully when allocating digital asset portfolios. Market Impact and Broader Implications This ranking shift carries implications beyond the two directly involved cryptocurrencies. First, it demonstrates that market leadership positions remain fluid despite increasing institutionalization. Second, it highlights how different value propositions attract capital at different market cycles. Third, it reinforces that technological developments and regulatory clarity significantly influence investor decisions. The broader altcoin market often takes directional cues from movements among top-tier assets like XRP and BNB. Several observable effects follow this market cap realignment. Trading volumes typically increase across correlated assets as portfolio rebalancing occurs. Additionally, media attention often brings new participants to both ecosystems. Furthermore, developer activity frequently receives boosted funding and attention following positive price momentum. Historical patterns suggest that sustained position changes often precede increased institutional research coverage and potential ETF considerations for the ascending asset. Technological Developments Driving Adoption The XRP Ledger has implemented several significant upgrades recently. These technological improvements enhance transaction efficiency and smart contract capabilities. Notably, the Hooks amendment introduced customizable logic to transactions, expanding use cases beyond simple payments. Additionally, increased decentralization of validator nodes has strengthened network security perceptions. These developments address previous criticisms while expanding the protocol’s potential applications in traditional finance and beyond. Simultaneously, BNB Chain continues evolving with substantial technical upgrades. The recent BEP-333 proposal aims to enhance staking mechanisms and governance processes. Both ecosystems demonstrate vigorous development activity, suggesting their competition will likely continue driving innovation. This technological arms race benefits the broader blockchain industry by pushing scalability, security, and usability boundaries forward. Users ultimately receive better products and services through this competitive dynamic. Investor Considerations and Risk Factors Investors evaluating this market shift should consider several important factors. First, cryptocurrency rankings historically show volatility, with positions changing frequently during bull markets. Second, different assets serve different portfolio functions—XRP as a payments corridor play versus BNB as an ecosystem participation token. Third, regulatory landscapes continue evolving unpredictably across jurisdictions. Fourth, technological risks remain present in both networks as they scale and add functionality. Key metrics for ongoing monitoring include: On-chain activity: Transaction counts and value transferred Development activity: GitHub commits and protocol upgrades Regulatory developments: Legal clarity and enforcement actions Institutional flows: ETF holdings and custody data Market structure: Exchange balances and derivative positioning These indicators provide early signals about whether position changes represent temporary fluctuations or sustained trends. Conclusion XRP’s overtaking of BNB to reclaim the fourth spot in market capitalization rankings represents a significant cryptocurrency market development. This movement reflects changing investor perceptions about payment-focused versus ecosystem-focused blockchain assets. The shift demonstrates how regulatory clarity and technological improvements can substantially impact market valuations. While cryptocurrency rankings remain dynamic, this development highlights the ongoing evolution of digital asset hierarchies. Market participants will watch closely to see whether XRP maintains this position and what implications this has for the broader altcoin market structure moving forward. FAQs Q1: What exactly does “market capitalization” mean for cryptocurrencies? Market capitalization represents the total value of all coins in circulation, calculated by multiplying current price by circulating supply. It provides a standardized metric for comparing the relative size of different cryptocurrencies, though it doesn’t reflect liquidity or actual money invested. Q2: Why does excluding stablecoins change XRP’s ranking? Stablecoins like USDT maintain 1:1 dollar pegs through reserves, making them fundamentally different from volatile assets. Many analysts consider rankings excluding stablecoins more meaningful for comparing speculative cryptocurrencies, as stablecoins primarily function as trading pairs rather than investment assets. Q3: How often do these top cryptocurrency rankings change? While Bitcoin and Ethereum have maintained the top two positions for years, positions 3-10 change more frequently. Significant ranking shifts typically occur during bull markets when investor sentiment favors different narratives, with average position tenure ranging from several months to a few years for major assets. Q4: What are the main use cases differentiating XRP and BNB? XRP primarily facilitates cross-border payments and currency exchanges for financial institutions. BNB serves as the native token for the Binance ecosystem, providing trading fee discounts, powering decentralized applications, and enabling governance participation on BNB Chain. Q5: Could this ranking change reverse quickly? Yes, cryptocurrency markets exhibit high volatility, and ranking positions can change rapidly based on news, technological developments, or market sentiment. Sustained position changes typically require fundamental improvements in adoption, technology, or regulatory standing rather than just price movements.

They typically begin when change of structure transpires beneath the surface. Supply tightens. Usage plans become clear. The first movers get ahead of the general market. The move has already been made in large part by the time it makes headlines. One DeFi crypto is entering the setup stage. It is still in the early stages but the pieces are beginning to fall into place. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Progress and Core Vision Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new crypto and it has been growing since early 2025. The presale opened at $0.01 and has been going through planned steps. The token price went to $0.04, with the beginning of Phase 7. This move is a 300% growth compared to the first stage. Mutuum Finance has raised over $19.5 million. The holder count has grown to 18,650. These numbers depict multi- sensitivity as opposed to central ownership. Out of the entire 4 billion tokens, 45.5% has been set aside to the presale. More than 820 million tokens have been sold already. Mutuum Finance is a DeFi being developed to be a lending platform in the crypto sector. The protocol will accommodate two lending markets. This enables users to give assets to earn money when another one takes loans on definite conditions. This is aimed to establish predictable lending behavior rather than speculative behavior. How mtTokens Drive Value and V1 Launch The launch of V1 will be a significant achievement of Mutuum Finance. As per official words, V1 will enable the main functions of the protocol on lending. At this point, MUTM is no longer in development but it is entering into live operation phase. An important part of such a system is mtTokens. Such tokens mark the involvement of the users in the lending pools. Users who provide assets are given a token of their share in the pool called the mtTokens. These mtTokens increase in value as the demand to borrow increases due to the activity of protocols. This is a model that analysts tend to consider as the basis of an enduring increase in prices. As the usage grows so does the token demand. According to the latest participation tendencies and the imminent V1 release, a few analysts provide a list of situations that refer to 750% upside over the next two years, assuming growth in adoption will be as anticipated. Security and Participation Signal The issue of security has been considered as a fundamental requirement. Halborn Security has reviewed Mutuum Finance . The CertiK token scan scored 90 out of 100. To the same end, there is also a bug bounty program that has been introduced with a value of $50,000.00 to motivate continued code testing. These will minimize protocol risk and raise confidence of the participants. This layer would be important to a DeFi that is based on lending. The participation cues are important, as well. Mutuum Finance has a 24 hour leaderboard that uses activity to reward participation. This system is not based on a one time contribution. Entry is also increased by card payment access. This has aided in the growth of the base of holders and diversified participation with crypto native users. The Reason This Arrangement is Under Observation When wondering what crypto to purchase at present or what crypto to invest in and grow in the long run, installations such as this one tend to become prominent before the multitude. Mutuum Finance is a combination of presale momentum, following utility, formal token economics, and sound security practices. The presale is advancing. Phase 7 came with an almost 20% price increment. Supply is tightening. V1 is approaching. Plans about infrastructure are well stipulated. When analysts are simulating possible scenarios they tend to seek consistent timing, structure and participation. In MUTM those aspects are beginning to overlap. Near mid 2026, Mutuum Finance is emerging not as the hype as a new crypto, but as a DeFi crypto that has its execution. That is the arrangement that is being followed by many market watchers.

56750051,651892,1767402007,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56750051.jpeg,Ethereum Shows Early Accumulation Signals As Binance Buy Pressure Intensifies,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-shows-accumulation-signals-buy-pressure/,"Ethereum has managed to push above the psychologically important $3,000 level, offering a brief sense of relief after weeks of compression and indecision. While this move marks a constructive short-term development, price action remains far from the technical thresholds required to fully reestablish a broader uptrend. Against this backdrop, on-chain and derivatives data are beginning to show subtle but notable changes. A CryptoQuant analysis reveals that Ethereum’s 14-day moving average of the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio on Binance has climbed to 1.005, its highest reading since July. A ratio above 1 indicates that aggressive market buy orders are outweighing sell orders, pointing to growing bullish intent among derivatives traders. The report explains that ETH remains significantly below its prior cycle highs, meaning this increase in aggressive buying is not a reaction to strong upside momentum. Instead, it suggests early positioning or accumulation behavior, where market participants are entering ahead of a potential directional move rather than chasing price. Still, derivatives-driven optimism alone is not sufficient to confirm a trend reversal. For Ethereum to transition from recovery to sustained upside, this improving aggression must be accompanied by stronger spot demand and a decisive reclaim of higher resistance levels. Derivatives Aggression Builds, but Confirmation Remains Critical The analysis adds that, historically, sustained periods in which Ethereum’s Taker Buy/Sell Ratio remains above 1—particularly when reinforced by a rising moving average—have often aligned with phases of increasing bullish volatility or early attempts at trend reversals. This behavior reflects a growing sense of urgency among buyers who are willing to execute at market prices rather than wait for pullbacks, a dynamic typically associated with improving sentiment and shifting expectations. However, this signal carries important caveats. The Taker Buy/Sell Ratio is primarily a derivatives-focused metric, and elevated buy pressure in leveraged markets does not automatically translate into a durable rally. Without confirmation from the spot market—such as rising spot volumes, net exchange outflows, or sustained on-chain accumulation—price reactions driven by derivatives activity can fade quickly. In past instances, leverage-heavy positioning has produced brief upside moves that were later unwound when real capital inflows failed to materialize. At present, the structure suggests that aggressive buying pressure is indeed building within Ethereum’s derivatives market. This increases the probability of a recovery attempt, particularly if traders continue to position proactively rather than reactively. Still, confirmation will depend on price follow-through above key resistance levels and alignment with broader indicators across spot demand, on-chain activity, and overall market liquidity. Ethereum Price Faces Key Test Ethereum has pushed back above the $3,000 level, offering a short-term relief bounce after weeks of compression and lower highs. However, the broader structure remains fragile. On the daily chart, ETH is still trading below its declining 100-day and 200-day moving averages, which continue to act as dynamic resistance and define the prevailing bearish-to-neutral trend. The recent move appears more corrective than impulsive. Price action shows shallow follow-through, with limited volume expansion, suggesting that buyers are cautious rather than aggressive. While reclaiming $3,000 is symbolically important, Ethereum has repeatedly failed to build acceptance above this zone since November, reinforcing it as a pivot rather than a confirmed support. From a structural perspective, ETH remains trapped in a broad range between roughly $2,800 and $3,400. The lower boundary has attracted dip buyers, but rallies continue to stall before reaching prior breakdown levels. This pattern reflects a market in balance, where neither bulls nor bears have sufficient conviction to force a trend. Momentum indicators implied by price behavior point to stabilization, not trend reversal. For Ethereum to shift back toward a sustained uptrend, it would need to reclaim the $3,300–$3,500 region and hold above the longer-term moving averages with expanding volume.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-lets-focus-on-10-xrp-heres-why/,"An ongoing debate within the XRP community resurfaced after a well-known market commentator dismissed the idea that XRP could reach triple-digit prices this year. XRP closed the year in negative territory, challenging earlier optimistic expectations held by many investors. The asset approached a yearly decline of roughly 10%, marking its first full-year loss since 2022. This outcome contrasts sharply with its performance during the first half of the year, when momentum suggested potential continuation of the previous uptrend. Community Reactions to Price Forecasts Among various price discussions throughout the year, predictions of XRP rising above $100 gained notable attention. However, several analysts expressed doubt at the time, and these projections are now facing renewed scrutiny. Recently, content creator and community figure Mason Versluis commented on the matter, stating that forecasting XRP to reach triple digits by the end of 2025 was, in his view, an unreasonable expectation. He described it as one of the most exaggerated predictions he had encountered. Triple digit $XRP by end of 2025 is THE MOST stupid thing I've ever heard in my entire life. We have like 48 hours left in the year. Even if I heard this at the start of 2025, I would've said the same thing. Everyone who said this will be WRONG once again. Let's focus on $10… — MASON VERSLUIS (@MasonVersluis) December 30, 2025 Versluis noted that even if he had heard this forecast earlier in the year, when market sentiment was more optimistic, he would have assessed it the same way. He acknowledged that XRP experienced a strong start to the year after surpassing the $3 threshold for the first time in eight years, but argued that expecting it to multiply in value dozens of times within a single year lacked a realistic basis. According to him, community members should prioritize gradual and achievable milestones. He suggested that a move toward $10, while requiring substantial appreciation, is a more practical price objective in the short to medium term. Achieving $10 would still require XRP to rise by several hundred percent, but he believes such an increase could occur under favorable market conditions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 How the Triple-Digit Narrative Emerged Earlier in the year, XRP began trading at around $2.07 and quickly climbed to a peak near $3.40 in January. The rapid ascent boosted confidence among holders and contributed to the spread of bullish projections. The upward movement, combined with improving regulatory progress for Ripple, encouraged some analysts to issue highly ambitious price targets. Among those who supported the idea of XRP reaching $100 was Digital Ascension Group CEO Jake Claver, who remained confident in the possibility even after receiving pushback from other commentators. In light of differing views, fellow analyst Levi Rietveld publicly challenged Claver on the projection. Although no formal agreement was reached, the discussion drew significant attention from the community and continued as the year progressed. Despite only days remaining in the year, Claver maintained that he expected a dramatic price movement, asserting that he still believed strongly in his forecast. The disagreement surrounding triple-digit projections highlights the divide between speculative enthusiasm and measured analysis within the crypto community. While long-term supporters remain confident in XRP’s potential growth, others emphasize the importance of setting realistic expectations and pursuing achievable milestones.

Versluis reminded the community that XRP began January 2025 at $2.08 and moved to $3.40 by the end of that month. The token then reached a yearly high of $3.66 in July before sliding back to close 2025 at $1.84, which represented an 11.5% YTD decline. “We just look at the fundamentals,” he said, adding that those who loudly predict extreme prices often end up wrong.

This change, according to the chairman, may be essential for future stock splits, as Ether’s price has a significant impact on the company’s value. Lee noted that BitMine’s share price is keeping up with Ether’s price . To effectively forecast future values, the executive carefully observed the ETH/Bitcoin ratio. Based on his argument, if, by any chance, BTC achieves a peak of $1 million, ETH would secure an all-time high of $250,000. At this point, Lee asserted that this rise would significantly increase the price of BitMine’s shares to highs he anticipated would be unreachable for many retail investors. Lee demonstrates a strong commitment to increasing the total number of BitMine’s shares In 2025, BitMine started as a Bitcoin mining and holding firm . Later, after careful consideration, the company shifted its focus to embracing an ETH treasury strategy. However, sources pointed out that BitMine continues to conduct some Bitcoin operations. Regarding his prediction, Lee declared that if ETH attained a peak of $250,000, BitMine shares could encounter an implied cost of approximately $5,000 each. Reports stated that this price is costly for several regular investors. To support this claim, the chairman mentioned that not everyone desires stocks to be priced at $500, $1,500, or $5,000; instead, a large group of individuals wants shares to be priced around $25. Meanwhile, apart from this finding, Lee also acknowledged that if ETH reaches an all-time high of $250,000, BitMine would be required to carry out a 100:1 stock split to maintain the share price at $25. With the move in place, the firm’s shares are expected to increase the total number to 43 billion. In a statement, Lee mentioned, “Right now, there are 426 million shares available. We aim to increase the authorized share count to 50 billion. However, that doesn’t mean we will actually create 50 billion shares; that’s just the highest number we want.” Reports highlighted that Lee is referring to the unit bias issue. Unit bias, in the basis of finance, is the psychological tendency for investors to prefer owning whole units of an asset (like a whole Bitcoin or share) over fractions, or to equate a low price per unit with better value, even when the total investment value is the same or a fractional amount of a pricier asset is a better investment. Lee’s idea faces criticism Regarding Lee’s proposal to increase the total number of BitMine’s shares, reports pointed out that several users shared negative responses to this suggestion on X. Some argued that it is unwise to raise the limit of authorized shares because this act would dilute the stock. This discussion made headlines, sparking controversy among individuals in the crypto ecosystem. One user remarked, “Tom, this seems shady and silly to raise the share count just because the stock could hit $500. You should wait until next year when it’s not in such bad shape.” Nonetheless, despite these concerns, recent reports highlighted that BitMine purchased approximately 32,938 ETH on Tuesday of this week for more than $102 million, based on current prices. Notably, as of December 2025, BitMine’s treasury had expanded to more than 4 million ETH, valued at over $12 billion. The firm also began staking ETH to generate income.

This investor began converting a massive $44.3 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) into Bitcoin (BTC) today, marking the end of a four-year holding period for the ETH assets. The transaction, first reported by blockchain analytics, represents one of the most notable single-asset shifts of 2025 and provides a compelling case study in long-term crypto investment strategy. Crypto Whale Executes $44.3 Million ETH to BTC Conversion According to data from AmberCN and corroborated by on-chain analysis, the whale address commenced the swap approximately five hours before reports surfaced. The entity exchanged 14,145 Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) for 492 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). Consequently, this transaction executed at a precise swap ratio of 1 WETH to 0.03478 WBTC. Therefore, the average purchase price for the WBTC settled at $90,014 per coin. This decisive action follows a period of accumulation that began in early 2022. Initially, the wallet accumulated a total of 22,344 ETH through major exchanges like Kraken, Bitfinex, and Poloniex. The average acquisition price for this Ethereum stash was $2,916 per ETH. The current move to convert a large portion into Bitcoin suggests a strategic reassessment of asset allocation. Market analysts are now scrutinizing the timing and potential motivations behind this substantial shift. Analyzing the Four-Year Holding Period and Market Context The whale’s four-year holding period is a critical piece of context. The accumulation phase in early 2022 occurred just after Ethereum’s all-time high in late 2021, during a broader market cooldown. Holding through the subsequent market cycles, including the bear market of 2022-2023 and the recovery phases, demonstrates a high-conviction, long-term approach. Now, the decision to rotate into Bitcoin may signal a change in that conviction or a tactical adjustment based on macroeconomic or protocol-specific factors. For instance, the broader cryptocurrency landscape in 2025 includes several evolving narratives. These include Bitcoin’s maturation as a institutional reserve asset, Ethereum’s ongoing upgrades to its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, and the regulatory clarity emerging in key jurisdictions. A whale of this size likely considers all these elements. Their move could be interpreted as a vote for Bitcoin’s relative stability or ‘digital gold’ narrative over Ethereum’s ‘world computer’ utility thesis, at least for a portion of their portfolio. Expert Perspective on Large Holder Behavior Historically, movements from large holders often precede or coincide with broader market trends. While a single transaction does not dictate market direction, it provides a valuable data point for sentiment analysis. Seasoned analysts note that whales typically move assets for several key reasons: portfolio rebalancing, risk management, capital deployment for other investments, or anticipation of specific market movements. The transparent nature of blockchain allows the market to observe these signals in real-time, adding a layer of strategic depth to crypto asset trading. The table below summarizes the key transaction details: Asset Sold Amount USD Value Holding Period Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) 14,145 $44.3 Million ~4 Years Asset Bought Amount USD Value Average Price Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) 492 $44.3 Million $90,014 per BTC Furthermore, using wrapped tokens (WETH, WBTC) indicates the swap likely occurred on a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol or a decentralized exchange (DEX). This method offers privacy and direct asset control compared to centralized exchange transfers. The choice of instrument itself is a minor but insightful detail about the whale’s operational preferences. Potential Impacts and Market Implications The immediate market impact of a $44.3 million swap is often absorbed by liquid markets for BTC and ETH. However, the psychological impact can be more significant. Such a move can influence retail and institutional sentiment, potentially leading to increased discussion about the BTC/ETH ratio—a key metric watched by crypto traders. A shift of this scale from a long-term holder may prompt other investors to reevaluate their own allocations between the two leading cryptocurrencies. Key considerations for the market include: Sentiment Signal: Does this indicate a loss of confidence in Ethereum’s short-term prospects or a gain in confidence for Bitcoin? Technical Pressure: While $44.3M is a large sum, both ETH and BTC markets handle daily volumes in the billions. Direct price pressure may be minimal but observable. Follow-on Activity: Market participants will monitor if this whale completes the conversion of its remaining ETH holdings or if other large holders mimic the strategy. Ultimately, this event underscores the dynamic and transparent nature of cryptocurrency markets. Major player movements are public, providing a continuous stream of actionable intelligence for all market participants. It also highlights the evolving strategies within digital asset portfolio management as the asset class matures. Conclusion The $44.3 million crypto whale transaction from Ethereum to Bitcoin is a noteworthy event in the 2025 digital asset landscape. It exemplifies strategic portfolio management by large-scale investors after a multi-year holding period. While the anonymous whale’s specific motivations remain private, the move provides tangible data for analyzing market sentiment between the two premier cryptocurrencies. This action reinforces the importance of on-chain analytics and serves as a reminder that even in a decentralized ecosystem, the behavior of major holders offers crucial insights into market dynamics and evolving investment theses. FAQs Q1: What is a ‘crypto whale’? A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a sufficiently large amount of a cryptocurrency that their trades have the potential to influence the market price due to the size of their transactions. Q2: Why use WETH and WBTC instead of native ETH and BTC? Wrapped tokens (WETH, WBTC) are ERC-20 token representations of native assets on the Ethereum blockchain. They are commonly used in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to facilitate seamless trading and lending without leaving the Ethereum ecosystem. Q3: Does this large sale mean the whale is bearish on Ethereum? Not necessarily. Portfolio rebalancing is a common practice. The whale may still hold a significant amount of ETH (over 8,000 ETH based on reported accumulation) and might be taking profits, managing risk, or increasing exposure to Bitcoin for strategic diversification rather than expressing a purely bearish outlook on Ethereum. Q4: How can such a large trade be executed without drastically moving the price? The trade was likely executed using a decentralized exchange aggregator or a liquidity protocol that splits the order across multiple pools to achieve the best average price (a method known as ‘batch swapping’ or using ‘smart order routing’). Both BTC and ETH also have deep liquidity, allowing large orders to be filled with minimal slippage. Q5: Where can I track whale movements like this one? Several blockchain analytics platforms and services specialize in tracking large transactions and whale wallet activity. These platforms monitor blockchain data in real-time, flagging significant transfers, accumulations, and distributions from known large holders.

This of course follows a stretch of repeated surges throughout 2025, with XRP doing the same thing in January 2025 after hitting $2.83 and seeing its market value smash $163 billion. July brought another market-wide rally that carried the Ripple-backed token to a new all-time high of $3.55, briefly moving it ahead of Tether’s USDT, the crypto with #3 at that time. In October 2025, XRP again passed BNB while it was trading near $2.63 before slipping back down to end the year. Markets trade higher as crypto sentiment stays tense At press time, XRP was priced around $2.40 on Coinbase while Bitcoin continues to struggle to hold above $90,000, as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index drops to 24 to start the year, meaning “extreme fear.” According to an X post from Santiment, bearish crypto comments running 20% to 30% above November levels.

The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.03% to 23,235.63. In the first session of the year, the Nasdaq later rose 0.6%, led by chipmakers including Nvidia, Broadcom, Micron, and Intel, each gaining between 3% and 6%. Silver advanced 3%, while gold and copper posted smaller gains. Past sentiment extremes have appeared before rallies in XRP that exceeded 1,000%. Data cited by CoinGecko shows machine-learning models reaching 70% to 91% accuracy in predicting crypto price direction when sentiment reaches clear extremes.

The annual decline was modest—around 6%—and negligible compared to historical drawdowns seen in prior bearish years. Yet despite its limited magnitude, the red close carries symbolic weight, suggesting a shift in market behavior rather than outright weakness. Related Reading: Ethereum Liquidity Rebuilds On Binance: December Inflows Signal Strategic Repositioning Recent on-chain analysis from Axel Adler adds important context to this change. Data tracking cumulative Net Taker Flow shows that aggressive buying peaked around the New Year before fading. Since then, the balance of market aggression has tilted toward sellers, though not in an extreme way. The indicator currently sits in a moderate negative range, signaling that sell-side pressure has increased but remains far from capitulation levels. Historically, similar conditions have tended to coincide with heightened downside sensitivity rather than immediate trend reversals. In practical terms, this suggests that Bitcoin is vulnerable to further weakness if demand fails to recover, but it is not yet displaying the stress typically associated with deeper bear phases. The key takeaway is nuance. Bitcoin is not collapsing, but it is no longer behaving like an asset in a clean, momentum-driven expansion. The shift toward moderate sell pressure, combined with a rare red yearly close, points to a market transitioning into a more complex and selective phase rather than following its familiar cycle script. Derivatives Momentum Turns Cautious as Sell-Side Pressure Aligns Adler’s analysis highlights a growing shift in short-term market behavior through the Bitcoin Net Taker Flow momentum metric, which tracks how aggressively traders are positioning on the long or short side. Unlike cumulative flow, this indicator is designed to react quickly to sentiment changes, offering an early read on shifts in trader behavior rather than longer-term positioning. In recent sessions, this momentum gauge has rolled over decisively. After holding positive territory in late December, the smoothed reading has slipped into negative levels, now hovering around -0.3. While this does not yet reflect extreme stress, it places the market firmly in a moderate bearish pressure regime. The timing is notable: the momentum downturn occurred alongside a deterioration in cumulative Net Taker Flow, reinforcing the signal rather than contradicting it. This alignment matters. When both cumulative pressure and short-term momentum weaken together, it reduces the likelihood that the move is driven by noise or isolated positioning. Instead, it points to a broader shift in trader aggression toward the sell side. Adler notes that deeper downside risk would emerge if momentum continues to weaken, particularly if readings push beyond the -0.4 threshold. Conditions suggest controlled but persistent selling pressure. Bitcoin is not yet in capitulation territory, but the synchronized signals indicate that bearish forces currently have the upper hand, increasing sensitivity to any loss of price support.

Reflecting a market caught between stabilization and lingering downside risk. Price remains below the short-term and medium-term moving averages, signaling that bullish momentum has not yet been reclaimed. The 50-period moving average has turned into dynamic resistance, while the 100-period average is flattening, reinforcing the idea of a broader compression phase rather than an immediate trend reversal. Importantly, Bitcoin is still holding well above the 200-period moving average, which continues to slope upward. This suggests that, from a higher-timeframe perspective, the broader structure has not fully broken down. However, the loss of the $100,000–$105,000 region earlier marked a clear regime shift from expansion to distribution. Increasing sensitivity to sell-side pressure. Volume has notably declined during the recent sideways movement, indicating a lack of conviction from both buyers and sellers. This supports the view that the market is digesting prior excesses rather than aggressively repricing lower. Still, repeated failures to push back above the $92,000–$95,000 range highlight weak demand at higher levels. As Bitcoin holds the $85,000–$88,000 support band, consolidation remains the dominant scenario. A breakdown below this area would likely open the door to deeper retracements.

He suggested that investors who maintain their positions over an extended period could eventually find it difficult to determine the exact value of their holdings due to substantial growth. His statement reflects optimism among supporters regarding the token’s future utility and its role in global financial infrastructure. Investor Expectations for Wealth Accumulation Many in the XRP community anticipate that the token’s value will appreciate over time. Factors driving this outlook include institutional adoption, ongoing ETF activity, and integration into real-world payment systems. Supporters argue that even relatively modest holdings could translate into significant wealth over the next decade or more. If you hold $XRP , there will come a time when you don't know how much money you have exactly. — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) December 30, 2025 Bark, the founder of an XRP-focused NFT project, for example, has stated that XRP could eventually provide retirement-level financial security for dedicated long-term holders. Debates continue over how many tokens an investor should hold to meaningfully benefit from potential appreciation. Analysts generally agree that positions ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 XRP offer substantial long-term exposure, with proponents like Edoardo Farina suggesting that 1,000 tokens represents a minimum for investors serious about maximizing future financial outcomes. Current Investment Scale At present, XRP trades near $1.85. This means that 1,000 XRP costs approximately $1,850, 5,000 XRP about $9,250, and 10,000 tokens roughly $18,500. Within the community, these positions are often viewed as capable of achieving six-figure or even seven-figure valuations if XRP reaches projected long-term targets. Forecasts for XRP vary. Telegaon anticipates a price range between $80 and $120 by 2035–2040, implying that 1,000 XRP could be worth $100,000 and 10,000 XRP could reach $1 million. More aggressive estimates, such as those from Changelly, suggest potential values of $150 to $200 per XRP in the same period, placing a 10,000 holdings at $2 million. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Some analysts, including Jake Claver, have proposed scenarios in which the asset reaches four-digit levels if it becomes a core component of global financial infrastructure, though these projections would require unprecedented market growth. Optimism around XRP has been bolstered by institutional interest. Recent spot ETF launches from firms including Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, Bitwise, and Canary Capital reportedly absorbed $1.25 billion worth of XRP in a short timeframe. Analysts note that ongoing ETF inflows, coupled with corporate adoption for treasury management and cross-border transactions, could place upward pressure on XRP’s supply-demand dynamics, supporting potential long-term appreciation. Squire’s remarks are not intended as a specific price forecast. Instead, they illustrate how sustained investment in XRP could materially alter an investor’s financial position over time. While the likelihood of reaching extreme valuations is uncertain, many community members believe the current market price does not fully reflect the token’s utility and potential for broader adoption. Ultimately, the takeaway for long-term XRP holders is strategic patience. Investors maintaining positions may witness significant financial growth, even if precise valuations remain difficult to track as the market evolves.

The negative rally traces back to pandemic-era spending that flooded the economy with federal cash as officials tried to keep businesses open, workers paid, and markets steady during the crisis. Huge figures no longer shock the system. Prices across the economy are higher, and long strings of zeroes now show up everywhere from grocery bills to government ledgers. In 2026, another line item joins that list. Annual interest payments on the national debt are reaching the trillion-dollar range, locking in a costly reality for the federal budget. Uncle Sam’s interest cost is surging crazily as borrowing piles up In 2020, as COVID spread, the US federal government paid $345 billion in interest. Six years later, that cost has nearly tripled. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has described this pace as the new norm. At this point, the United States owes lenders about $38.4 trillion, and servicing that balance now consumes a massive share of federal revenue. Elected officials across parties keep talking about shrinking the debt, and 2025 followed that familiar script. President Donald Trump, now back in the White House, signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” last summer. The package combined tax cuts with new spending and carried a $3.4 trillion cost spread across ten years, reinforcing Washington’s appetite for constant borrowing. Trump has laid out several ideas to deal with the growing tab. He has said tariffs could help pay it down and that proceeds from his golden visa program could offset some borrowing. He has also argued that faster economic growth would ease pressure by improving the debt-to-GDP ratio and that the Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, would trim spending and reduce future borrowing needs. Not everyone sees those steps as enough. Economists do not expect any administration to reverse the debt quickly, but many expected tougher action. Kush Desai, the White House deputy press secretary, pushed back. “America’s debt-to-GDP ratio has actually declined since President Trump took office, and as the administration’s pro-growth policies of tax cuts, rapid deregulation, more efficient government spending, and fair trade deals continue taking effect and America’s economic resurgence accelerates, that ratio will continue trending in the right direction,” Kush said. He added, “That’s on top of the record revenue that President Trump’s tariff policies are bringing in for the federal government.” Tariffs and DOGE deliver cash but barely dent totals Warnings from major figures have grown louder in recent years. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase chief executive, has called the situation the “most predictable crisis” in history. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, has said it could lead to an “economic heart attack.” Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, has said the issue demands an “adult conversation.” The White House points to results so far.DOGE’s public tracker says it has cut $202 billion from government costs. That equals $1,254.66 per taxpayer. Even so, the math remains brutal. Debt per person now sits just over $108,000, showing how small those savings look next to the total. Tariffs have also brought in money. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget reported that tariff revenue jumped from about $7 billion last year to roughly $25 billion by late July. The inflow is rising, though opinions differ on whether consumers or foreign exporters carry the burden. Per Cryptopolitan’s calculations, $25 billion equals less than 0.07% of the national debt. If every dollar of current tariff revenue went straight toward paying it down, it would still take nearly 120 years to clear the balance. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Savvy investors who spotted early movers often reaped massive rewards, while those who hesitated watched fortunes slip away. Today, traders are hunting the best altcoins to invest in, searching for the next big surge before the crowd catches on. Ripple (XRP) serves as a powerful reminder: timing is everything. Some early investors transformed tiny stakes into life-changing gains, leaving latecomers regretting they didn’t act sooner. But history has a way of repeating itself, and a new contender is capturing attention. APEMARS ($APRZ) is a bold, story-driven project that blends speed, community, and high-stakes momentum. It’s generating buzz for investors who want to catch the next wave of explosive growth. Its whitelist access is designed to provide controlled early participation within a fast-moving presale framework. For those ready to act fast, the crypto cosmos is opening another door, and only the decisive will step through. Ripple (XRP): The Missed ICO That Still Haunts Many Ripple (XRP) remains a cautionary tale for crypto enthusiasts. Its historic price journey started at $0.002802, and early investors who held on witnessed an all-time high of $3.84 gains that many only dreamed about. XRP’s story proves that early adoption matters, and hesitation can be costly. According to the best crypto to buy now site, XRP ranks sixth in market performance, highlighting its ongoing relevance and potential for investors seeking stable, high-potential cryptocurrency opportunities. XRP trading around $1.83–$1.94 is giving off a strong missed-ICO vibe, where calm price action masks a high-stakes accumulation phase that seasoned investors recognize as a rare second-chance entry. Levels like these often don’t linger for long, and once momentum kicks back in, late buyers are usually left chasing higher prices in regret. Despite the past gains, XRP remains relevant. FOMO is real, and those who hesitated on XRP’s early journey now know: missing opportunities in crypto can mean missing life-changing gains. XRP’s trajectory offers a blueprint.

56752434,651993,1767407413,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56752434.jpeg,Peter Schiff Says The Bitcoin ‘Good News’ Era Is Over In 2026,https://bitcoinist.com/peter-schiff-bitcoin-good-news-era-over-2026/,"Peter Schiff is starting 2026 with a blunt message for Bitcoin holders: in his view, the trade is crowded, the “good news” is exhausted, and the unwind is already visible in the vehicles built to maximize BTC exposure. Schiff’s Bitcoin Prediction For 2026 In a Jan. 1 “Year-End Special” episode outlining his 2026 market forecasts, the renowned Bitcoin-critic argued that the cryptocurrency spent 2025 doing the one thing it wasn’t supposed to do in a year packed with pro-crypto narratives: fall. He framed that underperformance as the tell for what comes next. Schiff contrasted BTC’s year against both risk assets and his preferred macro hedges. Stocks finished 2025 higher, he cited the Dow up 13%, the S&P 500 up 16.4%, and the Nasdaq up 20.4%, while gold rose 64% and silver more than doubled. Bitcoin, he said, was the outlier on the wrong side. “Everybody on CNBC was pounding the table on when the year began was Bitcoin,” Schiff said, describing a narrative mix that included “a Bitcoin president,” “a Bitcoin strategic reserve,” heavy corporate buying, and the growth of ETFs. “Bitcoin was one of the only things that was down on the year.” He pointed to ETF performance to ground that claim, saying he checked where Bitcoin ETFs “closed because they’re done for the year,” and that they were “down just over 7.5% on the year,” even as the Nasdaq and gold posted large gains. Then he delivered the core of his setup: “If something doesn’t go up when everybody thinks it’s going to go up, that’s a pretty good indication that it’s going to go down,” he said. “If a market can’t go up on good news, that means all that good news is already priced into the market […] and that means all that it can do is go down.” Strategy As The “Poster Boy” Stress Test Schiff also used Strategy, the market’s most visible leveraged Bitcoin proxy, as his preferred diagnostic for sentiment and structural demand. He said Strategy finished 2025 at a new 52-week low and was “down 47.5% on the year” and “67% below its peak 52-week high,” calling it “the poster boy” for maximum BTC leverage. Schiff’s argument was not that Strategy failed to buy BTC but that the equity market was already pricing the downsides of the model. Schiff went further, claiming Strategy’s five-year average BTC cost basis sits around $75,000, implying only a modest gain with Bitcoin near $87,000. “That’s about a 16% gain, 3% a year over 5 years,” he said, arguing it undercut the pitch that the trade is a one-way compounding machine. He also claimed Strategy could not realistically exit at its average price without slippage, framing the “profit” as fragile in a liquidation scenario. From there, Schiff extended the thesis into 2026 market structure: if Strategy slows or stops buying, and if ETF flows flip decisively negative, marginal demand may not be there when it’s needed. “The ETFs are selling now,” he said. “They’ve gone from big Bitcoin buyers to consistent Bitcoin sellers.” While Schiff refrained from naming a BTC price target for 2026 in the video, the gold bug set a downside “minimum target” of about $50,000 mid-December 2025. He argued that Strategy could not fall as much as he expected without Bitcoin also taking a major leg lower. Year-End Special: My 2026 Economic and Market Forecasts https://t.co/pqy8bWJBjP — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) January 1, 2026 The Macro Backdrop Schiff’s broader 2026 macro call was a mix of weaker growth, stickier inflation, and intensifying political pressure on monetary policy, conditions he expects to support precious metals and pressure Bitcoin. He argued the Fed is already effectively back in easing mode: “it just went back to quantitative easing, even though it hasn’t officially acknowledged that that’s what it’s doing” and expects further rate cuts alongside a weakening dollar. He also tied tariffs to higher consumer prices and margin pressure, forecasting a 2026 environment where “the economy is going to be weak” while “inflation is going to be strong,” a combination he called “toxic.” Schiff’s practical conclusion for crypto listeners was direct: he urged viewers to “get rid of your Bitcoin above $87,000,” while reiterating that he expects capital to rotate toward gold and silver as “the bloom comes off that crypto […] tulip.” At press time, BTC traded at $89,517.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|Peter Schiff,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-03 02:30:13
56752733,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258089,1767408011,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto Fear & Greed Index Soars to 29 as Hopeful Investor Sentiment Eases Market Caution,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fear-greed-index-climbs-29/,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index Soars to 29 as Hopeful Investor Sentiment Eases Market Caution Global cryptocurrency markets witnessed a notable shift in psychological terrain this week as the widely monitored Crypto Fear & Greed Index climbed to a reading of 29, marking a continued ascent from the depths of extreme fear and offering a tangible signal of easing investor caution. This incremental yet significant one-point rise, reported by data provider Alternative on April 10, 2025, follows the index’s crucial migration from the ‘Extreme Fear’ category into the ‘Fear’ category just a day prior, potentially foreshadowing a change in market dynamics. Consequently, analysts and traders are scrutinizing this movement for clues about future price action and capital flows. Crypto Fear & Greed Index Climbs: Decoding the 29 Reading The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial barometer for the collective emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Operating on a scale from 0 to 100, it quantifies sentiment where 0 represents ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 signifies ‘Extreme Greed.’ A reading of 29, therefore, firmly places the market in the ‘Fear’ zone, but notably on an upward trajectory away from the extreme pessimism that often characterizes market bottoms. This index does not rely on a single metric; instead, it synthesizes data from six distinct sources to provide a holistic view. Specifically, its calculation incorporates: Market Volatility (25%): Current price swings compared to historical averages. Market Volume (25%): Trading activity and momentum on major exchanges. Social Media (15%): The volume and sentiment of crypto mentions on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Polling data from various community platforms. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Google Trends (10%): Search volume for cryptocurrency-related terms. The recent climb to 29 suggests positive momentum across several of these components, particularly in trading volume and social media sentiment, which have historically led shifts in the broader index. Historical Context and Market Sentiment Analysis Understanding the importance of the move to 29 requires examining historical patterns. For instance, prolonged periods in ‘Extreme Fear’ (typically below 25) have frequently coincided with accumulation phases, where long-term investors enter the market. The index’s escape from this territory often precedes periods of consolidation or gradual recovery. By contrast, a sustained move above 50 into ‘Greed’ or ‘Extreme Greed’ has historically correlated with market peaks and increased risk. The current reading, therefore, represents a transitional phase. Market analysts from firms like Glassnode and CoinMetrics often cross-reference this sentiment data with on-chain metrics, such as exchange net flows and holder composition, to validate the sentiment shift. Their recent reports indicate a decrease in coins moving to exchanges for sale, aligning with the less fearful sentiment reading. Expert Insight: The Mechanics of Sentiment Shifts Dr. Lena Vance, a behavioral finance economist at the Digital Asset Research Institute, explains the underlying mechanics. “The Fear & Greed Index is powerful because it quantifies the herd mentality,” she states. “A move from 20 to 29 may seem small, but in behavioral terms, it reflects a measurable reduction in panic-driven decision-making. Investors are beginning to process information more rationally, rather than reacting purely to negative headlines or short-term volatility.” This perspective is supported by data from the past month, which shows a stabilization in Bitcoin’s realized volatility and a modest increase in stablecoin inflows to exchanges—a potential precursor to buying pressure. Furthermore, the index’s weighting of social media sentiment captures the nuanced shift from apocalyptic narratives to more balanced discussions about protocol upgrades and regulatory clarity. The Impact of Volatility and Trading Volume The two heaviest-weighted components of the index—volatility and trading volume—deserve particular attention. Over the last fortnight, the 30-day volatility for Bitcoin has contracted by approximately 15%, according to data from TradingView. This compression often indicates a coiling period that can precede a significant price movement. Simultaneously, aggregate spot trading volume across major platforms like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken has risen by an estimated 8%. This combination of lower volatility and higher volume can signal the early stages of informed accumulation, as opposed to speculative frenzy. The table below illustrates the recent trend in these key metrics: Metric 30 Days Ago Current Reading Change Impact on Index BTC 30-Day Volatility 68% 58% -14.7% Positive for Sentiment Aggregate Daily Volume $42B $45.5B +8.3% Positive for Sentiment Social Sentiment Score 28/100 35/100 +25% Positive for Sentiment This data-driven improvement directly feeds into the index’s calculation, providing a factual basis for the climb to 29. Broader Market Implications and Future Trajectory The easing sentiment captured by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index does not exist in a vacuum. It interacts with macro-financial conditions, including interest rate expectations and global liquidity. In early 2025, with central banks in a holding pattern, cryptocurrency markets are finding their own footing based on internal supply dynamics and adoption milestones. A sentiment reading in the ‘Fear’ zone, but rising, typically suggests a market that is healing but remains vulnerable to negative shocks. For portfolio managers, this environment often dictates a strategy of phased re-entry or dollar-cost averaging, rather than all-in speculation. The index also provides a contrarian indicator for retail investors; historically, buying during periods of sustained fear has yielded positive long-term returns, though past performance is never a guarantee of future results. The key watchpoint now is whether the index can sustain its move and challenge the neutral level of 50, which would require consistent positive inflows and a supportive macro backdrop. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s climb to 29 represents a meaningful, data-backed shift in market psychology from extreme pessimism toward cautious optimism. This movement, driven by improvements in volatility, trading volume, and social sentiment, provides a quantifiable snapshot of a market in transition. While firmly remaining in the ‘Fear’ category, the upward trajectory suggests that the peak of investor capitulation may have passed, allowing for a more stable foundation for price discovery. Market participants should monitor this index alongside on-chain fundamentals and macroeconomic developments, as the journey from fear to greed is rarely linear. The current reading of 29 offers a hopeful sign that the market is processing information more calmly, a necessary step for sustainable long-term growth. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 29 mean? A reading of 29 places the market in the ‘Fear’ category, but on an upward trend from ‘Extreme Fear.’ It indicates that negative sentiment is easing, though investors remain generally cautious rather than optimistic or greedy. Q2: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and how often is it updated? The index is compiled and published daily by the data provider Alternative. It aggregates real-time data from volatility, volume, social media, surveys, Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends. Q3: Is the Fear & Greed Index a reliable predictor of Bitcoin’s price? The index is a sentiment indicator, not a direct price predictor. It reflects current market emotion. Historically, sustained extreme fear has often preceded price rebounds, while extreme greed has signaled market tops, but it should be used alongside other fundamental and technical analysis tools. Q4: Why is Bitcoin’s market dominance a factor in the index? Bitcoin dominance measures Bitcoin’s market share relative to the entire cryptocurrency market. Shifts in dominance often reflect risk appetite; investors may flee to Bitcoin (‘digital gold’) during fear and into altcoins during greed, making it a useful sentiment gauge. Q5: How should a trader or investor use this index? Primarily as a contrarian indicator and a gauge of market temperature. Extreme readings can signal potential turning points. A rising index from fear levels, like the current move to 29, can suggest it’s time to research opportunities, but never to base a trade solely on this single metric.

This critical metric, updated on a continuous basis, provides a data-driven snapshot of capital rotation between the flagship cryptocurrency and the broader altcoin universe. Consequently, investors and analysts are closely monitoring this figure for early signs of a potential regime shift, as historical patterns suggest these cycles dictate portfolio performance for months. The current reading, far from the 75 threshold needed to declare an ‘altcoin season,’ underscores a period where Bitcoin continues to command market leadership and investor preference. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index Mechanics CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index operates on a transparent and methodical calculation. Fundamentally, the index compares the 90-day price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization against Bitcoin’s performance over the same period. However, the algorithm makes crucial exclusions to ensure clarity; it deliberately filters out stablecoins like USDT and USDC, alongside wrapped tokens such as WBTC, which merely mirror Bitcoin’s price. The core calculation is straightforward: it measures the percentage of these top 100 assets that have outperformed Bitcoin. A result of 75% or higher triggers the official declaration of an altcoin season, a condition last observed in early 2021. Conversely, a score below 25 strongly suggests a Bitcoin season, where the pioneer cryptocurrency outshines most alternatives. The current score of 23 sits precisely within this Bitcoin-dominant territory. The Historical Context of Market Cycles Understanding the index’s current position requires examining past crypto market cycles. Historically, bull markets often begin with Bitcoin leading the charge, attracting institutional and mainstream capital first. Subsequently, as Bitcoin’s price stabilizes or consolidates at higher levels, investor appetite for risk increases, leading capital to flow into altcoins with higher growth potential—this is the classic altcoin season. For instance, the index surged above 75 for extended periods during the 2017-2018 and 2020-2021 bull runs. The prolonged period since 2022, however, has been characterized by lower index readings, reflecting a post-bear market environment where safety and established store-of-value narratives favor Bitcoin. This cyclical rhythm between Bitcoin and altcoin dominance is a well-documented phenomenon in cryptocurrency market analysis. Implications of a Score of 23 for Investors The index’s low reading carries significant practical implications for portfolio strategy. Primarily, it suggests that a momentum-based approach focused solely on altcoins may underperform relative to a strategy with Bitcoin exposure. Market data from similar periods shows that during strong Bitcoin seasons, capital tends to be concentrated, leaving many altcoins struggling for momentum. Therefore, investors might prioritize Bitcoin and perhaps the largest, most liquid altcoins (often called ‘blue-chip’ alts) during this phase. Nevertheless, a low index can also signal a potential accumulation phase for selective altcoins before a possible rotation. Seasoned analysts often view extreme readings in either direction as potential contrarian indicators, though timing such shifts remains notoriously difficult. Key characteristics of a Bitcoin-dominant market (Index below 25) include: Heightened focus on macroeconomic factors like interest rates and inflation. Strong relative performance of Bitcoin against the total crypto market cap (BTC Dominance). Reduced trading volumes and volatility across smaller altcoin projects. Increased narrative strength around Bitcoin as a digital gold and institutional asset. Expert Analysis on Current Market Structure Market structure experts point to several concurrent factors explaining the low Altcoin Season Index. First, the regulatory environment in 2024-2025 has created uncertainty for many altcoin projects, particularly those deemed securities by regulators. This uncertainty naturally benefits Bitcoin, which has achieved clearer regulatory status in major markets like the United States. Second, the successful launch and adoption of Bitcoin spot ETFs have funneled billions in traditional finance capital directly into Bitcoin, creating a demand shock that altcoins have not yet experienced. Finally, the broader risk-off sentiment in global markets, influenced by geopolitical tensions, has made investors cautious about the high-beta nature of most altcoins. These combined forces create a powerful tailwind for Bitcoin’s dominance, as reflected in the index score. Comparing Alternative Market Health Indicators While the Altcoin Season Index is a vital tool, prudent analysts cross-reference it with other metrics. For example, the Bitcoin Dominance chart, which tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, often correlates strongly with this index. Other useful indicators include the performance ratio of Ethereum (ETH) to Bitcoin (ETH/BTC pair) and the collective market cap of altcoins excluding the top 10. Currently, most of these complementary metrics align with the Altcoin Season Index’s message. The ETH/BTC ratio, a bellwether for altcoin strength, has remained in a downtrend or consolidation pattern, further validating the index’s low reading. This confluence of data from multiple sources strengthens the reliability of the current market diagnosis. The Path Forward: Monitoring for a Regime Shift Market participants are now watching for catalysts that could push the Altcoin Season Index higher. Potential triggers include decisive regulatory clarity for altcoins, the approval of spot ETFs for assets like Ethereum, or a sustained period of sideways movement in Bitcoin’s price that prompts investors to seek higher returns elsewhere. Historically, the transition from a Bitcoin season to an altcoin season is not instantaneous; it is a gradual process where the index climbs from lows, through a neutral zone, and finally breaches the 75 level. Therefore, a sustained move above the 50 level would be the first technical signal of strengthening altcoin momentum. Until then, the market structure favors the incumbent. Conclusion CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index, registering at 23, delivers a clear and data-backed message: the cryptocurrency market remains in a phase of Bitcoin dominance. This reading, derived from the comparative performance of the top 100 assets, is a crucial tool for navigating complex market cycles. While it presents challenges for altcoin investors in the short term, it also provides a framework for anticipating future rotations. Ultimately, understanding this index allows for more informed, strategic decisions aligned with the prevailing market regime. As the crypto landscape evolves, this metric will continue to serve as an essential barometer for the ever-shifting dynamics between Bitcoin and the expansive world of altcoins. FAQs Q1: What exactly does an Altcoin Season Index score of 23 mean? It means that only an estimated 23% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the previous 90 days. This indicates a market strongly favoring Bitcoin, known as a ‘Bitcoin season.’ Q2: How often is CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index updated? The index is calculated and updated on a continuous, real-time basis by CoinMarketCap, reflecting the most recent 90-day rolling performance data of the tracked cryptocurrencies. Q3: Has the index ever been wrong in predicting market cycles? The index is a descriptive metric, not a predictive one. It reports on what has already happened over a 90-day period. While it is an excellent indicator of the current trend, past performance does not guarantee future results, and external shocks can change market dynamics rapidly. Q4: Should I avoid altcoins entirely when the index is this low? Not necessarily. A low index suggests a challenging environment for broad altcoin momentum, but it can also be a period for researching and accumulating fundamentally strong projects at lower valuations. Portfolio allocation should always align with individual risk tolerance and investment horizon. Q5: What is the difference between this index and the ‘Bitcoin Dominance’ metric? Bitcoin Dominance measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total crypto market cap. The Altcoin Season Index measures price performance over time. While they often trend together, they are different measurements; one is a snapshot of value share, and the other is a snapshot of momentum performance.

This optimism was highlighted by XRPee, a prominent figure in the XRP community, who recently stated on X that the efforts surrounding XRP are not aimed at a $10 price, implying that expectations extend well beyond double digits. Price Declines Do Not Deter Long-Term Supporters XRP has declined roughly 50% from its July peak of $3.66, prompting frustration among some investors. However, several analysts caution against focusing solely on price fluctuations, emphasizing that XRP’s underlying ecosystem has grown significantly in recent months. Community voices, including Alex Cobb, have argued that trading below $2 represents a mispricing relative to XRP’s fundamentals. According to Cobb, purchasing XRP at this level provides an attractive long-term opportunity. They're not doing all this for a $10 XRP. — XRPee (@XRPee3) December 31, 2025 A key indicator supporting this perspective is the performance of spot XRP ETFs. Since their launch in mid-November, these ETFs have accumulated more than $1.16 billion in inflows, including approximately $500 million added in December alone. Notably, these funds have not experienced any net outflows since inception. Asset managers such as 21Shares, Bitwise, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, and Canary Capital now collectively oversee over $1.27 billion in XRP holdings. Observers interpret this consistent institutional interest as evidence that professional investors are positioning for a significant long-term appreciation beyond a $10 target. Regulatory Developments Support Optimism Regulatory clarity is another factor contributing to bullish sentiment. The CLARITY Act, scheduled for markup in January 2026, is widely viewed as a potential catalyst for increased institutional engagement within the U.S. crypto market. Given Ripple’s historical focus on compliance, many believe XRP could benefit disproportionately as clearer rules are established, further strengthening the long-term case for the asset. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Treasury Adoption Expands Beyond ETFs, corporate treasury strategies are driving additional institutional demand for XRP. Companies including Wellgistics Health, Webus International, and VivoPower have announced plans to hold XRP as a reserve asset. Ripple itself has collaborated with Evernorth to develop a large-scale XRP treasury initiative, involving up to $1 billion in long-term holdings. Proponents argue that these actions demonstrate growing confidence in XRP’s potential role within global financial infrastructure. XRPee’s statement reflects a widely held belief among XRP holders that the scale of ETF inflows, regulatory engagement, and institutional treasury adoption points to valuations exceeding a $10 price. A $10 XRP would imply a market capitalization of approximately $601 billion, more than five times its current $113 billion valuation. In this context, institutions holding 1 million XRP could see their portfolios reach $1 billion, illustrating the potential magnitude of future growth. Overall, long-term holders argue that XRP’s current trading levels understate its broader prospects, with the ongoing institutional and regulatory developments signaling ambitions far beyond a modest five-fold increase.

Currently hovering just above $89,200, Bitcoin recently saw its 10-week and 50-week simple moving averages (SMAs) cross paths on December 8, a development highlighted by market analyst Ali Martinez on social media site X (previously Twitter). Bitcoin May Face 50%-60% Correction Martinez emphasized the importance of watching the behavior of these two moving averages on the weekly chart. Historically, each time Bitcoin has registered a death cross between the 10-week and 50-week SMAs, it has been followed by substantial corrections. Related Reading: Dogecoin Long-Term Bullish Structure Still In Play And Will Cross $10 As seen in the cryptocurrency’s weekly chart below, past occurrences of such crossovers have led to price declines of 67% in September 2014, 54% in June 2018, 53% in March 2020, and 64% in January 2022. With the recent death cross-forming, Martinez suggests that if history is any guide, Bitcoin could face a correction between 50% and 60%, which would place its price anywhere between $50,000 and $38,000. Adding another layer of complexity to the analysis, market expert Mags has outlined two potential scenarios for Bitcoin’s near future. Two Scenarios For BTC’s Future Following Bitcoin’s downturn since its October highs above $126,000, it has been trading around the $85,000 mark for several weeks. Coinciding with this, Tether’s USDT dominance has broken out of its previous range, currently maintaining levels above the breakout zone. Since Bitcoin and USDT dominance exhibit an inverse correlation, Mags has identified two main scenarios moving forward. The first, a bullish scenario, hinges on the idea that if USDT dominance begins to decline, the current breakout could turn out to be a fakeout. Mags asserts that such a move could potentially ignite another expansion in Bitcoin’s price, possibly even leading to a new all-time high before any significant distribution occurs. Related Reading: Here’s How Much The XRP Price Will Be If It Overtakes Ethereum In Market Cap Conversely, Mags outlined a second scenario indicating early signs of a bearish structure. If the broader market trend weakens, Bitcoin might experience a temporary bounce, while USDT dominance forms a higher low near its mid-range before trending back upwards. In this case, BTC would exhibit a slow distribution pattern, marking neither a crash nor a rapid decline, but rather a gradual, choppy downward movement characteristic of initial bearish market behavior. The next move in USDT dominance is poised to play a crucial role in determining whether the current market represents a mere pause before further price continuation or the onset of an extended distribution phase leading up to a new all-time high.

As macro uncertainty, fading liquidity, and weak risk appetite weigh on sentiment, an increasing number of analysts are openly discussing the possibility of a prolonged bear market. Still, price action tells a more nuanced story. Bitcoin remains locked in consolidation, and the absence of aggressive downside continuation has opened the door to a potential relief rally in the near term. On-chain data from CryptoQuant adds important context to this setup. Recent metrics show that short-term holders—investors who typically drive momentum during trend expansions—have slipped back into net losses. Aggregate realized profit and loss for this group has turned negative again, with margins hovering near -12%. This deterioration is notable because it is occurring while Bitcoin’s price remains relatively elevated compared to previous cycle drawdowns, suggesting that stress is building beneath the surface rather than after a full capitulation. Historically, periods where short-term holders operate at a loss often coincide with late-stage corrections or consolidation phases within broader market transitions. While this does not confirm a market bottom, it highlights fragility in near-term demand and reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is at a critical inflection point as 2026 approaches. Short-Term Holder Stress Signals a Market at a Crossroads Recent on-chain observations suggest Bitcoin is entering a delicate phase where short-term holders are increasingly under strain. When newer market participants slip into losses, it often signals that price has moved faster than incoming demand can comfortably absorb. In past cycles, this condition has typically appeared near the later stages of corrections or during extended sideways phases, rather than at the start of deep bear markets. What makes the current setup notable is Bitcoin’s proximity to the average acquisition price of short-term holders. This zone has historically acted as a psychological and behavioral battleground. When price hovers near this level, market reactions tend to intensify, as traders decide whether to cut losses or hold through uncertainty. The outcome often defines whether consolidation continues or volatility expands. Importantly, the scale of losses remains moderate compared to historical capitulation events. Previous market resets, such as those seen in 2018 or mid-2022, were characterized by far deeper and more prolonged stress among short-term holders. The absence of similar extremes today suggests that, while sentiment is weak, the broader market structure has not yet broken down. That said, persistent pressure on short-term holders reflects fragile near-term demand. If losses begin to narrow, it could signal stabilization and set the stage for a relief move. If they widen instead, downside moves are more likely to accelerate. Bitcoin Consolidates Below $90K Bitcoin price action on the 3-day chart shows a clear transition from trend expansion to consolidation following the sharp correction from the $120K–$125K region. After losing the 50-day and 100-day moving averages during the November breakdown, BTC accelerated lower before finding demand in the mid-$80K zone. Since then, price has stabilized and is now compressing just below $90K, suggesting that downside momentum has slowed materially. The current structure reflects a market in equilibrium rather than capitulation. Bitcoin is trading above the 200-day moving average, which continues to slope upward, preserving the broader bullish structure from a higher-timeframe perspective. However, the declining 50-day and 100-day averages overhead are acting as dynamic resistance, capping upside attempts and preventing a clean trend reversal for now. Selling pressure peaked during the November decline, but recent candles show reduced volume, consistent with seller exhaustion rather than aggressive accumulation. This often precedes a range-bound phase where the market digests prior gains. From a technical standpoint, holding the $85K–$88K region is critical. A sustained defense of this area keeps the consolidation intact and opens the door for a relief rally toward the $95K–$100K zone. Conversely, a decisive loss of this support would expose Bitcoin to a deeper retracement toward the 200-day average, shifting the short-term bias back to the downside.

Analyst Thinks So—Here’s Why,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-heading-0-08-analyst-thinks-heres-why/,"A cryptocurrency analyst has pointed out how Dogecoin could be on track for $0.08 based on this breakout from a consolidation channel. Dogecoin Has Fallen Under An Ascending Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about where Dogecoin could be heading based on a technical analysis (TA) pattern. The pattern in question is an “Ascending Channel,” which is a type of Parallel Channel. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cycle Defined by Demand, Not Price: CryptoQuant Head Says Parallel Channels appear whenever an asset’s price observes consolidation between two parallel trendlines. When these lines have a positive slope, the pattern is known as an Ascending Channel. This channel corresponds to consolidation that occurs toward some net upside. Like other such patterns in TA, the upper line acts a source of resistance, while the lower one provides support. A break out of either of these boundaries can signal a continuation of trend in that direction. This means that a surge above the channel may be a bullish signal, while a drop under it a bearish one. Like the Ascending Channel, there is also a pattern in TA called the Descending Channel, emerging when the opposite type of consolidation takes place. That is, when the price moves to a net downside between two parallel trendlines with a negative slope. Until recently, Dogecoin had been trading inside a multi-year Ascending Channel on the 3-day timeframe. The memecoin capped off 2025 with a breakout from it, as the chart shared by Martinez shows. From the above graph, it’s apparent that Dogecoin has escaped the long Ascending Channel with a fall below the support trendline. The memecoin has since been following a steep downward trajectory, a potential sign that the bearish breakout is in effect. Breakouts from Parallel Channels are considered likely to end up being of the same height as the distance between the trendlines. Based on this, the analyst has put the $0.08 target for DOGE. It now remains to be seen whether the asset will follow this trajectory or if it will see a rebound before long. Related Reading: XRP At Risk Of A Drop To $0.80? Analyst Makes The Case In another X post, Martinez has highlighted how Bitcoin, the number one cryptocurrency, has also been trading inside a TA consolidation pattern recently. As displayed in the chart, the pattern in the case of Bitcoin is a Symmetrical Triangle, a channel that involves two lines converging at a roughly equal and opposite slope. BTC’s 4-hour price has been moving sideways in this pattern recently and based on its height, the analyst thinks that the coin may be set up for a 15% move. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.13, up more than 8% over the last 24 hours.

This perspective challenges a common belief among retail investors who assume that a single large price increase is sufficient to achieve long-term wealth. Why 20,000 XRP Might Not Be Enough According to the XRP veteran, many holders underestimate the real costs associated with sustaining financial freedom. Even if XRP were to reach $100 per token , a 20,000-XRP holding would be worth $2 million on paper. However, he emphasizes that this figure may not translate into lasting security once taxes, living expenses, and unexpected costs are considered. He notes that maintaining wealth over decades requires more than headline numbers. Inflation, lifestyle adjustments, and rising costs of living can quickly erode the value of even a multimillion-dollar portfolio. For younger investors, whose capital may need to last 30 to 50 years or more, a $2 million portfolio might cover essential needs but fall short of providing true financial freedom. You have people out here that truly believe they will become financially free with 20k xrp smh If XRP hit $100, that might sound amazing, but it doesn’t mean you’re set for life. A million dollars can go fast with taxes, bills, and daily costs. Over time, money is worth less… — XPR_OG (@XPROGTDBN28) December 28, 2025 Defining Real Financial Freedom The XRP community member suggests that a sustainable level of financial independence often requires assets valued between $5 million and $7 million, depending on individual circumstances such as age, location, and lifestyle choices. From this perspective, financial freedom is not determined solely by XRP reaching a specific price. Long-term planning, disciplined spending, and strategic portfolio management are equally critical. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 How Much XRP Might Be Necessary? Previous discussions within the XRP community highlight differing accumulation strategies. Crypto pundit King Vale recommended holding at least 50,000 XRP, a level that aligns with the top 0.5% of holders and potentially maximizes exposure to XRP’s growth potential. Meanwhile, Edoardo Farina has suggested that 10,000 XRP could be sufficient for long-term gains under optimistic market conditions. However, other community voices stress that portfolio size alone does not guarantee success. Xena, another prominent figure, argues that financial literacy, careful planning, and disciplined investing can allow smaller holders to achieve better outcomes than those with larger positions. Her approach prioritizes smart investment strategy and risk management over simply accumulating tokens. These contrasting perspectives reflect two primary approaches within the community: one emphasizing maximum accumulation to capture potential high returns, and the other focusing on sustainable, strategic investment tailored to individual circumstances. For instance, while 50,000 XRP could reach $500,000 if the price climbs to $10, the same tokens would only become a significant fortune if XRP were to reach $1,000 per coin, a highly speculative scenario. Ultimately, the discussion highlights that achieving financial freedom through cryptocurrency is not solely a matter of reaching a specific price point or holding a predetermined number of tokens. Effective wealth management, long-term planning, and realistic expectations play equally important roles in securing lasting financial stability.

As its user base was hyping for new records right around the corner, the trend changed, and the asset plummeted in the following months to an all-time low of $0.172 in early October. It managed to rebound to $0.20 when 2025 came to a close, but that still meant a 93% yearly decline. The question that we now asked ChatGPT is whether 2026 will fare any better, and what the most shocking price predictions it could justify for the year ahead are. $0.10 or Even $0.05? The popular AI solution began by outlining the most bearish scenario it could think of, in which the overall bear market continues and PI slumps to $0.05 or even slightly below that level. This could happen if the ongoing token unlocks keep increasing the circulating supply, and the selling pressure from early adopters surges as they finally access liquidity. Additionally, limited real demand for PI outside the Pi Network ecosystem could harm the underlying asset. “If broader crypto markets turn risk-off in 2026, PI could easily slump to $0.10, or even plunge toward $0.05, wiping out another 75% from current levels. In this scenario, PI would resemble many past “community-first” projects that failed to sustain long-term value after launch,” said the chatbot. If The Bulls Take Control… In contrast to the shocking bearish prediction, ChatGPT also outlined the opposite side of the coin. It believes this so-called ‘most explosive scenario’ hinges on real adoption, which could send the token flying toward or even beyond its 2025 all-time high. If Pi Network successfully converts even a small fraction of its tens of millions of claimed users into active economic participants, and if PI gains deeper exchange liquidity, the potential upside could be ‘violent,” said ChatGPT. It predicted a massive surge to as high as $5 in a full bull-market environment, which sounds rather far-fetched at the moment, but crypto has a lot of catching up to do to TradFi in 2026. Following these big price predictions, some of which may sound unattainable at the moment, the AI platform brought up its most realistic scenario. It’s a lot less volatile as it sees PI trading sideways between $0.15 and $0.40 throughout most of the year, with perhaps a few deviations above and below those boundaries in case of sharp market moves.

Despite these challenging conditions, analysts are suggesting that this negativity may set the stage for a significant bullish reversal, drawing parallels to historical trends. Institutional Buyers Remain Active Reports indicate that periods of extreme sentiment have often preceded XRP rallies with impressive gains, at times exceeding 1,000%. Data from Santiment indicates that bearish mentions of XRP are now running 20-30% higher than the subdued averages seen in November. This deepening negativity, coupled with XRP stabilizing between $1.8 and $1.9 mark, highlights “a classic market divergence”: sentiment continues to worsen while prices consolidate, suggesting that emotional capitulation is occurring faster than any fundamental deterioration. Related Reading: Is The Dogecoin Bottom In? 3 Analysts Break Down the Charts Beneath this wave of retail fear, however, institutional behavior paints a more positive picture. Spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded inflows of approximately $424 million in December alone, making them the best-performing crypto ETF product. This contrast between extreme retail sentiment—currently at an extreme fear level of 24—and substantial institutional accumulation, which stands at around $1.3 billion over the past 50 days, often precedes market reversals more reliably than sentiment readings alone indicate. 70-75% Chance Of Bullish Reversal For XRP, the current setup combines extreme fear readings with a social sentiment significantly above baseline levels, alongside price consolidation, creating a historical pattern that has led to substantial rallies multiple times since 2020. For instance, back in the 2020-2021 cycle, XRP dropped to $0.17 amid the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit, followed by a 1,053% increase to $1.96 over just four months. Today’s scenario mirrors this past occurrence. With institutional accumulation diverging sharply from retail capitulation, historical data suggests that this combination yields a 70-75% chance of a bullish reversal within the next two to eight weeks. Current trading conditions for XRP sit at approximately $1.90, with the Fear & Greed Index at 24. This setup creates three potential scenarios. Three Potential Price Scenarios For XRP In the most favorable bullish scenario, the Trump administration could announce clear pro-crypto regulatory policies in the first quarter of the year, BlackRock might file an XRP ETF application, or the adoption of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin could rapidly scale above $2-3 billion. Historically, when the Fear & Greed Index climbs from 24 into neutral territory (between 50 and 60), XRP often rallies between 30-50%, setting targets between $2.44 and $2.82. If bullish momentum continues into mild greed (70+), XRP could reach the $3.00-$3.20 range. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s $150K Target Looks Unlikely As Polymarket Odds Sink To 23% In a more neutral scenario, sentiment may gradually normalize without dramatic catalysts, with ETF inflows continuing to average between $200-300 million monthly. As RLUSD organically grows through existing partnerships, fears could naturally subside over a span of six to eight weeks. As the Fear & Greed Index rises from 24 to the 45-55 range, XRP has typically appreciated between 15-25%, targeting between $2.16 and $2.35. If the support at $1.85 holds through January, and trading volume expands above $1.98, the price could extend toward $2.40-$2.50. In a bearish outcome, sentiment could linger in extreme fear (below 30) for over eight weeks without relief. A decisive break below $1.85 on substantial volume would see XRP testing support levels around $1.65-$1.70. The altcoin has surged by over 6% in the past 24 hours towards $1.98 amid a broader recovery in the crypto market.

His release took place on January 2, 2026, several years before the completion of his original sentence. Lichtenstein credited his early release to provisions under the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform law signed in 2018, which allows sentence reductions for inmates who participate in rehabilitation programs and demonstrate good conduct. How the First Step Act Led to an Early Release Lichtenstein was arrested in February 2022 alongside his wife, Heather Morgan, after US authorities traced nearly 120,000 BTC stolen from Bitfinex. At the time of the arrest, the stolen Bitcoin was valued at approximately $4.5 billion, making it one of the largest cryptocurrency seizures in US history. In November 2024, Lichtenstein was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to money laundering conspiracy. However, according to his statement following release, his participation in rehabilitation and educational programs made him eligible for sentence reduction under the First Step Act. From a Mid-Market Bitcoin Era to a Multi-Trillion-Dollar Asset When the Bitfinex hack occurred in August 2016, Bitcoin was trading at roughly $600–$650 per coin. At those prices, the 120,000 BTC stolen during the breach were valued at approximately $72–$78 million, a substantial amount at the time but within a far smaller and less developed crypto market. Nearly a decade later, Bitcoin trades at levels that fundamentally reshape the historical significance of the incident. With Bitcoin priced around $90,000 in early 2026, the same 120,000 BTC would now be worth approximately $10.8 billion, representing an increase of more than 140 times compared with its estimated value at the time of the hack. Cooperation With Authorities Played a Role Beyond rehabilitation efforts, Lichtenstein cooperated with US authorities during ongoing investigations. In 2024, he testified in the case involving the cryptocurrency mixer Bitcoin Fog. The operator of the service was later sentenced to 12.5 years in prison, a development prosecutors cited as a significant enforcement milestone. Heather Morgan received a more lenient sentence of 18 months in prison and was released in October 2025 after serving approximately eight months. Following her arrest, she gained widespread attention on social media for her musical project under the pseudonym Razzlekhan, which became a viral internet phenomenon. What the Case Signals for Crypto Enforcement Lichtenstein’s release comes amid broader discussion about how the US justice system handles cryptocurrency-related crimes. In recent years, sentencing outcomes have increasingly reflected cooperation, restitution efforts, and rehabilitation rather than punishment alone. Following his release, Lichtenstein stated that he plans to use his technical background in cybersecurity, marking a notable shift from one of the most high-profile crypto crime cases toward a potential role in digital security. The case underscores how enforcement strategies and sentencing frameworks in the crypto sector continue to evolve as authorities balance deterrence, recovery of assets, and long-term reintegration.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-03 05:01:20

The latest figures show that network demand has now surpassed the peak levels observed during the height of the NFT and DeFi boom in 2021. According to CryptoQuant , the seven-day rolling average of Ethereum transactions reached 1.87 million on December 31, 2025. This exceeds the previous record of 1.61 million transactions set in May 2021 and also surpasses a local peak recorded in August 2025. Address activity and the number of new network users have also increased alongside transaction volume. User Growth and Upgrades Drive Network Demand User engagement on Ethereum has risen sharply in recent months. Analysts report that the number of active addresses climbed to 728,904 , the highest level since May 2021. On the same day, more than 270,000 new addresses were created, marking the largest single-day increase since early 2018. Why Activity Is Rising Without Fee Spikes Analysts attribute the sustained increase in network activity primarily to technical changes implemented throughout 2025. During the year, Ethereum underwent two major upgrades, Pectra and Fusaka, both aimed at improving scalability and lowering costs for users. The Pectra upgrade increased data throughput, raised staking limits for validators, and introduced multiple performance improvements. Fusaka followed by implementing PeerDAS, which optimized data availability, reduced node load during periods of high demand, and helped keep transaction fees relatively stable even as usage increased. Experts also point to rising institutional participation as an additional growth factor. Increased stablecoin usage, the expansion of tokenized real-world assets, and capital inflows through exchange-traded products have added sustained demand to the network without triggering sharp fee increases. Ethereum developers are already preparing another round of major upgrades in 2026. The upcoming Glamsterdam upgrade will focus on overall network performance and resilience, while the subsequent Hegota upgrade is expected to target long-term architectural optimization and decentralization. Despite growing competition from other blockchains, analysts note that Ethereum continues to serve as core infrastructure for stablecoins, real-world assets, decentralized finance, and yield-generating products.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-03 05:21:25

This significant inflow, led dominantly by financial giant BlackRock, completely erased the prior day’s outflows and signaled robust institutional appetite for cryptocurrency exposure at the start of the new trading year. The data, compiled by industry tracker TraderT, provides a clear snapshot of investor sentiment and capital movement within this pivotal financial instrument category. Bitcoin ETF Inflow Breakdown and Market Leaders BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) commanded the day’s activity, single-handedly drawing $280.12 million in net inflows. Consequently, this massive vote of confidence from investors solidified IBIT’s position as the category leader. Other major issuers also reported positive flows, creating a broad-based rally. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) secured $88.08 million, while Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) gathered $41.49 million. Furthermore, several other funds contributed to the total, including Franklin Templeton’s EZBC ($12.99M), VanEck’s HODL ($8.26M), Ark Invest’s ARKB ($6.71M), and Invesco’s BTCO ($4.47M). Notably, Grayscale’s offerings also participated, with its flagship GBTC adding $15.42 million and its Mini BTC Trust attracting $6.35 million. The following table summarizes the key inflows for January 2, 2025: ETF Ticker Issuer Net Inflow (USD) IBIT BlackRock $280.12M FBTC Fidelity $88.08M BITB Bitwise $41.49M EZBC Franklin Templeton $12.99M Contextualizing the Spot Bitcoin ETF Phenomenon The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States in early 2024 represented a watershed moment for cryptocurrency adoption. Unlike futures-based products, these funds hold physical bitcoin, providing direct exposure to the asset’s price. This structure appeals to a wide range of investors, from large institutions to financial advisors and retail participants. The January 2nd inflow data is particularly noteworthy because it follows a period of typical year-end portfolio rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting, which often pressures asset prices. Therefore, the strong start to 2025 suggests a renewal of strategic, long-term allocation rather than short-term speculation. Market analysts often interpret consistent ETF inflows as a measure of sustained institutional demand. These flows require the ETF issuer to purchase equivalent amounts of bitcoin on the open market to back the new shares. This process creates a direct, mechanical buy-pressure on the underlying asset. Over time, this dynamic can significantly impact bitcoin’s supply and demand equilibrium, especially considering its fixed maximum supply of 21 million coins. Expert Analysis on Institutional Adoption Trends Financial experts point to several factors driving this renewed interest. First, macroeconomic conditions, including monetary policy expectations, can influence asset allocation decisions. Second, the maturation of cryptocurrency custody and regulatory frameworks has reduced perceived operational risks for large institutions. Third, the competitive fee structures among ETF issuers, with some even offering temporary fee waivers, have made access more cost-effective. The dominance of traditional asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity in the inflow rankings underscores their existing, vast distribution networks and client trust, which are effectively channeling capital into the digital asset space. The trajectory of these funds is also closely watched for its impact on bitcoin’s market structure. As ETF holdings grow, the proportion of bitcoin supply considered “locked” in long-term investment vehicles increases. This trend potentially reduces the liquid supply available for trading, which can decrease market volatility and increase price stability over the long term. However, analysts caution that outflow days will also occur, reflecting normal market cycles and profit-taking behavior. Comparative Performance and Market Impact When comparing the performance of different spot Bitcoin ETFs, factors beyond daily flows become critical. Investors and advisors typically evaluate expense ratios, liquidity (as measured by average daily trading volume), and the reputation of the custodian safeguarding the assets. BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC have consistently led in net asset gathering since their launches, benefiting from their globally recognized brands and extensive relationships with wirehouses and registered investment advisors (RIAs). The collective action of these ETFs has several tangible market impacts: Price Discovery: They integrate bitcoin pricing into traditional equity market hours and systems. Accessibility: They provide a familiar, regulated wrapper for exposure, bypassing the complexities of direct custody. Legitimization: Their existence and growth signal regulatory acceptance to a broader investor base. Data from the broader blockchain ecosystem often reflects ETF activity. On days of substantial net inflows, on-chain analysts may observe larger-than-normal transfers of bitcoin to known custodian addresses, such as Coinbase Custody, which secures assets for multiple ETF issuers. This on-chain transparency provides a secondary layer of verification for the reported flow data. Conclusion The $463.9 million net inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 2, 2025, marks a decisive and optimistic start to the year for cryptocurrency investment products. Led by BlackRock’s IBIT, this collective movement of capital demonstrates resilient institutional demand and a swift recovery from prior outflows. As these regulated vehicles continue to mature, their flow data will remain a crucial barometer for measuring mainstream financial adoption of digital assets like bitcoin. The sustained growth of these funds not only impacts bitcoin’s market dynamics but also solidifies the asset’s position within the modern, diversified investment portfolio. FAQs Q1: What is a spot Bitcoin ETF? A spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that holds physical bitcoin. It allows investors to gain exposure to bitcoin’s price movements through a traditional brokerage account without needing to buy, store, or secure the cryptocurrency directly. Q2: Why are net inflows important for Bitcoin ETFs? Net inflows are crucial because they represent new capital entering the fund. The issuer must use this cash to purchase an equivalent amount of bitcoin, creating direct buy-side pressure on the market. Consistent inflows indicate growing investor demand and can influence bitcoin’s price. Q3: What was the significance of the January 2, 2025, inflow data? The $463.9 million inflow was significant because it represented a strong reversal from outflows on the previous day. It signaled renewed institutional investment interest at the very beginning of the new trading year, often interpreted as a positive sentiment indicator. Q4: How does BlackRock’s IBIT differ from Grayscale’s GBTC? Both are investment products offering bitcoin exposure, but they have different structures. IBIT is a newly launched spot ETF with a competitive management fee. GBTC was converted from a closed-end trust into a spot ETF. Their fee structures, historical performance, and liquidity profiles differ, influencing investor choice. Q5: Do Bitcoin ETF flows directly cause bitcoin’s price to rise? While not the sole factor, significant net inflows contribute to upward price pressure. The ETF issuer’s market purchases to back new shares increase demand. However, bitcoin’s price is also affected by global macroeconomic factors, broader cryptocurrency market sentiment, and technological developments.

Powell has, in his persistent classiness, refused to share whether or not he plans to stay on, opting to instead say the answer to that question is “irrelevant at the moment.” Cryptopolitan had earlier reported that at December’s press conference, Powell said, “I’m focused on my remaining time as chair. I haven’t got anything new on that to tell you. Please move on.” Wall Street can’t decide what it feels about Fed’s board math and Trump’s influence Like most other places on earth, numbers decide power at the Fed, and the Board of Governors has seven seats, with three already filled by allies of President Donald Trump, who has made it embarrassingly clear that he does not like Powell. He spent a lot of time last year publicly insulting the Fed chair and telling Americans that he is to blame for their economic woes. Not the president of the free world himself. In June, Trump posted on Truth that:- “Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell, and his entire Board, should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this to happen to the United States. They have one of the easiest, yet most prestigious, jobs in America, and they have FAILED — And continue to do so. If they were doing their job properly, our Country would be saving Trillions of Dollars in Interest Cost. The Board just sits there and watches, so they are equally to blame. We should be paying 1% Interest, or better!” If Powell leaves when his chair term ends, Trump would gain an instant majority on the board. That math matters for the Open Market Committee, which sets rates. Trump has also said publicly that any future chair must agree with him or “will never be Fed Chairman.” If the board voted together, which is not guaranteed, the president would gain a clearer path to ultra-low rates. But the Federal Reserve Act does appear to allow a board majority to remove individual regional bank presidents who oppose rate cuts. Legal experts debate whether cause is required. Jerome remaining on the board, even without a majority, could complicate any effort to remove dissenting voices. This type of question has not come up in decades. Former chairs like Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen left the board quietly before their governor terms expired. Ben went on to the private sector. Janet later took another government role. The fact that this is even a debate now shows how different the political climate has become. Fed watchers interviewed by CNBC allegedly described the decision as personal and professional. After 13 years at the Fed, including eight as chair, Jerome is seen as ready for life outside public office. He plays golf, enjoys music, and recently became a grandfather. During much of his tenure, he faced steady public criticism from Trump, who first appointed him to the role. Powell could face a legal battle with Trump administration but Fed history is on his side Most observers believe Powell will leave the Fed entirely in May. None rule out a short stay. Only one chair ever stayed on as a governor after stepping down. Marriner Eccles did so in 1948. As a governor, Marriner later helped secure the 1951 Treasury-Fed accord, which ended the Fed’s duty to hold rates down and strengthened central bank independence. Another factor sits with Fed Governor Lisa Cook. Trump fired Lisa over an alleged mortgage fraud claim. She has denied the allegation. Courts paused the firing. The Justice Department has not filed charges. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear the case on January 21, with a ruling expected later. If the court removes Lisa, Trump would gain a board majority immediately. The bigger issue is whether the ruling gives the president broad power to remove other governors. In that scenario, Jerome could face direct pressure next. Some of the fear assumes the worst. Governors do not always follow the president who appointed them. All three Trump-appointed governors recently voted to reappoint all 12 regional bank presidents to new five-year terms. The board still holds removal power, but the vote showed independence can still exist. There is also talk that Powell may be using silence as leverage. By refusing to say what he will do, he could be keeping options open based on who Trump nominates next. There is no proof of that thinking. Jerome has stayed largely apolitical on fiscal matters and has not responded publicly to repeated insults from the president. Several Fed observers say staying on would draw even more political pressure and break recent tradition. Leaving would avoid that outcome. Another theory is simpler. Powell may see his refusal to answer as a basic exercise of independence, showing that the law gives him the right to decide his exit on his own timeline and announce it when he chooses.",OP-ED|Fed|powell|TRUMP,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-03 05:29:59
56758053,652008,1767418249,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56758053.jpeg,Mark Cuban Cleared As Court Dismisses Voyager Digital Investor Lawsuit,https://bitcoinist.com/mark-cuban-cleared-as-court-dismisses-voyager-digital-investor-lawsuit/,"A US federal judge has tossed a class-action lawsuit brought by former Voyager Digital customers against billionaire Mark Cuban and the Dallas Mavericks, ruling the court did not have the power to hear the case. The order , entered at the end of December, dismissed the suit in its entirety after finding the plaintiffs failed to show the defendants were subject to personal jurisdiction in Florida. Mark Cuban Vs. Voyager: Judge Cites Lack Of Personal Jurisdiction According to the court filing, Judge Roy K. Altman concluded that Mark Cuban and the Mavericks did not “carry on a business or business venture in Florida” in a way that would let the Miami-area court preside over the matter. The decision follows extensive jurisdictional discovery and multiple amended complaints that, the judge said, still fell short of establishing the necessary legal ties to Florida. The defense team hailed the ruling as a complete win for their clients. The suit traces back to 2022, when Voyager Digital filed for Chapter 11 protection after a sharp market downturn and loan defaults. Voyager’s bankruptcy and the fallout led to a wave of litigation by users who said they lost access to funds and were misled by the company’s statements. Reports have noted the firm had roughly $1.3 billion in customer crypto assets implicated during restructuring talks. Promotion And The $100 Fan Offer Based on reports from earlier coverage, the dispute focused on a 2021 promotion in which Cuban and the Mavericks partnered with Voyager and offered fans incentives tied to deposits and trading. Plaintiffs argued the partnership and public backing helped convince customers to use the platform. Other defendants in related Voyager litigation have settled; Cuban and the Mavericks maintained they would fight the claims. Legal experts say the outcome highlights the limits of suing public figures in forums far from where those figures are based. Courts increasingly demand concrete evidence that a defendant targeted a state before allowing local lawsuits to proceed. This dismissal does not decide whether the promotional statements were true or false; it addresses only where the case could be heard. Plaintiffs’ Options And Wider Litigation Reports have not shown an immediate refiling in another court by the named plaintiffs. Because the judge dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, the plaintiffs were denied the chance to proceed in that Florida court but may pursue claims elsewhere if they choose.

56757427,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258103,1767418811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Ethereum ETF Surge: U.S. Spot Funds See Staggering $173.8M Inflow, Reversing Bearish Trend",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-etf-inflow-january-2025/,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETF Surge: U.S. Spot Funds See Staggering $173.8M Inflow, Reversing Bearish Trend In a significant reversal of fortune for digital asset markets, U.S.-listed spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) attracted a substantial $173.8 million in net new capital on January 2, 2025. This notable Ethereum ETF inflow marks a decisive shift from the net outflows that characterized the closing weeks of 2024, according to verified data from analytics firm TraderT. The collective movement into these regulated investment vehicles suggests a resurgence of institutional and retail investor confidence in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, potentially setting a new tone for the year ahead. Breaking Down the January 2 Ethereum ETF Inflow Data Data from TraderT provides a detailed breakdown of the capital allocation across the major fund issuers. Grayscale Investments, a long-standing leader in the crypto asset management space, led the pack. Its flagship Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) secured $53.69 million, while its newer, lower-fee Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust attracted a comparable $50.03 million. This dual strength indicates demand across both established and cost-conscious investor segments. Meanwhile, traditional finance giant BlackRock made a formidable showing. Its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) pulled in $46.55 million, reinforcing its rapid ascent in the crypto ETF arena since its launch. Specialized crypto asset managers also participated in the inflow. Bitwise’s Ethereum Strategy ETF (ETHW) gathered $18.99 million, and VanEck’s Ethereum Strategy ETF (ETHV) saw a $4.56 million inflow. The distribution of capital across multiple providers, rather than concentration in a single fund, points to broad-based buying interest rather than a niche event. Grayscale ETHE: $53.69 million inflow Grayscale Mini ETH: $50.03 million inflow BlackRock ETHA: $46.55 million inflow Bitwise ETHW: $18.99 million inflow VanEck ETHV: $4.56 million inflow Contextualizing the Reversal in Crypto ETF Flows This substantial single-day inflow represents a stark contrast to the trend observed in late December 2024. Throughout that period, spot Ethereum ETFs, alongside their Bitcoin counterparts, experienced consistent net outflows. Market analysts attributed the year-end weakness to typical portfolio rebalancing, tax-loss harvesting strategies, and a cautious sentiment amid macroeconomic uncertainty. Consequently, the January 2 data is widely interpreted as a potential “January effect” for crypto assets—a phenomenon where investment products rebound after year-end selling pressure subsides. Furthermore, the timing coincides with renewed discussions about Ethereum’s underlying network upgrades and its evolving use cases in decentralized finance (DeFi) and tokenization. Investors may be positioning themselves ahead of anticipated developments in Ethereum’s protocol, which could enhance its scalability and utility. The inflow also arrives as traditional equity markets show volatility, prompting some allocators to seek non-correlated assets. This shift suggests a strategic reallocation into crypto as a distinct asset class, facilitated by the accessible, regulated ETF wrapper. Expert Analysis on Institutional Sentiment Shifts Financial analysts monitoring fund flows emphasize the importance of sustained momentum. “A single day of robust inflows is an encouraging signal, but the key metric will be consistency over the coming weeks,” notes a market structure report from Bloomberg Intelligence. The report highlights that while the reversal is positive, it must be viewed within the broader trajectory of adoption. For instance, cumulative net flows for spot Ethereum ETFs since their launch in 2024 remain a critical benchmark for measuring long-term product success and investor acceptance. Additionally, the performance gap between spot Ethereum ETFs and futures-based products has narrowed, making the physically-backed funds more attractive. This convergence, coupled with generally lower fee structures among newer entrants like the Grayscale Mini Trust and BlackRock’s ETHA, creates a more competitive and investor-friendly landscape. The data implies that cost efficiency and the simplicity of direct spot exposure are driving factors behind the capital movement. The Regulatory and Market Impact of Spot Ethereum ETFs The approval and subsequent trading of spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2024 marked a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency industry. It provided a regulated, familiar, and accessible pathway for a wider range of investors to gain exposure to Ether’s price movements without the complexities of direct custody, wallet management, or crypto exchange accounts. This structural innovation has fundamentally altered the market’s liquidity profile and price discovery mechanisms. The daily inflow and outflow data from these ETFs now serve as a transparent, real-time barometer of institutional and sophisticated retail sentiment. Large inflows typically correlate with positive price momentum for Ethereum, as ETF issuers must purchase the underlying asset to back new shares created. This creates direct buy-side pressure on the spot market. Conversely, the reversal from outflows to inflows can signal a local bottom or a shift in market psychology, which the January 2 data strongly suggests. Spot Ethereum ETF Flow Comparison (Selected Dates) Fund Name (Ticker) Inflow Jan 2, 2025 Typical Fee Structure Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) $53.69M ~1.50% Spot Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust $50.03M ~0.25% Spot r> iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) $46.55M ~0.25% Spot Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (ETHW) $18.99M ~0.20% Spot Conclusion The $173.8 million net inflow into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on January 2, 2025, stands as a powerful indicator of shifting market dynamics. This movement not only breaks a pattern of outflows but also underscores the growing integration of Ethereum into mainstream investment portfolios through regulated vehicles. The diversified distribution across major issuers like Grayscale, BlackRock, and Bitwise reflects healthy competition and broad investor appeal. As the crypto market continues to mature, the flow data from these Ethereum ETF products will remain a crucial metric for gauging institutional sentiment, market health, and the evolving narrative around digital asset adoption. This early-year surge may well set a precedent for capital allocation trends throughout 2025. FAQs Q1: What does a “net inflow” mean for an Ethereum ETF? A net inflow occurs when the amount of new money invested into an ETF through share creations exceeds the amount withdrawn through share redemptions on a given day. It indicates net buying demand for the fund. Q2: Why is the January 2, 2025, inflow for spot Ethereum ETFs significant? This inflow is significant because it represents a sharp reversal from the net outflows seen in late 2024, potentially signaling renewed investor confidence and a positive shift in market sentiment for Ethereum at the start of the new year. Q3: How do inflows into a spot ETF affect the price of Ethereum (ETH)? When a spot ETF experiences inflows, the issuer must purchase an equivalent amount of the underlying asset (Ether) to back the newly created shares. This purchasing activity on the open market can create upward pressure on Ethereum’s price. Q4: What is the difference between Grayscale’s ETHE and its Mini ETH fund? The primary differences are the fee structure and share price. The Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust was launched with a significantly lower annual fee to compete with newer, low-cost entrants like BlackRock’s ETHA, whereas the original ETHE carries a higher fee. Q5: Are spot Ethereum ETFs considered a safe way to invest in cryptocurrency? Spot Ethereum ETFs are considered a more secure and regulated way for traditional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price. They eliminate the need for investors to manage private keys or use cryptocurrency exchanges, as the ETF issuer handles custody. However, they still carry the market risk associated with Ethereum’s price volatility.

John D’Agostino, Head of Institutional Strategy at Coinbase, recently provided an optimistic assessment of the CLARITY Act’s trajectory during a CNBC interview, describing the bill as fundamental legislation for the growth of real-world asset classes, including cryptocurrency. This development marks a pivotal moment for digital asset regulation following years of regulatory uncertainty and fragmented oversight across different states and federal agencies. Crypto Market Structure Bill Advances Toward Regulatory Clarity The CLARITY Act represents the most comprehensive attempt to date to establish a coherent regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States. Unlike previous piecemeal approaches, this legislation aims to create a unified classification system for cryptocurrencies while defining clear jurisdictional boundaries between regulatory agencies. Industry analysts note that the bill addresses several critical issues that have hampered institutional adoption, including custody requirements, trading venue regulations, and consumer protection measures. Furthermore, the legislation incorporates lessons from international regulatory approaches while tailoring solutions to the unique aspects of the American financial system. Market participants have long advocated for such comprehensive legislation, arguing that regulatory uncertainty has pushed innovation and investment to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, implemented in 2024, created pressure for the United States to develop its own coherent framework. Industry data shows that between 2023 and 2025, the percentage of institutional investors citing regulatory clarity as their primary concern decreased from 78% to 62%, reflecting growing confidence in legislative progress. However, significant challenges remain regarding enforcement mechanisms and inter-agency coordination. Comparing Legislative Complexity: CLARITY Versus GENIUS Acts D’Agostino emphasized the inherent complexity of the market structure legislation compared to other crypto-related bills, particularly the GENIUS Act focused on stablecoin regulation. While both pieces of legislation address digital assets, their scope and technical requirements differ substantially. The GENIUS Act primarily establishes reserve requirements, redemption mechanisms, and issuer qualifications for dollar-pegged stablecoins. In contrast, the CLARITY Act must address diverse asset classes with varying characteristics, from Bitcoin’s decentralized nature to tokenized securities and utility tokens. The following table illustrates key differences between the two legislative approaches: Aspect GENIUS Act (Stablecoins) CLARITY Act (Market Structure) Primary Focus Payment-focused stable assets Comprehensive digital asset ecosystem Regulatory Scope Narrow: issuer requirements and reserves Broad: exchanges, custody, classification Technical Complexity Moderate: banking and payment systems High: multiple asset types and use cases Implementation Timeline 12-18 months estimated 24-36 months estimated International Alignment High with payment standards Moderate with varying global approaches This complexity explains why the legislative process has extended over multiple congressional sessions. Lawmakers must balance innovation facilitation with investor protection while considering existing securities, commodities, and banking laws. Additionally, the bill navigates jurisdictional questions between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and banking regulators. Recent committee hearings have revealed bipartisan support for certain provisions but ongoing debates about specific definitions and enforcement powers. Institutional Perspective on Regulatory Progress From an institutional investment standpoint, regulatory clarity serves as the foundation for broader market participation. D’Agostino’s comments reflect a growing consensus among traditional financial institutions that clear rules enable proper risk assessment and compliance frameworks. Major financial firms have increasingly allocated resources to digital asset divisions, with a 2024 survey showing 67% of institutional investors planning to increase their crypto exposure once comprehensive legislation passes. This institutional interest extends beyond trading to include: Custody solutions meeting traditional financial standards Portfolio diversification through regulated products Tokenization of traditional assets like real estate and bonds Cross-border settlement mechanisms reducing transaction costs The gradual legislative progress, while slower than some industry participants prefer, allows for thorough consideration of complex technical issues. This deliberate approach may ultimately produce more durable legislation that withstands technological evolution and market changes. Historical analysis of financial regulation shows that hastily drafted laws often require numerous amendments, creating additional uncertainty. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, for instance, underwent hundreds of regulatory adjustments in its first decade, demonstrating the challenges of implementing comprehensive financial reform. Legislative Timeline and Implementation Expectations The CLARITY Act has progressed through multiple congressional committees since its initial introduction, with significant revisions addressing stakeholder concerns. The current version incorporates feedback from industry participants, consumer advocates, and regulatory agencies. While D’Agostino acknowledged the lengthy process, he expressed understanding of the necessary deliberation for such foundational legislation. Congressional records show that the bill has garnered support from both sides of the aisle, though specific provisions remain subject to negotiation. Implementation will likely occur in phases, beginning with classification frameworks and registration requirements for existing market participants. Regulatory agencies will need to develop detailed rules based on legislative mandates, a process that typically takes 12-24 months following enactment. Industry transition periods will allow companies to adjust their operations to comply with new requirements. International coordination will also play a crucial role, as global standards continue to evolve through organizations like the Financial Stability Board and International Organization of Securities Commissions. Market impact studies suggest that comprehensive regulation could increase institutional investment by 40-60% within three years of implementation. This projection considers both direct crypto allocations and indirect exposure through regulated financial products. Additionally, clearer rules may reduce compliance costs for legitimate operators while increasing enforcement against fraudulent activities. The legislation’s consumer protection provisions aim to address common issues in crypto markets, including disclosure requirements, conflict of interest management, and custody safeguards. Conclusion The crypto market structure bill represents a watershed moment for digital asset regulation in the United States, with the CLARITY Act making measurable progress toward comprehensive legislation. John D’Agostino’s confirmation of positive momentum reflects growing institutional confidence in regulatory developments. While the bill’s complexity necessitates careful deliberation, its potential to provide clear rules could unlock significant institutional participation and innovation. As legislative processes continue through 2025, market participants should monitor committee developments while preparing for the implementation phase that will follow enactment. The ultimate success of the crypto market structure bill will depend on balanced regulation that protects consumers while fostering technological advancement and financial inclusion. FAQs Q1: What is the CLARITY Act? The CLARITY Act is proposed U.S. legislation establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets, including classification systems, exchange regulations, and consumer protections for cryptocurrency markets. Q2: How does the CLARITY Act differ from stablecoin regulation? While stablecoin bills like GENIUS focus specifically on dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, the CLARITY Act addresses the broader digital asset ecosystem including trading venues, custody arrangements, and diverse cryptocurrency types beyond stablecoins. Q3: Why is the market structure legislation taking longer than other crypto bills? The legislation’s comprehensive nature requires addressing multiple asset classes, regulatory jurisdictions, and technical considerations, making it substantially more complex than narrower bills focused on specific aspects like stablecoins or taxation. Q4: What impact might the CLARITY Act have on cryptocurrency prices? While legislation doesn’t directly determine prices, regulatory clarity typically reduces uncertainty premiums and may encourage institutional investment, potentially increasing market depth and stability over the long term. Q5: When could the CLARITY Act potentially become law? Based on current legislative progress and typical timelines for complex financial legislation, industry analysts suggest potential enactment in late 2025 or early 2026, with implementation occurring in phases over subsequent years.

Despite recent headlines proclaiming that large BTC wallets have been aggressively buying the dip, deeper blockchain data reveals a more nuanced reality. The head of research at the platform, Julius Moreno, cautioned that what appears to be whale accumulation is actually exchange-related activity inflating perceptions of buying. Exchanges frequently reorganize funds into other wallets, thereby increasing the number of wallets with massive balances . Moreno commented on X: “No, whales are not buying an enormous amount of Bitcoin. Most BTC whale data out there has been ‘affected’ by exchanges consolidating a lot of their holdings into fewer addresses with larger balances. This is why whales seem to have accumulated a lot of coins recently.” Blockchain analytics firms report that long-term Bitcoin holders — wallets that have held their BTC for extended periods — have shifted back into net distribution after a prolonged accumulation phase. The Coinbase executive comments come as sentiment among crypto market participants on social media has started the year strong, according to a Santiment analyst, who warned that further market upside depends on retail investors staying level-headed. “We need retail to continue to be a bit cautious, a bit pessimistic, a bit impatient,” Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan said in a video published to YouTube on Saturday. Despite other crypto sentiment indicators showing fear among market participants, Quinlivan said Santiment’s social media data points in the opposite direction. Moreno says Bitcoin is still distributing their assets instead of accumulating Moreno noted that adjusted data show that large holders are still in distribution mode, and not accumulation. The data also shows a continued drop in whale holdings, alongside falling balances among 100–1,000 BTC addresses, suggesting ETF outflows persist. Large holders typically make significant changes in the Bitcoin price; however, the market structure is adapting with the introduction of US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have become substantial market participants. Aside from questions about whale accumulation, sentiment among long-term BTC holders has improved, as indicated by other onchain metrics. According to Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck , long-term Bitcoin holders have once again begun buying after suffering the biggest selling period in years. The trend suggests that the recent selling pressure on BTC might be beginning to ease. The recovery of Bitcoin remains tentative, although downside pressure to date hasn’t forced prices back to the sub-$80,000 range seen in November. BTC is currently trading just above the $90,000 mark. Nonetheless, Bollinger Bands, a key volatility gauge, suggest that a major price swing may be imminent.TradingView data shows Bitcoin’s Bollinger Bands—the volatility bands set two standard deviations above and below the 20-day moving average—have tightened to under $3,500, the narrowest since July. Back in late July, a Bollinger Band squeeze capped a two-week consolidation between $115,000 and $120,000, marking the start of a three-month price expansion that ranged from $100,000 to $126,000. A similar pattern emerged in late February, with Bitcoin consolidating between $94,000 and $98,000 before a Bollinger Band squeeze preceded a decline to $80,000. Kim says Bitcoin will surpass $270,000 by February 2026 The social media predictor and self-proclaimed world’s smartest man, Kim, recently predicted that BTC could jump past $270,000 within a month next year. According to reports, the predictor cited both the growth and fragility of fiat currencies as reasons for his optimistic outlook, noting Bitcoin’s historical volatility and sensitivity to macroeconomic trends. The social media personality has made several Bitcoin forecasts in the past that have not held up. He predicted in November that Bitcoin would more than double to $220,000 within 45 days, pledging any future profits toward church construction, yet the price surge never materialized. In addition to his bullish calls, Kim said BTC could replace the US dollar by 2026, labeling the current low as a short-term, manipulation-driven discount.

56757837,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258132,1767419711,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Tether Investment in SQRIL Unlocks Revolutionary Real-Time QR Payment Solutions,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tether-invests-sqril-qr-payments/,"BitcoinWorld Tether Investment in SQRIL Unlocks Revolutionary Real-Time QR Payment Solutions In a strategic move poised to reshape global digital finance, Tether Operations Limited, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, has announced a significant investment in SQRIL, a pioneering real-time QR payment platform. This development, confirmed in early 2025, signals a major push to enhance stablecoin utility and streamline cross-border payment corridors, particularly in emerging markets across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. While the precise investment size remains undisclosed, industry analysts immediately recognized the deal’s potential to bridge traditional finance with blockchain-based solutions. Tether Investment Targets Global Payment Inefficiencies The Tether investment directly addresses longstanding friction in international money transfers. Consequently, SQRIL will deploy the capital to accelerate development of its QR-based infrastructure, which integrates digital asset settlement with familiar payment interfaces. This approach specifically targets regions where mobile penetration outpaces traditional banking access. Moreover, the partnership leverages Tether’s immense liquidity and settlement finality with SQRIL’s agile, region-specific payment rails. For context, cross-border remittance flows to low- and middle-income countries reached an estimated $656 billion in 2023, according to World Bank data. However, the average cost for sending $200 remained high at 6.4%. This Tether investment aims to disrupt that model by utilizing stablecoins for near-instant settlement, potentially slashing fees and transfer times. The collaboration represents a tangible step toward the financial inclusion goals often discussed within the cryptocurrency sector. The Mechanics of QR-Powered Stablecoin Payments SQRIL’s platform operates by generating dynamic QR codes for transactions. A merchant or individual displays a code, which a payer scans with a mobile app. Crucially, the system can settle the transaction using USDT or other digital assets on the backend, while displaying local currency values upfront. This process eliminates the need for users to understand blockchain complexities. Furthermore, it provides a seamless experience comparable to popular payment apps like Alipay or Paytm, but with a decentralized settlement layer. The technical architecture typically involves the following components: QR Code Generation: Creates a unique, time-sensitive code for each transaction. Stablecoin Gateway: Handles the conversion and transfer of USDT between parties. Local Currency Interface: Displays amounts in the user’s native fiat currency. Compliance Layer: Integrates necessary KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) checks. SQRIL’s Strategic Focus on Emerging Markets SQRIL has strategically concentrated its operations in regions with demonstrable need for innovative payment solutions. In Asia, countries like the Philippines and Vietnam see massive remittance inflows. Across Africa, nations such as Nigeria and Kenya exhibit robust mobile money adoption but face high costs for international transfers. Similarly, in Latin America, countries like Argentina and Venezuela grapple with currency volatility, making stablecoins an attractive alternative. The platform’s regional strategy is not accidental. These markets share common characteristics: a large unbanked or underbanked population, high smartphone usage, and existing familiarity with QR code payments through other services. By focusing here, SQRIL avoids direct, head-on competition with entrenched legacy systems in North America and Europe. Instead, it builds where infrastructure is still being defined. SQRIL’s Primary Operational Regions and Market Characteristics Region Key Markets Primary Use Case Existing Payment Landscape Southeast Asia Philippines, Vietnam Overseas Worker Remittances Strong mobile wallet adoption (e.g., GCash, MoMo) Africa Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana Cross-border trade, Remittances Dominant mobile money (e.g., M-Pesa), high remittance costs Latin America Argentina, Venezuela, Mexico Inflation Hedging, Dollar Access Widespread QR use, high crypto adoption Expert Analysis on the Partnership’s Impact Financial technology analysts view the Tether investment as a validation of the “crypto-for-payments” thesis, which had faced skepticism. “This is a pragmatic application of blockchain technology,” notes Dr. Lena Zhou, a fintech researcher at the Digital Finance Institute. “It uses stablecoins not as a speculative asset, but as a superior settlement medium. The QR code is simply the user-friendly bridge.” She emphasizes that success hinges on regulatory cooperation and seamless user experience, not just technological capability. Furthermore, the move aligns with Tether’s broader strategy of expanding USDT’s utility beyond trading pairs on cryptocurrency exchanges. In recent years, Tether has invested in renewable energy, Bitcoin mining, and educational initiatives. This investment in payment infrastructure represents a direct push into the consumer and merchant payment space. It also potentially insulates Tether’s business model from being solely dependent on exchange-based demand. The Evolution of Tether’s Business Strategy Tether’s decision to invest in SQRIL reflects a matured corporate strategy. Initially known almost exclusively for issuing USDT, the company has actively diversified its holdings and initiatives. This investment follows other strategic moves, such as allocating a portion of reserves into U.S. Treasury bills and supporting emerging market financial infrastructure. The goal appears to be building an ecosystem where USDT is the preferred medium of exchange for real-world transactions, thereby increasing its intrinsic utility and stability. From a market structure perspective, this could reduce systemic risk. If a significant volume of USDT circulates in daily payments rather than sitting on exchange order books, its liquidity becomes more organic and less prone to market sentiment swings. Additionally, it creates a powerful network effect: more merchants accepting USDT via QR codes increases its usefulness, which attracts more users, which in turn attracts more merchants. Regulatory Considerations and Future Roadmap Any expansion into payments invites regulatory scrutiny. SQRIL and Tether will need to navigate a complex patchwork of financial regulations across dozens of jurisdictions. Key areas of focus will include licensing as a money transmitter, adherence to strict AML/CFT (Combating the Financing of Terrorism) standards, and data privacy laws. The companies have indicated that a portion of the investment will fund legal and compliance teams to ensure local regulations are respected. The immediate roadmap for SQRIL involves scaling its merchant onboarding in pilot cities, enhancing platform stability for higher transaction volumes, and integrating with additional local banking and mobile money partners. Long-term, the vision includes enabling micro-payments for services and creating programmable payment flows for businesses, all accessible through a simple QR scan. Conclusion The Tether investment in SQRIL marks a pivotal moment in the convergence of cryptocurrency and mainstream payments. By focusing on real-time QR payment solutions in underserved regions, the partnership tackles genuine economic pain points related to cost and speed in cross-border transactions. This move strategically expands the utility of the USDT stablecoin beyond digital asset trading into the fabric of everyday commerce. Ultimately, the success of this initiative will be measured by its adoption among merchants and consumers, its resilience under regulatory pressure, and its tangible impact on reducing the cost of moving value across borders. The deal underscores a clear trend: the future of finance may not be built by displacing existing systems entirely, but by seamlessly integrating efficient digital asset settlement into the payment tools people already use. FAQs Q1: What is SQRIL and what does it do? SQRIL is a financial technology platform that enables real-time payments using QR codes. It specializes in cross-border transactions and plans to use Tether’s investment to integrate stablecoin settlement, aiming to make international transfers faster and cheaper. Q2: Why did Tether invest in a QR payment platform? Tether invested to increase the real-world utility and adoption of its USDT stablecoin. By powering everyday payments and remittances, Tether moves beyond being primarily a trading asset on crypto exchanges and embeds itself into practical financial infrastructure.

56757993,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258131,1767420012,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto Futures Liquidations: The Staggering $250M Short Squeeze That Rocked Markets,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-futures-liquidations-short-squeeze/,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Futures Liquidations: The Staggering $250M Short Squeeze That Rocked Markets Global cryptocurrency markets witnessed a dramatic cascade of liquidations totaling approximately $250 million over a critical 24-hour period, with short positions bearing the overwhelming brunt of the losses. This substantial crypto futures liquidations event represents one of the most significant short squeeze scenarios in recent months, highlighting the inherent volatility and leverage risks within digital asset derivatives markets. According to comprehensive data from leading analytics platforms, Ethereum (ETH) led the liquidation wave with $120 million, followed closely by Bitcoin (BTC) at $108 million, while Solana (SOL) experienced $21.95 million in forced position closures. Crypto Futures Liquidations: Understanding the Market Mechanics The recent $250 million crypto futures liquidations event provides a textbook example of market dynamics in leveraged trading environments. Perpetual futures contracts, which dominate cryptocurrency derivatives trading, allow traders to use significant leverage—often 10x to 100x their initial capital. Consequently, even relatively modest price movements can trigger automatic position closures when maintenance margin requirements fail. Market analysts note that this particular liquidation wave occurred during a period of unexpected bullish momentum across major digital assets. The resulting short squeeze forced cascading position closures as prices moved against traders betting on declines. Derivatives markets serve crucial functions for price discovery and risk management. However, they also amplify volatility through leverage effects. When numerous traders hold similar directional positions with high leverage, the market becomes vulnerable to liquidation cascades. These events typically unfold rapidly as initial liquidations create additional selling or buying pressure. This pressure then triggers further liquidations in a self-reinforcing cycle. The cryptocurrency market’s 24/7 operation means these events can develop at any time, often catching traders off guard during low-liquidity periods. The Anatomy of a Short Squeeze A short squeeze represents a specific market condition where traders who have sold assets expecting price declines must urgently buy them back to cover their positions. This covering activity creates additional upward buying pressure, which then forces more short positions to liquidate. The resulting feedback loop can produce rapid, dramatic price increases. Historical data from traditional finance shows similar patterns in equity markets, though cryptocurrency markets exhibit amplified effects due to higher leverage availability and continuous trading. Ethereum Leads With $120 Million in Liquidations Ethereum’s derivatives market experienced the most substantial impact during this crypto futures liquidations event, with $120 million in positions forcibly closed. Remarkably, short positions accounted for 89.48% of these liquidations, indicating overwhelming directional consensus among leveraged traders. This percentage translates to approximately $107.38 million in short positions liquidated against just $12.62 million in long positions. The disparity highlights how market sentiment had become excessively bearish on Ethereum before the price movement that triggered the squeeze. Several factors contributed to Ethereum’s prominent role in this liquidation event. First, Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization with exceptionally deep derivatives markets. Second, ongoing network upgrades and regulatory developments create uncertainty that encourages leveraged positioning. Third, Ethereum’s correlation with broader cryptocurrency markets means it often moves in tandem with Bitcoin while exhibiting higher beta characteristics. Traders frequently use Ethereum futures for directional bets on the altcoin market’s overall health. Total Ethereum Liquidations: $120 million Short Position Percentage: 89.48% ($107.38M) Long Position Percentage: 10.52% ($12.62M) Primary Exchanges: Binance, Bybit, OKX, and Deribit The concentration of liquidations across specific price levels reveals important market structure information. Order book data indicates that liquidation clusters occurred near key technical resistance levels that many traders expected to hold. When these levels broke, stop-loss orders and forced liquidations created a vacuum of selling pressure that accelerated the upward move. This pattern demonstrates how derivatives markets can influence spot prices during periods of high leverage utilization. Bitcoin’s $108 Million Liquidation Event Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, witnessed $108 million in crypto futures liquidations during the same 24-hour window. Short positions comprised 83.95% of this total, representing approximately $90.67 million against $17.33 million in long liquidations. While Bitcoin’s percentage of short liquidations was slightly lower than Ethereum’s, the absolute dollar amount remained substantial due to Bitcoin’s larger market size. This event underscores Bitcoin’s continued dominance in derivatives trading volume despite growing altcoin markets. Bitcoin’s liquidation patterns often differ from altcoins due to its unique market characteristics. Institutional participation in Bitcoin derivatives has grown significantly in recent years through regulated products like CME Bitcoin futures. However, the majority of high-leverage trading still occurs on offshore exchanges. The recent liquidations primarily affected these offshore markets, where leverage limits often exceed 100x. Market structure analysis reveals that Bitcoin liquidations frequently cluster around round-number psychological price levels, such as $60,000 or $70,000 thresholds. Bitcoin vs. Ethereum Liquidation Comparison Metric Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Total Liquidations $108 million $120 million Short Percentage 83.95% 89.48% Short Value $90.67M $107.38M Long Value $17.33M $12.62M Market Cap Rank #1 #2 The timing of Bitcoin’s liquidations relative to Ethereum’s provides insights into market leadership dynamics. In traditional cryptocurrency market cycles, Bitcoin typically leads price movements with altcoins following. However, in this particular event, Ethereum’s liquidations slightly led Bitcoin’s in both timing and intensity. This pattern suggests evolving market relationships where major altcoins increasingly influence broader sentiment rather than simply reacting to Bitcoin movements. Solana’s $21.95 Million Liquidation Surge Solana experienced $21.95 million in crypto futures liquidations, with short positions representing a staggering 91.05% of the total. This percentage translates to approximately $19.98 million in short liquidations versus just $1.97 million in long liquidations. Solana’s exceptionally high short liquidation percentage reflects its status as a higher-volatility asset that attracts substantial speculative trading. The network’s rapid growth and technical innovations have made it a favorite among derivatives traders seeking amplified returns. Several unique factors contributed to Solana’s disproportionate short liquidation percentage. First, Solana’s derivatives markets have grown exponentially alongside its spot market expansion. Second, the asset’s historical volatility exceeds both Bitcoin and Ethereum, creating more frequent liquidation events. Third, Solana’s correlation with broader cryptocurrency markets varies more significantly than established assets, creating additional basis risk that can surprise leveraged traders. Finally, Solana’s smaller market capitalization means individual large positions can disproportionately impact prices and trigger cascading liquidations. Market Impact and Recovery Patterns The immediate market impact of these crypto futures liquidations included increased volatility and temporary price dislocations across affected assets. However, markets typically absorb liquidation events within hours or days as liquidity returns and equilibrium reestablishes. Historical analysis shows that post-liquidation periods often feature reduced leverage in the system as risk-averse traders decrease positions. This deleveraging can create calmer trading conditions temporarily before leverage gradually rebuilds. The funding rates on perpetual contracts typically normalize after such events, though they may remain elevated if directional sentiment persists strongly. Historical Context and Comparative Analysis The $250 million crypto futures liquidations event, while substantial, represents a moderate-sized liquidation wave compared to historical extremes. During previous market cycles, single-day liquidation totals have exceeded $1 billion multiple times. For instance, the May 2021 market correction triggered approximately $8.6 billion in liquidations within 24 hours. Similarly, the November 2022 FTX collapse precipitated over $1 billion in daily liquidations. These comparisons provide important perspective on the relative scale of market stress. Nevertheless, the recent event’s significance lies in its composition rather than absolute size. The extreme concentration in short liquidations—exceeding 83% across all major assets—indicates a market caught leaning heavily in one direction. Such lopsided positioning often precedes trend reversals or accelerated moves as crowded trades unwind. Market technicians refer to this as “contrarian indicator” conditions, where extreme sentiment readings suggest impending mean reversion. The cryptocurrency market’s history contains numerous examples of similar setups preceding substantial price movements. May 2021: $8.6 billion liquidations during China mining ban announcement November 2022: $1+ billion liquidations during FTX collapse March 2020: $1+ billion liquidations during COVID market crash June 2022: $800+ million liquidations during Celsius crisis The increasing sophistication of cryptocurrency derivatives markets has changed liquidation dynamics over time. Early markets featured simpler mechanisms with fewer safeguards, leading to more frequent and severe cascades. Modern exchanges implement circuit breakers, auto-deleveraging systems, and insurance funds to mitigate extreme events. However, as trading volumes and leverage availability have grown, the absolute dollar amounts at risk have increased correspondingly. This evolution represents the natural maturation of financial markets as they scale. Risk Management Implications for Traders The recent crypto futures liquidations event offers crucial lessons for risk management in leveraged trading. First, position sizing relative to account equity becomes paramount during volatile conditions. Traders using excessive leverage relative to their risk tolerance frequently become liquidation candidates during normal market fluctuations. Second, diversification across assets and position directions provides some protection against single-direction liquidation events. Third, monitoring funding rates and open interest can provide early warning signals of crowded positioning that might precede squeezes. Advanced traders employ several strategies to navigate high-leverage environments. These include using stop-loss orders judiciously (while recognizing they can exacerbate moves during illiquid periods), maintaining adequate margin buffers above exchange requirements, and avoiding maximum leverage even when available. Some institutional traders utilize options strategies to hedge leveraged futures positions, creating defined-risk exposures. The growing availability of cryptocurrency options markets has facilitated more sophisticated risk management approaches in recent years. Exchange Mechanisms and Safeguards Cryptocurrency exchanges employ various mechanisms to handle liquidations while maintaining market integrity. Most platforms use a mark price system that averages prices across major exchanges to prevent manipulation through isolated price spikes. When positions reach maintenance margin thresholds, exchanges typically attempt to close them through their order matching systems. If insufficient liquidity exists at reasonable prices, some exchanges trigger auto-deleveraging (ADL) systems that close opposing profitable positions to cover losses. More sophisticated platforms maintain insurance funds accumulated from liquidation fees to cover deficits without ADL. Regulatory Considerations and Market Evolution The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency derivatives continues evolving across jurisdictions. Some regions have implemented leverage limits for retail traders, while others prohibit derivatives entirely for non-accredited investors. These regulatory developments aim to protect consumers from the risks demonstrated by liquidation events. However, they also create fragmentation as traders migrate to less-regulated venues. The ongoing tension between innovation and protection represents a central challenge for policymakers worldwide. Market structure evolution will likely continue addressing liquidation risks through technological improvements. Decentralized derivatives protocols offer alternative approaches using automated market makers and on-chain liquidation mechanisms. While currently smaller than centralized exchange volumes, these decentralized platforms provide different risk profiles and transparency benefits. Their growth could eventually reduce systemic risks from concentrated liquidation events by distributing exposure across multiple venues and mechanisms. Conclusion The recent $250 million crypto futures liquidations event highlights the ongoing risks and dynamics of leveraged cryptocurrency trading. With short positions accounting for the overwhelming majority of losses across Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana markets, this episode demonstrates how crowded positioning can precipitate rapid reversals. These crypto futures liquidations serve as a reminder that derivatives markets both reflect and amplify underlying spot market movements. As cryptocurrency markets mature, understanding liquidation mechanics becomes increasingly important for all participants—from retail traders to institutional investors. While such events create short-term volatility, they also contribute to market efficiency by removing excessive leverage and resetting sentiment extremes. FAQs Q1: What causes crypto futures liquidations? Liquidations occur when a trader’s margin balance falls below the maintenance requirement for their leveraged position. Exchanges automatically close these positions to prevent negative balances, often creating cascading effects when many traders hold similar positions. Q2: Why were short positions disproportionately affected in this event? Short positions faced massive liquidations because prices moved upward against traders betting on declines. This created a short squeeze where covering positions added buying pressure, forcing more liquidations in a self-reinforcing cycle. Q3: How do crypto futures liquidations impact spot prices? Liquidations can significantly impact spot prices through several mechanisms. Forced buying to cover short positions increases demand, while forced selling of long positions increases supply. These flows can create temporary price dislocations and increased volatility. Q4: What percentage of traders typically experience liquidations? Exact percentages vary by market conditions, but industry estimates suggest approximately 70-90% of retail leveraged traders eventually experience at least one liquidation event, highlighting the risks of trading with high leverage. Q5: How can traders avoid futures liquidations? Traders can mitigate liquidation risks through proper position sizing, maintaining adequate margin buffers, using stop-loss orders strategically, avoiding maximum available leverage, and monitoring market conditions for signs of crowded positioning.

Related Reading: Ethereum Optimism For 2026: Analysts Share Bullish Forecast Despite Disappointing End-Of-Year Bitcoin Records Least Volatile Year On Friday, K33 Research data revealed that Bitcoin has recorded the least volatile year in the asset’s history. According to the chart, the flagship cryptocurrency saw its lowest volatility level, measured by the average deviation of daily returns, in 2025, hitting just 2.24%. The recent data shows that BTC fell below the previous lowest year on record, 2023, which registered 2.30% volatility. Moreover, it’s annual volatility has also ended below the 3% mark over the past three years, its lowest levels since 2016. This signals a “clear” diminishing trend, K33 Research noted, as Bitcoin’s volatility has been trending lower year by year, suggesting growing market maturity and stabilizing price action. Crypto trader Niels highlighted that “for the first time, BTC recorded its lowest annual volatility on record, lower than every cycle before it, including the early ‘wild west’ years and the post-ETF era.” As he explained, 2025 was “the calmest year in Bitcoin’s history” despite all the price movements of the years, including the Q4 daily corrections, which saw the flagship crypto retrace up to 16% in a single day. It’s worth noting that BTC’s deepest correction in 2025 saw the cryptocurrency drop nearly 36% in a two-month period, while previous cycles’ corrections recorded retraces of more than 50% during similar periods. Previously, Nic Carter addressed the negative sentiment brewing around Bitcoin and the broader market. He detailed that the market could be considered “boring” now because most of the questions that drove the historical volatility have been answered. Carter also asserted that the space matured significantly with “more serious businesses (…), [and] less chaos” in the industry. The Start Of The ‘Institutional Era’ In his X post, Niels also pointed out that the diminishing trend in Bitcoin volatility was fueled by the massive institutional participation, calling for “More capital. More long-term holders. More institutional participation. [and] Less emotional trading” for the future. Similarly, Bitwise’s CEO, Hunter Horsley has affirmed that the overall crypto market was changing, driven by the significant decrease in regulatory risk, which has led to last year’s spike in institutional adoption and mainstream recognition. Notably, the market saw the second of wave of crypto Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) go live, with funds based on altcoins like Solana (SOL) and XRP breaking multiple records. In addition, the Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) trend, led by Strategy’s Bitcoin purchases, poured billions of dollars into cryptocurrencies in 2025.

He noted that rising demand for alternative stores of value and progress on bipartisan US crypto market structure legislation could drive Bitcoin to new highs in the first half of the year.

In a recent interview with Robert Pickering on the Allin Crypto podcast, he argued that those documents reveal how large financial institutions already value certain blockchain protocols. His focus stayed firmly on XRP and its utility. SMQKE drew the community’s attention to this interview on X, writing, “Why the value of XRP will be ‘incomprehensibly high.’” He said the answer sits inside documented institutional research. The interview walked through that material step by step, with XRP presented as a core infrastructure asset rather than a speculative asset . Why the value of XRP will be “incomprehensibly high.” Answered in the video below. With documentation of course. https://t.co/JRkoDVtkZK — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) December 31, 2025 Institutional Research and Protocol Valuation SMQKE anchored much of the discussion to a July 2025 Franklin Templeton paper authored by Sandy Kaul, the firm’s Head of Innovation. The document explored how blockchain protocols differ from early internet protocols. TCP/IP and HTTP reshaped the global economy but never carried direct financial value. Blockchain networks do. The paper argued that if investors had been able to own early internet protocols, the wealth creation would have been extreme. SMQKE highlighted a phrase describing modern protocol value as “incomprehensibly high.” He said native tokens enable monetization of infrastructure. XRP is treated as a protocol asset, with institutions analyzing it as a settlement layer . XRP’s Role as a Global Value Transfer Layer According to SMQKE, Ripple’s documents position XRP as a scalable layer for value transfer. Moving trillions across global markets needs more than speed. It needs deep liquidity and a high unit price . Low-priced assets create slippage at scale. XRP’s design addresses that limit. He added that if XRP becomes central to global settlement, demand must rise. SMQKE also cited regulatory clarity, saying institutions favor assets with clear legal status and operational compliance. This positioning aligns with institutional settlement requirements worldwide today. Regulation, ETFs, and Market Structure The conversation also addressed shifts in market structure. SMQKE said the traditional 4-year crypto cycle no longer reflects reality. Institutional ETFs, sovereign capital, and tokenized assets operate on continuous timelines. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He attributed recent market weakness to macro disruptions rather than failing fundamentals. He expects XRP to benefit as regulated products expand. SMQKE also suggested that XRP sits behind Bitcoin and Ethereum as a candidate for deeper institutional exposure. He emphasized use cases, not narratives, as the deciding factor. A Utility-Driven Outlook for 2026 Looking ahead, SMQKE described 2025 as a regulatory checkpoint. He expects 2026 to mark widespread utilization. He warned that speculative tokens without compliance face declining relevance, as institutions focus on ISO 20022 alignment and legal certainty. For XRP, SMQKE’s conclusion remained consistent. Value follows function, and documentation already reflects that belief.

This analysis provides a detailed, evidence-based HEX price prediction for 2026 through 2030, examining the complex factors that could influence its path toward the symbolic $1 threshold. Market data from Q1 2025 indicates a renewed focus on tokenomics and real-world utility, setting a critical context for any long-term forecast. HEX Price Prediction: Foundational Analysis and 2026 Outlook Any credible price prediction must begin with a clear understanding of the asset’s fundamentals. HEX, launched in 2019, operates as a certificate of deposit on the Ethereum blockchain. Its unique staking mechanism, designed to incentivize long-term holding, directly influences its circulating supply and market dynamics. Consequently, analyst reports from firms like IntoTheBlock frequently highlight on-chain metrics such as active address growth and stake maturity profiles as primary indicators. For the 2026 horizon, projections must account for several macroeconomic and sector-specific variables. First, broader adoption of Ethereum’s ongoing scalability upgrades could reduce transaction costs for HEX interactions. Second, regulatory clarity expected by 2026 will significantly impact all crypto assets. Based on historical volatility patterns and supply shock models from staking unlocks, a realistic 2026 price range considers both bullish adoption scenarios and bearish regulatory pressures. Market technicians often reference key resistance levels from previous cycles when formulating these targets. Evaluating the Path from 2027 to 2030 The journey toward 2030 introduces longer-term technological and adoption trends. The integration of blockchain technology into traditional finance, often called Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs), could create new utility corridors for assets like HEX. Furthermore, the potential for HEX’s codebase to be utilized in other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols may affect its demand. A comparison of key value drivers is essential for this period. Key Value Drivers for HEX (2027-2030) Driver Potential Positive Impact Potential Negative Impact Ethereum Ecosystem Growth Increased network security and user base. High congestion and fees if scaling lags. Staking Adoption Rate Reduced sell-side pressure from long-term stakes. Liquidity crunch if too much supply is locked. Regulatory Environment Clarity could spur institutional interest. Restrictive policies could limit access or utility. Broader Crypto Market Cycles Bull market could lift all asset prices. Extended bear market could suppress growth. Therefore, a 2030 prediction is not a single price point but a spectrum of possibilities defined by these interacting forces. Analysts from platforms like Coin Bureau emphasize that achieving a $1 valuation would require a substantial increase in market capitalization, demanding significant new capital inflow and sustained utility. Expert Insights on Market Psychology and Valuation Models Financial experts specializing in crypto assets, such as those cited in Bloomberg Crypto reports, often apply modified stock-to-flow models or network value-to-transaction ratios to projects like HEX. However, they caution that these models are highly sensitive to assumptions about user growth. The psychological significance of a $1 price target acts as both a magnet for retail interest and a major technical resistance level. Historical data shows that assets breaking such round-number milestones often experience increased volatility and media attention, which can become self-reinforcing cycles. Critical Risks and Considerations for Long-Term Forecasts While exploring potential highs, a responsible analysis must address inherent risks. The cryptocurrency sector remains susceptible to black swan events, technological disruptions, and paradigm shifts in investor sentiment. For instance, the emergence of a superior staking mechanism on another blockchain could divert attention and capital. Additionally, the project’s dependence on a single founder for direction and communication presents a centralization risk often noted in community governance assessments. Investors should weigh these factors against the potential rewards. Smart Contract Risk: Despite audits, undiscovered vulnerabilities remain a threat to all DeFi projects. Competitive Landscape: Newer projects with similar yields may fragment market share. Liquidity Risk: High staking participation can sometimes lead to low immediate liquidity on exchanges. Regulatory Uncertainty: Changing laws regarding staking rewards could alter the fundamental value proposition. These considerations are not unique to HEX but are magnified in long-term forecasting. Due diligence remains the cornerstone of any investment strategy. Conclusion This HEX price prediction for 2026-2030 illustrates a journey defined by technological integration, regulatory evolution, and market adoption. The path to a $1 price target is theoretically possible but fraught with significant challenges requiring favorable alignment of multiple complex factors. Ultimately, the future valuation of HEX, like all cryptocurrencies, will be determined by its proven utility, network security, and ability to attract sustained use within the broader digital economy. Investors should prioritize rigorous research and risk management over speculative price targets. FAQs Q1: What is the main utility of the HEX cryptocurrency? HEX primarily functions as a blockchain-based certificate of deposit. Users stake their HEX tokens for chosen time periods to earn interest, with the system designed to reward longer-term staking. Q2: What key factor could most help HEX reach a $1 valuation? Sustained, large-scale adoption of its staking mechanism combined with a significant increase in the overall user base and total value locked in its contract would be critical. Integration into broader DeFi ecosystems could also provide substantial demand pressure. Q3: How does the broader crypto market cycle affect HEX’s price prediction? HEX has historically shown correlation with major market cycles. A prolonged bull market in Bitcoin and Ethereum could provide a rising tide that lifts interest and capital flow into alternative assets like HEX, while a bear market would likely present a major headwind. Q4: Are there any direct competitors to HEX’s model? Yes, several other projects offer time-based staking or locking mechanisms with yield rewards. The competitive landscape is dynamic, with new projects frequently launching variations on proof-of-stake and liquid staking models. Q5: Why is the $1 price level considered psychologically important? Round numbers like $1 often serve as key mental benchmarks for investors. They can act as strong resistance levels on price charts and, if broken, can trigger increased buying activity and media coverage, potentially fueling further momentum.

Turkmenistan’s Crypto Legislation Now In Effect As reported by Associated Press, the Asian nation of Turkmenistan officially recognized mining and exchanging cryptocurrency as legal on Thursday. The move comes after President Serdar Berdymukhamedov signed a law back in November, which allowed crypto companies to obtain registration starting January 1st. Located in Central Asia, Turkmenistan was a constituent republic of the Soviet Union before gaining independence following the USSR’s dissolution in 1991. Today, the country is considered as one of the world’s most isolated, due to strict state control over media, internet access, and foreign business activity. Home to a population of over seven million, Turkmenistan’s economy is dependent on its natural gas reserves, which rank as the fifth largest in the world. China is its main customer at the moment, with a pipeline project aimed at supplying gas to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India in the works. For a nation known for tight state control, the move to embrace crypto marks a notable shift. Though, while the country is now open to mining firms and exchanges, it still hasn’t legalized digital assets as a form of payment, currency, or security. Turkmenistan isn’t the only Central Asian nation to have made developments related to the digital asset sector recently. Uzbekistan, located north of Turkmenistan, signed on an initiative related to stablecoin payments in November, approving a regulatory sandbox launch for January 1st. Elsewhere in the region, Iran has taken an even bolder approach, offering to sell advanced weapons systems to foreign governments for crypto, according to a report from Financial Times. The nation is willing to exchange ballistic missiles, drones, and warships for digital assets in a bid to bypass western financial controls, per the report. Bitcoin Has Been Stuck In Consolidation Recently While nations move forward with crypto regulation, the market has been stuck in a phase of consolidation lately, with the Bitcoin price unable to settle on a direction. As the below chart shows, BTC has been ranging between $85,000 and $90,000 during the last couple of weeks. The market slowdown has naturally not been restricted to just Bitcoin; the altcoins have also faced stale price action. Ethereum, for example, has positive returns of over 2% in the past month, which are not too different from BTC’s small decline of 2%. Over the past day, Bitcoin has once again climbed toward the upper end of the range, with its price currently trading around $89,500. Considering the recent pattern, it’s possible that this recovery effort may also fizzle out, but it only remains to be seen how things will play out in the coming days.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto exchanges|crypto mining|Turkmenistan|Turkmenistan Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-03 07:00:17

After a tumultuous period, total market capitalization has surged back above $3 trillion. However, many investors are left wondering what the new year has in store for digital assets. Institutions Forecast Bullish Crypto Prices For 2026 According to a recent report by analysts at Bull Theory, the past year proved to be robust for traditional markets, particularly for metals, while cryptocurrencies fell short of expectations. Silver surged by 160%, and gold followed suit with a 66% increase. In contrast, Bitcoin (BTC) wrapped up 2025 down approximately 5%, despite several positive indicators, such as consistent purchasing by Strategy, strong inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and growing institutional interest. Related Reading: Is The Dogecoin Bottom In? 3 Analysts Break Down the Charts Yet, when one asset class lags significantly while liquidity remains abundant, historical trends show that the gap typically narrows. In terms of specific projections, various major institutions and prominent investors have offered their forecasts for both Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH). Standard Chartered targets Bitcoin to reach $150,000 by the end of 2026, and JPMorgan projects a price of $170,000. Meanwhile, Citi’s base case stands around $143,000, with a more aggressive bull case suggesting a potential rise to $189,000. Cathie Wood of ARK Invest envisions a long-term scenario where Bitcoin could hit $500,000, contingent on widespread institutional adoption. Tom Lee from Fundstrat anticipates Ethereum will trade between $7,000 and $9,000 by early 2026, fueled by the tokenization of real-world assets. New Regulations And Economic Optimism The analysts further highlighted that, unlike previous years, this cycle looks distinct in several key aspects. For one, crypto is no longer encumbered by operating within a legal gray area. New regulatory frameworks, particularly in the US, are poised to offer clearer guidelines, reducing uncertainty and facilitating easier access for institutional investors. The anticipated changes aim for simplified regulations that could enhance market structure while broadening institutional participation beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Moreover, several factors suggest that a sharp movement in the crypto markets could be on the horizon. The end of quantitative tightening on December 1, 2025, coupled with a growing GDP, signals a conducive environment for crypto. Related Reading: Dogecoin Long-Term Bullish Structure Still In Play And Will Cross $10 With inflation stabilized below 3% and unemployment at 4.6%, there are indications that the Federal Reserve (Fed) may adopt a more dovish stance, especially with a new Fed Chair expected to take office in May 2026. Overall, as the new year begins, the crypto market finds itself in a position of underperformance rather than excess. This contrasting state often results in rapid repricings as gaps are closed in response to liquidity alignment. As a result, Bull Theory analysts believe that 2026 could very well be the year when these disparities start to correct, leading to a potentially bullish environment for cryptocurrencies.

Crypto pundit Mason Versluis (@MasonVersluis) offered a theory that reframed the move as intentional rather than organic. The rally happened after prolonged frustration among holders and observers. XRP had failed to meet expectations despite previous recoveries. Many questioned whether the asset could still reach its former highs. That uncertainty weighed on market sentiment and investor participation. The sudden reversal disrupted that mood. My theory on Ripple + $XRP manipulation: The market controllers of XRP saw that the community of holders and larger crypto community were complaining a lot about not hitting all time high again… They purposely pumped it back up to all time high, just to prove to the ones who… pic.twitter.com/VLYSJz3fRo — MASON VERSLUIS (@MasonVersluis) December 31, 2025 Intentional XRP Price Action Versluis argued that XRP’s rise back to all-time high levels served a deliberate purpose. He suggested that market controllers pushed the price upward to prove continued influence over XRP’s price behavior. According to his view, the move targeted those watching closely rather than casual traders. He emphasized the importance of morale. XRP hit a new all-time high in July 2025 . Versluis stated that if it had not reached $3 or higher again, sentiment would be significantly worse in 2025. The rally prevented that outcome and restored the belief that XRP remains capable of rapid upside movement . Versluis described the move as proof that XRP can still “rocket out of nowhere.” It also reinforced the idea that long periods of suppression do not eliminate the possibility of sudden repricing. Why the $3+ Return Carries Weight Reaching above $3 mattered regardless of how long XRP stayed there. Markets respond to the asset’s demonstrated capability. XRP proves it can still attract large capital inflows in a short window, and the amazing performance of spot XRP ETFs reinforces that belief. These developments change how risk is assessed. They also challenged entrenched assumptions. XRP had spent years below its peak. Critics viewed that stagnation as permanent. The rally forced a reassessment. It showed that liquidity remains available and responsive. XRP positions itself around speed and scale. An asset designed for large transactions must demonstrate its ability to move decisively. The rally provided that evidence.

Confidence improved, attention returned, and trading activity increased. These factors strengthen market structure. Speculative markets reward relevance, and assets that fall out of rotation lose liquidity and participation. XRP avoided that outcome, as the return to over $3 kept it in the spotlight. The asset’s long-term performance will still depend on adoption, regulation, and real-world use. Price alone does not deliver utility. However, price action sustains engagement while those developments progress. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

More precisely, it skyrocketed from $1.86 to a three-week high of $2.05 before it faced some resistance but still stands above $2.00. This has helped the asset reclaim the fourth spot in terms of market capitalization from Binance Coin, which is up by a more modest 1% daily and 4.4% weekly. As a result, BNB’s market cap sits at $120 billion, while XRP’s has neared $122 billion. Naturally, the XRP Army rejoiced in this price revival as the asset was struggling sideways below $2.00 and even $1.90 for weeks. Cobb, one of the most vocal Ripple supporters, was quick to predict that the underlying asset won’t go below $2.00 again, even though it’s excruciatingly close to doing exactly that now. Analyst CW indicated that the XRP rocket had launched after the asset broke past the first resistance at $1.90. They added that the number of XRP short positions is quite slim, which shouldn’t be a problem for the asset to continue its run. On a more macro scale, CW explained that XRP’s Phase 4 has just begun. The analyst noted that breaking through the $3.65 July 2018 all-time high “is the top priority,” which could send the token even north. The next step of $XRP ‘s Phase 4 is beginning.

XRP Reclaims $2 Level in Early January Trading XRP climbed back above the $2 mark on Jan. 2, extending a late-week advance after several days of sideways movement. The token traded as high as about $2.05 during the session before easing slightly, according to CoinCodex data, marking its strongest price level since late December. XRP Price Breaks Above $2 on Jan. 2. Source: CoinCodex Earlier in the week, XRP moved within a narrow band between roughly $1.83 and $1.90. During that period, price action showed overlapping candles and limited follow-through, which pointed to consolidation rather than a clear trend. On Dec. 31, a brief dip toward the lower end of the range failed to hold, and price quickly recovered, suggesting short-term support remained intact. Structurally, the chart shows a transition from range-bound trading into a short-term breakout attempt. The $2 level now acts as a key reference point. Holding above it would keep the recent upside move intact, while a drop back below could place price back into the earlier consolidation zone. As of the latest reading, XRP traded near $2.03, with market capitalization around $123 billion and 24-hour volume close to $5.9 billion. Swiss Trader Points to $3.20 Flip as Key XRP Trigger In a post on X, trader Swiss, known as @swisstrader09, said XRP shows a “clean structure” on higher time frames, with the $2.10 level acting as the key line between continuation and further consolidation. XRP U.S. Dollar 3-Day Binance Chart. Source: swisstrader09 via X The TradingView chart shared by Swiss shows XRP breaking out of a descending trendline that guided price lower for several months. Price has now moved back into a former support and resistance band around $2.05–$2.10, highlighted as a decision zone. According to the chart, sustained trading above this area would signal a structural flip, rather than a short-lived bounce, following repeated rejections in late 2025. Swiss noted that confirmation remains necessary before taking action. The chart projects a potential move toward the $3.30–$3.40 region if XRP flips $2.10 into support and consolidates above it. That target aligns with a prior horizontal resistance zone from earlier market cycles. Until such confirmation appears, price action remains in a transition phase rather than a confirmed trend continuation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-03 07:27:43

While short-term gains seem unlikely for traders in XRP, other alternative crypto coins with long-term growth opportunities within the DeFi crypto sector are under consideration. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is in Presale Phase 7 priced at $0.04 presently, is one coin within this category. While most other cryptocurrencies are mere speculative instruments for traders, Mutuum Finance is developing a new-age lending and borrowing system. The project’s presale uses dynamic pricing, where the token costs higher with every new phase. Investors buying today are guaranteed a profit even before the MUTM token enters the open market. The presale stages increasing in price makes this DeFi crypto project conducive for early investors looking for the next big thing in the market. Ripple (XRP) Displays Weak Structure Looking at Ripple (XRP) from a high-timeframe standpoint, it can be observed that it now exhibits a weaker chart pattern, having created many bull traps. The price now finds itself back within the lower part of its channel and even breached it, leaving little space for an upside movement. Though a short-term rebound towards the middle part of its channel at levels of $2.3-$2.5 might not be difficult, overall technical analysis concludes that a possible scenario will find it retest levels of $1.7-$1.4 if another shakeout for BTC takes place. A new bull turn will require a confirmed close over $2.8, which has not happened yet, making only range trades feasible at the moment. Mutuum Finance Presale Traction While XRP has been displaying poor market performance, Mutuum Finance is making headlines as the best crypto to buy during its fast-paced presale. The project has breezed through Presale Phase 6, entering Presale Phase 7, which is also filling up fast. Presale Phase 7 is very crucial as it is the final stage where buyers can acquire MUTM for only $0.04, making it a standout DeFi crypto opportunity. Since the presale started, Mutuum Finance has accumulated $19.52 million, and the total number of MUTM token holders now reaches 18,650. The token price has already experienced a 300% appreciation in price compared to the Phase 1 price of $0.01. But analysts say this is just the beginning for this DeFi crypto. Here’s why: Buy-backs and Staking Buyback and staking in Mutuum Finance is intended to aid the MUTM coin by giving it a value-correlated presence in the market. From the revenue generated by the platform, a part will go toward the purchase of MUTM tokens available in the open market, which will then be redistributed to stakers. This rewards long-term commitment to the project to ensure more token growth. MUTM has become an attractive asset for investors who seek to enjoy the benefits of a DeFi crypto with inherent thrusts of value. Buying today at $0.04 means enjoying presale growth by the time MUTM hits $0.06 at launch, as well as additional gains as adoption grows post-launch and tokens buybacks build more value. Early analyst predictions say MUTM could reach $0.50-$1 shortly after launch. This puts current buyers in a position to reap 1150%-2400% gains. A $500 investment today could grow to as much as $12,500 if this growth materializes. However, waiting until MUTM goes live to buy could shrink this profit margin by $4500 to just $8000 assuming the investor catches the $0.06 listing price. MUTM’s presale rewards those who get in early. Protocol Resilience Mutuum Finance focuses on effective risk management. Each supported asset is assigned specific loan-to-value (LTV) limits and liquidation thresholds, adjusted based on asset volatility. Stable assets like ETH and USDT can have LTVs of up to 75% with an 80% liquidation threshold, while more volatile tokens are capped at around 40% LTV with tighter liquidation triggers. As a borrower, a $10,000 ETH deposit allows you to borrow up to $7,500, while still retaining full ownership of your ETH. This provides flexibility by allowing borrowers to access liquidity without selling their assets. If ETH later gains 100%, the borrower still benefits from that upside while having used the asset as collateral for a loan. Lenders, on the other hand, receive mtTokens minted 1:1 to their deposits. For instance, 10,000 USDC mints 10,000 mtUSDC. The mtUSDC then accrues yield, typically ranging between 10–15% APY. This structure creates a win-win situation for both lenders and borrowers. By ensuring the platform remains consistent and stable, Mutuum earns the trust of the users, which attracts higher levels of capital inflow, as well as consistent activity on the platform. The higher the level of confidence in the platform, the higher the level of use, which enhances the value of the token itself. In a season where Ripple (XRP) finds itself struggling to keep up, the clear choice for growth is Mutuum Finance, costing a mere $0.04 in Presale Phase 7. With a considerably large pot of $19.52 million in funding, 18,650 unique holders and a strong DeFi ecosystem, MUTM combines early-stage success with utility, making it the best crypto to buy right now.

56760741,https://cryptonews.com/?p=470004,1767426467,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/56760741.jpeg,Tom Lee Seeks Shareholder Approval to Expand BitMine Shares to 50B,https://cryptonews.com/news/tom-lee-seeks-shareholder-approval-to-expand-bitmine-shares-to-50b/,"Tom Lee, chairman of BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), has asked shareholders to approve a proposal that would dramatically expand the company’s authorized share count to 50 billion, up from its current limit of 500 million. Key Takeaways: Tom Lee wants BitMine to raise its authorized share limit to 50 billion to enable future stock splits as its valuation tracks Ethereum. BitMine shares jumped 14% after the proposal, reflecting investor support for keeping the stock affordable. The plan has split investors, with some voicing dilution concerns. In a video posted to YouTube on Friday , Lee described the move as a structural adjustment rather than an immediate issuance. “That doesn’t mean we’re issuing 50 billion shares,” he said, stressing that the proposal would simply raise the maximum number of shares the company is allowed to authorize. BitMine Shares Jump 14% as Tom Lee Flags Stock Split Risk Tied to Ether Investors appeared receptive, with BitMine shares climbing about 14% on Friday to trade near $30.93 by mid-afternoon in New York. Lee framed the proposal primarily as a way to prepare for future stock splits as BitMine’s valuation tracks the price of Ethereum. According to Lee, the company’s share price closely mirrors ether’s performance, creating the risk that BMNR could become prohibitively expensive for retail investors if ETH rallies sharply. “If ETH rises to $22,000, our stock could be around $500,” Lee said. Under more aggressive assumptions, including a scenario where Bitcoin climbs to $1 million and ETH reaches $250,000, Lee estimates BitMine’s shares could carry an implied price near $5,000. “Most people want shares to stay around $25,” he said, arguing that high nominal prices can deter participation regardless of fundamentals. BitMine has repositioned itself as the largest Ethereum-focused digital asset treasury, holding roughly 3.41% of ETH’s circulating supply. The company disclosed last week that it added another 44,463 ETH, bringing total holdings to more than 4.11 million ether. While BitMine still maintains some Bitcoin-related operations, its core strategy shifted in 2025 toward accumulating and staking ETH to generate yield. Lee said that if ether were to reach $250,000, BitMine would likely need to execute a 100-for-1 stock split to maintain a share price near $25. That scenario would require tens of billions of authorized shares, which the current structure does not allow. “We’re trying to get ahead of that,” he said. BitMine Share Expansion Plan Divides Investors Over Dilution Risk Not all investors are convinced. Reaction on social media has been mixed, with critics arguing that raising the authorized share limit could pave the way for dilution. Supporters counter that authorized shares are not the same as issued shares and that the proposal simply gives management flexibility as the company’s crypto-linked valuation evolves. Tom this looks fishy and ridiculous to authorize a higher share count because the stock might go to $500. You can do this next year when it isn’t in the gutter. That’s like someone thinking of what color lambo to buy when they’re a millionaire…while having $50 in the bank. — Singularity (@S1ngularity0) January 2, 2026 Shareholders have until Jan. 14 to vote on the proposal. As reported, BitMine plans to switch on its Made in America Validator Network in early 2026, aiming to earn staking yield from a $12 billion ETH hoard. Last week, the company said it now holds 4,110,525 Ether, a stash it values at about $12 billion, making it the largest publicly-disclosed Ethereum treasury and placing it among the biggest crypto balance sheets in the market.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/elon-musks-grok-says-ripple-cto-david-schwartz-is-satoshi-bitcoin-creator-heres-why/,"A well-known figure in the XRP community has placed an old mystery back into focus through a direct exchange with Elon Musk’s AI model, Grok. Vet (@Vet_XO), a validator on the XRP Ledger, posted an image containing four individuals who have appeared in past speculation around Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity (anonymous Bitcoin creator). He then asked Grok to remove everyone who isn’t Satoshi from the image. hey @grok remove everyone who is not satoshi from this image. pic.twitter.com/9bvTHWE2dH — Vet (@Vet_X0) January 2, 2026 Grok’s Opinion on Satoshi’s Identity The image featured David Schwartz, a prominent figure in the crypto space who recently announced that he would step down from his role as Chief Technology Officer at Ripple. Alongside Schwartz, it featured Hal Finney, a pioneering cryptographer and the first person to receive a Bitcoin transaction from its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. It also showed Nick Szabo, a computer scientist, legal scholar, and cryptographer known for his significant contributions to the development of digital currency and smart contracts. It also featured the late cybersecurity expert Dan Kaminsky, who was a renowned white-hat hacker and a prominent figure in the field of network security. Grok replied with an edited image that removed three people, leaving only David Schwartz, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer. For years, many in the crypto world have speculated that Schwartz is Satoshi , and Grok’s response has drawn renewed attention to these claims. Is Schwartz Really Satoshi? Vet rejected the outcome and challenged the reasoning behind it. He showed skepticism and pushed Grok to explain why it singled out Schwartz. Grok followed up with a clarification. The AI emphasized uncertainty and referenced existing narratives around Satoshi’s identity. Grok pointed to long-running speculation tied to Schwartz’s background . It referenced his early work in cryptography and distributed systems, including patents dating back to the late 1980s, as well as his role at Ripple. Grok also noted that Schwartz has publicly denied being Satoshi Nakamoto and has said he first learned about Bitcoin in 2011 . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why Schwartz Remains Part of the Theory David Schwartz remains part of Satoshi discussions largely due to public perception and the narratives circulating online. Community speculation often highlights high-profile crypto figures with leadership roles in major projects, and Schwartz fits that profile. His visibility on social media, participation in XRP Ledger development, and engagement with crypto debates give his name repeated exposure. Multiple notable figures have also directly and indirectly suggested that Schwartz is Nakamoto , and the speculation is unlikely to die soon.

The latest rejection came after reports emerged about several explosions felt across Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, which were linked to potential strikes by the United States. The cause has not been confirmed yet, but US President Donald Trump has repeatedly warned Venezuela of ground strikes, and deployed a navy task force in the Caribbean. Additionally, the BBC reported that the Trump administration was aware of the explosions today, but there’s no official statement yet. The CNN added that several areas of the city were left without power after the explosions, and agency journalists said they could hear the sound of an aircraft. Although the strikes have not been confirmed to be initiated by the US, BTC’s price felt the consequences immediately after the reports started to go live. The asset, which has been prone to experience enhanced volatility in times of attacks between different nations, stood at around $90,500 after it touched $91,000 yesterday. However, it dumped by over a grand within less than an hour following the first BBC and CNN reports and now sits at $89,500. BTCUSD Jan 3.

About 40% of the top 100 Bitcoin treasury firms are valued by the market at less than the net asset value of their BTC holdings, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net. At least 37 companies in the group now trade at discounts to NAV, a notable reversal from conditions seen in Q2 and Q3 2025 when the king coin was changing hands at all-time-high levels. During the first three quarters of the year, most treasury firms possessed sizable premiums and could issue equity above the value of their Bitcoin, raise capital, and buy more coins without immediate shareholder dilution. Nearly 200 public firms now hold more than 1 million Bitcoin collectively, valued at roughly $96 billion in 2026. Among the top 5 BTC DATs by holdings are Strategy , with 672,497 BTC, and MARA Holdings, which owns 53,250 coins. Twenty One Capital holds 43,514 Bitcoin, Metaplanet controls 35,102, and Bitcoin Standard Treasury holds 30,021. Is the Bitcoin DAT model a failure? mNAVs fall steeply When Michael Saylor’s software firm Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) began buying Bitcoin through convertible notes and equity, Bitcoin’s price was slightly above $11,000. Fast forward to 5 years later, an all-time-high value of $126,000 in October must have been a reason for MSTR shareholders to smile, but that wasn’t entirely the case. The model began to falter as equity valuations slipped and BTC prices tanked by over 30% in just three months, not to mention several firms like Strategy had bought the highs. Once stock prices fell below NAV, the business model of issuing new shares to buy Bitcoin became uneconomical, exposing firms to market pressure and investor criticism. A December report from BitcoinTreasuries.net showed that only one BTC treasury company, France-based The Blockchain Group, outperformed the S&P 500 in 2025, since the benchmark US stocks index returned 16% over the year. Every other treasury company was well behind the index, and about 60% of them spent more acquiring BTC than those holdings are currently worth. Pioneers Strategy traded at more than double the value of its Bitcoin last year, but its shares are now at a 17% discount to NAV. Smaller players like Sweden’s H100 Group trade at a 32% discount, Vanadi Coffee trades at a 61% discount to its BTC value, alongside five to six firms near parity, including Brazil-based OranjeBTC. Any modest equity selloff could push them below NAV and make them ripe for a takeover if Bitcoin’s price drop continues. Echoes of distress, delisting on MSCI, and DATs dubbed rug pulls Bitcoin treasuries are being blasted by some naysayers in the crypto community, who believe the companies’ buying spree led to a crypto market pull-down causality. “Every single one of these companies is simply a pump N dump rug pull on their common shareholders. And no, preferred equities won’t save your shitty scheme when you don’t have a profitable underlying business, will not save your shitty stock. You should avoid any company that calls itself a ‘DAT’ or ‘Bitcoin treasury company’. Bunch of scammers and idiots tbh,” complained one user on X. Some companies, seeing the whiplash of red mNAVs, are also stepping back, including Prenetics, a health-sciences firm that began buying Bitcoin in 2025. Cryptopolitan reported that it stopped adding coins on December 4 and will now focus on IM8, a nutritional supplement brand co-founded by former England football captain David Beckham. “We are making disciplined strategic decisions that reflect our experience as operators and our commitment to maximizing long-term shareholder value,” Danny Yeung, Prenetics’s chief executive officer, said in a press release. In other related news, index provider MSCI’s decision to exclude companies holding significant BTC reserves from its global benchmarks will be made on January 15. If the NYSE-listed company greenlights its exclusion, estimates from BTC for Corporations show the DATs would be forced to sell between $10 billion and $15 billion over a year. BTC for Corporations, a group advocating corporate Bitcoin adoption, held discussions with MSCI leadership before 2025 came to a close. “We had a very constructive conversation,” said George Mekhail, the group’s executive director.

Amid the cheers of the new year, the flagship cryptocurrency has once again retested the proven price resistance around $90,500, but the market still bears a sense of uncertainty. Related Reading: XRP Faces Strong Social Discontent—Is A 50% Bullish Reversal Just Around The Corner? Bitcoin Coinbase Premium To Rebound? In an X post on January 2, renowned analyst Burak Kesmeci shares an insightful analysis of the Bitcoin market following the asset’s positive start to 2026. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency has gained by almost 4% since the new year commenced two days ago. Amid the mild market euphoria, Kesmeci highlights a simultaneous rise in Coinbase premiums across the Bitcoin and Ethereum market suggesting the recent price gains are significantly influenced by US investors. For context, the Coinbase premium assesses how much more or less US investors are paying for an asset. It is a strong market indicator as US investors’ liquidity tends to heavily influence the global market. Despite the latest price gains, Kesmeci notes that Coinbase premiums for BTC and ETH still remain negative, suggesting the majority of US investors still remain cautious. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Grows As Altcoins Post Another Losing Year: Analyst Bitcoin Short-Term And Long-Term Triggers In predicting future price movements, Burak Kesmeci has also outlined some potential developments investors should watch out for. Using the simple moving average indicator, the market expert has identified certain price levels of importance to Bitcoin’s price trajectory. For a bullish trend to kick off in the short-term, Kesmeci explains that Bitcoin must maintain its current 50-day simple moving average (SMA50) above the present level at $89,415 for at least the next two days. Notably, a potential loss of this price level would suggest the present consolidation continues. Meanwhile, the seasoned analyst also expects a positive long-term trend to only develop when Bitcoin crosses above $101,000, which represents an intersection between the SMA365 and SMA111. This outlook underscores $101,000 as a major psychological and structural resistance, with a decisive break above it likely to restore Bitcoin’s bullish market structure after the extended correction observed in Q4 2025. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $89,520 following a 0.85% gain in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, daily trading volume is up by 11471%, representing buoyant market activity. Notably, Bitcoin’s market cap has climbed to $1.79 trillion, allowing the maiden cryptocurrency account for 58.6% of the total crypto market cap.

Adding that it was the kind of bill that was more foundational to the growth of crypto, or any real asset class, and emphasized that it therefore made sense for the process to take some time. The CLARITY Act, he said, was far more complicated than the GENIUS Act , the stablecoin legislation that was enacted into US law in July, as the two bills address different levels of the crypto ecosystem. While he conceded the Genius Act was “not simple, but transformative,” he added that it focused on areas such as stablecoin issuance and oversight, which are structurally easier to regulate than broader market structure bills that reshape how digital asset markets operate, interact with regulators, and protect investors. Talent flight pressures US lawmakers to advance crypto rules The comments came only a few weeks after White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks announced that the CLARITY Act could obtain approval as soon as January. Speaking on December 19, Sacks said the administration was now closer than ever to passing the groundbreaking crypto market structure legislation that President Trump had called for, and he believed lawmakers would get it done in January. D’Agostino also added that he was bullish on the CLARITY Act passing, citing greater global momentum to regulate cryptocurrency. He cited the European Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework and the United Arab Emirates’ own ongoing efforts to achieve regulatory clarity as signs of mounting pressure on the United States to act. He also acknowledged what he called an enormous exodus of talent from the US to other countries, and said such a trend could increase pressure on lawmakers to push through the CLARITY Act in 2026. Some of the urgency that was behind passing the Genius Act, he said, was designed to slow that drain of talent. Once lawmakers returned to session and were able to assess developments in the sector fully, D’Agostino said, a similar sense of urgency would arise, fueled by an anxiety that the United States would fall further behind in transformational technologies like artificial intelligence and blockchain. Delays in the Clarity Act deepen uncertainty in crypto markets CoinShares recently reported that crypto investment products experienced approximately $952 million in outflows during the week ending December 19, attributing the decline to delays in passing the CLARITY Act. The firm explained that prolonged regulatory uncertainty in the United States had led investors to become more cautious. At the same time, fears that large holders, often referred to as whales, would sell their assets had added to the pressure. According to CoinShares, this uncertainty has eroded confidence and led some investors to withdraw funds from crypto funds in the short term. At the same time, veteran trader Peter Brandt said the possible passage of the CLARITY Act was unlikely to cause a major move in Bitcoin’s price . He said the legislation was important and necessary for the long-term health of the crypto market, but he did not see it as a major global event. Brandt explained that while clearer rules could help the industry grow over time, the bill was not something that would suddenly change Bitcoin’s value or immediately push prices much higher or lower.

According to the Financial Times and follow-up coverage , the listings on Mindex’s export platform include items ranging from drones and air defense systems to warships and ballistic missiles. The move was reported in January 2026 and marks a clear change from past, quieter uses of digital assets. Accepting Crypto And Barter To Avoid Banking Limits Based on reports, Mindex has placed offers that mention cryptocurrency, Iranian rial, and barter as possible forms of payment. The listings encourage potential buyers to contact Iranian officials to negotiate contracts. Sanctions from the US, the UK and the EU have shut many conventional payment routes, and Iranian officials appear to be using multiple channels — crypto among them — to keep export deals moving. Listings Include Broad Array Of Hardware Mindex’s catalogue, as described by multiple outlets, lists equipment across a wide spectrum: small arms and ammunition, drones, missiles, air defense systems, and naval vessels. Reports say Mindex claims commercial ties with about 35 countries. That number helps show the scale Iran’s exporters say they serve, even while facing banking isolation. How Crypto Fits Into Iran’s Cash Flows According to authorities outside Iran , the country has used cryptocurrency before to move value around borders. US Treasury findings previously tied more than $100 million in crypto flows to Iranian oil-related activity that skirted sanctions. Observers warn that accepting crypto for arms could make tracking payments harder, depending on the coins and the custody arrangements used. Some analysts say public listings could attract buyers who already avoid SWIFT and traditional banking. Governments and sanctions experts have raised alarms. If deliveries happen after crypto payments are received, enforcement agencies will face fresh tracing challenges. The US has a record of sanctioning networks that used crypto to support Iranian programs, and officials have signaled they will monitor new tactics closely. Some countries may consider tighter rules on crypto services used in cross-border defense deals. Based on reports , the export agency presents the offers as open to negotiation and claims sanctions will not stop contracts from being fulfilled. What remains unclear is how many, if any, arms contracts will actually be completed using crypto. There are also unanswered questions about which cryptocurrencies would be accepted, how escrow and delivery would be handled, and what intermediaries might be involved.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission confirmed on Jan. 2 that Caroline Crenshaw has departed the agenc y, opening a vacancy that could influence how digital asset policy develops in the months ahead. SEC leadership change alters internal balance The SEC announced Crenshaw’s departure in a public statement released on Jan. 2. The notice was signed by SEC Chair Paul S. Atkins and the remaining commissioners, marking the formal end of her tenure. Crenshaw joined the commission in August 2020 after a unanimous Senate confirmation and previously served as an SEC staff attorney and counsel to former commissioners. Her exit leaves the SEC operating with fewer than its full five-member panel. By statute, no more than three commissioners may belong to the same political party. In addition, commissioners can remain in office for a limited period after their terms expire if successors are not confirmed, a mechanism often used to maintain continuity during stalled nominations. As a result, the timing of a replacement will matter. Until the Senate confirms a new commissioner, the existing members will shape enforcement priorities, rulemaking votes, and public guidance. That dynamic becomes more important as the SEC continues to face pressure to clarify its stance on digital assets. What the departure means for crypto oversight During her term, Crenshaw frequently emphasized investor protection and market risk in discussions involving crypto assets. She supported a cautious approach, often aligning with views that digital tokens could fall under existing securities laws depending on their structure and distribution. Her departure comes as the SEC continues work through its internal Crypto Task Force, which has said it aims to clarify how securities laws apply to crypto markets and to evaluate possible policy adjustments. With fewer commissioners, each vote now carries greater weight in shaping outcomes tied to enforcement actions or regulatory guidance. Historically, shifts in SEC leadership have influenced crypto policy direction. Past transitions have coincided with changes in enforcement intensity, settlement strategies, and public messaging toward exchanges, token issuers, and intermediaries. As Congress debates broader digital asset legislation, the SEC’s composition remains a critical factor in how those laws, if passed, would be interpreted and enforced. For now, the vacancy introduces uncertainty. While no immediate policy changes were announced alongside Crenshaw’s departure, the altered lineup could affect future decisions at a regulator already central to the U.S. crypto regulatory debate.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-03 08:31:00

Despite record FY2025 revenue of $766M and positive operating income of $319M, CLSK's free cash flow remained deeply negative at -$461M, driving continued dilution and increased debt. Management turnover and a $1.15B convertible bond raise signal strategic urgency, with initial data center conversions targeting Sandersville and Texas facilities (200MW each). Full conversion of 1.4GW capacity could yield $1.4B–$2.1B annual revenue, but immediate, complete transition is not the current outlook. CleanSpark ( CLSK ) is a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner in transition to using its power capacity for AI data centers. It's a late shift and change of tone from previous guidance, and it's one worth a follow-up. While I think this will be a better business over time than BTC mining, tight cash flows and capital needs make the current valuation unfavorable. Summary of Previous Thesis When I wrote about CleanSpark in March, I was cautious about its status as a BTC mining pure play. This was something that made the company stand out, as other BTC miners were converting many of their assets into data centers. The move, broadly accepted across the BTC mining industry, leverages electrical capacity for an end use that can produce reliable free cash flow. CleanSpark's decision to stay out of it was, therefore, a curious one. Screenshot from previous thesis (Author's display of 10K data) Seen above, their BTC mining business was a cash burner, regularly requiring more shares to be issued, in order to finance operations. CleanSpark was betting that competitors' shift to data centers would make their mining operations more competitive, as it would give them a greater share of the global hash rate and therefore improve their BTC output. Nevertheless, BTC still needed to appreciate considerably to turn cash flows positive. Lacking those in the meantime and threatened by continual dilution that would kill off realized upside, I gave CLSK a cautious Hold rating. Updates and Subsequent Events In the months that followed, CleanSpark proceeded with the BTC mining pure play approach. They expressed growing confidence that the business would become self-sufficient, announcing a financing deal with Coinbase ( COIN ) in April. They stated that a portion of BTC mined would be used to sustain operations. Later, they touted reaching 50 exahashes per second in their mining. CEO Zach Bradford stated: As we look to the future, CleanSpark has laid the foundation to achieve 60 EH/s and beyond. This expansion capacity aligns with the Company's broader strategy to grow with capital efficiency only possible for an operator that has achieved escape velocity . ""Escape velocity"" was a term used in both cases, expressing that CleanSpark was near to achieving what I was afraid they would not achieve: an end to cash burn and shareholder dilution. Cash Flow Statements (Q2 & Q3 Fiscal 2025 Forms 10Q) In spite of this, there was still a total cash burn of $234M in fiscal Q3, after accounting for operating cash flow, purchase/disposition of miners, BTC proceeds, and purchase of fixed assets. If Bradford believed CleanSpark was reaching escape velocity, the numbers were not yet bearing it out. Whether he was right or wrong, Bradford resigned as CEO shortly after fiscal Q3 results were released. He was replaced by Matt Schultz, Bradford's fellow co-founder and predecessor as CEO (from 2014 to 2019). In early September, new management announced a strategic pivot to data centers. CleanSpark was finally on the AI-hyperscaler train. Stepping outside of self-funding operations, CleanSpark began raising capital again, such as a recent $1.15B convertible bond offering in November . End of Fiscal 2025 Financials Fiscal 2025 was, in large part, a record year for the company, with revenue reaching an all-time high of $766M. This also supported operating income finally turning positive, reaching $319M. Income Statement (Fiscal 2025 Form 10K) For many folks this is a welcome sign, but the cash flow situation reveals some underlying cracks, coming out of the year. Cash Flow Statement (Fiscal 2025 Form 10K) While cash burn was lessened somewhat by reduced capex on miners and liquidation of BTC, operating cash flow still decreased overall for the year, reaching -$461M. BTC 1Y Price History (Seeking Alpha) Some likely recall the recent decline of the price of BTC in the fall. For CleanSpark, the fiscal year ended before this drop. They were mining BTC at prices above $100K for a large portion of the year. Fiscal 2025 Form 10K In order to raise capital and plug the gap, CleanSpark shares outstanding, basic and diluted, have both grown in the year, so the consequences of dilution persisted. Liabilities (Fiscal 2025 Form 10K) They ended the year with significantly more debt, largely from the credit facilities they started throughout the year. Then there are the convertible bonds issued later that I mentioned earlier. Overall, it's a somewhat improved picture but still a company with serious capital needs. Outlook and Valuation CLSK trades for about $10 per share and a market cap of $2.6B. As free cash flow has been negative, the task is to determine how following the shift to data centers can tip the scales into positive cash flow. Much of what I will say next will work with very general estimates, given the lack of specifics at this stage. To start, I've looked at similar deals by other companies to give us an idea of what rates they could make with their electrical capacity: Applied Digital's ( APLD ) contract with a hyperscaler Another deal between APLD and CoreWeave ( CRWV ) Ionic Digital's contract with Nscale These contracts show that a data center can make about $1M to $1.5M per MW each year. I've included a table for your convenience. Author's display of data center revenue estimates Total electrical capacity was reported to be 1.4 GW in November. If we assume their total portfolio of capacity were used for data centers today, one could imagine revenue of $1.4B to $2.1B annually, dependent on the rates of local markets and the like. Of course, that assumes complete and immediate conversion of these assets, which isn't the outlook. During the Q4 earnings call , management largely highlighted the Sandersville and Texas facilities as the first places that could be converted to AI/HPC uses. Q4 Fiscal 2025 Investor Presentation These two sites are reported to have about 200 MW of capacity each that could be active by 2027. They could contribute about $400M to $600M in revenue. As the business currently has gross margins of about 55% just on its BTC mining, the underlying assumption is that the average margin for AI/HPC would be meaningfully superior to this. Income Statement (Fiscal 2025 Form 10K) The devil is going to be in the details, but a look at key expense items currently show that these assets could produce an additional $100M to $200M in operating income. The upfront capex, however, means that free cash flow would likely not turn positive for some time, however. Liquid Assets (Fiscal 2025 Form 10K) As CleanSpark ended fiscal 2025 with only $43M in cash and is slow to liquidate its $967M BTC holdings, this is why they had to do the $1.15B convertible bond offering in November and have leaned into their BTC-backed credit facilities instead. The cash from the convertibles should be sufficient to cover capex needs for the next couple of years (if recent years are a guide). Additional cash burn from operating expenses will force them to raise more capital at some point, and this will likely entail some kind of a dilutive offering. When I see a market cap of $2.6B, I think the fundamentals should practically produce a cash flow multiple of about 10 within a few years. The timing of things makes it seem unlikely they will hit such a milestone in a few years without diluting more. The guidance in the call, after all, was: Our focus is on building a capital stack, which minimizes dilution . Management realizes what I realize and can only promise to dilute as little as possible. I think CLSK needs to be more conservatively valued for it to reflect a real shot at undervaluation. A market cap of $1.5B, which would make an entry price of $5.80 or less, is one that seems to allow for a slower realization of positive cash flow and likely some kind of margin of safety. That isn't to say that a very patient investor couldn't see upside on CLSK at the current valuation, but we're likely thinking very far into the future and imagining that execution goes very well for the most part. Fiscal Q1 results, as well as monthly updates of power capacity, will be important in assessing just how large the pipeline is and how much higher-margin revenue could be realized that isn't on the table right now. Conclusion CleanSpark likely made a pivot that needed to be made, even before BTC prices declined. Nevertheless, strategic transitions take time and cost money. CLSK meanwhile is valued in the billions, when generating cash in the hundreds of millions without more dilution remains an open question. Investors can simply wait for a more reasonably priced entry, and for that reason, I maintain my previous Hold rating.",CLSK,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2026-01-03 08:34:17

According to the analyst, any upside movement in the market will depend on retail investors staying level-headed. In a video published recently, Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan mentioned that for the market to see an upside, it needs retail investors to continue being a bit cautious, a bit pessimistic, and a bit impatient. Despite other crypto sentiment indicators pointing to fear among market participants, the analysts pointed out that Santiment’s social media data among investors and market participants points the other way. Crypto kickstarts the new year with an impressive social chatter According to Quinlivan, the signs are very positive at the moment, noting that it was always a bit of a concern in the past years. He mentioned that in this case, it might just be a metric that shows that we are gradually coming back from the holidays. Quinlivan also added that he is not particularly worried about any FOMO, adding that it could also enter the market if Bitcoin surges to $92,000 quickly. Bitcoin is currently trading around $89,930 at the time of publication, up 1.77% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Quinlivan noted that a quick rise in Bitcoin’s price to reach this level will show the “true reaction from retailers.” “Are they starting to pour in money because they’re saying Bitcoin goes up? That would be bad,” he said. Retail euphoria in crypto markets has always pushed towards all-time highs or cycle peaks, and going by history, the market has dropped shortly after. In addition, analysts have previously argued that when the market excitement gets too intense, the crypto market has always moved in the opposite direction to what most people expect. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a metric that measures the overall crypto market sentiment, posted a “Fear” score of 29 in its Saturday update. The Index has been hovering around the “Fear” and “Extreme Fear” region since early November. Analysts predict a short-term rally for Bitcoin January has always been a historic month for Bitcoin and Ethereum, with average gains of 3.75% for BTC and 19.07% for ETH, according to data from CoinGlass. Meanwhile, Cryptopolitan has reported that Bitcoin could face a difficult start to the new year after the premier asset gave back most of the gains it accrued in the past three months. The token dominated headlines in the early part of 2025, thanks to Donald Trump shining a light on it after taking back the White House. However, some analysts have added that they expect Bitcoin to undergo a rebound, even if the recovery will not last. Citi analyst Alex Saunders has mentioned that near-term support could come from the expansion of crypto exchange-traded funds, which will continue to provide better access to retail and institutional investors. He highlighted that the prediction assumes adoption will continue and ETF inflows would reach $15 billion, but noted that the level can only sustain the prices for a short while. Meanwhile, attention will remain on Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, as another beacon for price movement. According to JPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the company’s enterprise-value-to-holdings ratio, which is above the 1.0 level, reassures the company that it would not consider selling its holdings during stress. “If this ratio stays above 1.0 and MicroStrategy can eventually avoid selling bitcoins, markets will likely be reassured, and the worst for bitcoin prices will likely be behind us,” Nikolaos said.

Key Takeaways: Aave’s founder says the protocol must move beyond DeFi lending to keep growing. Aave Labs plans to share non-protocol revenue with AAVE holders and revisit IP control. Governance tensions persist over fees and influence despite the SEC closing its probe. The failed vote reignited debate over Aave’s long-term direction and how value should be shared between tokenholders and core contributors. Addressing those concerns in a post on Aave’s governance forum on Friday , Kulechov said the protocol faces a strategic inflection point as growth in decentralized finance lending alone may not be enough to sustain its next phase. Aave Founder Says DeFi Is at a Crossroads Kulechov argued that Aave should expand beyond its core DeFi lending business into areas such as real-world assets, institutional credit and consumer-facing financial products. Without that broader push, he warned, DeFi risks stalling as competition intensifies and market conditions shift. He described the ecosystem as being “at a crossroads,” urging the community to think beyond near-term governance disputes. A key element of the roadmap is a plan by Aave Labs to distribute non-protocol revenue to holders of the AAVE token. The move would mark a shift in how the token captures value, extending its role beyond governance voting. Kulechov also said a revised proposal addressing intellectual property and brand rights will be brought forward, following strong resistance to the initial plan. Higher. https://t.co/1NhV3xta6D — Stani.eth (@StaniKulechov) January 1, 2026 The strategy pitch appears aimed at unifying a community that has grown divided over questions of control and revenue ownership. Kulechov singled out real-world assets as a major growth avenue, citing estimates that put the value of global financial assets at roughly $500 trillion, a pool he believes on-chain finance can increasingly tap. Aave remains one of the largest DeFi protocols by scale. Industry data showed the platform’s total value locked surpassed $45 billion in October, underscoring its influence even as the broader sector grapples with slower growth and regulatory uncertainty. Aave Governance Dispute Centers on Swap Fees and Revenue Control The governance dispute itself centered on fees generated by token swaps routed through services such as CoW Swap, which allow users to trade directly from Aave. Some community members argued those revenues should accrue to the DAO, while others favored keeping them under the control of Aave Labs to fund development. Tensions were heightened by Kulechov’s recent purchase of roughly $15 million worth of AAVE tokens . Critics suggested the move was intended to sway the vote, a claim Kulechov rejected, saying the purchase reflected personal conviction rather than an attempt to influence governance. Last month, the US Securities and Exchange Commission formally concluded its multi-year investigation into the Aave Protocol without recommending any enforcement action. The action ends nearly four years of regulatory uncertainty surrounding one of decentralized finance’s most widely used lending platforms.

This data, captured on April 15, 2025, reveals a market in delicate balance despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties and regulatory developments affecting digital asset trading worldwide. BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratio Analysis Perpetual futures represent one of cryptocurrency’s most innovative financial instruments, combining traditional futures mechanics with unique funding rate mechanisms. These derivatives maintain constant exposure without expiration dates, making their positioning data particularly valuable for sentiment analysis. The BTC perpetual futures long-short ratio specifically measures the proportion of open long positions relative to short positions across exchanges. Market analysts consistently monitor this metric because it provides real-time insight into trader expectations and potential price direction biases. Exchange-specific data reveals subtle variations in trader behavior. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, reported a slight long bias at 50.02% long versus 49.98% short. Similarly, OKX showed marginally more bullish positioning at 50.07% long against 49.93% short. Bybit demonstrated the strongest long preference among the three platforms at 50.16% long compared to 49.84% short. These minor differences nevertheless indicate distinct trading community characteristics across platforms. BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios (24-Hour Data) Exchange Long Positions Short Positions Net Bias Overall Aggregate 49.85% 50.15% -0.30% (Slightly Bearish) Binance 50.02% 49.98% +0.04% (Neutral) OKX 50.07% 49.93% +0.14% (Slightly Bullish) Bybit 50.16% 49.84% +0.32% (Moderately Bullish) Understanding Perpetual Futures Market Dynamics Perpetual futures markets operate through sophisticated mechanisms that maintain contract prices close to underlying spot prices. The funding rate system automatically transfers payments between long and short position holders every eight hours, creating economic incentives for price convergence. When long positions dominate the market, funding rates typically turn positive, requiring longs to pay shorts. Conversely, excessive short positioning usually generates negative funding rates where shorts compensate longs. Current funding rates across major exchanges remain near neutral, reflecting the balanced positioning revealed in long-short ratio data. Several factors influence perpetual futures positioning beyond simple price expectations: Hedging Activity: Institutional traders often use perpetual futures to hedge spot Bitcoin holdings Leverage Preferences: Different exchanges offer varying maximum leverage levels affecting position sizing Geographic Distribution: Regional trading patterns create distinct positioning biases across platforms Market Making: Professional market makers maintain balanced books regardless of directional views Historical Context and Market Evolution Cryptocurrency derivatives markets have undergone substantial transformation since Bitcoin futures first launched on regulated exchanges in 2017. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange introduced the first regulated Bitcoin futures contracts in December 2017, providing institutional investors with compliant exposure to cryptocurrency price movements. Subsequently, cryptocurrency-native exchanges developed perpetual futures products that gained tremendous popularity among retail and professional traders alike. Today, perpetual futures trading volume consistently exceeds spot trading volume across major cryptocurrency pairs, establishing derivatives as the dominant price discovery mechanism for digital assets. Historical long-short ratio data reveals distinct market phases. During the 2021 bull market, aggregate long positions frequently exceeded 60% across major exchanges, reflecting extreme bullish sentiment. Conversely, the 2022 bear market saw prolonged periods with short positions dominating above 55%. The current equilibrium around 50% represents a maturing market where participants exhibit more measured positioning. This development suggests increasing sophistication among cryptocurrency derivatives traders who now incorporate more nuanced risk management strategies. Exchange-Specific Positioning Analysis Each major cryptocurrency exchange maintains unique trader demographics and product features that influence perpetual futures positioning. Binance, as the global market leader, attracts the most diverse participant base including retail traders, institutions, and algorithmic trading firms. The platform’s near-perfect 50.02%/49.98% long-short split reflects this diversity, with opposing views effectively canceling each other out. Binance also offers the widest range of cryptocurrency perpetual futures products, allowing traders to express views across multiple digital assets beyond Bitcoin. OKX has historically maintained stronger retail trader participation in Asian markets, particularly throughout China, South Korea, and Southeast Asia. The exchange’s 50.07%/49.93% ratio indicates slightly more bullish sentiment among this demographic, possibly reflecting regional economic conditions or local regulatory developments. OKX also pioneered several innovative derivatives features including unified margin accounts and portfolio margin systems that influence position management approaches. Bybit demonstrates the most pronounced long bias at 50.16%/49.84%, suggesting its user base maintains moderately optimistic Bitcoin price expectations. The exchange has cultivated strong popularity among retail derivatives traders through user-friendly interfaces, competitive fee structures, and extensive educational resources. Bybit’s consistent long bias throughout 2024 and early 2025 aligns with its marketing positioning as a platform for bullish cryptocurrency traders seeking leveraged exposure. Implications for Bitcoin Price Action Balanced perpetual futures positioning typically correlates with reduced short-term volatility as opposing forces create market stability. When extreme long or short positioning develops, markets become vulnerable to liquidation cascades where rapidly moving prices trigger automatic position closures. These liquidation events often accelerate price movements in the dominant direction, creating volatility spikes. The current equilibrium suggests reduced near-term liquidation risk, potentially supporting more orderly price discovery processes. Market structure analysis reveals additional insights when combining long-short ratio data with other metrics. Open interest, representing the total value of outstanding perpetual futures contracts, has remained stable throughout the reporting period. Funding rates across all three exchanges hover near 0.01% per eight-hour period, indicating neither longs nor shorts face significant carrying costs. Combined, these signals suggest a market in technical equilibrium where neither bulls nor bears possess clear advantage. Methodological Considerations in Ratio Calculation Long-short ratio calculations employ different methodologies across data providers, creating potential interpretation challenges. Some platforms calculate ratios based on position count, while others use position value or trader count. The data presented here utilizes position value methodology, measuring the notional value of long versus short positions. This approach provides the most accurate representation of capital allocation and market exposure. Several important limitations affect long-short ratio interpretation: Hidden Positions: Some institutional traders utilize multiple accounts or platforms obscuring true exposure Cross-Exchange Hedging: Sophisticated traders maintain offsetting positions across different venues Market Maker Activity: Liquidity providers typically maintain market-neutral books regardless of personal views Timeframe Discrepancies: Ratios represent snapshots rather than continuous measurements Despite these limitations, perpetual futures long-short ratios remain among the most widely monitored cryptocurrency market indicators. Trading platforms, analysts, and media outlets consistently reference this data when assessing market sentiment and potential price direction. The metric’s popularity stems from its simplicity, transparency, and real-time availability across multiple data providers. Conclusion The BTC perpetual futures long-short ratio reveals a cryptocurrency derivatives market in remarkable equilibrium during the latest reporting period. With aggregate positioning nearly perfectly balanced at 49.85% long versus 50.15% short, traders appear divided on Bitcoin’s immediate direction despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. Exchange-specific variations show subtle differences, with Bybit maintaining the strongest long bias at 50.16% while Binance exhibits near-perfect balance at 50.02% long. This balanced BTC perpetual futures positioning suggests reduced near-term volatility risk as opposing market forces create stability. Market participants will continue monitoring these ratios alongside funding rates and open interest for signals of developing directional biases in cryptocurrency derivatives trading. FAQs Q1: What exactly does the BTC perpetual futures long-short ratio measure? The ratio measures the proportion of open long positions relative to short positions in Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts across specified exchanges. It provides insight into trader sentiment and potential price direction biases within derivatives markets. Q2: Why do long-short ratios differ across cryptocurrency exchanges? Ratios vary due to differences in trader demographics, geographic distribution, leverage offerings, and product features across platforms. Each exchange attracts distinct user bases with varying risk appetites and trading strategies. Q3: How does the long-short ratio relate to Bitcoin’s spot price movements? While not perfectly predictive, extreme positioning (above 55% either direction) often precedes increased volatility as liquidation cascades can accelerate price movements. Balanced ratios typically correlate with more stable price action. Q4: What time period does the long-short ratio data cover? The data represents a snapshot of open positions at a specific moment, typically updated continuously throughout trading sessions. The analysis above covers positions active during a 24-hour period ending at the reporting time. Q5: How should traders use long-short ratio information in their strategies? Sophisticated traders incorporate ratio data as one component of broader market analysis, combining it with funding rates, open interest, volume patterns, and technical indicators to assess market conditions and potential turning points.

In a post on X, Crypto Dyl News (@cryptodylnews), a pundit in the crypto space, pointed to short-term technical signals suggesting XRP could be setting up for another upward move. Claver remains under scrutiny for missed price targets and unresolved allegations , yet some traders believe the market is now aligning with his analysis. OMG JAKE WAS RIGHT pic.twitter.com/wvtuiRhTX9 — Crypto Dyl News (@cryptodylnews) January 1, 2026 Technical Structure Signals Strength The chart shows XRP trading near $1.83 with a sharp vertical move following consolidation. The price pushes above multiple exponential moving averages, including the 20, 50, and 100 EMAs. That alignment often signals a shift from compression to expansion. Momentum accelerates once price clears clustered resistance levels. Candlestick structure also matters here. The pundit’s chart displays strong bullish candles with limited upper wicks. That reflects aggressive buying rather than short covering. The move occurs after price holds above a local support zone near $1.82. Buyers defended that level decisively. The 200 EMA still sits overhead, which limits the scope of the claim. However, price now trends directly toward it. Traders often treat that zone as a magnet during early trend transitions. A clean break above it would strengthen the bullish case . Was Claver Right? Jake Claver previously stated that XRP would reach $100 before the end of 2025. That did not happen. He also spoke about XRP reaching thousands of dollars in 2026. Those projections remain highly speculative. As expected, they face widespread skepticism. The current chart does not validate extreme price targets. It does show that directional bias can flip quickly once pressure builds. This has led some community members to believe Claver was just early, and not completely wrong. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Crypto Dyl News post does not claim XRP has entered a macro bull cycle. It highlights that the recent move followed technical rules often cited by aggressive bulls. Breakouts from compressed EMAs tend to attract momentum traders. That dynamic plays out regardless of who called it first. What’s Next for XRP? The current setup confirms renewed buying interest. It also confirms volatility expansion after consolidation. It shows that XRP can still move sharply when liquidity enters. That explains why some believe Claver was directionally correct, even if his timelines failed. For now, the chart supports a cautious bullish outlook. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The surge in bearish bets shows traders are bracing for losses after a fast jump in the stock that followed a $6 billion deal tied to energy and artificial intelligence. Shares of Trump Media climbed more than 30% after December 18, when the company said it would merge with Google-backed TAE Technologies in an all-stock transaction. The stock ran even harder right after the news, jumping as much as 63% over two trading days. Since Cryptopolitan reported the announcement, short interest has jumped 31% to nearly 16 million shares, close to the highest level seen since October. After the stock rose another 4% on Friday to $13.77, those short positions were worth about $218 million in bets that the price would fall, according to data from Yahoo Finance. Short sellers stack bets after merger sends Trump Media shares higher Trump Media is still losing money, and its shares are down almost 60% over the past 12 months even after the recent pop. Right now, President Donald Trump owns 115 million shares, about 40% of the company, but after the merger closes, his stake would drop to roughly 20%. Short interest near 16 million shares puts bearish positioning near levels last seen in October. The build came as the stock stayed volatile following the announcement. With the price still well below where it traded a year ago, some investors are betting the recent gains will not hold as the market absorbs the scale of the deal and the company’s ongoing losses. Trump Media’s token plan increases exposure as America goes pro-crypto At the same time, Trump Media said earlier this week it plans to issue a new token to shareholders, giving one token for each share held through a partnership with Crypto.com, and the token will operate on the Cronos blockchain. Trump later said on Truth that the token holders could receive rewards tied to its products. Chief executive Devin Nunes called the rollout “a first-of-its-kind token distribution” that will “reward Trump Media shareholders, and promote honest and open markets.” Devin also serves at the White House as chair of the Intelligence Advisory Board, where he advises the president on intelligence matters. The company said the tokens would be issued “in the near future.” Founded in 2021, Trump Media has expanded its push into crypto while also moving into artificial intelligence and financial services. Despite that expansion, its shares have fallen more than 60% this year. The crypto plan adds to Trump-linked ventures that have already generated hundreds of millions of dollars and allegations of conflicts of interest from Democrats in Congress and even some Republicans. Since returning to the White House in January, Donald has backed looser rules for crypto trading platforms and related businesses. The industry spent millions during the 2024 election cycle, backing candidates including him. Over the summer, he signed the country’s first major national crypto law, a step that folded crypto deeper into the financial system. Still, investor appetite has cooled this year as traders pulled away from volatile bets. Bitcoin is on track for an annual loss after sliding from record highs set in October. Some Trump-linked bets have stumbled too. The TRUMP meme coin surged ahead of the January inauguration and quickly ranked among the most valuable tokens. Since then, it has lost more than 90% of its value.

Price action since that event has been slow, showing reduced volatility and tightened candles. This calm has drawn steady attention from technical traders who see more than consolidation. According to Crypto Captain (@UniverseTwenty), a structure has formed beneath the surface that often precedes a decisive move. The chart shows a falling wedge that began after the October collapse . XRP has printed a sequence of lower highs and lower lows, but the distance between them continues to shrink. This convergence shows a market that is no longer trending down. Sellers remain present, but they no longer dominate with force. Buyers show increasing willingness to step in near support levels. #XRP breakout is Imminent from this falling wedge pattern pic.twitter.com/JYY68F2xsi — CRYPTO CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) January 1, 2026 How the Falling Wedge Has Developed The falling wedge on the daily chart stretches across November and December into the new year. The upper resistance slopes down at a steady angle, and the lower support declines more gradually. That imbalance signals selling pressure losing momentum over time. Each push lower struggles to extend meaningfully. Each rebound fails sooner, yet holds more ground. This pattern often appears near the end of corrective phases. Traders are closely watching the upper boundary. A daily close above it would signal a shift in control. The longer the asset’s price coils within the wedge, the stronger the reaction tends to be once it resolves. XRP now trades near the wedge apex. Candles cluster tightly, and the asset’s volume remains contained. That combination suggests compression rather than exhaustion. Markets rarely stay compressed for long. Resolution becomes more likely as space runs out, and Crypto Captain expects a major breakout . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What Does the New Year Hold for XRP? The timing adds significance. Early-year sessions often bring repositioning across crypto markets. Fresh capital enters, and investors change strategies. Technical levels gain influence as traders seek clarity. A breakout at this stage can quickly shape sentiment. If XRP breaks higher from this structure, short-term traders would likely respond first. Their activity often pulls in additional liquidity. That process can accelerate the asset’s price action over a short period. XRP has shown in previous cycles that once momentum builds, moves can develop rapidly . Failure to break out would still matter. A rejection at resistance would reinforce caution and keep the price constrained near support. Even that outcome would confirm the wedge as a valid structure rather than noise. For now, the direction remains unresolved.

Founded in 2017, the company is led by June Paik, a former Samsung Electronics memory-chip engineer. Paik began focusing on artificial intelligence about a decade ago while recovering from a torn Achilles tendon suffered during a Samsung company soccer event. During months of rehabilitation, he took online artificial intelligence courses offered by Stanford University. After returning to work, Paik left Samsung to pursue an AI-related venture. “I left with absolute certainty that I had to get into the AI space,” Paik said. According to Paik, the idea for FuriosaAI took shape after discussions with former colleagues at a computing conference in Seoul, where artificial intelligence was a central topic. He later partnered with a former Samsung colleague and an associate with experience in algorithms, and the company was launched the same year. Furiosa chip demonstrates efficiency for large AI models Furiosa’s current chip, designated RNGD, short for “renegade,” is aimed at the inference phase of artificial intelligence, which involves running trained AI models. Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) currently dominate the broader AI computing market, particularly in training large models, but startups such as Furiosa are targeting inference as a potential area of competition. The company’s latest funding round values Furiosa at close to $700 million. Meta Platforms approached Furiosa about a potential acquisition last year, but no deal was reached. OpenAI demonstrated the use of a Furiosa chip at a recent event in Seoul. while LG’s AI research division is testing the chip and said it showed “excellent real-world performance.” Furiosa said it is currently in discussions with potential clients . According to Paik, Furiosa’s chips deliver performance comparable to Nvidia’s sophisticated GPUs while drawing less power. This would reduce the overall expense of putting AI systems into operation. The technology sector shouldn’t depend so heavily on a single chip manufacturer for AI computing, Paik argues. “A market dominated by a single player—that’s not a healthy ecosystem, is it?” Paik said. Paik began his career at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), where he worked on GPU design, before returning to South Korea in 2013 to join Samsung. There, he led a small team developing new memory-chip products. Hanjoon Kim, now Furiosa’s chief technology officer, previously worked with Paik at Samsung and later joined him in founding the company. Kim said Paik emphasized rapid decision-making and long-term goals during Furiosa’s early development. South Korea positions itself for AI and inference growth With strong software capabilities and semiconductor knowledge from homegrown firms like Samsung and SK Hynix, South Korea is putting a lot of emphasis on AI development. The government has made the development of AI a top priority, hoping to become a technological leader alongside China and the United States. The government of South Korea arranged for Nvidia to finalize a significant GPU supply deal, while OpenAI recently opened an office in Seoul. During Furiosa’s beginning years, Paik frequently cited “Blitzscaling: The Lightning-Fast Path to Building Massively Valuable Companies,” a book popular in Silicon Valley. He used it to stress the importance of quick decisions and bold moves to dominate markets as an early entrant. At Stanford’s respected Hot Chips conference in 2024, Paik introduced Furiosa’s RNGD chip during a keynote presentation, calling it an answer to what he termed “sustainable AI computing.” Paik shared information demonstrating the chip could operate Meta’s Llama large language model with power efficiency exceeding Nvidia’s top-tier chips by more than double. “It was a moment where we felt we could really move forward with our chip with confidence,” Paik said. Looking back now, Paik views his Achilles injury as a pivotal moment. “I think it could have been a blessing in disguise,” he said. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

BTC Price Prediction and Why Investors Are Turning to This New Crypto Instead,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-bottom-in-btc-price-prediction-and-why-investors-are-turning-to-this-new-crypto-instead/,"Bitcoin (BTC) seems to be holding steady, forming a new bottom, but whether it is merely taking a breather before resuming a downtrend is a matter of debate among analysts. Against this backdrop, investors are beginning to weigh the merits of potential up-and-coming cryptocurrencies. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is currently in Presale Stage 7 at the price of $0.04, is expected to present potential returns of even up to 1000% to those who join the presale today. This new crypto is attracting attention duet to its utility. The project’s presale, coupled with a lending and borrowing platform, planned multichain expansion, and the availability of convenient means of buying MUTM tokens using credit cards, may ultimately facilitate a 10x growth. When compared to the current state of Bitcoin (BTC) whose potential is limited by the sheer size of its market cap, MUTM presents a scenario where early buyers may enjoy more rapid appreciation prospects. For investors searching for the next big opportunity, this crypto to buy now offers compelling early-stage potential. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Bitcoin (BTC) is stuck below $91K, although technical levels indicate budding break-out momentum. The charts are tightening, MACD just turned green, and prices have held all three short-term averages while testing above the mid-band of Bollinger Bands, suggesting a market that is range-bound and not crashing. Additionally, resistance at $85K appears steadfast, and a clean close above $91K would provide a strong break-out. Until then, BTC is range-bound, underlining that trading in established markets remains difficult and that large gains prove tough in mature markets. Meanwhile, breakout investment opportunity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly taking over the market. Mutuum Finance Is Still Early at $0.04 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in a position that could be considered in an early valuation stage in its ongoing presale. Being priced at $0.04 with a projected launch price of $0.06, smart buyers are getting in prior to the public who are waiting for launch. The project has managed to raise more than $19.52 million in the first 7 stages of presale, where more than 18,650 investors have participated. The current pricing is being regarded as early, since MUTM will launch at $0.06. This means stage 7 buyers get to benefit from a near 2x rise by the time of launch. In addition, the platform’s features support the potential for at least another 20x rise after market debut. This puts MUTM among this cycle’s most anticipated DeFi launches. While Bitcoin’s rally is limited by its huge market cap, MUTM offers untapped growth potential and smart investors are recognizing this opportunity. Passive Income for Users One of the major aspects of Mutuum Finance is the mtToken model, which encourages users to lend their assets by offering them incentives. While conventional assets can only earn interest when withdrawn, the mtTokens offered by Mutuum Finance guarantee the investors the chance to earn profits instantly while still having liquidity at their disposal. This has made MUTM the top crypto to buy now and a must-hold in 2026. Halborn Security Audit & Testnet Launch One of the most recent developments for the project was to have their lending and borrowing contracts reviewed independently by Halborn Security. The audit suggestions have been incorporated, and preparations are underway for Mutuum Finance V1 to debut on the Sepolia testnet, which will mark the first time it goes public. Some features that will be included in the testnet are: Liquidity Pools for Lending & Borrowing mtTokens signifying deposits and accumulated yields of users Debt tokens representing borrowed positions Automated liquidator bot for the management of under-collateralized loans At first, the ETH and USDT tokens will be the main assets to lend, borrow, and use as collateral within the system. More assets will be included later, with MUTM set for multichain integration. The testnet enables users to engage with the system and provide feedback to optimize the system before the mainnet launch. As Bitcoin (BTC) consolidates below $91K, offering little upside in an established market, the chance presented by Mutuum Finance (MUTM), in its early stage, is an uncommon occurrence. At the price of $0.04 during Presale Phase 7, with only $2,500 in, 62,500 MUTM tokens can be acquired, which can grow after presale to as much as $62,500, considering MUTM fetches $1 per piece. That’s a 25x ROI without having to lift a finger. Already, more than 18,650 investors are on board, and the project has raked in $19.52M, along with an exemplary mtToken model set to churn out passive income, offering realistic utility alongside the possibility for explosive growth.

ChatGPT’s Outrageous Ripple Price Predictions,https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-in-2026-1-crash-or-10-moonshot-chatgpts-outrageous-ripple-price-predictions/,"Ripple closed arguably its best year to date, with multiple high-level acquisitions, the favorable ending of the lawsuit against the SEC, as well as new partnerships and licenses. The native token also benefited, at least until the summer when it peaked at $3.65, breaking its 2018 ATH. However, the following several months were painful despite the Q4 launch of five spot XRP ETFs in the United States. As a result, the asset ended 2025 in the red and below $1.90. All eyes are now set on the new year and what it could bring to XRP’s price performance. Here’s what ChatGPT thinks. XRP Back Below $1? Aside from a brief and unexpected dip below the $1.00 level during the early October market-wide crash , Ripple’s XRP has remained above that line for the entire 2025. In fact, it hasn’t been beneath it since late November 2024. However, ChatGPT believes there’s a possibility of such a breakdown in 2026. It cited several risks that could cap upside and trigger a massive meltdown: Aggressive profit-taking from long-term holders Fading speculative demand if the broader market cools Macro uncertainty limiting institutional risk appetite Recall that large long-term holders, typically referred to as whales, have been on a violent selling spree since October, disposing of billions of tokens in Q4. If this worrisome behavior continues, the token could “lose key psychological support and revisit the $1.00-$1.20 range, representing another 40-50% drop from current levels. While painful, such a move would not be unprecedented for XRP, which has historically been prone to deep retracements after euphoric rallies,” such as the one seen in mid-2025. Or Maybe $7-$10? ChatGPT admitted that XRP enters 2026 at a “crossroads” without a clear price direction. It added that the first couple of months may set the trend for the entire year. If the bulls take control, then the AI platform sees a massive run ahead. If that’s to happen, though, Ripple would need to continue with its impressive yearly performance in terms of partnerships, licenses, and growing usage of the XRP Ledger. In case these factors align, including a market resurgence, XRP could post a 3x to 5x move from current prices and head toward $10.00. “Such a rally would likely be driven by institutional capital rather than retail hype – a dynamic shift that could make the move faster and more violent than previous cycles,” ChatGPT concluded. The spot XRP ETFs have indeed enjoyed the first couple of months, gaining well over a billion dollars, while the rest of the crypto-focused funds have fallen behind.

USDT Whale Transfer Analysis: Breaking Down the $400 Million Movement Blockchain analytics reveal the transaction occurred in a single transfer. Whale Alert, the prominent blockchain tracking service, detected and reported this substantial movement. The transaction originated from a known HTX exchange wallet and arrived at an Aave protocol address. This movement represents approximately 0.4% of Tether’s total circulating supply. Consequently, market analysts immediately began scrutinizing the implications. The timing of this transfer coincides with several market developments. First, Ethereum network upgrades have reduced gas fees significantly. Second, Aave recently implemented new interest rate models. Third, regulatory clarity has improved for DeFi protocols in certain jurisdictions. These factors collectively create favorable conditions for large-scale DeFi participation. Historical data shows similar whale movements often precede market shifts. For instance, a 300 million USDC transfer to Compound in 2023 preceded a 15% increase in total value locked across DeFi. However, correlation does not guarantee causation. Market participants should consider multiple factors when interpreting such movements. HTX Exchange Background and Strategic Context HTX, formerly known as Huobi Global, represents one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. The platform consistently ranks among the top ten exchanges by trading volume. HTX maintains substantial USDT reserves to facilitate user withdrawals and trading pairs. The exchange supports over 500 trading pairs and serves millions of users globally. Recent HTX developments provide important context. The exchange enhanced its institutional services division in late 2024. Additionally, HTX expanded its staking and earning products. These developments suggest the exchange increasingly caters to sophisticated investors. Large withdrawals to DeFi protocols may reflect this evolving user base. Exchange outflows generally signal two possibilities. Users might seek higher yields elsewhere. Alternatively, they might prepare for different investment strategies. The destination—Aave specifically—strongly suggests yield-seeking behavior. Aave consistently offers competitive returns on stablecoin deposits, especially during periods of high borrowing demand. Aave Protocol Mechanics and Yield Opportunities Aave operates as a decentralized liquidity protocol. Users deposit cryptocurrencies to earn interest. Borrowers then utilize these deposits as collateral for loans. The protocol algorithmically determines interest rates based on supply and demand dynamics. Currently, USDT deposits on Aave yield between 3.5% and 8.2% APY, depending on market conditions. The $400 million deposit significantly impacts Aave’s liquidity pools. It increases available borrowing capacity for other assets. Furthermore, it potentially lowers borrowing rates for certain cryptocurrencies. This substantial injection demonstrates growing institutional confidence in DeFi security and reliability. Recent Aave developments make this timing particularly noteworthy. The protocol recently launched its V4 upgrade with enhanced risk management features. Additionally, Aave expanded cross-chain functionality through new bridges. These improvements likely contributed to the whale’s decision-making process. Market Impact and Broader Implications This transaction immediately affected several market metrics. First, HTX’s USDT reserves decreased temporarily. Second, Aave’s total value locked increased by approximately 2.5%. Third, borrowing rates for certain assets adjusted downward slightly. Market observers monitored these changes throughout the trading day. The transfer carries broader implications for cryptocurrency markets. It demonstrates DeFi’s growing maturity for handling institutional-scale transactions. Additionally, it highlights stablecoins’ crucial role as liquidity vehicles. Moreover, it suggests sophisticated investors increasingly utilize multiple platforms simultaneously. Comparative analysis reveals interesting patterns. Similar whale movements occurred before previous market cycles. However, each situation possesses unique characteristics. The current macroeconomic environment features different interest rate conditions. Regulatory frameworks have evolved substantially. Technological infrastructure has improved dramatically. Key considerations for market participants include: Liquidity redistribution between centralized and decentralized platforms Yield differentials between exchange products and DeFi protocols Risk management approaches for large cryptocurrency holders Market sentiment indicators derived from whale movements Technical implications for blockchain network congestion Expert Perspectives on Whale Transaction Patterns Blockchain analysts emphasize several important factors when evaluating whale movements. Transaction size relative to typical activity provides crucial context. Destination addresses reveal strategic intentions. Timing relative to market events offers additional insights. Multiple transactions from the same entity create more reliable patterns. Historical data from Chainalysis and Glassnode supports several observations. First, whale movements to DeFi protocols increased 300% between 2023 and 2024. Second, average transaction sizes grew from $50 million to $180 million during this period. Third, holding periods for deposited funds lengthened from weeks to months. These trends indicate deepening DeFi integration. Risk management considerations remain paramount. Smart contract vulnerabilities represent persistent concerns. Regulatory uncertainty continues affecting decision-making. Market volatility impacts yield stability. Sophisticated investors typically employ multiple risk mitigation strategies simultaneously. Technical Execution and Blockchain Efficiency The transaction occurred on the Ethereum blockchain, utilizing the ERC-20 standard for USDT. Gas fees for the transfer amounted to approximately $350—a negligible cost relative to the transaction size. This efficiency demonstrates blockchain technology’s scalability improvements. Recent network upgrades significantly enhanced transaction throughput and cost predictability. Transaction confirmation required only twelve blocks—approximately 2.5 minutes. This speed highlights Ethereum’s post-Merge performance improvements. The network now handles large transfers with remarkable efficiency. These technical capabilities facilitate institutional adoption by reducing execution uncertainty. Security protocols ensured transaction integrity throughout the process. Multi-signature arrangements likely authorized the transfer. Cold storage solutions probably safeguarded funds before movement. Address verification procedures confirmed destination accuracy. These security measures represent industry best practices for large transfers. Conclusion The 400 million USDT whale transfer from HTX to Aave represents a landmark DeFi movement. This transaction demonstrates institutional-scale capital flowing between centralized and decentralized platforms. Market participants should monitor subsequent developments carefully. The transfer likely signals evolving yield optimization strategies among sophisticated investors. Furthermore, it validates DeFi’s growing maturity and reliability. As blockchain technology continues advancing, such substantial movements may become increasingly commonplace. The cryptocurrency ecosystem demonstrates remarkable resilience and innovation through these developments. FAQs Q1: What does a whale transfer of this size typically indicate?

The total losses resulting from wallet drainer phishing attacks reached $83.85 million, affecting 106,106 victims worldwide. According to Scan Sniffer’s 2025 phishing report, there was an 83% drop in stolen funds and a 68% reduction in victims compared with 2024, when phishing scams drained nearly half a billion dollars from more than 330,000 users. The Web3 security group said the reduction was likely a result of the mixed bullish and bearish market cycles last year, where phishing activity went up at peak market performances and fell when user engagement on blockchain networks dropped. Crypto market valuation declines ‘sends away’ phishing scammers Per Scam Sniffer’s analysis and chart data tracking the first quarter, when markets were declining, losses stood at $21.94 million, affecting slightly over 22,000 victims. When markets began to recover in the second quarter, phishing losses declined to $17.78 million from about 21,000 victims. Phishing losses and victims by month. Source: Scam Sniffer. The third quarter was the most dangerous period for market participants because several assets had witnessed strong rallies, including Bitcoin, which peaked at $123,000, and Ethereum, which hit its all-time-high price at $4,946 in August. The price charge and bull market environment came with a surge in phishing activity, pushing losses to $31.04 million and impacting 40,000 victims. August and September alone accounted for 29% of total annual losses, making the quarter the most active for attackers. However, the last quarter of the year saw a pullback in phishing losses that fell to $13.09 million, by far the quietest part of 2025. Permit / Permit2 leads signature phishing theft methods The biggest single phishing theft last year resulted in a $6.5 million loss in September, where hackers made away with staked ether and wrapped bitcoin derivatives. The attackers used a method known as the Permit-style signature, a feat that made up 38% of losses among cases exceeding $1 million. Permit/Permit 2 signatures allow token spending approvals without direct transfers, which attackers take advantage of by disguising malicious permissions to appear as legitimate prompts and trick token holders into accepting them without question. Other cases included a $3.13 million theft of wrapped Bitcoin in May using an approval escalation technique, and a $3.05 million loss of stablecoins in August through a direct transfer exploit. Yet, only 11 cases exceeded $1 million in the year, down from 30 the year before. The data also showed a decline in the average loss per victim, which fell to $790, down from nearly $1,500 last year. While the report focused on signature-based wallet drainer attacks, one of the most unforgettable cases occurred in February, when the Lazarus Group compromised a developer machine through a multisignature wallet provider within the Bybit crypto exchange. A malicious code was injected into a signing interface, enabling attackers to spoof legitimate approvals and steal approximately $1.46 billion. Supply chain attacks were also among the most prevalent methods used, with attackers stealing developer credentials through phishing emails and injecting malicious code into open-source packages, backdooring hundreds of software libraries, and exfiltrating private information and security credentials. Other campaigns phishing hackers used included compromised front-end interfaces, hijacked social media accounts, and spreading malware to steal private keys and authentication data. 2025 closed with Google Task notification phishing abuse In other news, the year ended with a sophisticated email phishing campaign in December, as hackers targeted more than 3,000 organizations in manufacturing by abusing Google’s cloud-based infrastructure. Several users reported receiving emails that appeared as genuine task notifications, prompting recipients to complete an urgent “All Employees Task.” Victims who clicked buttons labeled “View task” or “Mark complete” were redirected to malicious pages hosted on trusted cloud storage services. Because the messages were sent using legitimate application integration tools, they passed all major email authentication checks and walked past security gateways undetected.

Key Takeaways: Hundreds of EVM wallets were drained in a coordinated, low-value attack, with losses typically under $2,000 per address. Security firms warn the exploit appears automated and may involve phishing emails spoofing MetaMask and malicious browser extensions. The incident echoes recent wallet hacks despite overall crypto exploit losses falling sharply in December. While individual losses were limited, typically under $2,000 per wallet, the incident’s scope points to a coordinated campaign rather than an isolated breach. According to ZachXBT, affected wallets span multiple EVM chains, suggesting the attacker cast a “wide net” to capture modest sums at scale. Hackless Warns Automated Attack Behind EVM Wallet Drains Cybersecurity firm Hackless echoed that assessment, warning users that the activity appears automated and urging immediate steps such as revoking smart contract approvals and closely monitoring wallet activity. Early clues indicate a phishing vector may have played a role. Cybersecurity researcher Vladimir S. said a spoofed email posing as legitimate communication from MetaMask could have lured users into granting approvals or signing malicious transactions. Screenshots shared on social media showed an email closely mimicking official branding, a tactic designed to lower suspicion and accelerate compromise. Possible start of a large-scale hack. According to @zachxbt , hundreds of wallets across multiple EVM chains are currently being drained in small amounts (under $2k per victim). The root cause is still unknown. ~$107,000 stolen so far – and the number is still rising. Suspicious… pic.twitter.com/ZLkZ3RM4zG — Hackless (@hackless_defi) January 2, 2026 The wallet drain may also be linked to a separate incident involving Trust Wallet, which reported a $7 million hack on Christmas Day. That breach compromised roughly 2,596 wallets and was later tied to a supply-chain attack known as “Sha1-Hulud,” which targeted npm packages widely used by crypto developers. Trust Wallet’s incident report said leaked developer secrets from GitHub allowed an attacker to modify the wallet’s browser extension and upload a malicious version to the Chrome Web Store. Industry figures have suggested insider access could have been a factor in the Trust Wallet case. Blockchain adviser Anndy Lian called the circumstances “not natural,” while Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao said the attack likely required deep knowledge of the wallet’s source code. Binance, which owns Trust Wallet, said the mobile app was unaffected and committed to reimbursing impacted users. Whether the two incidents are directly connected remains unconfirmed. Still, the overlap in tactics,browser extensions, phishing, and approval abuse, shows a familiar risk pattern for EVM users. Crypto Hack Losses Fell 60% in December As reported, crypto-related losses from hacks and cybersecurity exploits fell sharply in December , dropping 60% month-on-month to about $76 million. The figure marks a notable decline from November’s $194.2 million, offering a rare pause after months of elevated attack activity across the sector. PeckShield said December saw 26 major crypto exploits, with a handful of incidents accounting for the bulk of losses. The largest involved a single user who lost $50 million in an address poisoning scam. In such attacks, threat actors send small transactions from wallet addresses that closely resemble legitimate ones, hoping victims will mistakenly copy or select the fraudulent address during a transfer. Last month, US prosecutors have charged a 23-year-old Brooklyn resident , Ronald Spektor, with stealing roughly $16 million in cryptocurrency from around 100 Coinbase users through an alleged phishing and social engineering scheme.

These digital currencies are maintaining strong performance, hinting at the potential for future gains. The following article explores which cryptocurrencies are showing promise, piquing interest for those on the lookout for the next big opportunity. NEAR Protocol Eyes Potential Comeback with Bullish Moves Source: tradingview NEAR Protocol's price is showing promising signs of recovery, sitting between $1.47 and $1.65. The coin recently gained around 14% this week, hinting at a positive trend. While it faced a bit of a drop last month, it's slowly climbing back up. The current price is approaching the resistance level of $1.72. If it continues to rise, it could potentially reach its second resistance of $1.90, making a leap of almost 27% from its support level. Monitoring NEAR's movements against these levels can provide clues to its future growth. Positive signals are developing, suggesting NEAR might be gearing up for more upward moves. Injective (INJ) Eyes Potential Gains Despite Recent Losses Source: tradingview Injective's current price is floating between $4.49 and $4.95. It's showing an upward trend with a recent week's boost of over 4%. INJ is close to testing its resistance level at $5.14, with further potential to rise to $5.60 if the momentum holds. This represents roughly a 25% gain from its current lower range. However, after losing over 20% this month and more than half its value in six months, investors remain cautious. The 10-day average suggests a short-term upward trend, moving above the 100-day average. With an RSI near 65, there’s potential for growth if it surpasses key resistance points. Toncoin Eyes Higher Ground: Is a Breakout Imminent? Source: tradingview Toncoin is currently trading between one and a half and almost one and three-quarters dollars. Recent trends show a rise, with the coin up over 15% in the past week. It's testing resistance near one and four-fifths dollars, a key level that could lead to further gains. If it breaks past this, it might reach around two dollars, promising an increase of over 10%. However, a dip could push it back to support levels near one and a third dollars. The market mood is optimistic, but caution is advised while watching the next price movements. Chainlink (LINK) Seeks Stability Amidst Market Fluctuations Source: tradingview Chainlink's price is hovering between $12 and $13, showing a recent weekly rise of over 8%. This suggests potential short-term interest from investors. However, the one-month change shows a dip of around 3%, indicating some uncertainty. The next key resistance is at $13, while support holds near $11.50. If LINK can break past $13, it might aim for a high of $14.34, which is a potential 10% increase from its current upper price range. RSI at 71.23 suggests it's nearing overbought conditions, which could influence movements. Overall, LINK is showing signs of interest, but caution is advised as it balances between growth potential and market pressure. Conclusion NEAR, INJ, TON, and LINK are maintaining their structures. These altcoins show strength, even when the market hesitates. This stability indicates potential resilience in uncertain times. Investors may view these as promising options in a cautious environment. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

With transactions now suspended, questions arise about the network's stability. This development has many wondering if trust issues will lead to a decline in value. The upcoming insights promise to reveal which cryptocurrencies might thrive amid this upheaval. Pi Network Price Shows Stability; Eyes on Potential Growth Source: tradingview The Pi Network cryptocurrency is hovering around $0.20, just under its nearest hurdle at roughly $0.21. It’s finding footing above the first support of about $0.20. If it breaches the next barrier, it could climb to nearly $0.22, gaining about 5% from its current value. The long-term trend reflects a drop over months, but recent patterns, like the moving averages near $0.20, hint at a possible turnaround. The relative strength index is also neutral, suggesting balanced buying and selling pressures. While it's suffered a monthly dip over 13%, the current stability could lay groundwork for upward movement if market conditions become favorable. Conclusion The temporary halt in payments has brought trust issues to the surface for the Pi Network. This could put pressure on the price of PI. Investors and users are now watching closely. Whether PI can hold its value will depend on how quickly these concerns are addressed. Some might look for stability in other options like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Solana, and Ripple. Moving forward, the reaction from the community and the network's ability to resolve these issues will be crucial. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

56764348,https://timestabloid.com/?p=93909,1767434413,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,What Could Be The Next Crypto to Hit $1?,https://timestabloid.com/what-could-be-the-next-crypto-to-hit-1/,"In crypto investing, the biggest gains often start with simple math and strong logic. When a token sits at $0.040, the path to $1 looks challenging on the surface. Yet history shows that price growth does not come from hype alone. It comes from demand, utility, trust, and timing. This is why many investors searching for the next crypto to hit $1 are now focusing on projects that combine early-stage pricing with real DeFi use cases. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fits this profile by design, not by coincidence. Presale Numbers Right after the idea, the numbers matter. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in presale phase 7. The total supply is potentially fixed at 4 billion tokens. Across all presale phases combined, around $19.60 million has already been generated. In the current phase, about 5% of the 180 million token allocation is already sold out. The current token price is $0.040, and the presale has attracted over 19,000 holders so far. This level of participation shows that interest is not coming from a small circle, but from a growing base of early adopters who see long-term value at this level. From a pricing angle, the journey from $0.040 to the planned listing price of $0.06 already reflects structured growth. That step alone sets a clear reference point for the market. Investors who understand crypto investing know that early phases are where risk meets reward, especially when a project is still building its core infrastructure. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself exactly in that window, where fundamentals are being laid before broader exposure arrives. Utility, Stablecoin Design, and the Demand Cycle Behind $1 The core strength of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lies in its dual lending model. The platform is being developed to support both peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer lending, giving users flexible ways to earn or access liquidity. This dual structure is expected to keep funds active inside the system rather than idle. Lending creates yield opportunities, borrowing creates use cases, and together they form the base of real demand. One of the most important growth drivers is the decentralized stablecoin being developed by Mutuum Finance (MUTM). This stablecoin is designed to always aim for a $1 value. It will be minted only when users borrow against collateral such as ETH, and it will be burned when loans are repaid or liquidated. Only approved issuers will be allowed to mint it, and each issuer will have a strict limit. This structure is meant to keep supply controlled and risk managed. The interest rate for borrowing this stablecoin will be governed internally. Instead of reacting only to market swings, rates will be adjusted to help keep the price close to $1. When the price rises above target, rates will be lowered. When it falls below, rates will increase. Arbitrage activity will also support balance, as traders act on price differences. All loans will be overcollateralized and automatically liquidated when required, keeping the system protected. This stablecoin is expected to act as the anchor for Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dual lending markets. As users borrow, repay, lend, and reinvest, liquidity will circulate within the ecosystem. Stablecoins are widely viewed as the backbone of DeFi, and a secure, overcollateralized design creates recurring activity. That activity translates into protocol usage. Usage creates demand for the native token. As demand grows, price pressure builds. This logical cycle is what supports the idea of a move from $0.040 toward $1 over time. V1 Protocol Launch and Ongoing Audit The team has announced the development of its lending and borrowing protocol, with Version 1 planned for the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. This version is expected to include essential components such as liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator bot. ETH and USDT are planned as the first supported assets for lending, borrowing, and collateral. Starting with these widely used assets will make the system easier to understand and adopt once it goes live. Rolling out V1 on the testnet allows the community to interact with the protocol ahead of the mainnet release. This approach promotes openness, invites meaningful user feedback, and supports further refinement of the platform. As adoption and engagement increase during testing, overall interest in Mutuum Finance may grow, helping reinforce long-term confidence and sustained demand for the MUTM token. Trust is another layer that supports long-term value. The team has confirmed that an independent audit by Halborn Security is being conducted on the lending and borrowing contracts. With the code finalized, this review will focus on vulnerabilities, logic errors, and functional accuracy. For investors, this step signals that the protocol is being prepared with security as a foundation rather than an afterthought. Price Discovery and Projected Exchange Listing Price discovery is another critical piece. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to rely on robust oracle infrastructure to determine fair asset values. While the protocol is not live yet, its roadmap anticipates the use of Chainlink data feeds, which are recognized for decentralized and reliable pricing. These feeds can return prices based on USD and native assets, allowing flexible integration across blockchains. To improve resilience, the design also includes fallback oracles that will activate if a primary feed experiences delays or outages. Aggregated feeds will reduce dependence on a single source, lowering manipulation risk. When on-chain liquidity is strong, decentralized exchange price data such as time-weighted averages will serve as an additional reference. Accurate pricing reduces incorrect liquidations and builds confidence. Confidence leads to larger positions and longer holding periods. That behavior supports fee generation and treasury growth, which can be redirected into MUTM-related economic uses. This reinforces demand and strengthens the case for sustained price appreciation. Market exposure will act as a catalyst. With its presale trajectory and utility-focused design, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is projected to move toward listings on well-known Tier-1 and Tier-2 exchanges. Once listed, awareness will expand rapidly. Liquidity inflow will increase, larger investors will take interest, and more users will engage with the platform’s features. This expansion will build trust and participation, driving demand higher and pushing price discovery into new ranges.

Instead, market participants are examining technical signals that suggest a decisive move may be approaching. The conversation gained traction after crypto analyst Diana (@InvestWithD) shared a chart-based outlook on XRP. Her post included a clear time reference and a bold expectation. The analyst predicted a minimum increase of 25% for XRP between January 12 and 20. The claim rests entirely on technical analysis shown in the captioned chart. Around Jan 12-20 there will be at least 25% increase in $XRP price. pic.twitter.com/ktJh9Z2gBV — Diana (@InvestWithD) January 1, 2026 Diana’s Analysis of XRP Diana’s chart highlights several classic market structure elements. These include breaking structure and changing character signals, commonly labeled as BOS and CHoCH. The chart shows XRP consolidating below a marked resistance zone while remaining above recent lows. Price action appears compressed, with repeated reactions around the same range. The resistance zone sits just below $2, a level that previously acted as a strong high. The asset earlier failed there, then pulled back into a tighter range. According to the chart, XRP continues to respect higher lows after a recent downside sweep. This type of behavior often signals accumulation. The visual emphasis on supply zones suggests that liquidity may still rest above current levels. Diana’s projected move implies that a clean break above resistance could trigger a fast expansion . What’s Next for XRP? At the time of Diana’s analysis, XRP traded at $1.8681. A 25% increase will send it to $2.335, its highest level since mid-November. The analysis stays focused on structure, levels, and timing. The January 12-20 window appears connected to the compression under resistance rather than to a specific event. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If XRP holds its current support range, the chart suggests a potential test of the upper zone around $1.95 to $2.05. A decisive move through that area would validate the bullish setup and send XRP toward the $2.335 target. Failure to break higher would weaken the case and likely extend consolidation. A Strong Start Could Shape the Year Beyond the immediate setup, early-year performance often influences sentiment. A sharp upside move in January can improve confidence and attract abandoned capital. That could mean stronger participation through the first quarter if momentum grows. The community already demonstrated remarkable strength in the final trading day of 2025 . If the community can maintain that momentum and push XRP’s price up, $2.335 might be the start of XRP’s upward journey in 2026.

According to reports, the attackers have been draining wallets years after encrypted vaults were stolen and laundering the digital assets through Russian exchanges. In 2022, LastPass confirmed that attackers had breached its systems by compromising a developer environment. The platform added that the criminals stole portions of the company’s source code and proprietary technical information. In another related incident, the hackers used the stolen credentials to breach the GoTo cloud storage firm, stealing LastPass database backups stored on the platform. For some users, the vault contained both stored credentials and cryptocurrency wallet private keys and seed phrases. Cryptocurrency theft attacks linked to LastPass breach During the breach, LastPass claimed that its vaults were encrypted. However, users with weak or reused master passwords were vulnerable to offline cracking, which TRM Labs believes has been ongoing since the breach occurred. “Depending on the length and complexity of your master password and iteration count setting, you may want to reset your master password,” warned LastPass when they disclosed the breach. The link between the LastPass breaches and the cryptocurrency thefts was also confirmed by the United States Secret Service last year after the agency seized more than $23 million in crypto and said the attackers had obtained the private keys of their victims by decrypting vault data stolen in a password manager breach. Court filings also mentioned that there was no evidence that the victims’ devices had been compromised through malware or phishing. In its report, TRM Labs connected the ongoing crypto theft to the abuse of the encrypted LastPass vaults stolen in 2022. Rather than the hackers moving swiftly to drain the entire wallets after the breach, the thefts have been carried out in waves, months or years after the incident occurred. It also shows that attackers have been gradually decrypting vaults and extracting stored credentials. In addition, the wallets were drained using similar transaction methods. TRM Labs also mentioned that the method used during the breach showed that the hackers possessed the private keys before the thefts. “The linkage in the report is not based on direct attribution to individual LastPass accounts, but on correlating downstream on-chain activity with the known impact pattern of the 2022 breach,” TRM said. The platform noted that it created a scenario in which the wallet occurs in the future, rather than immediately after the breach happened. TRM Labs highlights the use of Wasabi’s CoinJoin feature The platform also mentioned that its research was initially based on a small number of reports, including several submissions made to Chainabuse, where users identified the LastPass breach as the method the hackers used to steal their wallets. The researchers increased their investigation, identifying cryptocurrency transaction behavior across other cases, eventually linking it to the data theft campaign. TRM also added that it was able to trace funds even after the attackers mixed them using Wasabi wallet’s CoinJoin feature. CoinJoin is a Bitcoin privacy technique that includes all transactions from multiple users into a single transaction, making it harder to determine which input corresponds to which output. The feature obfuscates transactions without using a traditional mixing service. After draining wallets , the hackers usually convert stolen assets to Bitcoin, route them through Wasabi Wallet, and attempt to hide their tracks using the feature. However, TRM mentioned that it was able to demix the Bitcoin sent using the CoinJoin feature by analyzing behavioral characteristics, such as transaction structure, timing, and wallet configuration choices. It was also able to match deposits with withdrawal patterns that matched the crypto theft.

Meanwhile, a separate chart post highlighted $2,500 as the key level holding the broader recovery together. Arkham says Hyperunit whale nears breakeven on $635.58M Ether long Blockchain analytics firm Arkham said a so called “Hyperunit whale” has nearly climbed back to breakeven on a large Ether long position worth about $635.58 million. Arkham shared the claim in a post on X, describing the trader as a “$10B Hyperunit whale.” Arkham said the account is now up almost $70 million in profit and loss from its lowest point, which it framed as a rebound from the account’s bottom. The post described the position as an ETH long that has “almost broken even,” implying recent market moves narrowed earlier unrealized losses. Arkham also said it linked the Hyperunit whale to Garrett Jin through a single transfer. The firm did not provide additional detail in the post about the counterparties, timing, or context of that transfer, beyond the stated connection. Analyst flags $2,500 Ether support as inverse head and shoulders forms Meanwhile, Crypto trader BitBull said Ether’s higher time frame setup looks constructive after price held above the $2,500 level, according to a post on X. Ethereum USDT 1W MEXC. Source: BitBull (@AkaBull) BitBull based the view on a large inverse head and shoulders pattern he marked on the chart. In that structure, the left shoulder forms after a selloff and rebound, the “head” prints as a deeper low, and the right shoulder develops when price makes a higher low before turning up again. On the shared ETH/USDT view, the lowest swing sits around the mid 2025 trough, while later pullbacks appear shallower, which keeps the “right shoulder” portion intact. The chart also draws a rising “neckline” zone overhead, shown as a band of sloping resistance that capped prior rallies. A typical read of this setup is that the pattern remains incomplete until price pushes through that neckline area and holds there, because repeated rejections at the same overhead zone can still stall the recovery. At the time of the snapshot, ETH traded near $3,038 on the ETH/USDT MEXC chart, with BitBull highlighting $2,500 as a key floor. Price sitting above that level suggests the latest pullback did not break the higher low structure he pointed to, while the next visible decision area remains the rising resistance band near the upper part of the chart.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|TRADING|ARKM|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-03 10:19:48

This comprehensive analysis examines BTC’s potential price trajectory from 2026 through 2030, incorporating historical patterns, technological developments, and macroeconomic factors that could influence the world’s premier cryptocurrency. Market analysts particularly focus on post-halving cycles and increasing mainstream integration. Bitcoin Price Prediction Methodology and Historical Context Professional analysts employ multiple methodologies when forecasting Bitcoin’s future value. Quantitative models often reference stock-to-flow ratios, network effect metrics, and adoption curve projections. Historical data reveals Bitcoin has experienced four-year cycles typically aligned with halving events. The 2024 halving reduced block rewards to 3.125 BTC, creating predictable supply constraints. Furthermore, increasing institutional participation through spot Bitcoin ETFs has introduced new capital flows. Traditional financial institutions now allocate portions of portfolios to digital assets. This institutional validation represents a significant shift from Bitcoin’s early years as a purely retail-driven asset. Technical and Fundamental Analysis Framework Analysts combine on-chain metrics with macroeconomic indicators for balanced predictions. Key metrics include: Network Hash Rate: Measures computational security and miner commitment Active Addresses: Indicates user adoption and network utility Exchange Reserves: Tracks available supply versus long-term holding patterns MVRV Ratio: Compares market value to realized value for valuation insights These indicators provide objective data points beyond speculative sentiment. The growing Lightning Network capacity additionally suggests improving scalability for everyday transactions. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2026: Post-Halving Momentum Analysis Historical patterns suggest 2026 could represent a period of consolidation or continued growth following the 2024 halving. Previous cycles indicate the second year post-halving often shows substantial price appreciation. However, analysts caution that past performance never guarantees future results. Several factors specifically influence 2026 projections: Factor Potential Impact Evidence Source Institutional ETF Flows Continued capital inflow SEC regulatory approvals Global Regulatory Clarity Reduced uncertainty premium MiCA implementation in EU Technological Scaling Improved utility and adoption Taproot adoption metrics Market observers note that Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional assets has fluctuated. During periods of monetary policy uncertainty, Bitcoin sometimes behaves as a risk-off asset. This evolving relationship complicates straightforward predictions. Central bank digital currency developments may also influence Bitcoin’s perceived role in the global financial system. BTC 2030 Forecast: Long-Term Value Proposition Projecting to 2030 requires examining Bitcoin’s fundamental value drivers. The fixed supply of 21 million coins creates predictable scarcity. By 2030, approximately 98% of all Bitcoin will have been mined. This diminishing new supply coincides with potential increased demand scenarios. Several adoption trajectories could materialize: Store of Value Narrative: Continued adoption as digital gold Medium of Exchange Development: Improved scalability enabling transactions Institutional Infrastructure: Integration with traditional finance deepening Demographic trends favor increased cryptocurrency adoption. Younger generations show greater comfort with digital assets. Technological improvements in custody solutions and user interfaces could lower barriers to entry. However, regulatory developments across major economies will significantly influence adoption rates. International coordination efforts through organizations like the Financial Stability Board may establish clearer global standards. Expert Perspectives and Model Variations Financial institutions have published varied Bitcoin price predictions for 2030. These projections typically range from conservative to optimistic based on different adoption scenarios. Goldman Sachs analysts emphasize Bitcoin’s volatility but acknowledge its growing institutional acceptance. Meanwhile, Fidelity Investments researchers highlight Bitcoin’s unique characteristics as an uncorrelated asset. Academic institutions like MIT and Stanford regularly publish blockchain research that informs these forecasts. It’s crucial to understand that all long-term predictions involve significant uncertainty. Market participants should consider multiple scenarios rather than single price targets. Critical Market Factors Influencing Future Bitcoin Valuation Several interconnected elements will determine Bitcoin’s price trajectory through 2030. Monetary policy decisions by major central banks significantly impact all risk assets. Interest rate environments influence the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like Bitcoin. Geopolitical developments affecting currency stability may increase demand for decentralized alternatives. Technological advancements in competing blockchain networks could affect Bitcoin’s market dominance. Environmental concerns regarding energy consumption continue prompting innovation in mining sustainability. The transition toward renewable energy sources for mining operations may address these concerns. Additionally, security developments protecting against quantum computing threats remain an ongoing research priority for the Bitcoin development community. Comparative Asset Analysis Bitcoin increasingly competes with traditional stores of value. Gold maintains a market capitalization exceeding $13 trillion, while Bitcoin’s market capitalization fluctuates around $1 trillion. This comparison suggests substantial growth potential if Bitcoin captures even a portion of gold’s market. Real estate and bond markets offer alternative investment vehicles with different risk-return profiles. Bitcoin’s 24/7 market operation provides unique liquidity advantages over traditional assets with limited trading hours. However, this constant availability also contributes to volatility. The evolving regulatory treatment of Bitcoin as either a commodity or security will affect its investment characteristics and tax treatment across jurisdictions. Conclusion Bitcoin price predictions for 2026 through 2030 involve analyzing complex technological, economic, and regulatory factors. While historical patterns and quantitative models provide frameworks, unexpected developments frequently disrupt financial markets. The Bitcoin price prediction landscape requires continuous monitoring of on-chain metrics, institutional adoption rates, and global macroeconomic conditions. Investors should maintain balanced perspectives, recognizing both Bitcoin’s transformative potential and its inherent volatility. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem matures, Bitcoin’s role within global finance will likely continue evolving alongside technological advancements and regulatory developments. FAQs Q1: What is the most reliable method for Bitcoin price prediction? Analysts typically combine multiple methodologies including technical analysis, on-chain metrics, and fundamental factors. No single method proves completely reliable, so consensus among varied approaches provides the most balanced outlook. Q2: How does Bitcoin halving affect long-term price predictions? Halving events reduce new Bitcoin supply by 50% approximately every four years. Historical data shows these events have preceded substantial price increases, though each cycle exhibits unique characteristics influenced by broader market conditions. Q3: What percentage of institutional portfolios currently includes Bitcoin? Allocations remain small but growing. Recent surveys indicate between 1-5% of portfolio allocations among crypto-adopting institutions, with many traditional firms still in exploratory phases regarding digital asset integration. Q4: How do regulatory developments impact Bitcoin price predictions? Clear regulatory frameworks typically reduce uncertainty premiums and may increase institutional participation. However, restrictive regulations in major economies could limit adoption rates and affect price trajectories significantly. Q5: What technological developments could most influence Bitcoin’s price by 2030? Scalability solutions like the Lightning Network, improved privacy features, quantum-resistant cryptography, and enhanced smart contract capabilities through layers could substantially increase Bitcoin’s utility and adoption.

The Hong Kong tech company has already acquired various mining hardware from Bitmain to mine Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. Its mining fleet comprises Antminer S21 XP Hydro units, S21 XP air-cooled miners, and Antminer L9 machines, which are expected to provide 30 PH/s for Bitcoin and 0.5 TH/s for Litecoin and Dogecoin. All installations are expected to be completed by the end of this month. It also secured 0.5 megawatts of power capacity across several US data centers . Not to mention, the firm is preparing to scale into broader digital assets activities, including future staking and node services, describing the start of its mining operation as a launchpad for its future services. BitVentures plans to expand crypto operations in the years to come BitVentures expects full mining deployment in the first quarter, targeting Bitcoin and select altcoins while prioritizing efficient, high-end machines to manage market fluctuations. Lawrence Wai Lok, CEO of the company, has described the rollout as a proof-of-concept phase, adding that the company will gradually expand its operations over time. He commented, “Subject to ongoing market conditions, the company intends to continue to invest in digital assets, and methodically scale its operations in tranches, creating a foundation for future expansion into broader digital asset services, including potential staking, node operations, and ecosystem partnerships.” He added, “We believe that establishing an efficient mining footprint may position the company favorably to pursue broader opportunities within the digital asset ecosystem.” Previously, BitVentures was formerly known as Santech Holdings and was listed on Nasdaq as STEC. The name change and ticker symbol change to BVC took effect on December 24. Before then, Santech’s core business had focused on technology investments, e-commerce platforms, and consumer-facing digital services, with no direct ties to blockchain or cryptocurrency. The firm had noted in its rebranding filing, “The company believes that the new name aligns well with its vision and focus on developing and investing in early-stage technology ventures.” Before switching to the Santech name, it was Hywin Wealth, a leading independent wealth management firm in China and a major player in real estate investment products. Over the past few months, several listed companies — including BitVentures — have turned to digital assets, raising crypto exposure as a potential remedy for business slowdowns and falling valuations. Last summer, biotech company 180 Life Sciences switched to an Ethereum treasury strategy after its shares had lost around 99% of their value. Corporations across all sectors, from non-bank lending to consumer products and agri-tech, have turned their attention to digital asset treasury strategies, such as those employed by Mill City Ventures, Upexi, and Nature’s Miracle. BitVentures shares surged 8% after it revealed its plans BitVentures’ stock has tumbled, with total returns since its IPO at approximately -89%, according to reports, a factor that may explain the company’s pivot. Stepping away from its wealth and asset management divisions resulted in the company generating no revenue in the first half of fiscal 2025. Nonetheless, BitVentures’ stock recorded a significant 8%+ increase in intraday trading after the firm announced its strategic move into the digital assets space, indicating a notable shift in its business strategy. The surge in share price came as investors increasingly bought into the company’s new bets in the cryptocurrency mining and broader blockchain-related services category — a portion of the tech industry that many investors see as high-growth, high-demand, and promising in the future.

The recent price recovery followed a volatile end to 2025, when ETH briefly slipped below the $3,000 level. Since then, trading activity has increased, supported by strong exchange flows and sustained demand from spot exchange-traded funds. Source: Coincodex Market participants have closely tracked these shifts, as capital movement patterns often reflect changes in short-term positioning and liquidity conditions. What triggered this sudden change in behavior? Binance Records $960M Ethereum Inflow in December Data from CryptoQuant showed Ethereum recorded a net inflow of $960 million to Binance in December 2025. This figure marked the largest monthly inflow to the exchange since July and ended a multi-month stretch of declining or negative net flows. From July through November, Ethereum consistently saw more withdrawals than deposits, a trend that often aligned with off-exchange holding strategies. Source: CryptoQuant December’s reversal signaled a notable change. Traders transferred large volumes of ETH onto Binance, increasing available liquidity on the exchange. Such movements often coincide with heightened trading activity, portfolio rebalancing, or preparation for market volatility. The scale of the inflow placed December well above recent monthly averages, highlighting a sharp shift in exchange-related behavior. Spot Ethereum ETFs Attract Fresh Capital Alongside exchange flows, spot Ethereum ETFs recorded strong inflows at the start of 2026. According to SoSoValue data, Ethereum spot ETFs posted a combined net inflow of $174 million on January 2. Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust ETF led daily inflows with $53.7 million, despite carrying a cumulative historical net outflow of $4.996 billion. The Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF followed closely, attracting $50 million in new capital and pushing its cumulative inflows to $1.538 billion. Total net assets held across Ethereum spot ETFs reached $19.046 billion. These products now account for an ETF net asset ratio of 5.06% relative to Ethereum’s total market capitalization. Cumulative historical net inflows across all Ethereum spot ETFs have climbed to $12.502 billion, underlining sustained institutional participation. Network Upgrades and Technical Signals Shape Market Focus Ethereum’s investment flows coincided with ongoing attention around network upgrades and technical indicators. Developers have scheduled the Pectra and Fusaka upgrades to improve scalability and reduce transaction fees. These upgrades have remained a central theme for investors tracking Ethereum’s long-term network development. On the technical side, ETH reclaimed the $3,000 level as the relative strength index flashed a buy signal. Market data showed $3,250 as a key technical threshold, often cited as a level that could confirm a broader trend shift if breached. Market commentary has also referenced long-term price projections, including Tom Lee’s previously stated $7,000 to $9,000 target range for 2026, which continues to circulate in market discussions.

The country wants the platform to make immediate technical and procedural changes to the chatbot after users and lawmakers flagged several instances of obscene content. According to the country, the cases of the chatbot being used to create these obscene images, including AI-altered images of women created using the tool. The order was issued on Friday by the IT ministry of India, asking the platform to take corrective actions concerning Grok, including restricting the generation of content involving “nudity, sexualization, sexually explicit, or otherwise unlawful” material. The ministry has also given the platform a 72-hour ultimatum to effect the changes. Indian government orders X to make technical changes to Grok As part of its deliverables in the 72-hour ultimatum, the ministry has also asked X to submit an action-taken report detailing the steps it has taken to prevent the hosting or dissemination of indecent content. These contents include “obscene, pornographic, vulgar, indecent, sexually explicit, pedophilic, or otherwise prohibited under law.” The order warned that if the platform fails to carry out the mandatory steps, it could jeopardize its “safe harbor” protections. India’s order comes amid concerns raised by users who shared examples of Grok being prompted to alter images of individuals, primarily women, to make them appear to be wearing bikinis. The issue was prompted by a formal complaint, which was submitted by Indian parliamentarian Priyanka Chaturvedi. Chaturvedi cautioned all big firms with AI chatbots, adding that there have to be guardrails put in place to check features like Grok so the chatbot does not violate human dignity. Source: @priyankac19 via X . Separately, users have also flagged several incidents where the AI chatbot has been used to generate sexualized images involving minors, an issue which X acknowledged on Friday. The platform claimed that it was caused by some lapses in safeguards before moving swiftly to take down the generated images. The platform also urged users to report formally to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or NCMEC’s CyberTipline, noting that X is committed to preventing such issues. X could face legal issues for non-compliance According to users, indecent images of women generated using the chatbot remained on the platform. The latest order comes after the Indian IT ministry issued an advisory to social media platforms, reminding them that compliance with local laws governing obscene and sexually explicit content is a prerequisite for retaining legal immunity from liability for user-generated materials. The country urged companies to improve guardrails and warned that failure could invite legal action. “It is reiterated that non-compliance with the above requirements shall be viewed seriously and may result in strict legal consequences against your platform, its responsible officers, and the users on the platform who violate the law, without any further notice,” the order warned. The Indian government has also warned X that if it fails to comply with its directive, the country has the power to initiate a legal action against the platform under India’s IT law and criminal statutes. India has emerged as one of the biggest digital markets, with the country being seen as a critical test case for how far governments are willing to push in order to hold platforms responsible for AI-generated content. If enforcement is tightened in the country, it could have a ripple effect for global technology companies operating across other jurisdictions. The order also comes as X continues to challenge India’s content regulation rules in court. The platform argues that federal government takedown powers risk an overreach, even as the platform has complied with most of the blocking directives put forward by the country. At the same time, Grok has been helpful to users on X, with most users using the platform for real-time fact-checking and commentary on global events, making its output more visible and more politically sensitive than that of stand-alone AI tools.

Buyers continue to defend the $88,000–$88,500 zone, while momentum remains restrained. Technical structure points to compression, not weakness, with higher lows, stabilizing indicators, and cautious sentiment shaping the outlook. Whether Bitcoin breaks above $90,500 or revisits lower support will likely set the tone for its next major move. Why Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Is Continuing to Defy the Odds Recent price action points to a clear stalemate. December’s volatility may have grabbed headlines, but Bitcoin has since settled into a tighter range, forming higher lows while struggling to reclaim the upper $90,000s. #Bitcoin is starting 2026 at a crossroads. #BTC holds near $89.7K as buyers defend $88K support, volatility compresses, and RSI stabilizes. A break above $90.5K could unlock the next leg higher — or delay the move. pic.twitter.com/i4JltTfeYW — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) January 3, 2026 This price behavior reflects consolidation rather than weakness, at least based on current market data. After a turbulent December, profit-taking has cooled, while long-term holders appear comfortable maintaining exposure rather than rushing for the exit. Candlestick behavior supports this interpretation. Smaller candle bodies and shorter wicks suggest neither buyers nor sellers are pressing aggressively. There are no clear signs of bearish follow-through or panic-driven selling, reinforcing the view that the market is pausing rather than breaking down. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Analysis: What’s the End Game? On the 2-hour chart, Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish after the breakout of remains a symmetrical triangle pattern which was defined by lower highs near $93,500 and a rising base between $85,800 and $87,000. This pattern typically signals compression and often precedes a volatility expansion rather than a sustained decline. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview So what is the current technical setup telling us? The constructive takeaway is that key indicators continue to lean supportive: Bitcoin is still printing higher lows along an ascending trendline drawn from mid-December, reinforcing underlying demand. The 50-day and 100-day EMAs are flattening and clustering around the $88,500–$89,000 area, creating a near-term support cushion. RSI has stabilized in the low-to-mid 60s, indicating improving momentum without entering overheated territory. There is no bearish divergence or negative EMA crossover in place, keeping downside risk contained for now. Market Data Adds to the Picture Looking beyond the charts, broader market metrics reinforce the technical setup. Total cryptocurrency market capitalization has rebounded toward $3 trillion, while 24-hour trading volume sits near $116 billion. That combination points to active participation without the kind of excess typically seen near market tops. Sentiment indicators also remain measured. The Fear and Greed Index continues to signal caution, reflecting lingering uncertainty rather than speculative euphoria, an environment that often leaves room for upside if price breaks key technical levels. What to Expect from Bitcoin in the Coming Weeks From a 2-hour chart perspective, a confirmed close above the $90,500–$90,900 zone would likely open the door to a push toward $93,500, with scope to extend into the $96,000–$97,000 area if momentum builds. Conversely, a failure to hold the upper $80,000s would weaken the structure and bring the $85,800 support level back into focus. At this stage, the price action looks more like preparation than exhaustion. As long as Bitcoin continues to defend the high $80,000s, the underlying bias remains constructive. A decisive breakout could shift sentiment quickly and potentially mark the start of the market’s next advance as the broader crypto cycle moves into a new phase. Maxi Doge: A Meme Coin Built Around Community and Competition Maxi Doge is gaining traction as one of the more active meme coin presales this year, combining bold branding with community-driven incentives. The project has already raised more than $4.4 million, placing it among the stronger early performers in the meme token category. Unlike typical dog-themed tokens that rely purely on social buzz, Maxi Doge leans into engagement. The project runs regular ROI competitions, community challenges, and events designed to keep participation high throughout the presale phase. Its leverage-inspired mascot and fitness-themed branding have helped it stand out in a crowded meme market. The $MAXI token also includes a staking mechanism that allows holders to earn daily smart-contract rewards. Stakers gain access to exclusive competitions and partner events, adding a passive earning component while encouraging long-term participation rather than short-term speculation. Currently priced at $0.0002765, $MAXI is approaching its next scheduled presale increase. With momentum building and community activity remaining strong, Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a meme coin focused on sustained engagement rather than one-off hype.

The so-called eccentric billionaire told reporters last month that claims about the company’s IPO timeline were “accurate,” as Cryptopolitan reported. That alone sent markets buzzing. But what’s really causing the stir is the price tag. After a recent share sale valued the firm at $800 billion, SpaceX is now aiming for a $1.5 trillion valuation when it finally hits the stock market. That number would crush the previous record held by Saudi Aramco’s IPO in 2019. If this thing actually launches at that level, it’ll be the largest public offering in history. And investors aren’t wasting time. They’ve already been buying in privately, betting that once the company opens to the public, it’ll blow past anything the market has seen before. Baron and Wood go all in as launch numbers explode Ron Baron, the man behind Baron Capital, told Bloomberg that nearly 25% of his personal portfolio is now in SpaceX. That’s not a typo. One in every four of his investment dollars is riding on Musk’s space venture. His Baron Partners Fund is also heavily tied to the company. Same goes for Cathie Wood, whose ARK Venture Fund has SpaceX as its top holding. According to Jefferies analysts, SpaceX set a new record in the final quarter of 2025, hitting 971 launches into low-Earth orbit, which is over 30% more than the Q3 and a huge 70% surge from the same time last year. Across the full year, SpaceX managed to fire off more than 3,200 satellites, the highest count ever for a twelve-month period. That total was 60% higher than what they did the year before. Kevin Lin, an analyst at Jefferies, told clients the company’s launch pace is “accelerating.” He didn’t mince words. While Amazon’s LEO unit has hit what it calls a stable launch phase, Lin says it’s “lagging” far behind. In a scramble to catch up, Amazon said in November that businesses could start testing its rebranded Leo offering. That’s its best shot at closing the gap with Musk’s Starlink, which has already locked in thousands of active satellites. Lin expects the total launch count across all providers to keep climbing in the near future. AI arms race pulls tech giants toward space data centers The launch game isn’t even the end of the story. Lin said something else is cooking, and it has nothing to do with tourists or satellites. It’s about data centers in space. With the AI boom putting strain on Earth’s energy supply, tech giants are now scouting for new ways to build infrastructure. Lin told clients this is where SpaceX could dominate next. Lin believes this sector could “drive” the entire growth of the LEO market over the next decade. If SpaceX finds a way to put servers in orbit, the company’s reach could expand far beyond rockets. But not everyone’s sold just yet. Edison Yu, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, warned there are still major problems to fix before this becomes reality. That hasn’t stopped the big names. Yu noted that Google and OpenAI are also testing ways to make orbital computing work. “There are clearly technical challenges to making this a viable endeavor,” Yu wrote, “but these seem to be engineering constraints as opposed to physics.” If SpaceX lands that kind of lead, it would only boost Musk’s already sky-high wealth. His $1 trillion compensation package from Tesla got the greenlight from shareholders in late 2025. But even with that approval, the electric vehicle side of his empire isn’t exactly flying. Tesla reported weaker-than-expected fourth quarter deliveries last week. That cost Musk his crown as the world’s top EV seller, with BYD now taking the lead. Tesla shares did end the year up more than 11%, but that was well below the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500. Worse, the gains don’t even come close to the 60% and 100% jumps seen in 2023 and 2024. Now the spotlight is on SpaceX, and the street’s not just watching. It’s betting that this IPO will be the one people talk about for decades.",OP-ED|Amazon|Google|OpenAI|SpaceX|Tesla,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|LEO|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-03 10:50:35

Bitfinex Hack Mastermind Receives Early Release On Friday, Ilya Lichtenstein, the mastermind behind the 2016 hack that stole over 120,000 Bitcoin (BTC) from crypto exchange Bitfinex, announced that he had been released from prison a year after receiving a five-year sentence . On X, Lichtenstein thanked a law signed by President Trump during his first administration for his release. “Thanks to President Trump’s First Step Act, I have been released from prison early,” the post stated. Notably, Trump signed the bipartisan First Step Act on December 21, 2018, aiming to improve criminal justice outcomes and reduce the size of the federal prison population. The law included a series of reforms, including one to establish a “risk and needs assessment system” that offers some inmates rehabilitative programming and the opportunity to be released early into home confinement. According to CNBC, A Trump administration official stated on January 2 that the mastermind behind the Bitfinex hack “has served significant time on his sentence and is currently on home confinement consistent with statute and Bureau of Prisons policies.” The US Department of Justice (DOJ) previously declared that Lichtenstein used advanced hacking techniques and tools to access Bitfinex’s network. He then transferred 119,574 Bitcoin to one of his crypto wallets through more than 2,000 transactions. At the time, the stolen funds were valued at around $71 million. However, its value has increased exponentially in the past decade, being worth nearly $11 billion at current prices. During his sentencing hearing, he expressed remorse for using his talents on criminal activities “instead of a positive contribution to society.” “I remain committed to making a positive impact in cybersecurity as soon as I can,” Lichtenstein affirmed on his Friday announcement, thanking his supporters for the help and vowing to prove “the haters” wrong. Crypto Heist Figures Reunite Under Trump’s Law Lichtenstein’s wife, Heather Morgan, reacted to the news online, declaring that being reunited at home with her husband after four years was “the best New Year’s present” she could get. Morgan, a rapper known online as “Razzlekhan,” entered prison in February 2025 but was released early from prison after eight months under the First Step Act. In late October, she posted a video on X, sharing the news and thanking President Trump for her release. “It is very good to be back, and I want to give a shout out to Papa Trump for making my 18-month sentence shorter,” she stated . However, it appears that the US President was not directly involved in the decision. As reported by Bitcoinist, the self-titled “Crocodile of Wall Street” was sentenced to 18 months in prison on November 18, 2024, for her role in the Bitfinex heist. Despite not being involved in the hack, Morgan assisted her husband in laundering the stolen funds by using “numerous sophisticated laundering techniques” to disguise them. Notably, they used fake identities to create online accounts, deposited the stolen Bitcoin in several darknet markets and crypto exchanges to withdraw the funds, converted BTC to other cryptocurrencies, and deposited part of the funds into crypto mixers. The couple seemingly managed to launder 21% of the total funds stolen from Bitfinex. At the time, prosecutors argued that Morgan was “a willing participant and bears full responsibility for her actions.” Nonetheless, they noted that she was “a lower-level participant,” which resulted in her reduced sentence.",Crypto News|2016 Bitfinex Hack|bitcoin|Bitcoin Heist|Bitfinex exchange|Bitfinex Hacker|btc|BTCUSDFT|crypto hacker|Crypto heist|heather Morgan|Ilya Lichtenstein|US President Donald Trump,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-03 11:00:36

Siong brought up the discussion on X early Saturday morning, asking the community if Jupiter should halt its buyback program after allocating more than $70 million to token repurchases over the past year. Ong believes the capital could be well spent if redirected toward user growth and platform incentives instead. “We spent more than 70m on buyback last year and the price obviously didn’t move much. We can use the 70m to give out growth incentives for existing and new users. Should we do it?” he asked. Jupiter had committed to directing half of its protocol revenue toward repurchasing JUP tokens and locking them for three years, a policy that officially began in February last year. Crypto exchange founders debate if buybacks are worth it Ong doubled down on his proposal by quoting comments from Amir Haleem, the chief executive and co-founder of Helium and parent company Nova Labs. Haleem had said his team was stepping away from token buybacks because markets were largely indifferent to such programs under current conditions. Helium and its Mobile network generated $3.4 million in revenue in October alone, Haleem said, adding that the funds would be better deployed towards subscribers, increasing the network’s installed base, and improving carrier offload usage. “We will be directing all our $ into those endeavors until morale improves, and data credits will continue to be burned for all carrier offload as always. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” the Nova Labs CEO surmised. Ong praised the decision, thanking Haleem for what he described as “taking the first step” and suggesting that Jupiter could follow suit. Some Solana community members responded to the Jupiter co-founder by defending the buyback model, saying it would work long-term if paired with sustained revenue growth. One proponent argued that consistent protocol expansion would result in “more tokens being removed from circulation,” and this could boost JUP’s prices. But back will be effective if it’s A) long term B) Jupiter keeps increasing its revenue for years to come That way: the stronger the product, the more tokens getting swept off the floor — Lochie (@lochie_sol) January 3, 2026 Responding to the above theory, one detractor accused the team of attempting to abandon commitments that had attracted investors to the token in the first place. The naysayer claimed canceling buybacks would undermine Jupiter’s success and JUP holders, warning that the token could lose relevance even if the platform continued to generate significant revenue. “People bought JUP because buybacks aligned with the protocol’s success. Jupiter is doing well, token is doing well. Without buybacks, it becomes a memecoin with JUP logo that can cost 0 even if Jupiter rakes in billions, and that’s a pure rug,” the Solana enthusiast wrote on X. Ong pushed back against the allegations and rejected the claims that executives were looking to rug the project. He said selling his own holdings would be the simplest way to gain any value, but JUP represented 99% of all of his net worth. Jupiter’s head shuts down the staking idea Among other ideas, community members proposed distributing protocol revenue directly to JUP stakers in the form of SOL or USDC rewards to help JUP’s valuation grow. Supporters of that approach believe organic price appreciation should follow revenue growth naturally, while staking rewards could motivate users to actively promote Jupiter adoption. They propounded that such a system would add more incentives for token holders by allowing participants to benefit directly from increased trading activity. Ong bashed that idea, convinced that stakers do not meaningfully contribute to platform growth. He said rewarding passive holders was unlikely to increase the token’s adoption and that staking incentives could weaken the project’s competitive drive against other Solana-based DEXes. Jupiter is among the top 5 most used exchanges on Solana in the last month, according to data from DappRadar. Raydium currently leads the 30-day trading charts with $793.8 million in trading volume, serving about 3.67 million unique active wallets. Meteora followed with approximately $9.38 million in monthly volume and 1.67 million active wallets, while Jupiter Exchange ranked close behind in wallet count, attracting around 1.48 million unique users over the same period and generating about $169.8 million in volume.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-reaching-20-is-not-fantasy-anymore-heres-why/,"XRP has re-entered the spotlight as market structure, liquidity conditions, and regulatory clarity align after years of uncertainty. Investors who once viewed long-term price projections as speculative now reassess XRP through a more disciplined, data-driven lens. The asset’s recent recovery and strengthening momentum suggest that the next phase may already be underway. This renewed confidence follows an analysis shared by crypto commentator John Squire, whose outlook reflects a broader shift among technical analysts tracking XRP’s long-term behavior. His assessment emerges as XRP stabilizes near key levels and benefits from improved market depth following Ripple’s post-SEC expansion in global payments. A Long-Term Breakout Backed by Structure XRP’s logarithmic chart, spanning from 2014 through projected levels into 2030, reveals a symmetrical triangle that constrained price action for nearly a decade. Markets rarely ignore such extended compression phases. When assets break out from structures of this scale, they often enter sustained expansion cycles rather than brief rallies. NOTHING STOPS XRP The structure is clear. The breakout already happened. Momentum is building and liquidity is lining up. $XRP reaching $20+ is not fantasy anymore. It’s a matter of time. Inevitable #XRPHolders pic.twitter.com/8XeBFZczbf — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) January 2, 2026 Current price action confirms that XRP has exited this triangle to the upside. Buyers have defended higher lows, and momentum indicators continue to trend upward. This behavior signals structural strength rather than short-term volatility. Fibonacci Extensions Define Realistic Price Zones Fibonacci extensions provide measurable reference points for evaluating XRP’s upside. On the long-term log-scale chart, the 1.272 extension aligns near $8 , while the 1.618 extension points toward the $13 region . These levels reflect natural continuation zones that traders often respect during macro uptrends. More importantly, extensions beyond these thresholds open a technically sound pathway toward the $20 level . Historical XRP cycles show that once the price enters expansion mode, momentum can accelerate rapidly as liquidity follows structure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Liquidity and Momentum Support the Thesis As of report time, XRP trades around $2.00, marking a roughly 9% rebound from early-2026 lows. This move coincides with rising spot liquidity and healthier derivatives positioning across major exchanges. Open interest continues to increase without excessive leverage, reducing the risk of abrupt downside cascades. Ripple’s expanding partnerships in cross-border payments further strengthen this backdrop. Financial institutions are now adopting XRP-powered solutions, as regulatory clarity has improved, reducing previous barriers to adoption. Post-SEC Resolution Changes the Narrative The conclusion of Ripple’s legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2025 reshaped XRP’s long-term outlook. Institutional participants can now engage without legal ambiguity, while developers and liquidity providers operate with greater confidence. This shift removes a structural ceiling that suppressed valuation for years. Why $20 No Longer Sounds Extreme XRP’s case for $20 no longer relies on speculative enthusiasm . The asset now combines a confirmed long-term breakout, historically consistent Fibonacci targets, improving liquidity, and a cleared regulatory path. While markets never move in straight lines, the technical and fundamental alignment explains why analysts increasingly view higher valuations as a matter of timing rather than imagination.

56766198,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258264,1767438611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Plummets: Digital Asset Falls Below $90K Amid Venezuela Airstrike Turmoil,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-falls-venezuela-airstrike/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Plummets: Digital Asset Falls Below $90K Amid Venezuela Airstrike Turmoil Global cryptocurrency markets experienced a sharp tremor on Tuesday, January 14, 2025, as the Bitcoin price swiftly fell below the critical $90,000 psychological threshold. This sudden downturn followed breaking news reports of a targeted U.S. military airstrike in Venezuela, immediately highlighting the digital asset’s ongoing sensitivity to real-world geopolitical shocks. Consequently, analysts are now scrutinizing whether this represents a fleeting reaction or the start of a deeper correction amidst a complex macroeconomic landscape. Bitcoin Price Reacts to Sudden Geopolitical Shock According to data from major exchanges and reported by Cointelegraph, the leading cryptocurrency reversed from an intraday high near $90,940. The sell-off accelerated rapidly as news wires confirmed the Venezuelan incident. Market depth charts showed significant short-term selling pressure materializing in the wake of the headlines. This event provides a stark, real-time case study in market microstructure. High-frequency traders and algorithmic systems often execute pre-programmed risk-off protocols during such events. Historically, Bitcoin and other crypto assets have demonstrated pronounced volatility during geopolitical crises. For instance, the initial phases of the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict saw similar sharp declines followed by a vigorous recovery. The current situation mirrors that pattern, where initial fear-driven selling gives way to more nuanced trading based on the conflict’s perceived duration and global economic impact. Market participants are now closely monitoring official statements from Washington D.C. and Caracas for further clues. Analyst Consensus and Short-Term Market Pressure Many prominent market analysts believe the Bitcoin price drop will likely prove temporary, contingent on the situation not escalating into a broader regional conflict. “Geopolitical events often create knee-jerk liquidity crunches in digital asset markets,” noted a strategist from a major crypto investment firm. “The underlying network fundamentals for Bitcoin remain unchanged. However, if the situation stabilizes, we typically see a retracement of the initial panic move.” This perspective is supported by on-chain data, which showed no corresponding spike in long-term holder distribution during the sell-off. Evidence from Derivatives and On-Chain Metrics Data from derivatives markets offers further context. The funding rates for Bitcoin perpetual swaps turned slightly negative, indicating heightened caution among leveraged traders. Meanwhile, the futures open interest declined modestly, suggesting a unwind of speculative positions rather than a fundamental exodus. The following table summarizes key market metrics before and after the news broke: Metric Pre-News (Approx.) Post-News (Approx.) BTC Spot Price $90,940 $89,850 24h Trading Volume Change +15% +85% Fear & Greed Index Greed (72) Neutral (54) BTC Dominance 52.1% 51.8% This data illustrates a classic risk-off shift. The surge in volume confirms the news was the primary catalyst, while the shift in market sentiment indices reflects a sudden reassessment of risk. The Broader Context: Capital Rotation and Macro Trends The event occurs against a fascinating macroeconomic backdrop. Notably, gold—the traditional safe-haven asset—has been correcting after recently hitting a nominal all-time high. In contrast, Bitcoin had risen approximately 5% since the Christmas holiday period. This divergent performance has fueled analyst speculation about a potential capital rotation from traditional stores of value into digital assets. The theory suggests investors may be reallocating a portion of their inflation-hedge portfolios. Several factors support this observation. First, increasing institutional adoption provides a structural bid for Bitcoin. Second, its fixed supply schedule contrasts with the continuous mining of precious metals. Finally, its digital, borderless nature offers a unique value proposition in times of regional instability. However, today’s price action serves as a crucial reminder that Bitcoin’s journey to becoming a uncorrelated safe haven remains a work in progress. Its price discovery is still heavily influenced by global liquidity conditions and investor sentiment. Historical Precedents and Market Psychology Examining past reactions provides critical insight. During the 2020 U.S.-Iran tensions, Bitcoin initially sold off before rallying strongly in the subsequent weeks. The market often processes geopolitical risk in two phases: an initial liquidity shock where all risky assets are sold, followed by a reassessment phase where assets with strong underlying theses recover. The speed of Bitcoin’s recovery this time will be a key indicator of its maturity. Long-term holders, often called ‘HODLers,’ typically view these dips as accumulation opportunities, which can create a price floor. Conclusion The sudden drop in the Bitcoin price below $90,000 following the Venezuela airstrike news underscores the cryptocurrency market’s acute sensitivity to geopolitical developments. While analysts largely view the sell-off as a temporary reaction to a risk-off shock, it vividly illustrates the asset class’s current stage of evolution. The concurrent narrative of potential capital rotation from gold to BTC adds a complex, longer-term dimension to the short-term volatility. Ultimately, the market’s response in the coming days will offer valuable evidence on Bitcoin’s resilience and its evolving role within the global financial ecosystem during periods of international tension. FAQs Q1: Why did the Bitcoin price fall after the Venezuela airstrike news? Financial markets often react negatively to sudden geopolitical instability due to increased uncertainty. The news triggered automated and discretionary selling as investors sought to reduce risk exposure, causing a short-term liquidity shock in the cryptocurrency market. Q2: How does this reaction compare to Bitcoin’s behavior in past geopolitical crises? The pattern is consistent with previous events, such as the early 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict. Typically, an initial sharp sell-off on the news is followed by a period of consolidation and often a recovery, depending on the scale and duration of the crisis. Q3: What is meant by ‘capital rotation from gold to Bitcoin’? This theory suggests that some investors are moving funds out of traditional safe-haven assets like gold, which has recently corrected from highs, and into Bitcoin. The 5% rise in BTC since Christmas amidst gold’s correction is cited as preliminary evidence, though long-term trends require more data. Q4: Will the Bitcoin price drop continue? Most analysts cited believe the drop will be temporary if the Venezuela situation does not escalate significantly. Market recovery will depend on the evolution of the geopolitical event, broader macroeconomic conditions, and underlying on-chain Bitcoin network strength. Q5: What metrics should investors watch now? Key metrics include the stability of the Venezuela situation, Bitcoin’s on-chain exchange flows (to see if long-term holders are selling), derivatives market funding rates, and the price action of traditional safe havens like gold and the U.S. dollar.

Venezuelan authorities accused Washington of hitting military-linked targets and announced emergency security measures after the blasts. U.S. President Donald Trump later said Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured and flown out of the country following the operation. At the time of reporting, officials did not publish a detailed briefing that confirmed targets, timing, or the claim’s operational details. Airspace warnings and flight restrictions also surfaced in early coverage. As a result, traders treated the headlines as an immediate macro risk event, even while many facts remained unsettled.

People often earn or hold bolívars, yet they need dollars for rent, imports, and bigger purchases, so exchange rates matter even for routine spending. In that environment, USDT has expanded as a “digital dollar” substitute for transfers and short-term savings. When cash USD gets scarce or risky to move, USDT can act as a bridge between bolívars and dollar-based pricing, including for business payments.

This monumental surge, reported by industry data tracker Wu Blockchain, represents a dramatic acceleration of institutional capital flowing into digital assets and blockchain infrastructure. Consequently, the landscape of crypto finance is undergoing a fundamental transformation. Crypto VC Investment Reaches Historic Highs The $49.75 billion figure marks a more than 300% increase from the previous year’s total. This explosive growth did not occur uniformly across the board, however. While the total capital deployed skyrocketed, the number of individual investment deals actually fell by 42.1% to just 898. This critical detail reveals a major trend: capital is concentrating in larger, later-stage rounds and strategic acquisitions rather than spreading across numerous early-stage startups. Therefore, the market is maturing rapidly. Several key factors drove this concentration. Firstly, established players with proven business models and regulatory clarity attracted outsized checks. Secondly, macroeconomic conditions prompted investors to seek safer bets within the high-risk crypto arena. Finally, the industry’s evolution beyond pure speculation into tangible financial infrastructure created compelling investment theses. Major firms like Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Paradigm, and Sequoia Capital have been particularly active, leading many of the year’s landmark rounds. The Driving Force: Exchange Mergers and Public Offerings The bulk of this historic crypto VC investment stemmed from high-value mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and preparations for initial public offerings (IPOs), primarily involving centralized exchanges (CEXs). These entities, which serve as the primary on-ramps for global users, have achieved significant scale and profitability. As a result, they became prime targets for consolidation and public market ambitions. The largest single deal of the year was the monumental $10.3 billion merger of Dunamu, the operator of the Upbit exchange. This transaction alone accounted for over 20% of the year’s total venture capital activity. Other major exchanges in Asia and North America also engaged in significant private funding rounds, explicitly aimed at strengthening their balance sheets before potential public listings. The table below illustrates the shift in deal dynamics: Metric This Year Previous Year Change Total Capital Invested $49.75 Billion ~$12.4 Billion +301% Number of Deals 898 1,550 -42.1% Average Deal Size ~$55.4 Million ~$8 Million +593% This data clearly shows capital pooling into fewer, much larger transactions. The trend indicates that investors are betting heavily on market leaders who are likely to dominate the next phase of adoption. Expert Analysis: Decoding the Capital Concentration Industry analysts point to a strategic pivot in venture capital strategy. “The decline in deal count alongside a surge in total capital is a classic sign of sector maturation,” explains a report from Delphi Digital, a leading crypto research firm. “Early-stage, experimental betting is being supplemented by massive, growth-equity checks into companies with clear revenue paths and regulatory strategies.” Furthermore, the focus on exchanges is logical. These platforms generate substantial fee revenue, have large user bases, and are critical gatekeepers. Investing in them, especially via late-stage private rounds or M&A, offers venture firms a path to liquidity that is often faster and more predictable than betting on a nascent protocol. The capital is following a trajectory from pure technological innovation toward financial infrastructure and market structure. Broader Market Context and Implications This record-breaking crypto VC investment wave did not happen in a vacuum. It coincides with several pivotal developments in the broader digital asset space: Regulatory Clarification: Key jurisdictions, including the EU with MiCA and parts of Asia, have advanced clearer regulatory frameworks, reducing perceived investment risk. Institutional Adoption: Major asset managers now offer spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, creating a more stable price foundation and legitimizing the asset class for traditional finance. Technology Scaling: Layer-2 solutions and next-generation blockchains have significantly improved transaction throughput and cost, enabling more viable consumer and enterprise applications. The influx of capital has immediate and long-term effects. In the short term, it provides war chests for companies to expand, acquire competitors, and weather market volatility. Over the long term, it accelerates the development of more robust, user-friendly, and interoperable blockchain networks. However, critics warn that such concentrated investment could lead to centralization of power among a few well-funded entities, potentially contradicting the decentralized ethos of crypto’s origins. Conclusion The quadrupling of crypto VC investment to $49.75 billion this year is a definitive milestone for the industry. It signals a powerful vote of confidence from sophisticated institutional investors, moving beyond speculative frenzy to strategic capital allocation in market-leading infrastructure. While the number of deals fell, the skyrocketing average deal size highlights a focus on scalability, regulation, and path to profitability. This historic capital surge will undoubtedly shape the competitive landscape, drive further innovation, and solidify cryptocurrency’s position within the global financial system for years to come. FAQs Q1: What was the largest single crypto VC deal this year? The largest deal was the $10.3 billion merger of Dunamu, the company behind the Upbit cryptocurrency exchange, which alone constituted a significant portion of the year’s total investment. Q2: Why did the number of deals fall while total investment soared? The data indicates a market maturation. Venture capital is concentrating in larger, later-stage funding rounds and M&A deals for established companies (like major exchanges) rather than spreading across many riskier, early-stage startups. Q3: What does this surge in crypto VC investment mean for the average crypto user? Increased investment in infrastructure like exchanges should lead to more secure, feature-rich, and compliant platforms. It also funds the development of new applications, potentially improving the overall user experience and utility of blockchain technology. Q4: Are venture capitalists only investing in cryptocurrency exchanges? While exchanges dominated the largest deals, significant capital also flowed into other areas like decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure, blockchain gaming studios, zero-knowledge proof technology, and institutional-grade custody solutions. Q5: How does this level of investment compare to previous market cycles? This $49.75 billion figure surpasses the total venture investment seen during the peak of the 2021 bull market. The current cycle is characterized by larger checks for more mature companies, suggesting a deeper, more sustainable foundation is being built.

You want to know the reason behind the rampant optimism? Well, look no further than global central banks that are still buying, as if the supply is going to finish tomorrow. The biggest prediction came from Nicky Shiels at MKS Pamp who proudly said on Friday that she sees gold hitting $5,400, a full 25% jump. She said most analysts have been “too timid” with their estimates. Shiels believes the dollar is still weakening and says, “We are only in the early innings of the debasement cycle.” That’s why some big money is being moved into gold, she explained. Forecasts vary wildly as analysts weigh investor behavior Lina Thomas from Goldman Sachs expects $4,900 by the end of 2026, saying there’s “significant upside” if more investors get into gold, which they likely would, thanks to geopolitical uncertainties designed by none other than US President Donald Trump. Lina’s model apparently shows that for every 0.01% increase in how much U.S. investors put into gold, the price could rise by around 1.4%. Right now, gold still makes up a small part of most portfolios. But to be fair, no one saw 2025 coming. At the start of the year, analysts were guessing an average of $2,795. The actual year-end price was $4,314, as Cryptopolitan earlier reported . Peter Taylor from Macquarie Group says gold is becoming “harder to predict.” He believes it’s being driven by investor feelings more than traditional supply and demand. His forecast is $4,200, one of the lower ones. He added, “We will see more macro news stability,” which might ease pressure on the market. Meanwhile, Natasha Kaneva at JPMorgan said central banks could still buy around 755 tonnes of gold in 2026. That’s less than previous years, but still enough to push prices toward $6,000 by 2028, she said. Her forecast for end-2026 is $5,055, just behind Société Générale’s Michael Haigh, who sees $5,000. Analysts split between breakout potential and warning signs Rhona O’Connell from StoneX is the most bearish of the analysts surveyed . She thinks gold could fall to $3,500, saying the market is too crowded. “The majority of the tailwinds for the price have already been taken on board,” she said. Unless something unexpected happens, she doesn’t see another investment surge. O’Connell also pointed to the court battle between the White House and Fed governor Lisa Cook, who’s fighting to keep her job after Trump tried to remove her and failed. If the court rules in Cook’s favor, it will assure investors of the central bank independence, and that might push gold down. Bernard Dahdah at Natixis also sounded cautious. He said jewelry demand is falling, and the Fed’s rate cuts are probably done after this year. His forecast is $4,200 for Q4 2026. “At current price levels, we are already seeing signs of demand destruction within the jewelry sector, and central bank demand has also slowed down,” he said. “We think 2026 will be a year of price consolidation.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

56766490,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=258263,1767439211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,SEC Crypto Critic Caroline Crenshaw Resigns: A Pivotal Shift in US Digital Asset Regulation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-caroline-crenshaw-resigns-crypto/,"BitcoinWorld SEC Crypto Critic Caroline Crenshaw Resigns: A Pivotal Shift in US Digital Asset Regulation WASHINGTON, D.C. – In a move that could reshape the regulatory landscape for digital assets, SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, a steadfast Democratic voice for stringent cryptocurrency oversight, has announced her resignation from the agency. Her departure, first reported by DL News, removes a pivotal figure from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and sparks immediate analysis about the future direction of crypto policy. Crenshaw consistently championed a strict application of securities laws to the burgeoning industry, most notably dissenting against the landmark approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. Consequently, her exit introduces significant uncertainty and potential for a more industry-friendly regulatory posture from the nation’s top financial markets watchdog. Caroline Crenshaw’s Legacy as an SEC Crypto Critic President Joe Biden appointed Caroline Crenshaw to the SEC in 2020. She quickly established herself as the commission’s most vocal skeptic regarding the integration of cryptocurrencies into the traditional financial system. Her regulatory philosophy centered on robust investor protection and market integrity. Crenshaw frequently argued that many digital assets constitute securities under existing law. She believed they should therefore comply with the full suite of registration and disclosure requirements. This stance often placed her at odds with industry advocates seeking new, tailored frameworks. Her tenure featured several high-profile dissents and public statements. These documents now form a clear record of her cautious approach. For instance, she voiced deep concerns about the custody, valuation, and market manipulation risks inherent in crypto markets. Furthermore, Crenshaw emphasized the potential for retail investor harm in a volatile and complex asset class. Her consistent messaging provided a counterbalance to more permissive views, both within the SEC and in the broader political arena. A Defining Moment: The Bitcoin ETF Dissent Commissioner Crenshaw’s most significant public stand occurred in January 2024. The SEC, under Chair Gary Gensler, approved a batch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. This decision marked a historic pivot after years of rejections. However, Crenshaw issued a forceful and detailed dissent. She argued the approvals failed to adequately address fundamental concerns about fraud and manipulation in the underlying Bitcoin spot markets. Crenshaw warned that the decision could expose millions of investors to substantial risks. This dissent cemented her reputation as the commission’s foremost crypto critic and highlighted the deep internal divisions on the issue. The Immediate Impact of the Resignation on Crypto Regulation Caroline Crenshaw’s resignation creates an immediate vacancy on the five-member commission. The SEC’s current composition now leans more heavily toward perspectives that may be open to engaging with the digital asset sector. However, Chair Gary Gensler remains a central figure. His own enforcement-focused approach will continue to guide the agency’s day-to-day operations. The immediate impact may be more tonal than substantive in the short term. Nevertheless, her absence removes a powerful internal voice advocating for the strictest possible interpretation of the law. The resignation process triggers a political appointment sequence. President Biden will nominate a successor, who must then be confirmed by the Senate. This process offers a key opportunity to shift the commission’s balance. Industry groups will likely lobby for a nominee with a more nuanced understanding of blockchain technology. Conversely, investor protection advocates will push for someone who maintains Crenshaw’s vigilance. The timeline for this appointment remains uncertain, creating a period of regulatory ambiguity. Potential Shifts in Pending Enforcement and Rulemaking Analysts are scrutinizing several ongoing SEC initiatives for potential change. High-profile enforcement cases against major crypto exchanges, which Crenshaw likely supported, will probably continue. However, her departure could influence the commission’s appetite for future, expansive legal theories. In terms of rulemaking, key areas to watch include: Custody Rules: Proposed changes to how investment advisers custody digital assets. Exchange Definitions: Rules that could expand the definition of an “exchange” to include DeFi platforms. Staking Services: Regulatory clarity for crypto staking and lending products. Without Crenshaw’s vote, proposals in these areas might see modifications or face closer votes, potentially leading to more industry-favorable outcomes. Historical Context and the Broader Regulatory Battle Caroline Crenshaw’s resignation occurs during a pivotal decade for financial regulation. The rise of blockchain technology has challenged decades-old legal frameworks globally. In the United States, the debate centers on whether existing securities laws, largely written in the 1930s, can effectively govern this new asset class. The SEC, under both Republican and Democratic leadership, has generally argued they can. Crenshaw was a leading proponent of this view. Her stance contrasted with other regulators, like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which has sought greater authority over digital commodities. This internal SEC dynamic mirrors a larger conflict in Washington. Legislative efforts to create a comprehensive crypto framework have repeatedly stalled in Congress. In the absence of new laws, regulatory agencies like the SEC have used enforcement actions to establish boundaries. Crenshaw’s voice was crucial in shaping that enforcement-first strategy. Her exit may encourage renewed legislative negotiations, as industry players see an opening for a more collaborative regulatory partner. Expert Analysis on the Commission’s Future Direction Financial law experts emphasize that one commissioner’s departure does not instantly reverse policy. “Commissioner Crenshaw was an important intellectual force for caution,” notes a former SEC senior counsel. “Her dissents provided a roadmap for legal challenges to SEC actions perceived as too lenient. Without that voice, the internal debate may lack a certain rigor, potentially allowing for more pragmatic, though still regulated, approaches to emerge.” Other analysts point to the remaining commissioners’ public statements. They suggest a continued focus on enforcement but perhaps with more publicly stated distinctions between different types of crypto assets. Conclusion: A New Chapter for the SEC and Crypto The resignation of SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw marks the end of a definitive era in U.S. cryptocurrency regulation. Her unwavering advocacy for applying traditional securities laws with full force provided a clear, if contentious, regulatory stance. Her departure introduces a new variable into an already complex equation. While immediate, sweeping changes are unlikely, the long-term trajectory of SEC policy toward digital assets may now have greater flexibility. The focus now shifts to the White House and the Senate. The appointment of her successor will send the next clear signal about whether the SEC under Chair Gensler will maintain its hardline posture or begin a cautious pivot toward a more structured engagement with the crypto industry. The legacy of Caroline Crenshaw’s tenure will be measured by how that future unfolds. FAQs Q1: Why did Caroline Crenshaw resign from the SEC? Commissioner Crenshaw has not publicly stated a specific reason for her resignation. Such departures are common at the end of a term or for personal career progression. The announcement, reported by DL News, simply confirms her decision to leave the agency. Q2: Does her resignation mean the SEC will stop suing crypto companies? No. The SEC’s enforcement division operates independently and pursues cases it believes violate securities laws. Chair Gary Gensler, who leads the agency, remains in place and has consistently supported an active enforcement stance. Crenshaw’s departure may affect the commission’s vote on certain cases but is unlikely to halt enforcement altogether. Q3: Who will replace Caroline Crenshaw on the SEC? President Biden will nominate a successor. The nominee must then be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The process could take several months. The new commissioner will likely be a Democrat, maintaining the current 3-2 partisan split, but their specific views on cryptocurrency regulation will be closely watched. Q4: How did Crenshaw vote on the spot Bitcoin ETFs? Commissioner Crenshaw dissented against the January 2024 approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. She published a detailed statement arguing that the approvals did not sufficiently protect investors from fraud and manipulation in the underlying Bitcoin market. Q5: Will this make it easier for other crypto ETFs (like for Ethereum) to get approved? Potentially. Crenshaw was a noted skeptic of the entire asset class. Her absence removes one likely “no” vote from the commission. However, the approval of an Ethereum ETF or similar product would still depend on the applicant meeting the SEC’s stringent requirements and the views of the remaining four commissioners, including Chair Gensler.

Stellar’s XLM traded at $0.2193 , posting a 2.54% weekly gain while falling 13.90% over the past month and nearly 51% over the past year. Source: CoinCodex These contrasting performance trends frame the debate heading into 2026. Market Ranking and Valuation Highlight a Wide Gap Market positioning clearly separates the two assets. XRP ranks fourth among all cryptos , while Stellar holds the seventeenth position. XRP’s market capitalization stands at $121.84 billion, far exceeding Stellar’s $7.1 billion valuation. This gap reflects broader participation, deeper capital pools, and wider market relevance. Trading activity reinforces this difference. As of writing, XRP recorded a 24-hour trading volume of $6.15 billion, compared with Stellar’s $180.03 million. Higher turnover typically supports tighter spreads and smoother execution, especially during volatile sessions. XRP also commands a market dominance of roughly 4%, compared with Stellar’s far smaller footprint. Supply Dynamics and Inflation Trends Shape Outlook Looking at the bigger picture that shapes 2026 clearly, supply metrics reveal important structural differences. XRP had a circulating supply of 60.68 billion tokens from a maximum of 100 billion, with an annual inflation rate of 5.98%, which addded 3.42 billion XRP over the past year. Stellar circulates 32.39 billion XLM from a capped supply of 50 billion, while posting a higher annual inflation rate of 6.96%, translating to 2.11 billion new tokens. These figures suggest different scarcity dynamics. XRP’s larger absolute issuance come with stronger demand and liquidity, while Stellar’s higher inflation rate weigh on long-term price performance. How much does supply growth matter when adoption diverges? Historical Price Cycles and Adoption Metrics Both assets share similar origins yet deliver different outcomes over time. XRP reached its all-time high of $3.92 in January 2018 and later rebounded to a cycle high of $3.64 after its cycle low. Stellar peaked at $0.9301 in the same year but failed to revisit comparable levels, topping out at $0.7965 during its last cycle. Development Activity, ETFs, and Forecasts Enter the Equation Both networks focus on cross-border payments and medium-of-exchange use cases. XRP operates on the XRP Ledger, while Stellar relies on its native blockchain. Market attention, however, is increasingly centered on XRP-related institutional developments , including ETF discussions tied to its regulatory clarity in key markets. Price forecasts reflect this momentum. CoinCodex projects XRP reaching $2.51 by January 2027, with a potential high of $3.16 in mid-2026. Stellar’s forecast pointed to $0.2799 by January 2027, with a projected high of $0.3258. While percentage gains appear similar, absolute value creation favors XRP due to scale and liquidity.

Source: BlockhainCenter Below that, the ‘Is this a bubble?’ level, running from around $157,214.21 to $200,285.53, points to elevated prices that often spark debate over sustainability without necessarily marking a market peak. The ‘HODL!’ zone, spanning roughly $120,036.03 to $157,214.21, represents valuations where long-term holders have historically been inclined to maintain positions amid strong but not excessive optimism. Further down, the ‘Still cheap’ band places the cryptocurrency between about $92,914.92 and $120,036.03, implying prices that in past cycles have offered favorable long-term risk-reward. The ‘Accumulate’ zone ranges from approximately $71,943.71 to $92,914.92 and reflects levels where investors have historically increased exposure during subdued sentiment. Below that, the ‘BUY!’ category spans roughly $53,350.41 to $71,943.71, a range associated with broad undervaluation in prior cycles. At the lowest end, the ‘Basically a Fire Sale’ zone places Bitcoin between about $40,828.60 and $53,350.41, representing deep-value territory that has historically aligned with strong long-term entry points after major drawdowns.

That’s the vision he sold investors: millions of humanoid bots, doing everything from factory shifts to folding your socks, and eventually helping humans colonize Mars. He said these bots could wipe out poverty and kill off the need to work. And if it all goes according to plan, this so-called Optimus robot would become Tesla’s biggest product ever. As Cryptopolitan reported during Q3 2025 earnings season, Elon has already promised they’ll generate “infinite” revenue and help turn Tesla into an $8.5 trillion monster. He’s even tied his own compensation to that goal, with a $1 trillion payout on the line if he can sell one million bots. Right now, not a single Optimus can even stay upright without help. They fall over. Engineers pick them up. The company started by training them with human data collectors wearing backpacks and cameras, walking around the clock to teach the bots how to move inside buildings without falling on dogs. Optimus units now circle Tesla’s Palo Alto offices, watching people and learning how not to crash into chairs. But when they do fall, someone wheels over a hoist and lifts them like crashed vending machines. Tesla engineers struggle to build working bots as Elon goes all in The project started in a kitchenette. Elon’s engineers had no formal lab space at first. Later, they got shoved into a basement, then a parking lot. The company couldn’t even find proper components .Tesla had to make its own actuators, which power the bot’s limbs, from scratch. Meanwhile, inside the lab, the nearly six-foot-tall robot spends most of its time sorting Legos, folding laundry, or learning how to use a drill. That’s the current level. That’s what Tesla has after years of hype and billions in cash. Some of Elon’s own people have doubts. Former Tesla engineers said they didn’t think the bot was worth putting in factories. One said other bots, built specifically for industrial tasks, still work better. In May, Tesla released a clip showing Optimus taking orders like “clean up crumbs” or “vacuum this area.” But those actions were learned directly from human video demonstrations, not from actual AI intelligence. Back in October 2024, Elon staged a Hollywood event at Warner Bros. in Burbank, California. Under a disco ball, five Optimus bots performed a dance routine to Haddaway’s “What Is Love.” Others served drinks in cowboy hats and bow ties. But behind the scenes, the show was run by engineers in VR headsets and bodysuits, teleoperating every move. Each robot needed a small crew: one to control it, one to monitor it, others standing close in case it tipped over or got stuck. Tesla had originally planned to roll out Optimus into its own factories by the end of the year. That’s no longer happening. The company is now working on the third version of the robot, and there’s no set delivery date. In the meantime, the only thing the bots do inside Tesla is walk around and learn how not to bump into people. Robot dreams get bigger while Tesla’s car sales shrink Elon’s whole pitch depends on turning these bots into the next big thing . That comes as Tesla’s car business is slipping fast. In Q4 of 2025, sales dropped 16%, and for the year, Tesla fell 9% overall. That put the company behind China’s BYD in total sales. Tesla’s stock had been falling too, until investors started betting on Elon’s pivot to robotaxis and humanoid bots. Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley compared Tesla’s journey to Amazon’s.“The car is to Tesla what the book was to Amazon,” he said. In other words, cars were just the beginning. But even the biggest Tesla bulls aren’t all-in. ARK Invest, which believes Tesla stock could hit $2,600 from around $400, completely left Optimus out of its models for 2029. Tasha Keeney from ARK said, “We believe initial versions of the robot will likely have a limited set of performable tasks.” Other companies are catching up fast. Silicon Valley startups like Figure and 1X, as well as Boston Dynamics from Hyundai and several Chinese firms, are also chasing the same robot market. Some are already selling bots that can fold clothes or help build cars. And some have given up on legs altogether. Rivals ditch legs while Elon promises robots in every home Elon still insists humanoids are better. But Evan Beard, CEO of Standard Bots, said wheels are smarter. “With a humanoid, if you cut the power, it’s inherently unstable so it can fall on someone,” he said . Beard’s bots roll instead of walk. He says they’re easier to control, safer to work around, and don’t tip over when turned off. That’s not stopping Elon. In Tesla’s marketing clips, Optimus is shown watering plants, unpacking groceries, and doing other household chores while its owners chill with family. He’s already trying to sell the robot as a personal butler. Back in November, he said, “Who wouldn’t want their own personal C-3PO/R2-D2? This is why I say humanoid robots will be the biggest product ever. Because everyone is gonna want one, or more than one.” Ken Goldberg from UC Berkeley isn’t convinced. “Getting these robots to do something useful is the problem,” he said. “Even a child could clear a dinner table.” Goldberg said Tesla still hasn’t solved dexterity, sensitivity, or control, and without those, the robots remain a long way from doing anything helpful. Morgan Stanley’s Jonas thinks humanoids could generate $7.5 trillion annually by 2050. Tesla’s current revenue is $98 billion, so even a slice of that pie would be massive. But so far, Optimus is barely walking, still learning from humans, and still years away from replacing even a part-time cleaner.",OP-ED|Tesla|xAI,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-03 11:25:06

This substantial movement, originating from address ‘t1Ym8XW’ and first flagged by the blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain, immediately captured the attention of traders, analysts, and the broader digital asset community, prompting deep analysis of its potential implications for Zcash’s market dynamics and privacy-centric narratives. Decoding the $35.75 Million ZEC Whale Deposit Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported the transaction on March 21, 2025, providing a transparent view into the on-chain activity. The deposit of 74,002 ZEC represents one of the largest single movements of the privacy-focused cryptocurrency in recent months. Consequently, market observers are parsing the data for signals. Typically, large inflows to centralized exchanges like Binance can precede selling pressure, as holders move assets to liquid trading venues. However, alternative interpretations exist, including portfolio rebalancing or preparation for use in exchange-based financial products. The sheer size of the transfer underscores the continued presence of high-net-worth individuals, or “whales,” who can influence asset prices through their actions. The Mechanics and Context of Large Transfers Understanding this event requires context about Zcash (ZEC) itself. Launched in 2016, Zcash is a cryptocurrency that offers optional privacy through advanced zero-knowledge proof technology called zk-SNARKs. This allows users to shield transaction details, including sender, receiver, and amount. However, the whale’s transaction appears to have utilized a transparent address (beginning with ‘t1’), making its value and destination publicly visible on the blockchain. This choice is notable; while it forfeits privacy, it aligns with exchange compliance requirements, as most trading platforms mandate transparent transactions for deposit verification. The move highlights the practical balance between Zcash’s privacy features and the regulatory realities of the centralized exchange ecosystem. Historical Precedents and Market Impact Analysis Historically, large deposits to exchanges have often correlated with short-term price volatility. Analysts frequently compare such events to past whale movements. For instance, similar sizable Bitcoin or Ethereum transfers to exchanges have sometimes preceded market dips. However, correlation does not equal causation. The actual market impact depends on several concurrent factors: Overall Market Sentiment: Is the broader crypto market in a bullish or bearish phase? Exchange Order Book Depth: Can Binance’s ZEC order books absorb potential selling without significant price slippage? Whale Intent: Is this a prelude to a sale, or merely a transfer for custody or participation in Binance’s Earn or futures platforms? Following the news, ZEC’s price showed minor fluctuations, a common reaction. Market data from the hour after the deposit revealed a slight increase in trading volume, but no immediate, drastic price movement. This suggests the market is processing the information cautiously, awaiting further signals. Expert Perspectives on Whale Behavior Blockchain analysts emphasize the importance of tracking whale wallets over time, not just single transactions. A one-off deposit is less indicative than a pattern of behavior. If the sending address continues to drain funds or if related addresses become active, it could signal a stronger directional intent. Furthermore, experts from firms like Chainalysis and CryptoQuant routinely stress that exchange inflows must be weighed against outflows. A simultaneous large withdrawal from Binance by another entity could neutralize the potential selling pressure. Therefore, comprehensive on-chain analysis looks at net flow—the difference between all assets entering and leaving an exchange—to gauge true market sentiment. Zcash’s Position in the 2025 Cryptocurrency Landscape This event brings Zcash’s unique value proposition back into focus. In a regulatory environment increasingly focused on transparency, privacy coins face unique challenges. Several international exchanges have delisted assets like Monero (XMR) and ZEC in certain jurisdictions due to regulatory pressure. Despite this, Zcash maintains a dedicated community and development team. Its technology continues to evolve, with ongoing upgrades to its consensus mechanism and privacy protocols. The whale’s activity, therefore, is not just a trading signal but also a data point in the larger narrative of privacy-preserving technologies finding their place in a regulated digital economy. The fact that a $35.75 million ZEC position exists and can be moved to a major exchange like Binance speaks to its enduring liquidity and holder confidence. Comparative Analysis of Recent Large Crypto Exchange Deposits (2025) Asset Approx. Value Exchange Date Noted Market Reaction ZEC (This Event) $35.75M Binance March 21, 2025 Minor volatility, increased volume ETH $48.2M Coinbase March 15, 2025 2% price decrease over 6 hours BTC $120M Kraken March 10, 2025 Negligible immediate impact Conclusion The anonymous ZEC whale deposit of $35.75 million to Binance serves as a powerful reminder of the scale and transparency inherent in blockchain markets. While the immediate price impact was muted, the transaction triggers essential analysis regarding holder behavior, exchange liquidity, and the evolving status of privacy-focused assets. For investors and observers, it underscores the critical need to interpret on-chain data within a broader context of market sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological progress. Ultimately, such visible movements contribute to the mature, data-driven discourse that defines the 2025 cryptocurrency landscape, where every large transaction is a story waiting to be decoded by the market’s collective intelligence. FAQs Q1: What does a large ZEC deposit to Binance typically mean? While not definitive, a large deposit often suggests a holder may be preparing to sell, trade, or use the assets on the exchange platform. It increases the immediate supply of ZEC available on the exchange, which can lead to selling pressure if executed as a market order. Q2: Why is the whale’s address visible if Zcash is a privacy coin? Zcash offers optional privacy. Transactions can be transparent (like this one, starting with ‘t1’) or shielded (starting with ‘z’). Exchanges usually require transparent transactions for compliance and audit purposes, explaining why this deposit was publicly visible. Q3: How does Lookonchain track these transactions? Lookonchain and similar firms use blockchain explorers and proprietary algorithms to monitor network activity. They track large wallets, identify exchange-related addresses, and flag transactions that exceed certain value thresholds for their subscribers. Q4: Could this deposit be something other than preparation for a sale? Absolutely. Potential reasons include moving funds to a different custody solution, providing liquidity for institutional services, collateralizing a loan, or participating in Binance’s staking, savings, or futures trading products. Q5: What is the long-term significance of such whale movements for ZEC? Individual transactions are short-term events. The long-term significance for ZEC depends more on adoption of its privacy technology, regulatory clarity, network development, and overall cryptocurrency market trends than on any single whale’s actions.

Reaching the target of $1 means Dogecoin will have to grow eight times in value, whereas the potential of the cryptocurrency is mostly driven by sentiment rather than utility. Dogecoin has repeatedly shown resistance at critical points, and in the absence of a fundamental force behind it, growth seems tough. Despite being widely recognized, DOGE does not appear to be the next crypto to hit $1, and investors seeking a new crypto coin with tangible potential are looking elsewhere. Mutuum Finance is now in Presale Stage 7, priced at $0.04, and represents a different concept for growth from DOGE. The structuring of the presale allows investors to participate in the process of growing the price, and the actual project is offering a DeFi platform, which allows for lending and borrowing via a dual model, offering actual utility not provided by DOGE and even some DeFi platforms. Given its dwindling token supply, increasing adoption, and growth roadmap, Mutuum Finance represents a situation in which initial positioning can provide gains DOGE holders won’t see this cycle. Dogecoin Displays Bullish Setup but $1 Unreachable Yet The current trading price of Dogecoin (DOGE) stands at $0.123, which forms an ascending triangle, indicating the commencement of a short-term bull run soon. Though the technical formation indicates the potential of the DOGE to reach $0.14, crossing $0.125-0.126 will be mandatory for the buyers to initiate the short-term upsurge. Nevertheless, the jump to $1 will necessitate almost eight times the growth, which seems unimaginable without extreme market hype at this stage. The support points at $0.1199 and $0.113 are of great importance, and breaches might induce the downward pullback. DOGE’s struggles have exemplified the need for investors to chase nascent coins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) whose early-stage momentum points to astronomical growth in the upcoming bull run. This makes MUTM the prime candidate for the next crypto to hit $1. Mutuum Finance: Next Crypto to Hit $1 Mutuum Finance remains one of the most popular projects that continues to attract a lot of investment interest. Currently, over 18,650 participants have joined the presale, with more than $19.5 million raised so far. Phase 7 is ongoing, with the new crypto coin at $0.04, which is a crucial investment point since a price rise is expected to follow soon. The token’s anticipated launch price at $0.06 provides investors a chance at a return of up to 600%. Past the launch stages, MUTM has the potential to rise by 25x in price and break the $1 barrier, making it one of the best cryptocurrencies to hold in 2026. With an impressive presale momentum that has seen six phases fill up faster than expected to raise over $19 million, it’s no surprise that MUTM is considered the next crypto to hit $1. Outpacing Legacy DeFi Unlike traditional DeFi protocols that rely heavily on inflationary reward models such as Aave or Compound, where the reward may end up diluting the tokens in the long run, Mutuum Finance uses dividend-based tokenomics and dual-market isolation. This provides superior risk isolation and revenue capture, ensuring MUTM appreciates through genuine protocol earnings rather than subsidized emissions. Mutuum also looks into the weaknesses established by its competitors. Most of the existing DeFi protocols lack MUTM’s planned non-algorithmic stablecoin and multichain scaling, thus posing risks of congestion, high gas costs, and the negative effects within their respective blockchain environments. On the other hand, MUTM is designed to expand beyond Ethereum to other blockchains and provides more liquidity and the capacity to connect and interact with multiple users within multiple environments. The structural advantage provided by Mutuum works even during bear markets. The ability to borrow ensures retention of users who otherwise will not remain within the platforms, and the dividends and staking bonuses ensure continued support for the platform. This reinforces why MUTM is widely regarded as the next crypto to hit $1. Utility and Real-World Value One of the factors making Mutuum Finance one of the best cryptos to invest in is the fact that the platform is based on real utility and not on hype. The platform is currently developing a decentralized lending and borrowing DeFi platform that will enable users to engage with the platform in more ways than one, solidifying it as a strong new crypto coin for the future. The team has confirmed that V1 protocol will go live on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, integrating crucial services like Liquidity Pools, mtTokens, Debt Tokens, and the Automated Liquidator Bot for ETH and USDT. Mutuum Finance is similarly building confidence within the community. The platform has a leaderboard that ranks the top 50 holders in real-time. Correspondingly, there is the 24-hour leaderboard ranking system where the number one-ranked buyer will win a bonus MUTM reward of $500. This reward program requires at least one transaction to happen within the specified time and resets at 00:00 UTC every day. Dogecoin trading at $0.13 may be tempting, but reaching $1 without the over-the-top drama will just be impractical. MUTM at $0.04 in Presale Phase 7 may have an actual shot at this milestone. Access to the presale means having the opportunity to turn $2,500 to $62,500 if MUTM attains the price of $1; doing otherwise means watching someone else profit from the next crypto to hit $1 from the sidelines.

Synthetix Coin price analysis shows a downward trend regarding current market events. The coin’s price has decreased to $0.452 in the last 24 hours. If the bearish momentum continues, the SNX price might retest support at the $0.427 level. Conversely, if buying interest overwhelms, the altcoin may again jump to the $0.463 level. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as seen in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2026 to 2032. It is expected that SNX will reach $2.58 by 2030. Why is SNX down? The cryptocurrency market is in a bearish mode, and SNX is following suit. From a larger perspective, the token is getting negative sentiment as the SNX price decreased to $0.452, losing 2.31% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $0.800376 for the current year, which is still quite higher than the current Synthetix price. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does not justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach a maximum of $3.47 by 2032. However, this is not investment advice, and anyone willing to purchase SNX tokens should seek independent professional consultation. Will SNX reach $1? Considering the future price movements, SNX will reach the $1 level by 2027. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was November 2025. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like a distant target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don’t expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years, considering the long term Synthetix price forecast. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $3.47, which it will achieve in 2032. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $3.47 by the end of 2032, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment. However, one’s own research is advised.

According to data from the blockchain analytics platform Onchain Lens, the anonymous address, beginning with 0x363ad, pulled exactly 20,000 ETH from institutional trading desks and platforms including Galaxy Digital, Coinbase, FalconX, and Cumberland. This substantial movement of digital assets away from trading venues into private custody typically suggests a holder’s intent to stake, hold, or deploy the capital elsewhere, rather than seeking immediate liquidation. Ethereum Whale Withdrawal Details and Immediate Market Context The transaction sequence, which concluded in the early hours of the UTC day, represents one of the most concentrated exchange outflows of Ethereum in recent months. Blockchain analysts immediately flagged the activity due to its scale, speed, and the profile of the source exchanges. Notably, the platforms involved—Galaxy Digital, Coinbase Institutional, FalconX, and Cumberland—primarily serve sophisticated clients, including hedge funds, family offices, and corporate treasuries. Consequently, this pattern strongly suggests the withdrawing entity is an institutional player, not a retail investor. Such large-scale withdrawals directly impact exchange reserves, a key on-chain metric watched by traders. When ETH leaves an exchange, the immediate supply available for selling decreases. Historically, sustained periods of high exchange outflows have preceded bullish market phases, as they indicate a reduction in selling pressure and an increase in investor conviction. This event occurs against a backdrop of evolving Ethereum fundamentals, including consistent network activity and the ongoing development of layer-2 scaling solutions. Analyzing the “Hodling” Signal Market participants often interpret movements from exchanges to private wallets as bullish. The logic is straightforward: assets on an exchange are typically there to be traded. Assets moved to self-custody are often being secured for a longer horizon. This whale’s action fits the classic “accumulation” narrative. It is crucial, however, to analyze this data with context. A single data point does not define a trend, but it adds to a larger mosaic of investor behavior. For perspective, we can compare this withdrawal to other notable on-chain events. The table below outlines recent significant ETH movements for context. Date Amount (ETH) Approx. Value Notable Detail This Event 20,000 $62.3M From 4 institutional exchanges in 12 hours Early Q4 2023 35,000 ~$55M Single withdrawal to a new wallet Mid-2024 15,000 ~$45M Movement between whale wallets, not from an exchange Institutional Behavior and On-Chain Analysis The methodology of using multiple exchanges is itself noteworthy. Spreading a large order across several venues is a common tactic to minimize market impact and avoid drawing attention on any single platform’s order book. The fact that this whale utilized this strategy further supports the institutional thesis. Onchain Lens and similar analytics firms use clustering algorithms and pattern recognition to link addresses to entity types, and the behavior here aligns with known institutional operational security (OpSec) and execution practices. Key on-chain metrics to monitor following this event include: Exchange Net Flow: The net difference between ETH entering and leaving all centralized exchanges. Supply on Exchanges: The total percentage of ETH’s circulating supply held on exchange wallets, which has been in a general downtrend. Wallet Age Bands: Tracking whether this ETH becomes dormant in a “Hodler” wallet or moves again shortly. Furthermore, the choice of Ethereum itself is significant. As the leading smart contract platform, ETH is not just a digital currency but a productive asset. Large holders may withdraw to participate in staking via the Beacon Chain, delegate to liquid staking protocols, or provide liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Each of these actions generates yield, making long-term holding more economically rational. The Role of Analytics Firms and Data Transparency This news broke via Onchain Lens, highlighting the critical role of blockchain analytics in modern crypto journalism. These firms parse raw, public blockchain data into actionable intelligence. Their reports provide transparency in a market often characterized by opacity. The ability to track large transactions in real-time is a double-edged sword; it promotes market efficiency but also places whale activity under a microscope. This transparency is a foundational element of the trustless nature of networks like Ethereum. Historical Precedents and Market Impact History offers several parallels. In late 2020, similar accumulation patterns by whales preceded the major bull run of 2021. While past performance never guarantees future results, these patterns form part of the analytical toolkit. The immediate market impact of this specific withdrawal was subtle. Ethereum’s price did not spike dramatically on the news, indicating the move was executed efficiently without major slippage. This lack of violent price movement actually reinforces the sophistication of the entity behind it. The broader impact is more psychological and strategic. It serves as a data point for other institutional investors conducting market analysis. It may influence sentiment among high-net-worth individuals. For retail investors, it underscores the importance of monitoring on-chain metrics rather than relying solely on price charts. The event also demonstrates the deepening maturity of crypto markets, where $62 million movements can occur with minimal disruption, a sign of increased liquidity and robust market infrastructure. Conclusion The $62.3 million Ethereum whale withdrawal from multiple institutional exchanges is a significant on-chain event that underscores several key market dynamics. It highlights continued institutional interest, showcases sophisticated capital movement strategies, and provides a strong signal of long-term holding intent. While a single transaction does not dictate market direction, it contributes valuable evidence to the ongoing narrative of Ethereum’s maturation as a institutional-grade asset. Market participants will now watch closely to see if this withdrawal marks the start of a broader accumulation trend or stands as a notable isolated action by a confident, deep-pocketed investor. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when a “whale” withdraws crypto from an exchange? It typically indicates the holder is moving assets into long-term storage (cold wallets) for purposes like holding, staking, or using in decentralized finance, rather than keeping them on an exchange for immediate trading. Q2: Why is withdrawing ETH considered a bullish signal? Withdrawing ETH from an exchange reduces the immediate sell-side supply available on the market. This can decrease potential selling pressure and is often interpreted as a sign of investor confidence in holding the asset for future appreciation. Q3: How do analysts know this was an institution and not an individual? The pattern—using multiple institutional-focused trading desks (Galaxy, FalconX, Cumberland) and spreading the order across them—is characteristic of institutional execution strategies to minimize market impact, unlike typical retail behavior. Q4: What is Onchain Lens? Onchain Lens is a representative example of a blockchain analytics platform. These firms analyze public blockchain data to track wallet activity, transaction flows, and market trends, providing insights that are not visible on standard price charts. Q5: Could this large withdrawal affect Ethereum’s price? The immediate price impact was minimal due to efficient execution. The longer-term impact is more about sentiment and supply dynamics. If it sparks a trend of similar withdrawals, the cumulative reduction in exchange supply could create upward price pressure over time.

The story was a little different for the digital asset market after the New Year’s holiday, with altcoins specifically enjoying the bulk of the rally. On Friday, January 2nd, the premier cryptocurrency jumped to above the psychological $90,000 level. However, the latest on-chain data suggests that there is no need for investors to be excited about the recent Bitcoin price action. Bitcoin Price Needs To Cross The STH Average Cost At $99,000 In a January 2nd post on the X platform, crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci revealed that the recent price jump for Bitcoin does not say a lot about the current market structure. The on-chain data pundit’s evaluation is based on the Short-Term Holder (STH) Realized Price, which currently lies around the $99,000 level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Data Shows Aggressive Sellers In Control As BTC Consolidates Below $90K For context, the Short-Term Holder Realized Price is an on-chain metric that tracks the average price where Bitcoin short-term investors (holding for less than 115 days) acquired their coins. Being the average cost basis of the most reactive group of investors, the STH Realized Price often functions as a dynamic support and resistance level. While the price of BTC slipped beneath the Short-Term Holder Realized Price four times in the past year, it has been below this critical threshold since September 2025. According to Kesmeci, the Bitcoin price needs to close above this STH Realized Price at $99,000 before bull run conversations can resume. Kesmeci wrote on X: No bull market without the short-term investor with a broken heart being made happy. This statement reiterates the importance of short-term investors in market dynamics. For instance, in this case, breaking the Short-Term Holder Realized Price would suggest the return of demand and confidence among the most reactive investor cohort. Data Converges Between $99,000 And $102,000 Furthermore, Kesmeci pointed out that additional on-chain data reinforces the critical importance of the $99,000 region to the Bitcoin price trajectory. The crypto analyst said that significant data is converging in the $99,000 – $102,000 range, and until this region is surpassed, the price of BTC might continue to struggle. In an earlier post on the X platform, Kesmeci had revealed that the price of BTC needs to close above $101,000 for the long-term trend to turn positive. This explains why the analyst later concluded that the $99,000 – $102,000 bracket is pivotal to Bitcoin’s health. As of this writing, the Bitcoin price stands at around $90,110, reflecting a roughly 2% jump in the past 24 hours.

Trading volume has followed that move, and it’s now notched a daily high of over $4.19 billion. This isn’t just a flash in the pan; that’s an awful lot of buying activity. XRP has now become the 4th largest crypto by market cap, valued at roughly $121.9 billion. Of its nearly 62 billion tokens in circulation, you can only make 100 billion in total. Despite the move, the market’s underlying tone remains measured. While things are certainly looking up, traders are keeping a close eye on whether XRP can hold onto its gains and avoid being a fleeting high. XRP/USD Technical Outlook: Fibonacci Retracement in Play From a technical perspective , XRP price prediction has turned bullish as XRP has undergone a significant shift lately. For most of last December, the price was stuck inside a clear downtrend channel, just chugging away lower and lower. But now the price has finally broken above the upper boundary of that channel after violating the $1.80 resistance zone. That breakout came after it built a solid foundation between $1.81 and $1.85, where buyers absorbed sellers and used those low points to build a series of higher lows. XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Looking at the 2-hour chart, some pretty convincing bullish candles drove the breakout; they were solid, with little wick on the tops. This marks a clear sign of absolute conviction behind the price move, not just some short-lived short covering. The brief pause at $2.05 has seen some smaller candle bodies, which isn’t really a sign that the market is rejecting the price just yet. #XRP breaks its December downtrend and holds near 2.01. EMAs turn higher, RSI cools after strength, and structure favors continuation. Above 2.00, 2.13–2.20 comes into focus. pic.twitter.com/I9uvNgSnyi — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) January 3, 2026 Key Levels and Momentum Signals Several indicators reinforce the improving structure: XRP is holding above the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement near $1.90, with price consolidating above the 0.382 level around $1.96. The 50-period EMA has crossed above the 100-period EMA, and both are turning higher beneath the price. RSI has cooled slightly after reaching the low-70s, pointing to strong momentum without clear bearish divergence. These signals suggest the move higher is being absorbed rather than faded. XRP Price Prediction: What Comes Next If XRP continues to hold above the $2.00 psychological level, the technical roadmap points toward $2.13 as the next resistance, followed by a potential extension into the $2.17–$2.20 zone. A sustained move below $1.96 would slow the bullish case and bring $1.90 back into focus. Maxi Doge: A Meme Coin Built Around Community and Competition Maxi Doge is gaining traction as one of the more active meme coin presales this year, combining bold branding with community-driven incentives. The project has already raised more than $4.39 million, placing it among the stronger early performers in the meme token category. Unlike typical dog-themed tokens that rely purely on social buzz, Maxi Doge leans into engagement. The project runs regular ROI competitions, community challenges, and events designed to keep participation high throughout the presale phase. Its leverage-inspired mascot and fitness-themed branding have helped it stand out in a crowded meme market. The $MAXI token also includes a staking mechanism that allows holders to earn daily smart-contract rewards. Stakers gain access to exclusive competitions and partner events, adding a passive earning component while encouraging long-term participation rather than short-term speculation. Currently priced at $0.000276, $MAXI is approaching its next scheduled presale increase. With momentum building and community activity remaining strong, Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a meme coin focused on sustained engagement rather than one-off hype.

Here’s Likely Next Move,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-is-slowly-breaking-currently-heres-likely-next-move/,"XRP has begun to show signs of breaking out from a long period of consolidation, according to crypto analyst Crypto Captain (@UniverseTwenty). His latest chart highlights XRP slowly climbing above the top boundary of a falling wedge , signaling potential upward momentum. Technical Patterns Point to Reversal The chart , which tracks XRP/USD on a daily timeframe, shows a series of lower highs and lower lows that have characterized the market since the flash crash in early October . Recently, XRP has pushed above the upper trendline of the wedge, suggesting that sellers may be losing control. Crypto Captain described this movement as a slow breakout, indicating that the momentum is gradual but noticeable. This technical pattern is closely watched in cryptocurrency trading. Falling wedges often signal a reversal after an extended downtrend. XRP’s breakout above the wedge suggests buyers are gaining traction, at least in the short term. Analysts see this as a potential shift in market sentiment. Current Price Action and Resistance Levels Price action remains cautious, with XRP hovering around $1.8975 at the time of his analysis. The breakout is not yet fully confirmed, and traders are waiting for a sustained move above the wedge. According to Crypto Captain’s chart, XRP has tested this resistance several times, and the current movement could be the first clear step toward higher levels . A strong start to the year could influence XRP’s trajectory. Early gains can set a positive tone for the next few months, encouraging investors to increase their positions. Market participants often watch the first week of the year, interpreting early trends as indicators of future performance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Next Moves for XRP If XRP can hold above the wedge, the next resistance levels may appear near $2.2. Breaking these levels could attract additional buying and increase short-term bullish momentum. Conversely, failure to maintain above the wedge could signal continued consolidation or a return to lower levels near $1.75. Investors are closely monitoring XRP’s daily charts to gauge the strength of the breakout. Confirmation requires multiple daily closes above the wedge with strong volume. Until that happens, the market may remain volatile, with rapid swings in both directions. The gradual rise above the upper trendline suggests a potential shift in market sentiment . Early movement above $1.9 could mark the beginning of a bullish period, especially if it continues in the first days of the year.

CoinCodex data shows XRP’s market cap surging to $121.72 billion, edging past BNB’s $120.40 billion and marking a notable reshuffle at the top of the crypto rankings. XRP is trading at $2.01 , signaling not just a short-term rally but a broader resurgence in market confidence. Its leap past BNB underscores a major shake-up in the top-tier crypto landscape, challenging the dominance of Binance’s exchange-backed ecosystem. Therefore, XRP kicks off 2026 with momentum, driven by rising market confidence, steady accumulation, and growing interest from both institutions and long-term investors. Once polarizing, XRP is now being valued more for its utility and liquidity than short-term speculation. Well, XRP’s surge is being fueled by its deep liquidity and renewed relevance in cross-border payments, where speed and cost efficiency are paramount. As blockchain settlement solutions gain traction globally, XRP’s role as a bridge asset has regained strategic importance, now reflected in its market capitalization. The recent flip over BNB underscores a broader market rotation, with capital favoring assets that combine established networks, high liquidity, and long-term utility over purely exchange-linked or hype-driven tokens. XRP reclaiming the fourth spot signals that investors are prioritizing resilience and scalability as 2026 begins. XRP’s rise has been remarkably steady, trading just above $2 without extreme volatility, signaling measured accumulation over speculative hype. Flipping BNB isn’t just a ranking shift; it underscores growing market confidence in XRP’s utility and a renewed role in the crypto ecosystem. With momentum this strong, XRP’s return to the top tier could mark the start of an even bigger story in 2026. Conclusion XRP’s leap past BNB to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency signals a shift in market dynamics and growing confidence in its long-term potential. The milestone underscores XRP’s resilience, strategic role in global payments, and appeal to investors seeking assets with strong utility, liquidity, and sustainable growth. As 2026 unfolds, XRP’s steady ascent positions it as a key contender shaping the future of the crypto market.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|XRP|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-03 11:33:30

According to reports, DeepSeek published a technical paper, which was co-authored by 19 people, including its CEO and founder, Liang Wenfeng, about “manifold-constrained hyper-connections.” The paper discussed the general framework for training artificial intelligence systems on a large scale, suggesting a promising direction for the future evolution of foundational models in the country. The release was a reminder to the world, especially during the peak of the festivities, about Chinese AI firms’ sharpened focus on innovation and their willingness to stay ahead in the fast-developing industry. China makes positive push to continue AI domination in 2026 The release of the paper came at the same time as last year, when DeepSeek announced itself to the global population. The platform began to catch the attention of the world after releasing its large language model (LLM) DeepSeek V3. Weeks later, the company released its reasoning model, DeepSeek-R1, on January 20. The two models matched or surpassed the performance of rival models across a range of benchmark tests, another metric that caught the eye of the global population. In addition, they were built at a fraction of the cost and computing power that major United States tech firms invest in building LLMs. The DeepSeek unveiling resulted in a massive sell-off on January 27, wiping out nearly $1 trillion in tech stocks, with Nvidia alone recording a $600 billion loss. Meanwhile, analysts have predicted that AI companies in China have the momentum to continue their impressive prowess this year, thanks to Beijing’s policy support. Aside from favorable policies, the firms have also enjoyed improved funding prospects, greater adoption of AI systems across industries, and a growing number of talents being recruited for these projects. A domestic AI startup co-founder, who spoke under anonymity, predicted that China could overtake the United States to become the world’s leading AI power in 2027. The co-founder named China’s talent pool as its major advantage in the race. Xi Jinping highlights healthy competition in the AI industry During his New Year’s address, Chinese President Xi Jinping mentioned that the market has seen many large AI models competing in a race to the top, while noting that breakthroughs were also being achieved in domestic semiconductor development. He highlighted that all of that has turned China into one of the economies with the fastest-growing innovation capabilities. Speaking about China’s innovation, Winston Ma, an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Law, with a focus on AI and the digital economy, mentioned that the country is prepped for a policy-driven innovation in 2026. Ma added that things could go well, considering that AI is placed at the center of China’s economic agenda and industrial upgrading plans. China currently plays host to a strong group of players in the AI industry developing powerful open models beyond DeepSeek, according to Stanford University’s DigiChina Project. The project is currently under the school’s Centre for International Security and Cooperation, and its Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, which compiles the annual AI Index report. They include the Qwen model developer Alibaba Cloud and startups like Moonshot AI, MiniMax, and Zhipu AI , which is known internationally as Z.ai. According to the report, China’s open-source AI models may have even caught up or pulled ahead of their United States counterparts in capabilities and adoption. For instance, Facebook’s parent company Meta Platforms was said to be using Alibaba Cloud’s open-source Qwen model for the training process for a new model called Avocado. Get seen where it counts.

SoFiUSD represents a strategic pivot into regulated financial infrastructure, enabling capital-light, high-margin, non-lending revenue expansion. Stablecoin reserves held at the Federal Reserve allow SoFi to earn interest with minimal credit or liquidity risk. Capital-light revenue already reached 56% of total revenue, with SoFiUSD potentially pushing this mix beyond 65% by 2026. Elevated valuation multiples place pressure on Q4 and 2026 execution, as dilution and weak operating cash flow remain key risks. Investment Thesis SoFi Technologies, Inc.’s ( SOFI ) 2026 bull case is reinforced by strong market performance and a timely reset. The stock delivered around 70% returns in 2025, materially outperforming the broader market. Since my last coverage , SOFI has pulled back roughly 12%, which I view as a constructive consolidation rather than a breakdown. Combined with the launch of SoFiUSD and its capital-light, high-margin revenue potential, this pause may be setting the foundation for the next leg higher as fundamentals expand. Data by YCharts SoFiUSD May Push Capital-Light Revenue Beyond 65% by 2026 I observe an important positive aspect in SoFi's recent developments that points to a new operational dimension for its business model. This is centering on SoFi’s move to become a financial infrastructure provider. Major development here is the announcement of the SoFiUSD stablecoin . Looking toward the Q4 earnings report and beyond, this move is a pivot from being a direct-to-consumer financial services application to also being a business-to-business enterprise platform. This move establishes a new potentially high-margin, capital-light topline that leverages SoFi’s most distinct asset, its national bank charter. SoFiUSD is a fully reserved US dollar stablecoin issued by SoFi Bank. Based on Q3 2025, if the capital light portion of their revenue (Financial Services and Technology Platform) is $534 million , which is approximately 56% of total revenue, achieving a 65% mix on the same revenue base would mean capital light revenue of approximately $617 million, leaving a difference of $83 million, a 16% increase. Q3 Earnings The bridge is not dependent on SoFi USD. The Loan Platform Business itself, which brought in $168 million in Q3, with an ARR exceeding $660+ million, is also a capital light and a fee-driven business. These two factors could potentially increase the contribution from 56% to 65% by 2026 with moderate adoption. The mechanics of this are central to my bullish thesis. The reserves backing the stablecoin are held as cash in SoFi’s federal bank account. This structure may lead to a level of security that eliminates both liquidity risk and credit risk for the reserves ( in a booming market ). It is a claim that entities without a national bank charter cannot make. IMG Also, as an entity dealing within the digital assets sector, the presence of such regulatory certainty and institutional security is a substantial differentiator. SoFi earns interest on stablecoin reserves held with the Federal Reserve. Under the assumption of about 3.5%, SoFiUSD balances worth the range of 2-5% of SoFi’s approximately $33 billion deposit base would mean reserves ranging between $0.66 billion and $1.65 billion and approximately between $46 and $115 million. An important point is that the revenue is mainly focused on partnering incentives instead of being directly channeled to profitability. Because SoFiUSD reserves are fully matched by an equivalent liability to stablecoin holders, they expand SoFi’s balance sheet symmetrically without materially increasing credit risk, risk-weighted assets, or equity capital requirements. SoFi’s monetization is more likely to come from transaction fees and B2B infrastructure revenue. The network effect therefore stems from volume and stickiness, as each new partner increases transaction activity and fee revenue, while stablecoin usage anchors clients to SoFi’s settlement and treasury stack. The Street also has not yet integrated the potential growth from SoFiUSD integration in SoFi’s topline, as I see no positive change in analysts estimates for Q4 . Q3 Earnings Moreover, this is like launching another product for its existing 12.6 million members . I think the intention for SoFiUSD is to enable SoFi to be a stablecoin infra provider for banks, fintechs, and enterprise-level platforms . This expands SoFi’s TAM largely. The stablecoin may also support settlement for card networks, retailers, and other businesses seeking 24/7 transactions at a lower cost. This pushes SoFi as a competitor to consumer banks based on being a foundational tech layer for other financial and non-financial companies. I see this leads to a much larger and larger market for SoFi. This move directly addresses a core issue in SoFi’s financial metrics. The profitability metrics like TTM cash from operations is a negative $2.95 billion . Here, the stablecoin business, is a capital-light and fee-based operation. It derived revenue and cash from transaction fees and the interest spread on reserves without putting SoFi’s own capital at risk in the same way lending business does. Post Q3-FY25, I mentioned the growing importance of capital-light revenue and pointed out that the Financial Services and Tech Platform segments derived 56% of total revenue. The stablecoin infra business is a direct extension of this operational focus. It diversifies income away from net interest margin from lending and moves it toward highly predictable scalable high-margin service fees. Q3 Earnings For the Q4 earnings, I will be looking for initial commentary on the adoption and progress of SoFiUSD. Even early indications of partnership deals and transaction volumes can reshape the market sentiment around SoFi stock. How? It changes the valuation from one based purely on consumer member growth and loan originations to one that includes enterprise software and transaction processing multiples. I think this new business line has the capacity to alter SoFi’s financial profile by boosting its non-lending revenue mix, improving overall margins, and deriving positive operating cash flow over the long term. This is a catalyst that was not present in the Q3 but may be a central point of inquiry for the Q4-FY25 and FY26 outlook. Why SoFiUSD Competes on Regulation, Not Scale SoFiUSD launches in a competitive environment where USDT and USDC are the leading stablecoins. The competitive advantage in the USDT and USDC stablecoins is size. The unique aspect about the launch of the SoFiUSD stablecoin is in its positioning, as opposed to its distribution. This stablecoin is bank-backed, a stablecoin created under a regulatory framework, as opposed to the existing stablecoins in the marketplace. Unlike USDT and USDC, which are issued by crypto-native firms or private consortiums, SoFiUSD is issued directly by a federally chartered bank. This means they are more focused on partnering with institutions who wish to harness the power of stablecoins rather than developing them in-house, remittances focused on compliance and speed of settlement, and perhaps even a payments/payment card network exploring using stablecoins instead. The best-case scenario isn't about capturing market share, but rather about the adoption of stablecoins in a more limited sub-niche. Q4 Must Outperform 70x Forward P/E Amid Repricing Risk The concern I find problematic for Q4 is the disconnect between SoFi stock’s market valuations and its current profitability and cash flow metrics. SoFi stock price appears to be based on flawless high-speed growth. This is creating a high-stakes environment for the upcoming Q4 report. The current market price of $26 seems to have fully priced in the strong Q3 results and upwardly revised guidance for 2025. Here, for the stock to appreciate further, SoFi must meet these elevated expectations at least and exceed them meaningfully. Any sign of deceleration presents a risk to the stock price downside due to the thin margin of safety afforded by its valuations. SoFi stock has a TTM P/E Non-GAAP of 90.09x against the sector median of 11.91x. The forward P/E non-GAAP is 73.21x, against the sector median of 11.48x. This points out that the market is paying a premium of more than 6-7 times for SoFi stock compared to its peers. The TTM Price/Sales ratio of 9.1x is nearly triple the sector median of 3.2x. These multiples suggest that upcoming growth is expected to be extraordinary and stable. This level of Street optimism makes SoFi stock vulnerable to downside shifts in sentiment. The Q4 report and the outlook for 2026 now carry the burden of justifying SOFI’s premium valuation. A big surprise may happen based on the historical pattern of large surprises in Q4s of 2023 and 2024. seekingalpha.com Furthermore, these high valuations are set against a weak underlying profitability. SoFi’s TTM ROCE is 8.59%, below the sector median of 10.90%. Whereas, SoFi’s business is not deriving cash from its core operations and is consuming capital to grow. This is common for high-growth companies, but I think it presents a risk as the Street is overlooking the current cash burn in anticipation of profits. If the timeline for stable positive operating cash flow is extended and if the growth in cash-burning segments outpaces cash-generating ones, the Street’s patience may become thin. Finally, the $1.5 billion public stock offering in early December complicates things here. The offering was priced at $27.5 per share, close to the current price. This action strengthened the balance sheet with an additional $1.5 billion in gross proceeds, but increased the number of outstanding shares by 54.5 million (before the underwriter's option). This dilution makes EPS growth more difficult to hit. The already high P/E ratio must now be justified against a higher share count. I think it is putting even more pressure on SoFi to deliver high net income growth in Q4-FY25 and FY26. Takeaway SoFiUSD reframes SoFi from a growth-dependent lender into a capital-light financial infrastructure provider. If adoption materializes, margins, cash flow, and valuation logic all change. The key risk isn’t demand, it’s timing. Early traction could force a rapid repricing as the market shifts from consumer fintech to regulated fintech platforms.",SOFI,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2026-01-03 11:44:52

After being one of the few global assets to end 2025 in the red , bitcoin’s price finally started to show some revival signs on January 2. Following a quiet January 1, in which it remained sideways between $87,000 and $88,000, the cryptocurrency went on the offensive yesterday and broke past $90,000 for the first time in about a week. This time, the bulls kept the pressure on and drove it even further north to a multi-week peak of $91,000. However, that was as far as BTC would go, at least for now, and it quickly retraced to $90,000. It added several hundred dollars late on Friday, but the explosions in Venezuela’s capital on Saturday morning halted its progress. Bitcoin dipped to $89,300 but now sits closer to $90,000 after US President Donald Trump confirmed that his country’s military was behind the strikes against Caracas. Moreover, he added that the US captured Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, who were flown out of the country. A press conference is expected later today, which could result in more volatility in the crypto market, given that it’s the only financial market open today.

This comprehensive analysis explores the technical, economic, and market factors that could influence Ethereum’s price between 2026 and 2030, providing a fact-based framework for understanding its future valuation. Ethereum’s Current Market Position and Historical Context Ethereum maintains its position as the world’s leading smart contract platform, with a market capitalization consistently exceeding $400 billion as of early 2025. The network’s transition to proof-of-stake consensus in September 2022 fundamentally altered its economic model, reducing new ETH issuance by approximately 90%. Subsequently, Ethereum has experienced multiple periods of net-negative issuance, where more ETH is burned through transaction fees than created through staking rewards. Historical price data reveals Ethereum’s volatility alongside remarkable growth. After reaching an all-time high near $4,900 in November 2021, ETH experienced a significant correction during the 2022-2023 bear market. However, the asset demonstrated resilience, recovering substantially as institutional adoption increased through spot ETF approvals and growing enterprise blockchain integration. Technical Upgrades Shaping Ethereum’s 2026-2030 Trajectory Ethereum’s development roadmap contains several critical upgrades that directly impact its value proposition. The ongoing implementation of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, known as proto-danksharding, significantly reduces layer-2 transaction costs. This enhancement makes decentralized applications more accessible to mainstream users. Further scalability improvements through full danksharding implementation are scheduled for 2026-2027. These upgrades could increase Ethereum’s transaction capacity to over 100,000 transactions per second. Additionally, continued optimizations to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism improve network security while reducing energy consumption by 99.95% compared to the previous proof-of-work system. Expert Analysis on Ethereum’s Fundamental Value Drivers Industry analysts emphasize several fundamental factors supporting Ethereum’s long-term valuation. Galaxy Digital researchers note Ethereum’s “triple-point asset” characteristics, functioning simultaneously as a store of value, consumption asset, and capital asset. This unique combination creates multiple demand vectors that could support price appreciation. Furthermore, Ethereum’s decentralized finance ecosystem continues expanding despite market fluctuations. Total value locked across Ethereum-based DeFi protocols consistently exceeds $50 billion, demonstrating sustained utility demand. The network also dominates the non-fungible token market, processing over $2 billion in monthly NFT trading volume across various marketplaces. Comparative Analysis: Ethereum Versus Competing Layer-1 Networks When evaluating Ethereum’s potential to reach $10,000, analysts must consider competitive dynamics within the blockchain sector. Several metrics highlight Ethereum’s enduring advantages: Developer Activity: Ethereum maintains the largest developer community with over 4,000 monthly active developers Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions including BlackRock and Fidelity offer Ethereum-based investment products Network Security: Ethereum’s staked value exceeds $100 billion, creating unprecedented cryptographic security Enterprise Integration: Companies like Microsoft, JPMorgan, and Visa utilize Ethereum for various blockchain solutions Despite competition from networks like Solana, Cardano, and Avalanche, Ethereum’s first-mover advantage and established ecosystem create significant network effects. These effects become increasingly difficult for competitors to overcome as more applications build on the platform. Macroeconomic Factors Influencing Ethereum’s 2026-2030 Price Global economic conditions substantially impact cryptocurrency valuations. The potential approval of additional Ethereum-based financial products, including futures ETFs and regulated staking derivatives, could increase institutional capital inflows. Monetary policy decisions by central banks worldwide also affect risk asset valuations, with lower interest rates typically benefiting growth-oriented assets like Ethereum. Regulatory developments represent another critical variable. Clear regulatory frameworks in major markets like the United States, European Union, and United Kingdom could reduce uncertainty for institutional investors. Conversely, restrictive regulations in significant economies might temporarily suppress price growth despite Ethereum’s fundamental strengths. Quantitative Models and Statistical Projections Multiple quantitative approaches provide frameworks for understanding Ethereum’s potential price trajectory. Stock-to-flow models, while controversial, suggest Ethereum’s reduced issuance post-Merge creates scarcity dynamics similar to Bitcoin. Network value-to-transaction ratios indicate Ethereum remains undervalued relative to its economic throughput. Historical volatility analysis reveals Ethereum’s price typically experiences 70-90% drawdowns during bear markets followed by exponential recoveries. If this pattern continues, reaching $10,000 by 2030 would require approximately a 5x increase from early 2025 levels, representing compound annual growth of 35-40%. This growth rate aligns with Ethereum’s historical performance during previous market cycles. Potential Roadblocks and Risk Factors Several challenges could impede Ethereum’s progress toward $10,000. Technical risks include potential security vulnerabilities in smart contracts or consensus mechanisms. Scalability limitations might persist despite ongoing upgrades, pushing users toward competing layer-1 or layer-2 solutions. Market structure risks also warrant consideration. The concentration of staked ETH among a few large providers raises concerns about network decentralization. Additionally, regulatory uncertainty regarding staking rewards and DeFi protocols creates potential compliance challenges for institutional participants. Conclusion Ethereum’s path to $10,000 by 2030 depends on multiple converging factors. The network must successfully implement its technical roadmap while maintaining developer engagement and user adoption. Macroeconomic conditions should remain favorable for risk assets, and regulatory clarity must improve in key jurisdictions. Based on current trajectories and historical patterns, Ethereum reaching $10,000 represents a challenging but plausible scenario that would require sustained growth across fundamental metrics. This Ethereum price prediction analysis provides a framework for evaluating the asset’s potential while acknowledging the inherent uncertainties in long-term cryptocurrency forecasting. FAQs Q1: What is the most realistic Ethereum price prediction for 2026? Most analysts project Ethereum could reach between $8,000 and $12,000 by 2026, assuming successful implementation of scalability upgrades and continued institutional adoption. However, predictions vary widely based on market conditions and technological developments. Q2: How does Ethereum 2.0 affect long-term price predictions? Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake consensus reduces new supply issuance by approximately 90%, creating deflationary pressure during periods of high network usage. This fundamental change supports higher long-term valuation models by altering the asset’s economic properties. Q3: What percentage return would Ethereum need to reach $10,000 by 2030? From early 2025 price levels around $2,000, Ethereum would need to appreciate approximately 400% to reach $10,000 by 2030. This represents a compound annual growth rate of roughly 30-35%, which aligns with the asset’s historical performance during bull markets. Q4: Which factors could prevent Ethereum from reaching $10,000? Potential obstacles include regulatory restrictions in major markets, failure to implement scalability solutions, significant security breaches, increased competition from alternative smart contract platforms, or prolonged unfavorable macroeconomic conditions for risk assets. Q5: How does institutional adoption impact Ethereum’s price trajectory? Institutional investment through ETFs, corporate treasury allocations, and regulated financial products increases buying pressure while reducing volatility. Major institutions currently hold approximately 8% of Ethereum’s circulating supply, with this percentage expected to grow as regulatory clarity improves.

The only problem I see is the war between Trump and Venezuela. If the conflict escalates, we’re going to have choppy price action,” economist Market Hokkage predicts. Political backlash from Liberals in the United States Before today’s events, congressional Democrats and some Republicans had attempted to limit Trump’s military options in Venezuela. They had been seeking to take away the POTUS’ powers through a congressional plea and forced votes in both the House and Senate, all of which were unsuccessful. Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona, a US Marine Corps veteran and part of the brigade against President Trump, wrote on X earlier today that the strikes are “illegal” and “the second unjustified war in his lifetime.” According to TRM Labs’ Country Crypto Adoption Index, Venezuela rose to 11th place globally in 2025, up from 14th in 2024, with just 27 million and a per capita GDP of $3,100. Venezuelans are using cryptocurrencies to preserve savings and to shield themselves from an unstable, inflation-ridden economy. The Trump critics propounded that airstrikes could stifle a growing crypto economy and destroy its oil economy that is already entangled with USDT. “If the United States succeeds in imposing control over Venezuela, and by extension over the world’s largest proven oil reserves, it will mark a major shift in global power. What happens in Venezuela will not stay in Latin America. It will shape the limits of American power, and the direction of geopolitical confrontation far beyond Caracas,” said Iranian journalist Ibrahim Majed.

After rebounding from recent lows, the asset now trades at a level that has historically determined whether XRP enters sustained bull markets or prolonged corrections. Market participants increasingly focus on higher-timeframe confirmation as momentum compresses near a decisive threshold. This discussion intensified following a technical outlook shared by Egrag Crypto , a widely followed analyst known for tracking XRP’s macro indicators. His analysis highlights a single long-term metric that has consistently separated XRP’s explosive growth phases from its most severe drawdowns. Why the 21-Month EMA Matters for XRP The 21-month exponential moving average has acted as a reliable trend validator throughout XRP’s trading history. During previous cycles, XRP produced its strongest macro rallies only after price broke above this moving average, retested it, and held it as support on higher timeframes. Those confirmations preceded XRP’s most aggressive upside expansions. #XRP 21-Month EMA: Green… or Red? The 21-month EMA has been #XRP ’s truth detector for years. Every time price breaks above the 21 EMA, retests, and HOLDS , we get explosive macro moves ( green circles). When price gets rejected and loses it, deep corrections… pic.twitter.com/eCjRf2RsbT — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) January 2, 2026 In contrast, whenever XRP failed to reclaim or lost the 21-month EMA on a monthly close, deep and extended corrections followed. This repeated behavior established the indicator as a long-term “truth detector” for XRP’s market direction. XRP Sits at the Decision Zone XRP now trades directly on the 21-month EMA, placing the market at a pivotal inflection point. Price action around this level reflects consolidation rather than weakness, as buyers continue to defend the zone while volatility tightens. This setup suggests that the market prepares for resolution rather than stagnation. According to Egrag Crypto’s assessment, the current structure closely resembles previous bullish launch phases where XRP held the EMA before entering powerful macro advances. While confirmation remains essential , present conditions align more with historical continuation patterns than with rejection scenarios. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bullish Outlook If Support Holds If XRP maintains support above the 21-month EMA on a monthly closing basis, the structure favors long-term base formation. Under this scenario, momentum can rebuild steadily, allowing liquidity to follow trend confirmation. Historical cycles show that once XRP confirms this support, price expansion often unfolds over multiple months rather than through short-lived spikes. Such a confirmation would strengthen projections toward double-digit price territory as the next macro phase develops. Downside Risk Hinges on Monthly Close The bearish scenario activates only if XRP closes a monthly candle below the 21-month EMA. A confirmed loss would weaken the long-term structure and shift risk toward deeper retracement zones . Past cycles show that XRP typically requires extended consolidation after losing this level before regaining bullish momentum. At present, this outcome remains conditional and unconfirmed. Why the Monthly Close Will Decide Everything Short-term volatility often distorts market perception, but the monthly close removes that noise. XRP’s positioning at the 21-month EMA means the next monthly candle could determine whether the asset resumes its macro uptrend or enters a corrective phase. History suggests this level rarely produces ambiguous outcomes once confirmation arrives. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Bithumb underwent its Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) inspection in March 2025 and has now been found culpable by the authorities. According to reports from local media, the crypto exchange has now been fined heavily for violating domestic regulations. In its statement, the FIU claimed that it discovered several compliance failures at Bithumb, including cases where the exchange breached AML protocols, had inadequate know-your-customer (KYC) processes, and a lapse in suspicious transfer reporting. The exchange could face significant penalties similar to those of Upbit and Korbit, depending on the type and amount of violations. Bithumb set to face penalties for AML violations The exact fine amount is still pending official announcement, but sources familiar with the happenings in the industry claim that the identification of systemic AML failures is similar to those at Upbit and Korbit. The exchange could receive a substantial fine, with sources estimating that it could match or exceed the $25 million that the financial regulator levied on Upbit. This is due to its huge market share and the additional investigation into its order book. Reports highlighted that the FIU has already finalized its audits and has proceeded to sanctions. The violations of Bithumb include failure to carry out due diligence on its customers, which includes incomplete verification of user identities, such as unclear pictures, improper address checks, and a lack of enhanced due diligence for high-risk customers. Upbit recorded 5.3 million such cases, while Korbit only saw 12,800 cases. In addition, Bithumb also allowed trades to be carried out by unverified users, violating rules that prohibit services until full KYC is completed. The platform also failed to report suspicious transactions, delaying or omitting reports on unusual trade activities to authorities. The FIU also claimed that Bithumb supported transactions carried out with unregistered local and international exchanges, increasing the rate of money laundering carried out across the border. FIU vows to stabilize the market to ensure trust Unlike Upbit and Korbit, Bithumb faced extra investigation into its order book management, which regulators alleged involved manipulative practices or insufficient monitoring, which could further amplify the seriousness of penalties on the exchange. The FIU mentioned that the issues it listed came from repeated or structural weaknesses, rather than isolated errors. The increase in volume of violations shows a lack of internal control despite Bithumb’s market dominance. The FIU mentioned that it will finalize details after Bithumb submits a response to its initial findings, with the process expected to conclude in the early part of 2026. This aligns with its methodical rollout, emphasizing deterrence over disruption. Meanwhile, the FIU has intensified scrutiny of major exchanges to ensure they are complying with AML and KYC rules. The latest set of penalties targeted crypto exchanges identified as the “Big Five”, which include Upbit, Coinone, GOPAX, Bithumb, and Korbit . The FIU said it plans to carry out follow-up measures for the other on-site inspections. The regulator also mentioned that it plans to impose sanctions on serious violations of special financial laws, noting that it will serve as a warning to other crypto firms. It has also made it known that it is not relenting in its efforts to improve the AML capabilities of crypto exchanges. The FIU said the violations appear to be caused by the rapid growth outpacing the compliance infrastructure, noting that it will support the crypto industry to grow with public trust.

Upcoming Apemars is the Only Real Comeback as Next Big Crypto With Over 30,000% ROI Potential",https://timestabloid.com/missed-every-big-run-like-cardano-upcoming-apemars-is-the-only/,"Imagine standing at a launchpad, watching a rocket ascend. The countdown is on, the engines roar, and the moment slips through your fingers. You realize you could have been part of something historic, but hesitation held you back. This isn’t fiction; it’s what many felt when Cardano first launched. Now, the next big crypto is preparing its liftoff, and joining the APEMARS ($APRZ) whitelist is your boarding call. Unlike the slow climb of conventional tokens, this mission is fast, structured, and cinematic. Each week marks a symbolic stage in a journey inspired by Commander Ape’s Mars expedition. Do you regret missing Cardano’s ICO? Consider this your chance to never experience it again. Every whitelist spot, every stage, every burn is engineered to propel early adopters forward. Early ADA Buyers Retired. Late Ones Wrote “I Should Have…” Posts Forever Think about this, early adopters got Cardano (ADA) at its ICO price of $0.0024. A small, calculated step then turned into a mind-blowing 129,000% gain when it hit its ATH of $3.10. Those who hesitated? They watched from the sidelines as fortunes were made, wishing they had acted faster. It wasn’t just numbers; it was life-changing. Simple decisions at the right time created massive wealth. Every second of delay meant missing out on a rocket that took off and never looked back. Now, the crypto universe is giving you another shot. A new project is opening whitelist registration, and the clock is ticking. The same hesitation that cost investors during Cardano’s ICO could cost you again, except this time, you can secure your whitelist spot before the rocket leaves. Don’t just read about history, be part of it. Joining the whitelist is the moment to act, because the window won’t wait, and the opportunity to ride a high-velocity, story-driven mission like APEMARS is here today. Whitelist of APEMARS ($APRZ): The Cardano-Level Opportunity Starts Here Joining the APEMARS ($APRZ) whitelist is where fortunes begin. This isn’t just another presale; it’s your opportunity to reserve your spot in a mission engineered for explosive momentum. Early adopters don’t wait; they position themselves while the window is wide open. Securing your whitelist spot now could give you early access before the mission accelerates toward Mars. The supply is limited and deliberately structured. Unsold whitelist allocations from future openings will be burned at critical checkpoints: Stages 6, 12, 18, and 23. Every burn shrinks the available supply, turning scarcity into a powerful force that rewards those who act first. Joining the whitelist now gives you access before scarcity tightens, putting you ahead of the crowd. And it’s not just about numbers, it’s about momentum. The presale unfolds across 23 symbolic stages, each reflecting Commander Ape’s legendary Mars expedition. Joining the whitelist offers early access, giving participants a chance to claim their position before demand increases. Hesitation could cost you dearly. Think of those who missed Cardano’s ICO watching fortunes soar while they stayed on the sidelines.

The rocket is on the pad, don’t let it leave without you. $50 Today or Regret Posts Tomorrow: Stage 1 Will Handing Out 322× Returns Here’s what most people don’t realize: joining the whitelist gives you early access to Stage 1 tokens, and $50 at Stage 1, priced at just $0.00001699 per token, locks in approximately 2,943,240 APEMARS. That’s less than your weekend takeout. Less than a tank of gas. Yet when this rocket lists at $0.0055, that throwaway fifty transforms into $16,187. A 32,269% ROI that makes early Bitcoin look tame. Let that number burn into your brain: sixteen thousand dollars from pocket change. The window isn’t closing, it’s vaporizing. Sitting idle while generational wealth boards the shuttle without you? That’s the real gamble. Whitelist access ensures you’re first in line for Stage 1 tokens before they sell out. The only question left: are you in, or are you going to explain to yourself in six months why you weren’t? Why Joining the Whitelist Puts You Ahead of Everyone Else Whitelist members don’t just wait; they move first. By joining, you gain early updates and exclusive announcements, ensuring you know about timelines, access windows, and feature activations before anyone else.

The pre-launch phase began on April 1, following the conclusion of the presale. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market’s revival continues, with Bitcoin (BTC) on the verge of reclaiming $90,000. The flagship cryptocurrency is up almost 1% at $89,440. Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and other tokens are also trading in positive territory. Husky Inu AI (HINU) Reaches $0.00024675 Husky Inu AI’s (HINU) latest price increase has taken the value of the HINU token from $0.00024581 to $0.00024675. The price increase is part of the project’s pre-launch phase, which began on April 1, 2025. The pre-launch allows the project to continue its fundraising efforts while empowering its growing community and existing token holders. It also helps the team to secure capital, fund platform improvements, undertake market initiatives, and support broader ecosystem expansion. The project has raised $917,618 so far as fundraising picks up once again. Investors had adopted a wait-and-watch approach, but the recent uptick suggests risk appetite has returned. The project crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached the $850,000 milestone in July and crossed $900,000 in October. However, fundraising has picked up again over the past few days as investor sentiment turns positive. Official Launch Date Husky Inu AI’s official launch date is now under three months away. However, the team remains open to the possibility of an earlier or later launch, depending on market conditions. The team will conduct a series of review meetings to determine the project’s launch date. The first two review meetings were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025, while the third is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Cryptocurrency Market Continues Uptrend Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market extended its uptrend as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and other tokens traded in positive territory. The flagship cryptocurrency briefly crossed the $90,000 mark on January 2, reaching an intraday high of $90,832. However, with sellers active above $90,000, bulls lost momentum as the price dipped back below $90,000. However, buyers have prevented further downside, as BTC has held above $89,000. The price is up nearly 1% over the past 24 hours, trading around $89,634. On the other hand, Ethereum (ETH) reclaimed $3,000 on Friday as bullish sentiment returned. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency rallied from $3,025 to an intraday high of $3,143 before moving to $3,095, up over 2%. Ripple (XRP) is up 7% and Solana (SOL) is up over 2% at $130. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up almost 7% and Cardano (ADA) is trading in positive territory, up 6% at $0.386. Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Toncoin (TON), Litecoin (LTC), and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered notable price increases over the past 24 hours.

The exchange recounts its expansion from 50 million to 80 million registered users, global regulatory and compliance advancements, and trading highs across metrics amid market challenges. Despite the hacking incident in February, Bybit stood firm as the second largest centralized exchange, with 2025 marking the year it strengthened its ecosystem and solidified its position for future growth. Global Regulatory Alignment In July, Bybit’s Vienna-based operation secured full MiCA compliance across applicable EEA countries via local authorizations in Austria. In MENA’s blockchain and crypto hub, Bybit received the UAE’s first SCA Virtual Asset Platform Operator License in October, enabling full trading, custody, and fiat services nationwide. Bybit has also recently relaunched its services in the UK after a 2-year hiatus, now offering spot and P2P crypto trading for UK users by partnering with FCA-regulated Archax to comply with strict financial promotion rules, providing access to around 100 trading pairs. Security: From Setback to Strength In February 2025, Bybit faced a major cyberattack with approximately $1.4 billion in ETH stolen in an incident linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. The attack proved to be the ultimate stress test for the exchange as it rose from defense to recovery and growth. The platform ensured zero loss in client funds via its 1:1 reserve guarantee, restored reserves within 72 hours through partners’ support, and processed over 350,000 withdrawal requests in the initial 12 hours. The immediate actions taken not only helped Bybit avert the crisis, but also prevented the potential contagion effects across the crypto ecosystem. In the aftermath, Bybit recovered BTC liquidity to $13 million daily in 30 days, surpassing industry benchmarks per Kaiko . In a report by Glassnode , analysts noted that ETH’s trading volume on Bybit reached a new daily all-time high of $8.5 billion despite the hack during the summer rally, reflecting the unwavering community trust and Bybit’s operational resilience and financial depth. The breach also prompted Bybit’s security taskforce to evolve and build towards a new infrastructure that contributes to industry-wide safety. A slew of over 50 security upgrades were conducted after 9 security audits within a month, establishing new trust benchmarks. With the establishment of the Lazarus Bounty program , Bybit offers an open invitation for experts to join the hunt and potentially help other victims of crypto-related cybercrime. Bybit Spot: Early Access Strategy, Year-Round Breakout Listings In 2025, Bybit Spot consolidated its listing strategies to effectively identify and list quality assets ahead of the hype and market saturation. The platform excelled at early discovery and advanced access for its users, connecting Bybit traders to emerging opportunities uniquely found on Bybit. In January, TRUMP recorded up to 548% gains on Bybit. Community-led DeFi project TUNA surged 2,637% on its first day of listing on Bybit, and MET hit 255% on day one. These results demonstrate Bybit Spot’s forward-looking listing strategy in unlocking early market trends. In real-world assets (RWA) tokenization, Bybit Spot also remained at the industry forefront. The platform pioneered incorporating RWA assets like XAUT, with the asset reaching 127% in gains, and launched xStocks for on-chain U.S. equity trading, leading the tokenized equities trend. Additionally, Bybit Spot unleashed up to $40 million in total rewards through projects like NXPC and NIGHT, mobilizing market momentum into tangible returns for users. Through strategies focusing on ahead-of-the-curve market entry, early access, and user-centric mechanisms, Bybit Spot concluded an exciting year of traders. Trading Volume, Hybrid Trading, and Ecosystem Strategy Throughout 2025, Bybit has sustained its No. 2 spot among exchanges by monthly trading volume . The momentum carried on during the relatively quiet winter trading season and the broader market downturn, recording a 24-hour spot trading volume of $9.1 billion on December 22, 2025. Beyond the numbers, Bybit also intensified its all-inclusive strategies and ecosystem play. Now supporting all things on- and off-chain within one interface: The revamped Bybit Alpha enables Bybit users to navigate on-chain opportunities, discover the hottest tokens, and explore liquidity farming without leaving the Bybit app. Byreal , a Bybit-incubated Solana DEX launched in early October 2025, surpassed $1 billion in cumulative trading volume within 10 weeks, with $10.88 million TVL and top-10 Solana DEX rankings for 30-day fees, revenue, and supporting 40+ assets including tokenized RWAs. Launched in May 2025, Bybit TradFi debuted as the first major CEX platform to integrate gold, forex, global indices, commodities, and over 100 stock CFDs with up to 500x leverage for eligible users. In September, Bybit TradFi introduced 24/5 trading for 20+ stock CFDs including tech giants like NVDA, TSLA, and AAPL to align TradFi hours with crypto’s 24/7 model. Bybit also integrated xStocks in June 2025 with dozens of tokenized U.S. equities and ETFs via Backed Finance, offering 24/7 settlement on Solana for global access. Riding on regulatory wins in 2025, Bybit Institutional saw substantial institutional growth with asset inflows surging from $1.3 billion in Q3 to $2.88 billion in Q4, while its wealth management operation’s assets under management (AUM) expanded fivefold from $40 million to $200 million. Bybit Earn continues to offer innovative and diverse products including Mantle Vault, a stablecoin on-chain yield asset management product optimized for APR performance, which hit $52 million in AUM within 7 days of launching. Mantle’s strategic partnership with Bybit in 2025 introduced MNT as a multi-functional asset supporting fee discounts, institutional leverage trading, RWA tokenization, and high-yield staking opportunities on Bybit, while Bybit, Mantle, and other ecosystem partners collaborated to deliver institutional-grade DeFi liquidity solutions. Over 2 million Bybit Card users and expanding footprint of Bybit Pay attest to the ecosystem strength of Bybit, empowering users to make the most of their digital assets in everyday life, from buying a morning coffee to creating memories at Tomorrowland Brasil . Whether traders are building a diversified portfolio in TradFi, gold, commodities, and crypto, seeking frictionless on-chain yield via Bybit Alpha and Bybit Earn, or going for the fully on-chain experience in Byreal, the Bybit ecosystem has it all.
