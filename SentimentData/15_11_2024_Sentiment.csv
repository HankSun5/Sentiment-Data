A crypto analyst of Trading View has discussed several factors that could propel the Dogecoin price even higher, potentially hitting the $1 mark in this bull market. Key Drivers To Send The Dogecoin Price To $1 A recent post on TradingView discusses the potential for the Dogecoin price to soon hit the coveted $1 milestone. Presenting compelling factors, the report suggests that Dogecoin could see its price surging to $1 with the influence of SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analyst Sets $320,000 Target As Wave 5 Begins To put it more clearly, TradingView has revealed that Musk’s steadfast support and devotion to DOGE could allow the meme coin to steadily grow to a $130 billion market capitalization, representing a $1 price surge. In addition, Dogecoin‘s increasing popularity in the financial space is also set to catalyze a potential price surge. Currently, Dogecoin is one of the most talked-about meme coins in the market, as the cryptocurrency has among the top gainers in this bull market. With more users and investors flooding into the DOGE ecosystem, demand and adoption are poised to rise, potentially triggering a major price spike. According to CoinMarketCap, the Dogecoin price has increased by a staggering 250% in just one month. This massive price surge saw the meme coin jump from around the $0.2 price level to new highs around $0.4. TradingView’s report noted that many analysts foresee the Dogecoin price hitting the $1 price tag in the near future. Notably, Jeremy, a prominent crypto analyst, told his 180,300 followers on X (formerly Twitter) that the Dogecoin price is gearing up to reach $1, driven by Musk’s support and the integration of the meme coin in America’s economy. Other X crypto analysts like ‘Bark’ have projected even higher price surges for DOGE, believing it could rise to $10. DOGE Outperforms Bitcoin During its report, TradingView also revealed that the Dogecoin price is currently outperforming Bitcoin by 150%. As mentioned earlier, Dogecoin has been on a parabolic run recently, jumping 110% in just one week while still accumulating gains as of writing. TradingView’s report revealed that following Trump’s Presidential win in the concluded US election, the Dogecoin price rallied 180%.

This massive price surge outperformed Bitcoin, which grew only 30% within the same period. While Bitcoin’s price is significantly larger than DOGE and has successfully achieved a new ATH, DOGE, with a lower price of around $0.4, is viewed as a more accessible and profitable option for smaller investors. Despite the clear gains in the Dogecoin price, analysts from TradingView caution against jumping headfirst too quickly. They warn that downturns remain possible and low prices can be deceptive.

According to his analysis, the XRP price is possibly forming a technical pattern known as a “bull flag” after decisively breaking above the multi-year resistance at $0.6649, a move that has been further substantiated by two consecutive daily closes above this key level. XRP Price To Reach $1.03 This Week? A “bull flag” pattern occurs when the price of an asset moves sharply higher, then consolidates in a narrow, downward-sloping range, resembling a flag on a pole. This pattern is typically considered a continuation pattern, suggesting that after the consolidation phase, the price is likely to break out upward in the direction of the initial sharp movement. In the context of XRP, the flagpole was formed by the steep price increase from $0.52 leading up to the break above $0.6649. Furthermore, Dark Defender points out the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is currently in the overbought territory at 84. An overbought RSI often indicates that the asset might temporarily pause or consolidate due to short-term selling pressure as traders take profits. Related Reading: XRP NVT Ratio Has Been High Recently: What It Means This aligns with the expectation of the consolidation phase of the bull flag pattern. However, an overbought RSI in the context of a bull flag pattern can also indicate strong underlying momentum, suggesting that once consolidation is complete, a breakout to the upside could follow. Dark Defender highlights the next substantial price target at $1.03, which could be achieved swiftly if XRP manages to ascend beyond the immediate resistance near $0.7496. Specifically, touches or minor closings above $0.7496, with potential surges to $0.76 or higher, are deemed critical for this bullish scenario to unfold. Should these conditions be met, Dark Defender expects that the price of XRP could rally to $1.03 within this week. Related Reading: XRP Surges To $0.74, Reaching Its Highest Price Since Mid-March: Here’s Why Notably, the analysis also rests on the understanding of Fibonacci levels, which are used extensively in crypto trading to predict potential support and resistance levels based on prior market movements. The level at $0.6649, now surpassed, could likely serve as a 70.20% retracement from the previous market high to low. If this level is breached to the downside, the bull flag pattern could extend more to the downside. Then, the 61.80% and 50% Fibonacci levels at $0.6044 and $0.5286 could serve as a support zone from which the XRP price could escalate above $1. The analyst states: “XRP closed 2 days in a row above $0.6649. Now we can say this Fibonacci Level is dead, too. There are no more substantial levels than this until $1.03. If we see touches above $0.7496, such as $0.76 or more, we can quickly expect the $1.03 this week.This is not financial advice but my expectation. Remember, XRP broke the multi-year (7) resistance of $0.6649 in NOVEMBER 2024.” At press time, XRP traded at $0.7086.
