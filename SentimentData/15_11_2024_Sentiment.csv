A crypto analyst of Trading View has discussed several factors that could propel the Dogecoin price even higher, potentially hitting the $1 mark in this bull market. Key Drivers To Send The Dogecoin Price To $1 A recent post on TradingView discusses the potential for the Dogecoin price to soon hit the coveted $1 milestone. Presenting compelling factors, the report suggests that Dogecoin could see its price surging to $1 with the influence of SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analyst Sets $320,000 Target As Wave 5 Begins To put it more clearly, TradingView has revealed that Musk’s steadfast support and devotion to DOGE could allow the meme coin to steadily grow to a $130 billion market capitalization, representing a $1 price surge. In addition, Dogecoin‘s increasing popularity in the financial space is also set to catalyze a potential price surge. Currently, Dogecoin is one of the most talked-about meme coins in the market, as the cryptocurrency has among the top gainers in this bull market. With more users and investors flooding into the DOGE ecosystem, demand and adoption are poised to rise, potentially triggering a major price spike. According to CoinMarketCap, the Dogecoin price has increased by a staggering 250% in just one month. This massive price surge saw the meme coin jump from around the $0.2 price level to new highs around $0.4. TradingView’s report noted that many analysts foresee the Dogecoin price hitting the $1 price tag in the near future. Notably, Jeremy, a prominent crypto analyst, told his 180,300 followers on X (formerly Twitter) that the Dogecoin price is gearing up to reach $1, driven by Musk’s support and the integration of the meme coin in America’s economy. Other X crypto analysts like ‘Bark’ have projected even higher price surges for DOGE, believing it could rise to $10. DOGE Outperforms Bitcoin During its report, TradingView also revealed that the Dogecoin price is currently outperforming Bitcoin by 150%. As mentioned earlier, Dogecoin has been on a parabolic run recently, jumping 110% in just one week while still accumulating gains as of writing. TradingView’s report revealed that following Trump’s Presidential win in the concluded US election, the Dogecoin price rallied 180%.

This massive price surge outperformed Bitcoin, which grew only 30% within the same period. While Bitcoin’s price is significantly larger than DOGE and has successfully achieved a new ATH, DOGE, with a lower price of around $0.4, is viewed as a more accessible and profitable option for smaller investors. Despite the clear gains in the Dogecoin price, analysts from TradingView caution against jumping headfirst too quickly. They warn that downturns remain possible and low prices can be deceptive.

According to his analysis, the XRP price is possibly forming a technical pattern known as a “bull flag” after decisively breaking above the multi-year resistance at $0.6649, a move that has been further substantiated by two consecutive daily closes above this key level. XRP Price To Reach $1.03 This Week? A “bull flag” pattern occurs when the price of an asset moves sharply higher, then consolidates in a narrow, downward-sloping range, resembling a flag on a pole. This pattern is typically considered a continuation pattern, suggesting that after the consolidation phase, the price is likely to break out upward in the direction of the initial sharp movement. In the context of XRP, the flagpole was formed by the steep price increase from $0.52 leading up to the break above $0.6649. Furthermore, Dark Defender points out the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is currently in the overbought territory at 84. An overbought RSI often indicates that the asset might temporarily pause or consolidate due to short-term selling pressure as traders take profits. Related Reading: XRP NVT Ratio Has Been High Recently: What It Means This aligns with the expectation of the consolidation phase of the bull flag pattern. However, an overbought RSI in the context of a bull flag pattern can also indicate strong underlying momentum, suggesting that once consolidation is complete, a breakout to the upside could follow. Dark Defender highlights the next substantial price target at $1.03, which could be achieved swiftly if XRP manages to ascend beyond the immediate resistance near $0.7496. Specifically, touches or minor closings above $0.7496, with potential surges to $0.76 or higher, are deemed critical for this bullish scenario to unfold. Should these conditions be met, Dark Defender expects that the price of XRP could rally to $1.03 within this week. Related Reading: XRP Surges To $0.74, Reaching Its Highest Price Since Mid-March: Here’s Why Notably, the analysis also rests on the understanding of Fibonacci levels, which are used extensively in crypto trading to predict potential support and resistance levels based on prior market movements. The level at $0.6649, now surpassed, could likely serve as a 70.20% retracement from the previous market high to low. If this level is breached to the downside, the bull flag pattern could extend more to the downside. Then, the 61.80% and 50% Fibonacci levels at $0.6044 and $0.5286 could serve as a support zone from which the XRP price could escalate above $1. The analyst states: “XRP closed 2 days in a row above $0.6649. Now we can say this Fibonacci Level is dead, too. There are no more substantial levels than this until $1.03. If we see touches above $0.7496, such as $0.76 or more, we can quickly expect the $1.03 this week.This is not financial advice but my expectation. Remember, XRP broke the multi-year (7) resistance of $0.6649 in NOVEMBER 2024.” At press time, XRP traded at $0.7086.

Notably, the ongoing price rally has seen relatively muted profit-taking, fueling hopes that BTC has further room to surge. Low Profit-Taking For Bitcoin In Current Cycle According to a recent report by Glassnode, the current BTC price momentum is primarily driven by strong spot demand and rising institutional interest. Particularly, the victory of Republican US presidential candidate Donald Trump has added optimism to the digital assets industry. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Peak In 200 Days, Before US Recession In Mid-2025, Report Says The report highlights that over 95% of Bitcoin’s supply is currently in profit. However, despite the high proportion of profitable holders, profit-taking has remained relatively muted during this cycle. Historically, monthly profit realization has typically ranged between $30 and $50 billion during previous Bitcoin ATH cycles. The current price discovery phase has seen about $20.4 billion in realized profit. This relatively low profit-taking level in the current BTC ATH cycle suggests further room for the BTC price to rise, potentially reaching the $100,000 milestone before demand wanes. The chart below shows the cost basis of new BTC investors, along with upper and lower statistical bands. According to the report, during an ATH phase, BTC’s price repeatedly tests the upper bands as new investors enter the market at higher price points. As can be inferred from the above chart, BTC’s current spot price of $91,199 is just below its upper band of $94,900. Keeping track of price movement between these bands can show when the market price might be high enough to force existing holders to sell their holdings. Excess Leverage Must Be Flushed Before $100,000 BTC While BTC is trading less than 10% below the $100,000 level, industry experts opine that excess leverage must be flushed out before the top digital asset attempts to hit the 6-figure target. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $100,000 By February 2025? Analyst Explains Why Data from Coinglass shows that more than $718 million worth of crypto contracts were liquidated in the past 24 hours, impacting 202,074 traders. Notably, contract liquidations were split pretty evenly between longs and shorts – 49.93% vs 50.07%, respectively – indicating that despite the strong bullish sentiment, there is no clear trading advantage. Some industry leaders remain optimistic about BTC’s future price action. In October, the BTC mining firm CleanSpark CEO said that the premier digital asset may peak at $200,000 in the next 18 months. Similarly, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes recently predicted that BTC may hit $1 million under the Trump administration. BTC trades at $91,199 at press time, up 3.9% in the past 24 hours.

The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $0.7240 support zone. XRP Price Gains Strength XRP price remained supported above the $0.620 level. It formed a base and started a strong increase above $0.7000. It outperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past two sessions, with a move above the $0.740 resistance. The price even climbed above the $0.850 level before the bears appeared. A high was formed at $0.8989 before there was a pullback. The price dipped below $0.820 and tested $0.720. It tested the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.6700 swing low to the $0.8989 high. The price is now trading above $0.750 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.740 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.6700 swing low to the $0.8989 high. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.8450 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.8880 level. The next key resistance could be $0.900. A clear move above the $0.900 resistance might send the price toward the $0.9250 resistance.

The price is consolidating and might aim for a fresh increase above the $635 level. BNB price started a downside correction from the $665 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $640 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $620 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $600 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Holds Support After a close above the $620 level, BNB price extended its increase. However, upsides were limited above $660 and the price remained capped, unlike Ethereum and Bitcoin. There was a move below the $632 and $620 levels. However, the price is now holding gains above the $600 level. A low was formed at $616 and the price is now consolidating near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $661 swing high to the $616 low. The price is now trading below $620 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $620 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $626 level. The next resistance sits near the $638 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $661 swing high to the $616 low. A clear move above the $638 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $650. A close above the $650 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $665 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $680 level in the near term. More Losses? If BNB fails to clear the $638 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $620 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $615 level. The main support sits at $600. If there is a downside break below the $600 support, the price could drop toward the $585 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $565 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is losing pace in the bullish zone.

Bitcoin Experiences Significant Liquidation Activity According to Bloomberg data, the premium for CME-listed Bitcoin futures contracts—commonly used by institutional investors to speculate on price movements—has decreased, indicating a potential shift in market sentiment. K33 Research notes that the basis, or the difference between the futures price and the spot price, has dropped to around 10% after previously hovering between 13% and 16% since the election. Related Reading: New Era For Crypto Regulation? SEC Chair Gensler Suggests He May Step Down Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33, remarked, “Markets seem to be cooling down… that might have been a subtle hint of moderating risk profiles.” This shift suggests that investors may be reassessing their strategies in light of the recent price volatility. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $87,970, down from its all-time high of $93,462 reached just a day ago. Since Trump’s election victory, the cryptocurrency has seen an increase of over 30%. However, this rally has been accompanied by significant liquidation of leveraged bullish positions. In the past 24 hours, liquidations of long positions—those betting on price increases—totaled $447 million, compared to $207 million for bearish bets. Renewed Trader Interest Profit-taking is also contributing to the recent downturn, particularly as Bitcoin approached the $90,000 mark, which has historically been a significant level for open interest in call options. James Davies, CEO of Crypto Valley Exchange, noted, “Crazy speculative days in the market, big profit taking in the last few hours… $90k is a massive level in the call options open interest.” The rally has primarily been fueled by fresh demand in the spot market, evidenced by substantial inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) backed by Bitcoin and relatively moderate leverage among traders. Interestingly, the funding rate for Bitcoin perpetual futures on offshore exchanges rose after falling earlier in the week, indicating renewed interest among traders after the so-called “Trump trade” catalyst. Related Reading: Solana ‘God Candle Is Close’ As It Breaks From Crucial Resistance – Top Analyst Options traders are increasingly optimistic, with growing interest in calls with strike prices at $110,000 and $120,000, according to data from Deribit. As Davies commented, “It’s all pure speculative trading right now, expect lots of volatility and a lack of clear signals for a while whilst we wait for policy announcements in the U.S.” As the market approaches the expiry of November options, all eyes will be on whether the $90,000 price point will serve as a resistance level or if Bitcoin can surpass it once again.

However, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has since experienced a pullback and is currently trading around $88,800. Market analyst Quinten Francois has suggested that this retracement could extend further, potentially dropping below the $80,000 mark due to a significant CME gap located beneath this level. 12% Retracement Ahead? CME gaps refer to price discrepancies on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Bitcoin futures chart, where the closing price of one trading day differs from the opening price of the next. These gaps often arise following substantial price movements and are typically filled as the market stabilizes. Francois has identified a CME gap at the $78,000 level, which would represent a retracement of just over 12% from current prices if filled in the coming days. Related Reading: Solana Rising: Key Metrics Hint At Serious Ethereum Competitor Such a correction could be healthy for BTC, as it often liquidates long positions, setting the stage for future upward movements. Historical patterns suggest that these pullbacks can provide the necessary liquidity for the cryptocurrency to advance further. However, if Bitcoin sees increased selling pressure at this level, additional support levels are identified at $72,000 and $69,000. The potential for a drop below these levels would take BTC back to the prices seen before Donald Trump’s election victory on November 5th, which many believe was a catalyst for the recent price spike. Could Trump’s Bitcoin Strategy Influence Future Price Movements During his presidential campaign, Trump continuously expressed his intention to support the growth of digital assets, positioning Bitcoin as a central element of his next administration’s economic policy. One of Trump’s promises includes establishing Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset for the United States. Pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis has taken this initiative to the Senate by introducing the Bitcoin Act, which aims to increase US Bitcoin reserves to 1 million coins, potentially reducing market supply and positively impacting the BTC price. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could See Swift 175% Surge As DOGE/BTC Pair Records Major Breakout Francois has also forecasted a bear market for the broader cryptocurrency sector, predicting it could emerge between 2026 and 2027. This suggests that the next two years will likely witness an extended bull run for Bitcoin and the overall digital asset ecosystem. However, the expert cautioned that if the $78,000 CME gap is not filled before a significant price rally, it may need to be addressed in the subsequent bear market phase, suggesting further price fluctuations ahead.

Bitcoin Retail Interest Has Returned In Explosive Fashion Bitcoin has witnessed a massive surge recently and has come closer to the $100,000 dream target than many had expected. Investor interest in the asset had cooled off during the cryptocurrency’s endless consolidation, but with a rally like this, it has naturally made a return. In the context of the current discussion, the investor focus segment is retail, which includes the smallest of the holders. The first metric that would hint at a return of these investors in the market is the New Addresses, which keeps track of the total amount of BTC addresses coming online for the first time. Related Reading: Dogecoin & Co. Take Over Social Media: Why Memecoin Frenzy Is Bad For Bitcoin As the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has pointed out in an X post, the Bitcoin New Addresses have witnessed a sharp increase recently, suggesting a large amount of address creation. The New Addresses can register an uptick when new investors join the network or when old ones who had sold earlier come back to the asset. The metric also goes up when existing users create multiple wallets for privacy. However, when a surge occurs at a scale like the recent one, the former is more likely to be the reason. Thus, the latest trend in the indicator could imply a high amount of fresh adoption for the cryptocurrency. As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin New Addresses recently hit a high of 442,000, the highest daily value since March of this year. Large investors are also likely joining the network right now, but their number certainly wouldn’t be too high, so this adoption must come from retail investors. Another indicator, the Retail Investor Demand 30D Change, provides us with information about the activity of existing and newcomer retail investors right now. As CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has explained in an X post, this indicator has also recently shot up. This metric tracks retail investor demand through transaction volume. Since the members of this cohort carry balance amounts that aren’t too significant, their transfers tend to involve small values as well. As such, their volume can be measured by only involving data of the transfers valued at less than $10,000. From the chart, it’s apparent that the 30-day change in the volume of retail investors has recently seen a large positive spike to levels not seen in more than four years.

BTC Price Bitcoin has seen a bit of a setback in the past day as its price has now dropped to the $88,300 level.
