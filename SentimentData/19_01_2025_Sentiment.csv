Bitcoin Price Briefly Tops $105K After the latest market meltdown, the Bitcoin price has breached the six-figure realm, signaling that the bulls are now in command. The largest and oldest crypto asset gained over 4% in the last 24 hours, rising from just under $90,000 on Jan. 13 to a price of $105,850, according to CoinGecko data. BTC has since cooled to $104,114 as of publication time. Nevertheless, the asset is just 3.5% away from its current all-time high price of $108,135, set in December 2024. Trump’s Swearing-In Is Only Days Away Expectations among crypto market observers are increasing as Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 47th president of the United States on Jan. 20 draws closer. Many anticipate that Trump will implement plans for crypto right from day one in office. The incoming president pledged pre-election to position the US as a leader in the crypto sector, including establishing a national strategic Bitcoin stockpile similar to gold. This is in stark contrast to the Joe Biden administration’s regulatory crackdowns and regulatory enforcement actions. If this were to be executed, the US Treasury would have to purchase one million BTC over five years, resulting in a supply crunch. Although direct government BTC buys remain uncertain, prohibiting sales of the US government’s current stash could reduce selling pressure and fortify the top crypto’s position as a legitimate asset class, further incorporating it into global financial markets. According to a Thursday Bloomberg report, Trump is looking to issue a pro-crypto executive order to elevate digital assets to a “national priority” shortly after his inauguration. Sources claim that this could include setting up a new crypto advisory council of industry leaders for policy recommendations. Trump is also expected to address crypto-debanking and repeal a bank accounting policy that compels banks to list crypto assets as liabilities. It’s worth mentioning that the New York Post recently reported that Trump is open to expanding a possible strategic reserve to include a basket of cryptos founded in the U.S., such as USD Coin (USDC), Solana (SOL), and Ripple’s XRP.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|BTCUSD|BTCUSDC|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency News|XBTUSD,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-18 21:35:51

Over the past few months, Selkis’ scorn for the San Francisco-based company and its cross-border payments token XRP seems to have taken a darker turn. The pundit slammed Ripple’s attempts to create ties with the forthcoming Donald Trump government. Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty dined with President-elect Trump earlier this month. Selkis Takes A Swipe At Ripple And XRP Messari’s Ryan Selkis has once again taken aim at Ripple and XRP. In a recent post on the X platform, Selkis described Ripple as a threat to the Trump administration’s cryptocurrency agenda, cautioning that XRP’s recent market strides are generally detrimental. The industry expert noted that XRP has surpassed Salesforce in market cap and is nearing the market capitalization of Bank of America. Moreover, XRP is now bigger than ride-hailing giant Uber, Spotify, PayPal, and MicroStrategy combined. In addition, the third-largest crypto is basically 5X the size of America’s biggest crypto exchange, Coinbase. “Ripple’s crash and scandals will take down the entire crypto agenda in DC,” Selkis wrote. XRP is now bigger than Salesforce and approaching BofA in market cap. + Top 30 US company. + Twice the value of Uber. + Bigger than Shopify, PayPal, and Microstrategy combined. + 5x the size of Coinbase. Ripple’s crash and scandals will take down the entire crypto agenda in DC. — Ryan Selkis (d/acc) (@twobitidiot) January 16, 2025 It’s worth mentioning that XRP currently commands a $178 billion market cap following its recent rally, while Salesforce is valued at $310 billion. But for Selkis and other Ripple critics, this does little to detract from the fact that Ripple’s parabolic growth is a potential threat to crypto. Selkis, meanwhile, claims that Ripple will unleash doom for crypto. In a follow-up post intended to explain his aversion to Ripple, he posited that the company’s executives were not good people, possibly referencing co-founder Chris Larsen and CEO Bradley Garlinghouse. “The reason I’m a dick about Ripple isn’t because I care about XRP or its memecoin rally. I’m happy for all of the retail holders who have made bank. My issue with them is that they aren’t content with just being billionaires, they lust for power,” Selkis asserted. Ripple And The Trump Administration As ZyCrypto reported previously, Ripple donated $5 million worth of XRP to Trump’s presidential inaugural fund. Reports say that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Trump could review its crypto-related cases and pause any that don’t have fraud allegations. Industry lawyers also bet that the SEC will soon abandon its crypto cases . Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty said on Jan. 15 that the regulator’s long-running enforcement case against the firm was “likely to be abandoned” by the incoming Trump administration after the agency filed an appeal challenging a July 2023 ruling that partially dismissed claims against the company. More interestingly, Trump is reportedly open to creating a wider national strategic reserve — prioritizing U.S.-founded cryptocurrencies such as XRP. The news was enough to send XRP to a price not seen since 2018. The crypto peaked at $3.38 — just two cents from its all-time high price mark.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-18 21:42:08

The surge in BTC price to an all-time high above $107K and on-chain factors led to most analysts gauging a bull peak around $150K. However, massive demand from institutional players and governments has fueled a much higher sentiment in 2025. $150K Is Too Low, Bitcoin Enthusiast Opines A crypto trader, Alex Becker, wrote on X that a $150K price target for this bull cycle is low compared to the level of institutional interest recorded. He noted that the price can easily be broken and way too short. Bitcoin price at $150K is 1/6th the gold market cap. For years, Bitcoin and gold backers have debated which asset is most valuable in light of present macro conditions. According to Becker, there is no reason for industry bulls to stop at 1/6th of an asset that is harder to hold, manage, access, and store. Bitcoin is termed the digital gold and unlike the yellow metal, it is easier for investors to hold and transfer. Market participants also point to Bitcoin’s supply and scarcity against gold making it a better asset. Bitcoin has also recorded rising institutional demand due to spot ETFs and other macro factors. Donald Trump’s election win also ushered in a new wave of inflows. With all factors considered, Becker expects a target between $250K and $400K. “ But these make absolutely no damn sense in the current environment. In the case of the biggest countries, funds and corporations are all using it to store value…A market cap that is 1/6th that of good is absolutely silly low. There is absolutely no reason for us to stop or cap at $150k. If we reach that there’s only more of a reason for us to go to 250k-400k,” he wrote. Impact on Wider Market Bitcoin price tapped a new all-time high above $107K, fueling optimism for a higher target. As bulls ramp up accumulations, altcoins whales are also prepping for a massive shift to their favorite assets. Several investors opine an altcoin season may be on the horizon after Bitcoin hits its cycle peak. At the moment, several altcoins like XRP and Cardano have shown signs of huge inflows. Ethereum whales also picked up huge holdings alongside transfers out of centralized exchanges.",Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|FIAT|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-18 21:45:44

Simultaneously, buzz is building around the latest Internet Computer news, featuring an upcoming YouTube livestream where innovators will explore the impacts of SNS on their projects. In this dynamic environment, BlockDAG (BDAG) is securing its position as a top crypto coin to watch with the recruitment of Marius Bock, previously a prominent figure at Cardano, now stepping in as the Lead Project Manager at BlockDAG. With Marius Bock’s leadership and strategic vision, BlockDAG is preparing for its eagerly awaited mainnet launch this year. Amidst the uncertainty faced by other cryptos, BlockDAG stands out as a top crypto of advancement. Explore Latest Movements by PEPE Coin Whales Recent movements by PEPE coin whales have once again highlighted them, generating both interest and discussion. A new wallet, “0x8f5,” has caused a stir by moving 280 billion PEPE tokens, valued at $5 million, out of Binance. This move follows the wallet’s previous acquisition of 47.4 million JASMY tokens, suggesting a deliberate diversification strategy. At the same time, another whale, “0xb1a,” has made a substantial purchase, securing 200.4 billion PEPE tokens for $3.72 million shortly before this report. These transactions might indicate a bullish outlook on PEPE’s future but also emphasize the meme coin market’s inherent instability. Such significant trades often prompt speculations about potential price changes or increased market action.

This follows reports of a whale trader profiting nearly $12 million from trading the token shortly after its release. The launch, which has triggered significant controversy, has drawn responses from financial experts, crypto enthusiasts, and ethics watchdogs. Eric Trump’s Take on $TRUMP Memecoin Eric Trump, the son of President-elect Donald Trump, commented on the $TRUMP memecoin’s rapid rise, calling it the “hottest digital meme on earth.” The $TRUMP token , launched late Friday, surged in value within hours, becoming a top trending topic in the cryptocurrency space. According to CoinGecko, its market capitalization exceeded $5 billion by Saturday afternoon, with trading volumes surpassing $11 billion. The token’s price more than doubled, reaching over $27 within 24 hours of its launch. The memecoin is owned primarily by CIC Digital LLC, a company tied to Donald Trump, which holds 80% of the token’s supply. With an estimated $20 billion in assets on paper under the current market price, the launch has raised questions about the intersection of Trump’s financial interests and his upcoming presidency. Peter Schiff, an economist and Bitcoin skeptic, weighed in on the rapid rise of the $TRUMP token. “It took Bitcoin four years to reach a $5 billion market cap. $TRUMP did it in one day,” he wrote on X. Schiff sarcastically suggested creating a strategic reserve for the memecoin and requiring its inclusion in retirement accounts. However, the comments drew mixed reactions, with some dismissing the comparison between Bitcoin and a newly launched meme-based cryptocurrency. Whale Trader Profits $11.8 Million Amid Market Activity A significant transaction involving the $TRUMP memecoin occurred hours after its launch, catching the attention of blockchain analysts. A whale trader, who reportedly spent $12 million purchasing 860,895 tokens at $13.94, sold the holdings at $27.67. The transaction resulted in an $11.8 million profit, showcasing the high volatility of the token in its early trading hours. This development has sparked concerns over the stability of the memecoin and the potential for market manipulation. Critics argue that speculative trading could harm smaller investors entering the market at inflated prices. Prominent figures, including former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, criticized the event. Scaramucci called the launch “an alarming level of corruption,” suggesting it reflects poorly on the broader cryptocurrency industry. Ethical Concerns Over Presidential Financial Ties The timing of the $TRUMP memecoin launch has led to ethical questions, as it occurred just days before Donald Trump’s inauguration as president. Historically, presidents-elect have made efforts to distance themselves from business ventures to avoid perceived conflicts of interest. The Trump administration’s direct ties to the cryptocurrency have drawn scrutiny from ethics watchdogs. Jordan Libowitz of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington commented on the situation, stating, “This is a president-elect launching businesses alongside promises to deregulate industries where he stands to profit.” Trump has also faced criticism for promoting cryptocurrency-friendly policies during his campaign, including proposals to overhaul crypto regulations and have the federal government stockpile Bitcoin.

Whale Sells $23.82 Million in Holdings appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Today, January 19, 2024, while major cryptocurrencies seem to be struggling, Donald Trump’s newly launched meme coin, Official Trump (TRUMP), is making waves and gaining significant attention from crypto enthusiasts. The potential reason behind this attention is the TRUMP coin’s over 300% upside momentum and a post made by President-elect Trump. Crypto Whale Sold Entire TRUMP Meme Coin On January 18, 2024, following a post on X (formerly Twitter), the price of TRUMP began soaring. Noticing its potential for upside momentum, a crypto whale spent a significant 12 million USDC to purchase 860,895 TRUMP meme coins at an average price of $13.94. However, as the price continued to rise significantly, the same whale dumped their entire TRUMP holding at an average price of $27.67, making a profit of $11.8 million. A whale dumped 860,895 $TRUMP for 23.8M $USDC just now. This whale spent 12M $USDC to buy 860,895 $TRUMP at $13.94, then sold it at $27.67, making a profit of $11.8M! https://t.co/1f98ch5Pi4 pic.twitter.com/nfuYYShyij — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 18, 2025 Adding to this massive sell-off, a crypto expert revealed on X that Trump’s team has allegedly sold $500 million worth of TRUMP tokens while retaining 85% of the total supply. TRUMP Price Momentum Despite this substantial dumping, TRUMP reached a high of $35. However, due to some profit-taking, the price now appears to be correcting. At the time of writing, the meme coin trades at $27.75, maintaining a significant 330% gain in the past 24 hours. This significant price surge in the past 24 hours has consistently attracted new investors and crypto giants, contributing to the continuous price increases the meme coin is experiencing. With only 200 million TRUMP of the total 1 billion supply currently in circulation, concerns are rising over the potential impact of future token releases.

Trump Buys Solana (TRUMPSOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Buys Solana launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Buys Solana by entering its contract address – 8Ruz6rzYPpKHActX3jo49v8WBhiJ5KsGM6dyCghQj3i – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SOL|SHIB|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-18 22:20:00

Input Output Global (IOG), the main firm behind Cardano, confirmed that it will be supporting the Plomin hard fork on the mainnet as of January 18, 2025. According to a tweet , “We’re happy to share that Input | Output has today voted “Yes” on the Plomin Hard Fork governance action.” This means that all the conditions which are stated in the Interim Constitution have been fulfilled to the letter. IOG representatives emphasized that there was internal and independent technical assessment before this milestone. Moreover, more than 85% of the active stake pools have been updated to the required client node versions of 10.1.3 or 10.1.4 to meet the consensus rules of the guardrail HARDFORK-04. The Intersect’s Hard Fork Working Group has also submitted readiness reports that only serves as a testament of the readiness of the network to this upgrade. The Plomin activation is a constitutional milestone for Cardano according to its decentralized governance plan. Is a 400% rally on the cards for ADA? With the bearish pressure in the cryptocurrency market being less severe, large-cap altcoins are displaying early indications of a comeback. Cardano has quickly become one of the best-performing assets in the cryptocurrency market by the year 2025. After weeks of downward movement, ADA has managed to regain and trade above the $1 level. Crypto analysts are now speculating about the next move for the price of Cardano. Prominent analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted fractals—which are patterns in the price, to indicate that Cardano is about to experience a significant price action. Martinez likened the current trend to the late 2020 rise of ADA, which jumped from $0.4 to above $3, this being its peak. Source: X In his analysis, he argued that Cardano could follow a similar trend, and it might hit $6 within two to three weeks. This would mean a 400% increase from the price at which it currently trades. At the time of writing this, ADA is selling at $1.15, which is about 5% higher than its value on the previous day and 20% higher than a week ago. Surging ADA TVL Aside from price recovery, Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem is also growing. The total value locked (TVL) in Cardano protocols has risen by 25% in the year so far, increasing from $430 million to $538 million. The institutional and large-scale investors have greatly contributed to the appreciation of the price of Cardano. According to blockchain analytics firm Santiment, whale transactions worth more than $100k have picked up as Ada’s price has risen. This increased activity is attributed to the increased confidence of institutional investors, increased trading and supporting the bullish outlook. Source: Santiment Cardano’s connection to the new US administration is another factor that makes it attractive to the market. The company’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, is said to be among the potential members of President-elect Donald Trump’s crypto council which will advise the new administration on digital currency laws.

Recently, the community started discussing a new plan to reduce inflation, aiming at the network’s long-term stability. The proposal suggests lowering the annual inflation rate from 5.7% to 1.5%. While this plan seeks to reduce inflation and enhance stability, it has led to mixed reactions, especially from stakers who worry about how it will affect their rewards. Solana Community Proposal Sparks Mixed Reactions From Stakers The Solana blockchain is known for processing many transactions quickly and at low costs. It uses an inflationary model, creating new tokens yearly to reward stakers who help secure the network. This encourages more people to stake their tokens, which improves the network’s decentralization and security. However, as the network grows, the increasing number of tokens raises concerns about inflation. This could reduce the value of Solana (SOL) tokens over time. Meanwhile, the proposal has received mixed reactions from the Solana staking community. Some stakers believe that reducing inflation is necessary to protect the value of their assets. Many stakers are worried that the proposed reduction could lower staking rewards. As the community discusses and improves the proposal, it’s clear that Solana is trying to find a balance between controlling inflation and keeping strong incentives for its growing network of participants. The final decision will likely affect the blockchain’s economic model for many years. IMF Predicts Global Inflation Drop to 3.5% As reported by TheCoinRise, the International Monetary Fund projects that inflation will fall to 3.5% by the end of 2025 , down from a peak of 9.4% in 2022. “The battle against inflation is almost won,” Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, IMF’s Chief Economist, stated last year. “The global economy has shown resilience, and we expect growth to hold steady at 3.2% for the next two years.” This stabilization in inflation would bring potential benefits such as reduced living costs and lower interest rates. Notably, the benefits could positively impact cryptocurrencies and tech stocks. Despite the encouraging inflation outlook, Gourinchas warned that geopolitical tensions and other global uncertainties could pose economic risks . However, the IMF called for a policy triple pivot to stabilize interest rates, reduce government spending, and implement reforms to boost productivity. Solana Becomes a Leading Blockchain for New Developers Due to its excellent performance, Solana has recently become the talk of the DeFi market . Since 2016, Ethereum has been the best DeFi development network for new developers, but Solana’s recent network reports have hijacked the mantle. While Solana now holds over 7,625 new developers, surpassing Ethereum, analysts are positive that this could further brighten its price sentiment.

Unveiled on Jan. 17, just before Trump’s inauguration as the 47th president, TRUMP reached a market cap of nearly $9 billion within hours, surpassing popular memecoins like Pepe and Bonk. “My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING! Join my very special Trump Community. GET YOUR TRUMP NOW,” Trump announced on Truth Social and X. While some in the crypto community questioned the authenticity of the project, a source close to Trump’s family confirmed to Cointelegraph that the initiative is legitimate and ties into his existing NFT ventures. A surge of trades underscored the token’s rapid rise. Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that a wallet named “LeBron” turned a $1 million investment into over $2 million by acquiring 4.52 million TRUMP tokens shortly after launch. Another trader made $70 million in under four hours, converting an initial $1.1 million investment into significant profits by selling 1.35 million TRUMP for 3.65 million USDC while keeping additional tokens valued at $67.5 million. Pseudonymous trader 0xsun also saw substantial gains, purchasing nearly 1 million TRUMP tokens with 3,000 Solana (worth $653,000) and later selling part of their holdings for $812,000, netting over $3.7 million in profit. Whales joined the frenzy as well, with one withdrawing 61,205 SOL, valued at $14.3 million, to purchase 1.27 million TRUMP tokens. Another whale spent 8.5 million USDC to acquire 1.03 million tokens at an average price of $8.28. At the time of writing, TRUMP traded at $18.82 with a market cap of $4.28 billion, a 10,222% increase since launch.

One trend shaking things up lately is the rise of Bulls Squad—projects that rally communities and drive utility in ways that traditional coins simply can’t. These squads bring together loyal holders and inject new energy into the ecosystem, particularly with projects tied to gaming, rewards, and meme culture. If you’re after a coin with serious staying power, you’ve got to consider how its squad delivers on both innovation and engagement. Now, who doesn’t love a good underdog story? Meme coins have been the heart and soul of crypto’s most unexpected successes, with coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu making waves over the years. They’ve proven that a dash of humor, mixed with a strong community, can translate into big gains. But the meme game is changing. New players like BTFD Coin (BTFD), Mog Coin (MOG), and Apu Apustaja (APU) are rewriting the rulebook with bold utilities and killer presales. BTFD Coin, in particular, is catching everyone’s eye. Not just for its presale buzz (more on that later), but for its Bulls Squad—a unique initiative blending staking, P2E gaming, and community-driven rewards. If you think meme coins can’t innovate, BTFD is here to prove you wrong. Ready to dive in? Let’s break it all down. BTFD Coin: Bulls Squad, Presale Perks, and Beyond BTFD Coin has smashed onto the scene like a bull in a china shop—unstoppable and ready to charge. With over $5.1 million raised so far and more than 64 billion coins sold across 8,600 holders, its presale is dominating headlines. Starting at just $0.000004, the coin’s price has climbed to $0.000142 in Stage 13, with a post-presale listing set at $0.0006. This isn’t just a hype train—it’s a freight train of value. What sets BTFD apart? It’s all about the Bulls Squad , a community-first initiative combining staking rewards and P2E gaming. Picture this: you’re not just holding your coins—you’re putting them to work in a gamified ecosystem where strategy and loyalty pay off big time. Whether you’re a hardcore gamer or a casual crypto enthusiast, the Bulls Squad has something for you. And let’s not ignore the presale perks. Early buyers snag more BTFD for less, setting them up for significant profits when the coin hits exchanges. Let’s crunch the numbers: if you drop $35,000 on BTFD at $0.000142 in Stage 13, you’ll bag roughly 246 million coins. When the price hits $0.0006 post-presale, that’s a whopping $147,600.

The recent Celestia upgrade has drastically reduced block times, effectively doubling the network’s efficiency and data handling capabilities. Concurrently, bullish trends in Render’s pricing emerge as its transition to Solana introduces enhanced functionalities. Amidst these developments, BlockDAG is making waves with a revolutionary approach. Through its collaboration with HackerEarth, BlockDAG (BDAG) is set to mobilize more than 10,000 developers and launch over 200 projects aimed at tackling blockchain scalability issues. This movement marks a shift towards practical, real-world applications and establishes BlockDAG as a formidable force in defining the future of blockchain technology. As new major players in the crypto market take the stage, don’t miss your chance to engage with innovations that could echo the early triumphs of Ethereum. BlockDAG’s Hackathons Pave the Way for Scalable Blockchain Solutions BlockDAG is stepping up like major crypto players such as Ethereum and Solana by partnering with HackerEarth. This collaboration is poised to revolutionize blockchain scalability by drawing over 10,000 developers into a series of global hackathons. The goal is to deploy over 200 projects within the BlockDAG network, offering viable solutions for decentralized finance, infrastructure, and governance challenges. The scope and concentration of these hackathons underline BlockDAG’s dedication to cultivating a robust crypto ecosystem. Central to these initiatives is the adoption of advanced technologies like the Phantom and GhostDAG protocols, which are set to enhance transaction speed and efficiency significantly. These hackathons will bring BlockDAG into collaboration with gifted developers worldwide, promoting breakthroughs that might parallel Ethereum’s formative growth. Smaller, specialized hackathons further showcase BlockDAG’s adaptability and commitment to meeting niche industry demands. BlockDAG’s presale figures underscore its burgeoning potential. Having raised over $182 million and sold 17.9 billion units, early participants have witnessed a staggering 2380% increase in value, with each unit currently priced at $0.0248. This offers a thrilling opportunity for newcomers to join a rapidly growing ecosystem that’s quickly gaining recognition as a major upcoming crypto force.

By fostering applications and decentralized projects that address real-world needs, BlockDAG is positioning itself as a leader in the blockchain arena. The forthcoming opportunities could profoundly influence the future of Web3 technologies. Celestia’s Speed Boost Unleashes New Capabilities The latest update to Celestia has dramatically reduced block times from 30 to 15 seconds, doubling the network’s capacity for handling data. This significant enhancement boosts transaction efficiency, making Celestia an even more attractive platform for developers in search of scalable solutions. Furthermore, this upgrade prepares the ground for future enhancements, such as expanding block sizes to 1 gigabyte, a move that could place it in competition with major transaction processors like Visa in terms of capacity. As of January 2025, Celestia’s native asset, TIA, is valued at $5.07, holding a market capitalization of $715.75 million. Despite a recent 7-day decrease of 6.69% in value, TIA’s trading volume of $149.39 million suggests sustained interest. With the upgrade unlocking numerous possibilities, Celestia is on a trajectory for significant growth, especially as the adoption of modular blockchain solutions continues to spread across various sectors. Render’s Price Outlook and Solana Switch Fuel Momentum Recent forecasts for Render indicate a promising growth outlook, propelled by its transition to the Solana network. This strategic shift drastically cuts transaction costs and boosts overall network performance, positioning Render as a scalable solution for intensive rendering demands. Integration with AI tools and services like Cinema 4D and Redshift expands its allure, particularly within the creative sectors. As of January 2025, Render’s currency, RNDR, is priced at $6.82, with analysts predicting potential peaks between $14.32 and $20.25 during this cycle. Longer-term forecasts suggest a price range of $50 to $80, buoyed by recent technological advancements and strategic alliances.

The Bottom Line The recent Celestia update has halved block times and doubled the network’s data capacity, positioning TIA as a strong contender in the market, currently priced at $5.07 with a market cap of $715.75 million. Likewise, optimism surrounds Render, with RNDR trading at $6.82 and price targets ranging from $14.32 to $20.25 for this cycle. Yet, it’s BlockDAG that’s taking the most ambitious strides.

Meanwhile, Arbitrum price shows modest gains, reflecting its steady role in Ethereum scaling. However, a lesser-known contender, Web3Bay (3BAY), is quietly stealing the spotlight with a practical approach that transcends speculation. While Solana benefits from ETF optimism and Arbitrum refines layer-2 scaling, Web3Bay focuses on reshaping e-commerce with blockchain-powered solutions. In a market crowded with speculative tokens, Web3Bay(3BAY) delivers a tangible use case: transforming global e-commerce. It’s not just another blockchain project; it’s a solution for businesses and consumers alike, bridging traditional finance and cryptocurrency. Investors searching for meaningful growth opportunities in 2025 might find Web3Bay more compelling than both Solana and Arbitrum. Web3Bay: Transforming E-Commerce with Blockchain Web3Bay is making headlines as the next big disruptor in the e-commerce industry. By integrating blockchain technology into its core operations, Web3Bay is eliminating the inefficiencies of traditional platforms, including high fees and lack of transparency. Instead, it offers users a decentralized, secure, and cost-effective way to engage in online shopping. Central to its ecosystem is the 3BAY token, which enables crypto payments and grants users perks like a 5% discount on purchases and community-driven governance. The presale for Web3Bay has already garnered immense attention, raising over $830,000 and selling more than 220 million tokens. Currently priced at just $0.0045626, the token’s affordability and projected launch price of $0.1959 make it a lucrative opportunity for early investors. With plans to expand into decentralized storage, multi-chain compatibility, and Layer-2 scaling for fast transactions, Web3Bay is well on its way to reshaping global commerce. As Web3Bay expands and adoption increases, the demand for 3BAY is set to skyrocket. By acting now, investors can lock in tokens at their lowest price, well ahead of the next price jump and the growing attention of the broader market. Solana Price Crosses $200 Mark Again As of January 17, 2025, Solana (SOL) is trading at $213.40, reflecting a 5.10% increase from the previous close. The intraday high reached $216.36, with a low of $198.74. The Solana price has been positively influenced by the anticipation of regulatory approval for Solana-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Industry experts suggest that the pro-crypto stance of the current U.S. administration may facilitate the approval of these ETFs, potentially attracting significant institutional investments. Analysts project that, upon approval, Solana ETFs could draw substantial investments, further boosting the Solana price.This development underscores the growing confidence in Solana’s ecosystem and its potential for mainstream adoption. Arbitrum Price Sees Modest Uptick Amid Market Fluctuations Arbitrum, an Ethereum layer-two scaling solution, utilizes optimistic rollups to enhance transaction speed and reduce costs. Arbitrum’s native token, ARB, is trading at approximately $0.7820, reflecting a 1.31% increase from the previous close. The token’s intraday performance has seen highs of $0.7871 and lows of $0.7499, indicating moderate volatility. Over the past week, ARB has experienced a 9.32% decline, aligning with broader market trends. Despite this downturn, the 24-hour trading volume has reached $235.32 million, suggesting sustained investor interest. The current market capitalization stands at approximately $3.11 billion, with a circulating supply of 4.21 billion ARB tokens. Takeaway While Solana price climbs on ETF optimism and Arbitrum price steadies amid market fluctuations, Web3Bay (3BAY) is building a foundation for lasting impact. Solana benefits from its thriving ecosystem, and Arbitrum enhances Ethereum’s scalability, but Web3Bay addresses everyday challenges in global commerce—fees, speed, and transparency. This focus on utility positions Web3Bay as more than just an investment; it’s a bridge between blockchain and real-world applications. The platform’s presale performance speaks volumes, with $830,000 raised , over 220 million tokens sold , and an attractive price of $0.004562625 . A projected launch price of $0.1959 signals significant upside for early investors. Features like NFT integration, decentralized governance, and seamless multi-chain functionality make Web3Bay a standout.

The announcement on January 17 through Trump’s Truth Social account stated that the token was for him and his “winning.” The initial speculation pointed towards a possible hack, but the confirmation came shortly after, with Trump becoming the first U.S. president to endorse a meme coin. Critics raise ethical concerns Like others, the TRUMP meme coin has been criticized for having no real-world application. Critics and analysts have pointed out that using the Trump administration’s position to endorse cryptocurrency is questionable. YouTuber Stephen Findeisen, also known as Coffeezilla, criticized the timings of the project. In a Jan. 18 post, he called the launch of the coin ‘unethical’ and raised concerns with the reported 80% of the coins being distributed to Trump’s inner circle. Findeisen described the situation as ‘nasty work’ due to the risks of large losses for inexperienced investors. > dropping TRUMP memecoin 2 days before becoming president is nasty work > new SEC/DOJ guarantees no prosecution > 80% of tokens vest to insiders DURING the presidency > most ppl losing money will be MAGA who aren't crypto native > *should* be a crime but crime is legal now ig? — Coffeezilla (@coffeebreak_YT) January 18, 2025 Peter Schiff, an economist who has consistently dismissed cryptos, likened the coin to Bitcoin in sarcasm while making fun of it. Former Trump aide Anthony Scaramucci called it “corruption” and warned it may negatively impact the broader crypto market. Crypto-influencer Max Schwartzman said that it is possible that Trump’s account was hacked, as the TRUMP COIN website has the same design as Trump’s previous NFT project. Others, like 0xCygaar, pointed out that the two have similar technical structures, which only added to the hype. Ok yeah the new Trump memecoin website is deployed almost identically to his previous NFT website. Same cloudflare setup, same deployment with Heroku, same SSL certificate issuer. Very similar HTML structure as before. pic.twitter.com/u1zLD7Vcv7 — cygaar (@0xCygaar) January 18, 2025 Explosive growth amid controversy After the launch, the token only took 15 minutes to reach a market cap of $400 million. The launch also saw SOL, Solana’s native token, rise to an all-time high of $267 due to the buzz around the TRUMP token. However, the TRUMP coin has soared and has recorded more than 12,000% adoption after its launch despite the backlash it has received. The token’s value reached close to $35 and then hovered around $29, taking the market capitalization to $5.98 billion. Successful traders have made a lot of money, with one of them reportedly making $50,000 to $1.1 million within a few hours. However, doubts remain about the prospects of the token in the future. Currently, only 20% of the 1 billion TRUMP coins are in circulation with the remaining 80% to be released over the next 36 months. At the moment, the first twenty holders possess 87.02% of the total token supply, which means only 12.97% remains for all other investors and traders. The developer wallet alone is estimated at about $15.5 billion, which raises questions about developers controlling and manipulating the market. Some critics have claimed that this sort of ownership control weakens the token in question. Crypto analyst JRNY Crypto raised concerns about the lack of concrete information coming from Trump’s advisors to support the project. The FOMO on the TRUMP token pushed many traders into action, causing a rise in the Solana price and an increase in its on-chain activity. Analyst Will Clemente pointed to the chaos, stating that traders have been dumping other assets to buy into the TRUMP phenomenon. However, some analysts have expressed concern that the fast pace may result in a quick drop. Never seen anything like this, SOL ripping and everything on chain nuking as people panic sell to fomo into Trump’s memecoin.

This pullback has caught many traders off guard as they had expected BTC’s upward trend to continue. The shift in sentiment is driven by profit-taking, caution from institutional investors , and broader economic concerns affecting risk assets. Also, the breach of the $104,268 support level raises concerns about further declines, with lower support zones now in focus. While the correction may feel unsettling, it is a natural part of Bitcoin’s volatile price movements. The next few weeks will determine whether the asset can regain stability and reclaim key support levels or if bearish momentum will persist, potentially leading to a more significant downturn. Bearish Momentum Builds: Bitcoin Struggles Below $104,268 Bitcoin is currently trading below the critical $104,268 level, which increases the likelihood of more declines. BTC’s price action is showing signs of negative movement, with selling pressure outweighing buying interest. As BTC remains below this key support threshold, the risk of deeper corrections grows. However, it’s also important to remember that corrections are a natural part of BTC’s price action, often presenting buying opportunities for long-term investors. If the asset finds support at these lower levels and stabilizes, there’s still potential for a rebound. However, the market remains cautious for now, with bearish momentum continuing to build as Bitcoin struggles to break back above the $104,268 mark. Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) aligns with Bitcoin’s current price action, reflecting a cooling of market momentum. As the RSI moves from overbought levels toward neutral territory, it suggests that buying pressure is diminishing. Typically, this shift coincides with the pullback below the $104,268 support level, indicating that the previous bullish strength may be fading. With the RSI trending lower, the market appears to be cooling, suggesting the possibility of further downward movement unless buying interest returns. Can BTC Recover After Dropping Below $104,268? BTC’s recent drop below the $104,268 level has raised concerns about its near-term outlook, but the road ahead remains uncertain. Traders will be closely monitoring how the asset reacts to this key support breach. A successful recovery above $104,268 could signal a potential rebound, causing a move toward the current all-time high of $108,311 for a retest. In contrast, failure to reclaim this level might lead to more drops, testing lower support zones such as the $100,000 mark. Bitcoin’s ability to stabilize and regain upward movement will be crucial in determining whether the recent pullback is a temporary setback or the start of a deeper correction.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|btc|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Long-Term Investors|Profit-taking|relative strength index|RSI,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-18 23:30:43

According to the company’s official announcement , trading for the controversial token began at 20:15 PM UTC on January 18. But as the token hits Kraken, it also saw a 35% decline in value. The token, which celebrates Trump’s leadership and his campaign slogan “Fight, Fight, Fight,” debuted only a few hours ago but has since seen an over 120,000 surge. TRUMP has now surpassed retail sensation stock GameStop (GME), which made history in 2021 and was thought to be the biggest market mania of the 2020s. The initial market frenzy sent TRUMP’s market cap soaring to nearly $6 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Trump launched the meme coin on January 17 through a post on Truth Social and X (formerly Twitter). In his signature style, Trump hyped the token as a rallying point for his movement, declaring, “My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!” The coin’s official website described TRUMP as a token for those who “don’t back down, no matter the odds.” And Trump’s highly-anticipated inauguration is less than 48 hours away. Behind the scenes, the token is managed by Fight Fight Fight LLC, a company promising to release an additional 800 million TRUMP tokens over the next three years. A first batch of 200 million coins hit the market during the launch. Exchanges pile on Other major centralized exchanges (CEXs) were ahead of Kraken. Singapore-based Crypto.com added trading pairs, allowing users to purchase TRUMP using USD, EUR, and 20 other fiat currencies. Meanwhile, Bybit opened pre-market trading for TRUMP/USDT with a call auction on January 18 at 9:35 AM UTC. On decentralized exchanges (DEXs), the token gained traction too. Platforms like Raydium, Orca, and Meteora listed TRUMP. In total, more than ten exchanges, including MEXC, HTX, and CoinW, now support TRUMP trading pairs. But this whole thing is just Trump putting his money where his mouth is. Last summer, he spoke at a Bitcoin conference in Nashville, promising to make America the “crypto capital of the planet.” His sons, Donald Jr. and Eric founded World Liberty Financial, a family-run venture focused on decentralized and centralized finance (DeFi and CeFi).

Donald Trump the Bull (DONBULL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONBULL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Trump the Bull can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Trump the Bull could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Trump the Bull launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Trump the Bull on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Donald Trump the Bull by entering its contract address – AmgaL1uuQ97qJoXfUUxdHipLJmVd3toChivEBiSFn7MW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONBULL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|TRADING|DOGE|SOL|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-18 23:39:00

Through this collaboration, BlockDAG aims to build over 200 Web3 projects and engage 10,000 to 15,000 developers through four global hackathons. This exciting development comes as analysts predict major growth for BlockDAG, expecting BDAG to reach $1 this year, as its presale quickly moves toward its $600 million target. Litecoin (LTC) Analysis: What’s Next After the 34% Drop? Litecoin (LTC) analysis shows LTC had a strong run in late 2024, breaking key resistance levels and reaching a three-year high. However, the price has since dropped 34%, though it found support around $100, creating a higher low. If Litecoin continues its upward movement, it could break through its resistance and signal the end of the correction. Current Litecoin analysis shows that LTC is still in a bullish trend, with key indicators suggesting potential for further growth. A breakout above resistance at $95 could push Litecoin toward $184, marking a major price gain. Recovery Signs Appear as Hyperliquid Price Rises Hyperliquid’s price has seen an 18% increase, bouncing back from a recent low. After experiencing a bearish trend with a death cross earlier, Hyperliquid’s price now shows signs of recovery. The 9-period EMA has risen above the 20-period EMA, signaling a potential reversal. If HYPE breaks above key levels like $24.62, it could target $28.42, with further upside potential towards $40. However, if it faces resistance, the price could drop to as low as $15.11. The next few days will be crucial for determining the token’s direction. 200+ New Web3 Projects Coming to BlockDAG Network! BlockDAG is becoming a key player in Web3 innovation through its latest partnership with HackerEarth, a global leader in hosting online hackathons. Through this collaboration, BlockDAG plans to launch over 200 new projects on its network, helping teams create decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain solutions. With HackerEarth’s huge community of 7.6 million developers, BlockDAG will gain access to a large pool of talent, speeding up the growth of its ecosystem. To reach its goal, the network will host four global hackathons, involving 10,000 to 15,000 developers. These hackathons will offer developers a chance to showcase their work and gain exposure while also pushing the adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi), infrastructure, and governance solutions. Overall, this partnership goes a long way in boosting BlockDAG’s visibility and strengthening its position as a go-to network for developers aiming to make an impact in Web3. This surge in developer activity will likely lead to significant growth in BlockDAG’s ecosystem, potentially boosting the value of the BDAG coin. Analysts predict that as the mainnet launch gets closer and BlockDAG’s crypto presale —currently at $181.5 million—moves toward its $600 million target, BDAG could reach $1 in 2025. Currently priced at $0.0248 in batch 27 and having delivered a 2,380% ROI to early holders, BlockDAG remains one of the best crypto coins to buy now. Insider Pick: The Best Crypto Coin To Buy Now! The Litecoin (LTC) analysis shows strong potential for further growth, with a breakout above $95 possibly pushing its price toward $184. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid’s price shows signs of recovery, with potential upside if it breaks key resistance at $24.62, targeting $28.42 and beyond. However, BlockDAG remains the best crypto coin to buy today, offering impressive $1 growth potential alongside innovative partnerships. Its presale has already reached $181.5 million, and the partnership with HackerEarth is driving massive developer activity. In essence, BlockDAG’s ambitious goal of over 200 Web3 projects and four global hackathons this year make it a key player in Web3 innovation—and one of the top cryptos to buy in 2025.

Crypto stakeholders were expecting regulatory clarity and more friendliness toward the industry. Nobody saw him launching a memecoin days before his inauguration. According to reports, the incoming POTUS did not inform those in his circle of his plans to launch a memecoin. The token launch went live hours before the inaugural crypto ball hosted by Trump’s White House Czar, David Sacks. Analysts calm talks of reward for NFT holders Growing speculation that holders of Trump’s NFT cards could get allocations of the memecoin caused the collection’s floor price to surge over 400% today. The floor price surged as high as $1,000, making the trading cards one of the best-performing NFT projects in recent times. Trading activity of Trump NFT trading cards surged along with the memecoins. Source: MagicEden The NFTs were sold in multiple issues, with an average price of $99 per card. With today’s rally, some holders are up by as much as 13x their buying price on the NFTs. Investors active in the space quickly highlighted that the same company that helped launch the NFT collections, CIC Digital, is also involved with the TRUMP memecoin. However, it appears that NFT holders will not receive any automatic allocations or airdrops as outlined on the gettrumpmemes.com website. The “meme cards” term that led holders to speculate about a potential allocation appears to be another term the project used to describe its tokens, not the previously held NFT cards. UPDATE: Apparently they call the $TRUMP itself ""meme cards"" which is also in their terms & conditions. This makes an airdrop highly unlikely, since ""card allocation"" in this context means basically ""tokenomics"", not ""allocation for trading cards NFTs"" pic.twitter.com/B2rQmIYSWD — wale.moca 🐳 (@waleswoosh) January 18, 2025 The collection trades on Polygon and has seen a 24-hour trading volume of 2,380,000 $POL ($1.1 million). The project has yet to make any announcements or acknowledge any chatter about NFT holders receiving token allocations or airdrops. TRUMP token continues to divide opinions Like Donald Trump, his memecoin evokes mixed reactions on opposite ends of the spectrum. On one hand, some crypto citizens are excited by the POTUS interacting with crypto at this level. However, the other camp is skeptical about the long-term effect of involvement with the crypto community. Already, many in his circle have made bank thanks to the series of launches linked to his name. World Liberty Finance , the DeFi project linked to the Trump family is also closely tracked as some in the crypto space consider its transactions with projects as endorsements . Another issue investors have noted is that Trump Group affiliates CIC Digital LLC and Fighter Fight LLC hold 80% of the token’s total supply. However, those tokens are subject to a 3-year unlocking plan, which helps to allay fears of a sudden dump on the market. However, there are now claims the launch team has sold up to $500 million worth of the memecoin already. Still, the memecoin continues to soar to new levels. It has already gained over $5 billion in market cap and almost $13 billion in trading volume to trade for about $29.

The altcoin hit a new all-time high, with the 24-hour trade volume leaving Ethereum (ETH) to bite the dust on Thursday. The token could extend its streak in the coming days following President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. Table of Contents XRP could extend rally alongside Bitcoin On-chain indicators support gains Market movers and Ripple lawsuit Technical analysis and XRP price forecast Expert commentary on XRP XRP could extend rally alongside Bitcoin XRP rallied over 40% in the past week. Bitcoin ( BTC ), the largest cryptocurrency recovered from its flashcrash under $90,000 and made a comeback above $104,000 on Friday. The native token of the XRPLedger is rallying alongside the top crypto. Trump’s upcoming inauguration is one of the leading catalysts, alongside optimism on crypto regulation, pro-crypto policy and a new approach by financial regulatory agencies in the U.S. XRP could gain further, entering price discovery next week.

The three classes of holders have accumulated the altcoin, even as the price climbs. This is indicative of a likely XRP price increase in the future. XRP supply distribution | Source: Santiment Market movers and Ripple lawsuit Monday’s inauguration is the largest market mover in crypto. But RippleNet’s rising adoption among institutions, the developments in RLUSD stablecoin and the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple are the three key market movers influencing the altcoin’s price. Even as the U.S. financial regulator filed an appeal against Ripple on Jan. 15, the altcoin continued its rally undeterred. The July 2023 ruling by Judge Analisa Torres that classified secondary sales of XRP as non-securities is being challenged and the SEC is seeking to have those retail sales classified as unregistered securities sales. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, told crypto.news in an exclusive interview: “XRP’s surge can be attributed to favorable outcomes in Ripple’s SEC lawsuit and a more crypto-friendly political climate in the US. If regulatory uncertainties are resolved, the influx of institutional investors could further solidify XRP’s position in the crypto market.” It remains to be seen whether the Trump administration will support pro-crypto regulation and whether it influences the outcome of lawsuits against firms like Ripple Labs.

XRP/USDT weekly price chart | Source: Crypto.news Expert commentary on XRP James Toledano, COO at Unity Wallet, told crypto.news in an exclusive interview: “Given that XRP was stuck at around $0.50 for literally 3 years, its recent breakout momentum reflects new levels of investor optimism around regulatory clarity and the potential approval of an XRP ETF in the following months. If the XRP ETF gets approved, it will have the potential to open the floodgates of capital inflow, meaning it could reach new heights in 2025.” Toledano warns XRP holders to be wary as altcoins take volatility to the next level in the current market cycle. He said: “Altcoin ETFs have genuine potential to attract capital, especially if supported by innovation-friendly policies with the new incoming U.S. administration. But, their success may be less consistent compared to Bitcoin ETFs due to the seemingly episodic nature of interest in altcoins. Just take a look at fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price this week. The factors are multifaceted; we could say it’s Trump, seasonality, geopolitics, macroeconomics and sentiment all blended together.

From Dogecoin to Shiba Inu, and more recently Dogwifhat (WIF), these projects have proven that humor, community, and the power of the internet can turn even the quirkiest coins into success stories. Dogwifhat joined the ranks in December 2023, riding the wave of meme coin hype and delivering consistent market value despite limited utility. But as the crypto market evolves, so does the competition. Enter BTFD Coin, a meme coin designed not just to generate buzz but to create tangible value for its holders. With a 90% APY staking program, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, and an innovative presale model, BTFD Coin isn’t just here to follow the trend—it’s here to set the standard for the best coin presales to buy in 2025 . BTFD Coin: 90% APY Staking Rewards and Bulls Squad Power BTFD Coin is more than just a meme; it’s a full-fledged investment opportunity built on community strength and impressive tokenomics. At the heart of its appeal is the jaw-dropping 90% APY staking program , which offers investors a way to earn consistent, high rewards by simply holding and staking their tokens. This feature is a game-changer for those looking to maximize passive income from their crypto portfolio. Let’s break it down: Suppose you invest $6,000 during the presale at the current price of $0.000142 per coin. That nets you over 42 million BTFD tokens. When BTFD hits its projected listing price of $0.0006, your investment would already quadruple to $18,000. Add staking into the mix, and the potential compounding returns become even more attractive. Imagine using those rewards to fund a dream vacation, pay off debt, or reinvest in other crypto projects. The staking program isn’t the only reason to get excited. BTFD Coin launched its P2E game on January 1, 2025, blending entertainment with earning potential. Players can earn $BTFD tokens while enjoying a dynamic and engaging game, further integrating the coin into everyday use. BTFD’s presale performance has been nothing short of stellar. Stage 13 is already 97% complete, with over $5.2 million raised and more than 64 billion coins sold. With the price set to increase soon, now is the perfect time to join the 8,600+ investors already backing this project. Analysts predict a post-listing price of $0.006, which translates to a staggering 4000% ROI for early adopters. This is your chance to be part of one of the best coin presales to buy before it’s too late. How to Buy BTFD Coins: Getting started is simple. Set up your MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB or ETH, and connect it to the presale page . Once connected, select the amount you want to purchase, confirm the transaction, and you’re in. Dogwifhat: A Meme Coin That Made Its Mark Dogwifhat entered the scene as a playful addition to the meme coin family, featuring a dog wearing a quirky hat as its mascot. Despite lacking real-world utility, it gained traction thanks to its lighthearted branding and strong community support. Its value has remained relatively stable, making it a notable success in the meme coin space. Investors who got in early on Dogwifhat reaped substantial rewards. The coin quickly climbed from obscurity to prominence, proving once again that community-driven projects can thrive in the crypto world. However, like many meme coins, its success depended largely on its ability to generate hype and maintain interest over time. For those who missed out on Dogwifhat’s early days, BTFD Coin offers a fresh opportunity. Unlike Dogwifhat, BTFD brings tangible utility to the table with its staking rewards, P2E game, and referral program. These features make it one of the best coin presales to buy in 2025, providing a unique combination of fun and financial growth. The Final Thoughts Dogwifhat may have made its mark, but BTFD Coin is rewriting the rules of meme coin investing. With its 90% APY staking program, innovative P2E game, and record-breaking presale performance, BTFD is more than just another meme coin—it’s a movement. Don’t let this opportunity slip away. With Stage 13 nearly complete and the potential for 4000% ROI , now is the time to invest in one of the best coin presales to buy this year. Secure your spot in the Bulls Squad today and watch your crypto portfolio take off. The future of meme coins is here, and it’s called BTFD Coin.

At $28 per token, and with Trump-affiliated companies CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC controlling 80% of the supply, the value of his crypto holdings alone has soared to $22.4 billion. For context, Forbes last valued Trump at $5.6 billion last November. TRUMP traded at just $7 per token at launch but skyrocketed within hours, achieving a fully diluted valuation of $27 billion. This all comes less than 48 hours before Trump’s inauguration. Only 200 million tokens are currently circulating, but there’s a plan to expand this to 1 billion over the next three years, as per the token’s official website . The timing of the launch has drawn intense scrutiny. A US president-elect releasing a business product days before taking office is quite literally unheard of. At an unofficial crypto inaugural ball Friday night, Trump’s crypto and AI czar, David Sacks, promised that: “The reign of terror against crypto is over. Innovation in America for crypto has just begun.” Meanwhile, crypto companies have donated over $10 million to Trump’s inauguration, after donating over $300 million to him during the campaign. What critics are worried about But of course some people are not happy about any of this. Admittedly, TRUMP does blur the lines between his presidency and personal profit. But hey, this is Donald Trump. When has he ever followed rules? “It’s absolutely wild,” said Jordan Libowitz, vice president for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “Presidents-elect usually spend this time separating themselves from their finances. Trump is doing the opposite—launching a business and promising deregulation in ways that blatantly benefit him.” Anthony Scaramucci, once Trump’s communications director and now a crypto investor, slammed the launch on X, calling it “Idi Amin-level corruption.” He added, “Don’t delude yourself. This is bad for the industry.” Nick Tomaino, a venture capitalist and former Coinbase executive, warned that the level of ownership in TRUMP could harm smaller investors. “Trump owning 80% and timing the launch hours before inauguration is predatory, and many will likely get hurt by it,” he posted on social media. Blockchain data backs up these concerns. As was reported by Cryptopolitan, analyst Conor has revealed that Trump’s team has already offloaded $500 million worth of tokens. Transactions show $20 million worth of TRUMP tokens being sent to Bybit within seven hours of the launch. Most of the USDC reserves tied to these transactions were funneled into liquidity pools on Meteora, consolidating Trump’s position even more. The official TRUMP website has a disclaimer that the token is “not an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security.” Meanwhile, Solana saw a 16% price surge in the 24 hours following the TRUMP launch on its network, hitting an intraday high of 23%. According to CoinGecko data, this is Solana’s most profitable day of the year so far, despite Ethereum taking a 7% hit during the same period.
