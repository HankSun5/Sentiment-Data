Bitcoin Price Briefly Tops $105K After the latest market meltdown, the Bitcoin price has breached the six-figure realm, signaling that the bulls are now in command. The largest and oldest crypto asset gained over 4% in the last 24 hours, rising from just under $90,000 on Jan. 13 to a price of $105,850, according to CoinGecko data. BTC has since cooled to $104,114 as of publication time. Nevertheless, the asset is just 3.5% away from its current all-time high price of $108,135, set in December 2024. Trump’s Swearing-In Is Only Days Away Expectations among crypto market observers are increasing as Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 47th president of the United States on Jan. 20 draws closer. Many anticipate that Trump will implement plans for crypto right from day one in office. The incoming president pledged pre-election to position the US as a leader in the crypto sector, including establishing a national strategic Bitcoin stockpile similar to gold. This is in stark contrast to the Joe Biden administration’s regulatory crackdowns and regulatory enforcement actions. If this were to be executed, the US Treasury would have to purchase one million BTC over five years, resulting in a supply crunch. Although direct government BTC buys remain uncertain, prohibiting sales of the US government’s current stash could reduce selling pressure and fortify the top crypto’s position as a legitimate asset class, further incorporating it into global financial markets. According to a Thursday Bloomberg report, Trump is looking to issue a pro-crypto executive order to elevate digital assets to a “national priority” shortly after his inauguration. Sources claim that this could include setting up a new crypto advisory council of industry leaders for policy recommendations. Trump is also expected to address crypto-debanking and repeal a bank accounting policy that compels banks to list crypto assets as liabilities. It’s worth mentioning that the New York Post recently reported that Trump is open to expanding a possible strategic reserve to include a basket of cryptos founded in the U.S., such as USD Coin (USDC), Solana (SOL), and Ripple’s XRP.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|BTCUSD|BTCUSDC|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency News|XBTUSD,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-18 21:35:51

Over the past few months, Selkis’ scorn for the San Francisco-based company and its cross-border payments token XRP seems to have taken a darker turn. The pundit slammed Ripple’s attempts to create ties with the forthcoming Donald Trump government. Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty dined with President-elect Trump earlier this month. Selkis Takes A Swipe At Ripple And XRP Messari’s Ryan Selkis has once again taken aim at Ripple and XRP. In a recent post on the X platform, Selkis described Ripple as a threat to the Trump administration’s cryptocurrency agenda, cautioning that XRP’s recent market strides are generally detrimental. The industry expert noted that XRP has surpassed Salesforce in market cap and is nearing the market capitalization of Bank of America. Moreover, XRP is now bigger than ride-hailing giant Uber, Spotify, PayPal, and MicroStrategy combined. In addition, the third-largest crypto is basically 5X the size of America’s biggest crypto exchange, Coinbase. “Ripple’s crash and scandals will take down the entire crypto agenda in DC,” Selkis wrote. XRP is now bigger than Salesforce and approaching BofA in market cap. + Top 30 US company. + Twice the value of Uber. + Bigger than Shopify, PayPal, and Microstrategy combined. + 5x the size of Coinbase. Ripple’s crash and scandals will take down the entire crypto agenda in DC. — Ryan Selkis (d/acc) (@twobitidiot) January 16, 2025 It’s worth mentioning that XRP currently commands a $178 billion market cap following its recent rally, while Salesforce is valued at $310 billion. But for Selkis and other Ripple critics, this does little to detract from the fact that Ripple’s parabolic growth is a potential threat to crypto. Selkis, meanwhile, claims that Ripple will unleash doom for crypto. In a follow-up post intended to explain his aversion to Ripple, he posited that the company’s executives were not good people, possibly referencing co-founder Chris Larsen and CEO Bradley Garlinghouse. “The reason I’m a dick about Ripple isn’t because I care about XRP or its memecoin rally. I’m happy for all of the retail holders who have made bank. My issue with them is that they aren’t content with just being billionaires, they lust for power,” Selkis asserted. Ripple And The Trump Administration As ZyCrypto reported previously, Ripple donated $5 million worth of XRP to Trump’s presidential inaugural fund. Reports say that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Trump could review its crypto-related cases and pause any that don’t have fraud allegations. Industry lawyers also bet that the SEC will soon abandon its crypto cases . Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty said on Jan. 15 that the regulator’s long-running enforcement case against the firm was “likely to be abandoned” by the incoming Trump administration after the agency filed an appeal challenging a July 2023 ruling that partially dismissed claims against the company. More interestingly, Trump is reportedly open to creating a wider national strategic reserve — prioritizing U.S.-founded cryptocurrencies such as XRP. The news was enough to send XRP to a price not seen since 2018. The crypto peaked at $3.38 — just two cents from its all-time high price mark.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-18 21:42:08

The surge in BTC price to an all-time high above $107K and on-chain factors led to most analysts gauging a bull peak around $150K. However, massive demand from institutional players and governments has fueled a much higher sentiment in 2025. $150K Is Too Low, Bitcoin Enthusiast Opines A crypto trader, Alex Becker, wrote on X that a $150K price target for this bull cycle is low compared to the level of institutional interest recorded. He noted that the price can easily be broken and way too short. Bitcoin price at $150K is 1/6th the gold market cap. For years, Bitcoin and gold backers have debated which asset is most valuable in light of present macro conditions. According to Becker, there is no reason for industry bulls to stop at 1/6th of an asset that is harder to hold, manage, access, and store. Bitcoin is termed the digital gold and unlike the yellow metal, it is easier for investors to hold and transfer. Market participants also point to Bitcoin’s supply and scarcity against gold making it a better asset. Bitcoin has also recorded rising institutional demand due to spot ETFs and other macro factors. Donald Trump’s election win also ushered in a new wave of inflows. With all factors considered, Becker expects a target between $250K and $400K. “ But these make absolutely no damn sense in the current environment. In the case of the biggest countries, funds and corporations are all using it to store value…A market cap that is 1/6th that of good is absolutely silly low. There is absolutely no reason for us to stop or cap at $150k. If we reach that there’s only more of a reason for us to go to 250k-400k,” he wrote. Impact on Wider Market Bitcoin price tapped a new all-time high above $107K, fueling optimism for a higher target. As bulls ramp up accumulations, altcoins whales are also prepping for a massive shift to their favorite assets. Several investors opine an altcoin season may be on the horizon after Bitcoin hits its cycle peak. At the moment, several altcoins like XRP and Cardano have shown signs of huge inflows. Ethereum whales also picked up huge holdings alongside transfers out of centralized exchanges.",Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|FIAT|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-18 21:45:44

Simultaneously, buzz is building around the latest Internet Computer news, featuring an upcoming YouTube livestream where innovators will explore the impacts of SNS on their projects. In this dynamic environment, BlockDAG (BDAG) is securing its position as a top crypto coin to watch with the recruitment of Marius Bock, previously a prominent figure at Cardano, now stepping in as the Lead Project Manager at BlockDAG. With Marius Bock’s leadership and strategic vision, BlockDAG is preparing for its eagerly awaited mainnet launch this year. Amidst the uncertainty faced by other cryptos, BlockDAG stands out as a top crypto of advancement. Explore Latest Movements by PEPE Coin Whales Recent movements by PEPE coin whales have once again highlighted them, generating both interest and discussion. A new wallet, “0x8f5,” has caused a stir by moving 280 billion PEPE tokens, valued at $5 million, out of Binance. This move follows the wallet’s previous acquisition of 47.4 million JASMY tokens, suggesting a deliberate diversification strategy. At the same time, another whale, “0xb1a,” has made a substantial purchase, securing 200.4 billion PEPE tokens for $3.72 million shortly before this report. These transactions might indicate a bullish outlook on PEPE’s future but also emphasize the meme coin market’s inherent instability. Such significant trades often prompt speculations about potential price changes or increased market action.

This follows reports of a whale trader profiting nearly $12 million from trading the token shortly after its release. The launch, which has triggered significant controversy, has drawn responses from financial experts, crypto enthusiasts, and ethics watchdogs. Eric Trump’s Take on $TRUMP Memecoin Eric Trump, the son of President-elect Donald Trump, commented on the $TRUMP memecoin’s rapid rise, calling it the “hottest digital meme on earth.” The $TRUMP token , launched late Friday, surged in value within hours, becoming a top trending topic in the cryptocurrency space. According to CoinGecko, its market capitalization exceeded $5 billion by Saturday afternoon, with trading volumes surpassing $11 billion. The token’s price more than doubled, reaching over $27 within 24 hours of its launch. The memecoin is owned primarily by CIC Digital LLC, a company tied to Donald Trump, which holds 80% of the token’s supply. With an estimated $20 billion in assets on paper under the current market price, the launch has raised questions about the intersection of Trump’s financial interests and his upcoming presidency. Peter Schiff, an economist and Bitcoin skeptic, weighed in on the rapid rise of the $TRUMP token. “It took Bitcoin four years to reach a $5 billion market cap. $TRUMP did it in one day,” he wrote on X. Schiff sarcastically suggested creating a strategic reserve for the memecoin and requiring its inclusion in retirement accounts. However, the comments drew mixed reactions, with some dismissing the comparison between Bitcoin and a newly launched meme-based cryptocurrency. Whale Trader Profits $11.8 Million Amid Market Activity A significant transaction involving the $TRUMP memecoin occurred hours after its launch, catching the attention of blockchain analysts. A whale trader, who reportedly spent $12 million purchasing 860,895 tokens at $13.94, sold the holdings at $27.67. The transaction resulted in an $11.8 million profit, showcasing the high volatility of the token in its early trading hours. This development has sparked concerns over the stability of the memecoin and the potential for market manipulation. Critics argue that speculative trading could harm smaller investors entering the market at inflated prices. Prominent figures, including former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, criticized the event. Scaramucci called the launch “an alarming level of corruption,” suggesting it reflects poorly on the broader cryptocurrency industry. Ethical Concerns Over Presidential Financial Ties The timing of the $TRUMP memecoin launch has led to ethical questions, as it occurred just days before Donald Trump’s inauguration as president. Historically, presidents-elect have made efforts to distance themselves from business ventures to avoid perceived conflicts of interest. The Trump administration’s direct ties to the cryptocurrency have drawn scrutiny from ethics watchdogs. Jordan Libowitz of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington commented on the situation, stating, “This is a president-elect launching businesses alongside promises to deregulate industries where he stands to profit.” Trump has also faced criticism for promoting cryptocurrency-friendly policies during his campaign, including proposals to overhaul crypto regulations and have the federal government stockpile Bitcoin.

Whale Sells $23.82 Million in Holdings appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Today, January 19, 2024, while major cryptocurrencies seem to be struggling, Donald Trump’s newly launched meme coin, Official Trump (TRUMP), is making waves and gaining significant attention from crypto enthusiasts. The potential reason behind this attention is the TRUMP coin’s over 300% upside momentum and a post made by President-elect Trump. Crypto Whale Sold Entire TRUMP Meme Coin On January 18, 2024, following a post on X (formerly Twitter), the price of TRUMP began soaring. Noticing its potential for upside momentum, a crypto whale spent a significant 12 million USDC to purchase 860,895 TRUMP meme coins at an average price of $13.94. However, as the price continued to rise significantly, the same whale dumped their entire TRUMP holding at an average price of $27.67, making a profit of $11.8 million. A whale dumped 860,895 $TRUMP for 23.8M $USDC just now. This whale spent 12M $USDC to buy 860,895 $TRUMP at $13.94, then sold it at $27.67, making a profit of $11.8M! https://t.co/1f98ch5Pi4 pic.twitter.com/nfuYYShyij — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 18, 2025 Adding to this massive sell-off, a crypto expert revealed on X that Trump’s team has allegedly sold $500 million worth of TRUMP tokens while retaining 85% of the total supply. TRUMP Price Momentum Despite this substantial dumping, TRUMP reached a high of $35. However, due to some profit-taking, the price now appears to be correcting. At the time of writing, the meme coin trades at $27.75, maintaining a significant 330% gain in the past 24 hours. This significant price surge in the past 24 hours has consistently attracted new investors and crypto giants, contributing to the continuous price increases the meme coin is experiencing. With only 200 million TRUMP of the total 1 billion supply currently in circulation, concerns are rising over the potential impact of future token releases.

Trump Buys Solana (TRUMPSOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Buys Solana launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Buys Solana by entering its contract address – 8Ruz6rzYPpKHActX3jo49v8WBhiJ5KsGM6dyCghQj3i – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SOL|SHIB|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-18 22:20:00

Input Output Global (IOG), the main firm behind Cardano, confirmed that it will be supporting the Plomin hard fork on the mainnet as of January 18, 2025. According to a tweet , “We’re happy to share that Input | Output has today voted “Yes” on the Plomin Hard Fork governance action.” This means that all the conditions which are stated in the Interim Constitution have been fulfilled to the letter. IOG representatives emphasized that there was internal and independent technical assessment before this milestone. Moreover, more than 85% of the active stake pools have been updated to the required client node versions of 10.1.3 or 10.1.4 to meet the consensus rules of the guardrail HARDFORK-04. The Intersect’s Hard Fork Working Group has also submitted readiness reports that only serves as a testament of the readiness of the network to this upgrade. The Plomin activation is a constitutional milestone for Cardano according to its decentralized governance plan. Is a 400% rally on the cards for ADA? With the bearish pressure in the cryptocurrency market being less severe, large-cap altcoins are displaying early indications of a comeback. Cardano has quickly become one of the best-performing assets in the cryptocurrency market by the year 2025. After weeks of downward movement, ADA has managed to regain and trade above the $1 level. Crypto analysts are now speculating about the next move for the price of Cardano. Prominent analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted fractals—which are patterns in the price, to indicate that Cardano is about to experience a significant price action. Martinez likened the current trend to the late 2020 rise of ADA, which jumped from $0.4 to above $3, this being its peak. Source: X In his analysis, he argued that Cardano could follow a similar trend, and it might hit $6 within two to three weeks. This would mean a 400% increase from the price at which it currently trades. At the time of writing this, ADA is selling at $1.15, which is about 5% higher than its value on the previous day and 20% higher than a week ago. Surging ADA TVL Aside from price recovery, Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem is also growing. The total value locked (TVL) in Cardano protocols has risen by 25% in the year so far, increasing from $430 million to $538 million. The institutional and large-scale investors have greatly contributed to the appreciation of the price of Cardano. According to blockchain analytics firm Santiment, whale transactions worth more than $100k have picked up as Ada’s price has risen. This increased activity is attributed to the increased confidence of institutional investors, increased trading and supporting the bullish outlook. Source: Santiment Cardano’s connection to the new US administration is another factor that makes it attractive to the market. The company’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, is said to be among the potential members of President-elect Donald Trump’s crypto council which will advise the new administration on digital currency laws.

Recently, the community started discussing a new plan to reduce inflation, aiming at the network’s long-term stability. The proposal suggests lowering the annual inflation rate from 5.7% to 1.5%. While this plan seeks to reduce inflation and enhance stability, it has led to mixed reactions, especially from stakers who worry about how it will affect their rewards. Solana Community Proposal Sparks Mixed Reactions From Stakers The Solana blockchain is known for processing many transactions quickly and at low costs. It uses an inflationary model, creating new tokens yearly to reward stakers who help secure the network. This encourages more people to stake their tokens, which improves the network’s decentralization and security. However, as the network grows, the increasing number of tokens raises concerns about inflation. This could reduce the value of Solana (SOL) tokens over time. Meanwhile, the proposal has received mixed reactions from the Solana staking community. Some stakers believe that reducing inflation is necessary to protect the value of their assets. Many stakers are worried that the proposed reduction could lower staking rewards. As the community discusses and improves the proposal, it’s clear that Solana is trying to find a balance between controlling inflation and keeping strong incentives for its growing network of participants. The final decision will likely affect the blockchain’s economic model for many years. IMF Predicts Global Inflation Drop to 3.5% As reported by TheCoinRise, the International Monetary Fund projects that inflation will fall to 3.5% by the end of 2025 , down from a peak of 9.4% in 2022. “The battle against inflation is almost won,” Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, IMF’s Chief Economist, stated last year. “The global economy has shown resilience, and we expect growth to hold steady at 3.2% for the next two years.” This stabilization in inflation would bring potential benefits such as reduced living costs and lower interest rates. Notably, the benefits could positively impact cryptocurrencies and tech stocks. Despite the encouraging inflation outlook, Gourinchas warned that geopolitical tensions and other global uncertainties could pose economic risks . However, the IMF called for a policy triple pivot to stabilize interest rates, reduce government spending, and implement reforms to boost productivity. Solana Becomes a Leading Blockchain for New Developers Due to its excellent performance, Solana has recently become the talk of the DeFi market . Since 2016, Ethereum has been the best DeFi development network for new developers, but Solana’s recent network reports have hijacked the mantle. While Solana now holds over 7,625 new developers, surpassing Ethereum, analysts are positive that this could further brighten its price sentiment.

Unveiled on Jan. 17, just before Trump’s inauguration as the 47th president, TRUMP reached a market cap of nearly $9 billion within hours, surpassing popular memecoins like Pepe and Bonk. “My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING! Join my very special Trump Community. GET YOUR TRUMP NOW,” Trump announced on Truth Social and X. While some in the crypto community questioned the authenticity of the project, a source close to Trump’s family confirmed to Cointelegraph that the initiative is legitimate and ties into his existing NFT ventures. A surge of trades underscored the token’s rapid rise. Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that a wallet named “LeBron” turned a $1 million investment into over $2 million by acquiring 4.52 million TRUMP tokens shortly after launch. Another trader made $70 million in under four hours, converting an initial $1.1 million investment into significant profits by selling 1.35 million TRUMP for 3.65 million USDC while keeping additional tokens valued at $67.5 million. Pseudonymous trader 0xsun also saw substantial gains, purchasing nearly 1 million TRUMP tokens with 3,000 Solana (worth $653,000) and later selling part of their holdings for $812,000, netting over $3.7 million in profit. Whales joined the frenzy as well, with one withdrawing 61,205 SOL, valued at $14.3 million, to purchase 1.27 million TRUMP tokens. Another whale spent 8.5 million USDC to acquire 1.03 million tokens at an average price of $8.28. At the time of writing, TRUMP traded at $18.82 with a market cap of $4.28 billion, a 10,222% increase since launch.

One trend shaking things up lately is the rise of Bulls Squad—projects that rally communities and drive utility in ways that traditional coins simply can’t. These squads bring together loyal holders and inject new energy into the ecosystem, particularly with projects tied to gaming, rewards, and meme culture. If you’re after a coin with serious staying power, you’ve got to consider how its squad delivers on both innovation and engagement. Now, who doesn’t love a good underdog story? Meme coins have been the heart and soul of crypto’s most unexpected successes, with coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu making waves over the years. They’ve proven that a dash of humor, mixed with a strong community, can translate into big gains. But the meme game is changing. New players like BTFD Coin (BTFD), Mog Coin (MOG), and Apu Apustaja (APU) are rewriting the rulebook with bold utilities and killer presales. BTFD Coin, in particular, is catching everyone’s eye. Not just for its presale buzz (more on that later), but for its Bulls Squad—a unique initiative blending staking, P2E gaming, and community-driven rewards. If you think meme coins can’t innovate, BTFD is here to prove you wrong. Ready to dive in? Let’s break it all down. BTFD Coin: Bulls Squad, Presale Perks, and Beyond BTFD Coin has smashed onto the scene like a bull in a china shop—unstoppable and ready to charge. With over $5.1 million raised so far and more than 64 billion coins sold across 8,600 holders, its presale is dominating headlines. Starting at just $0.000004, the coin’s price has climbed to $0.000142 in Stage 13, with a post-presale listing set at $0.0006. This isn’t just a hype train—it’s a freight train of value. What sets BTFD apart? It’s all about the Bulls Squad , a community-first initiative combining staking rewards and P2E gaming. Picture this: you’re not just holding your coins—you’re putting them to work in a gamified ecosystem where strategy and loyalty pay off big time. Whether you’re a hardcore gamer or a casual crypto enthusiast, the Bulls Squad has something for you. And let’s not ignore the presale perks. Early buyers snag more BTFD for less, setting them up for significant profits when the coin hits exchanges. Let’s crunch the numbers: if you drop $35,000 on BTFD at $0.000142 in Stage 13, you’ll bag roughly 246 million coins. When the price hits $0.0006 post-presale, that’s a whopping $147,600.

The recent Celestia upgrade has drastically reduced block times, effectively doubling the network’s efficiency and data handling capabilities. Concurrently, bullish trends in Render’s pricing emerge as its transition to Solana introduces enhanced functionalities. Amidst these developments, BlockDAG is making waves with a revolutionary approach. Through its collaboration with HackerEarth, BlockDAG (BDAG) is set to mobilize more than 10,000 developers and launch over 200 projects aimed at tackling blockchain scalability issues. This movement marks a shift towards practical, real-world applications and establishes BlockDAG as a formidable force in defining the future of blockchain technology. As new major players in the crypto market take the stage, don’t miss your chance to engage with innovations that could echo the early triumphs of Ethereum. BlockDAG’s Hackathons Pave the Way for Scalable Blockchain Solutions BlockDAG is stepping up like major crypto players such as Ethereum and Solana by partnering with HackerEarth. This collaboration is poised to revolutionize blockchain scalability by drawing over 10,000 developers into a series of global hackathons. The goal is to deploy over 200 projects within the BlockDAG network, offering viable solutions for decentralized finance, infrastructure, and governance challenges. The scope and concentration of these hackathons underline BlockDAG’s dedication to cultivating a robust crypto ecosystem. Central to these initiatives is the adoption of advanced technologies like the Phantom and GhostDAG protocols, which are set to enhance transaction speed and efficiency significantly. These hackathons will bring BlockDAG into collaboration with gifted developers worldwide, promoting breakthroughs that might parallel Ethereum’s formative growth. Smaller, specialized hackathons further showcase BlockDAG’s adaptability and commitment to meeting niche industry demands. BlockDAG’s presale figures underscore its burgeoning potential. Having raised over $182 million and sold 17.9 billion units, early participants have witnessed a staggering 2380% increase in value, with each unit currently priced at $0.0248. This offers a thrilling opportunity for newcomers to join a rapidly growing ecosystem that’s quickly gaining recognition as a major upcoming crypto force.

By fostering applications and decentralized projects that address real-world needs, BlockDAG is positioning itself as a leader in the blockchain arena. The forthcoming opportunities could profoundly influence the future of Web3 technologies. Celestia’s Speed Boost Unleashes New Capabilities The latest update to Celestia has dramatically reduced block times from 30 to 15 seconds, doubling the network’s capacity for handling data. This significant enhancement boosts transaction efficiency, making Celestia an even more attractive platform for developers in search of scalable solutions. Furthermore, this upgrade prepares the ground for future enhancements, such as expanding block sizes to 1 gigabyte, a move that could place it in competition with major transaction processors like Visa in terms of capacity. As of January 2025, Celestia’s native asset, TIA, is valued at $5.07, holding a market capitalization of $715.75 million. Despite a recent 7-day decrease of 6.69% in value, TIA’s trading volume of $149.39 million suggests sustained interest. With the upgrade unlocking numerous possibilities, Celestia is on a trajectory for significant growth, especially as the adoption of modular blockchain solutions continues to spread across various sectors. Render’s Price Outlook and Solana Switch Fuel Momentum Recent forecasts for Render indicate a promising growth outlook, propelled by its transition to the Solana network. This strategic shift drastically cuts transaction costs and boosts overall network performance, positioning Render as a scalable solution for intensive rendering demands. Integration with AI tools and services like Cinema 4D and Redshift expands its allure, particularly within the creative sectors. As of January 2025, Render’s currency, RNDR, is priced at $6.82, with analysts predicting potential peaks between $14.32 and $20.25 during this cycle. Longer-term forecasts suggest a price range of $50 to $80, buoyed by recent technological advancements and strategic alliances.

The Bottom Line The recent Celestia update has halved block times and doubled the network’s data capacity, positioning TIA as a strong contender in the market, currently priced at $5.07 with a market cap of $715.75 million. Likewise, optimism surrounds Render, with RNDR trading at $6.82 and price targets ranging from $14.32 to $20.25 for this cycle. Yet, it’s BlockDAG that’s taking the most ambitious strides.

Meanwhile, Arbitrum price shows modest gains, reflecting its steady role in Ethereum scaling. However, a lesser-known contender, Web3Bay (3BAY), is quietly stealing the spotlight with a practical approach that transcends speculation. While Solana benefits from ETF optimism and Arbitrum refines layer-2 scaling, Web3Bay focuses on reshaping e-commerce with blockchain-powered solutions. In a market crowded with speculative tokens, Web3Bay(3BAY) delivers a tangible use case: transforming global e-commerce. It’s not just another blockchain project; it’s a solution for businesses and consumers alike, bridging traditional finance and cryptocurrency. Investors searching for meaningful growth opportunities in 2025 might find Web3Bay more compelling than both Solana and Arbitrum. Web3Bay: Transforming E-Commerce with Blockchain Web3Bay is making headlines as the next big disruptor in the e-commerce industry. By integrating blockchain technology into its core operations, Web3Bay is eliminating the inefficiencies of traditional platforms, including high fees and lack of transparency. Instead, it offers users a decentralized, secure, and cost-effective way to engage in online shopping. Central to its ecosystem is the 3BAY token, which enables crypto payments and grants users perks like a 5% discount on purchases and community-driven governance. The presale for Web3Bay has already garnered immense attention, raising over $830,000 and selling more than 220 million tokens. Currently priced at just $0.0045626, the token’s affordability and projected launch price of $0.1959 make it a lucrative opportunity for early investors. With plans to expand into decentralized storage, multi-chain compatibility, and Layer-2 scaling for fast transactions, Web3Bay is well on its way to reshaping global commerce. As Web3Bay expands and adoption increases, the demand for 3BAY is set to skyrocket. By acting now, investors can lock in tokens at their lowest price, well ahead of the next price jump and the growing attention of the broader market. Solana Price Crosses $200 Mark Again As of January 17, 2025, Solana (SOL) is trading at $213.40, reflecting a 5.10% increase from the previous close. The intraday high reached $216.36, with a low of $198.74. The Solana price has been positively influenced by the anticipation of regulatory approval for Solana-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Industry experts suggest that the pro-crypto stance of the current U.S. administration may facilitate the approval of these ETFs, potentially attracting significant institutional investments. Analysts project that, upon approval, Solana ETFs could draw substantial investments, further boosting the Solana price.This development underscores the growing confidence in Solana’s ecosystem and its potential for mainstream adoption. Arbitrum Price Sees Modest Uptick Amid Market Fluctuations Arbitrum, an Ethereum layer-two scaling solution, utilizes optimistic rollups to enhance transaction speed and reduce costs. Arbitrum’s native token, ARB, is trading at approximately $0.7820, reflecting a 1.31% increase from the previous close. The token’s intraday performance has seen highs of $0.7871 and lows of $0.7499, indicating moderate volatility. Over the past week, ARB has experienced a 9.32% decline, aligning with broader market trends. Despite this downturn, the 24-hour trading volume has reached $235.32 million, suggesting sustained investor interest. The current market capitalization stands at approximately $3.11 billion, with a circulating supply of 4.21 billion ARB tokens. Takeaway While Solana price climbs on ETF optimism and Arbitrum price steadies amid market fluctuations, Web3Bay (3BAY) is building a foundation for lasting impact. Solana benefits from its thriving ecosystem, and Arbitrum enhances Ethereum’s scalability, but Web3Bay addresses everyday challenges in global commerce—fees, speed, and transparency. This focus on utility positions Web3Bay as more than just an investment; it’s a bridge between blockchain and real-world applications. The platform’s presale performance speaks volumes, with $830,000 raised , over 220 million tokens sold , and an attractive price of $0.004562625 . A projected launch price of $0.1959 signals significant upside for early investors. Features like NFT integration, decentralized governance, and seamless multi-chain functionality make Web3Bay a standout.

The announcement on January 17 through Trump’s Truth Social account stated that the token was for him and his “winning.” The initial speculation pointed towards a possible hack, but the confirmation came shortly after, with Trump becoming the first U.S. president to endorse a meme coin. Critics raise ethical concerns Like others, the TRUMP meme coin has been criticized for having no real-world application. Critics and analysts have pointed out that using the Trump administration’s position to endorse cryptocurrency is questionable. YouTuber Stephen Findeisen, also known as Coffeezilla, criticized the timings of the project. In a Jan. 18 post, he called the launch of the coin ‘unethical’ and raised concerns with the reported 80% of the coins being distributed to Trump’s inner circle. Findeisen described the situation as ‘nasty work’ due to the risks of large losses for inexperienced investors. > dropping TRUMP memecoin 2 days before becoming president is nasty work > new SEC/DOJ guarantees no prosecution > 80% of tokens vest to insiders DURING the presidency > most ppl losing money will be MAGA who aren't crypto native > *should* be a crime but crime is legal now ig? — Coffeezilla (@coffeebreak_YT) January 18, 2025 Peter Schiff, an economist who has consistently dismissed cryptos, likened the coin to Bitcoin in sarcasm while making fun of it. Former Trump aide Anthony Scaramucci called it “corruption” and warned it may negatively impact the broader crypto market. Crypto-influencer Max Schwartzman said that it is possible that Trump’s account was hacked, as the TRUMP COIN website has the same design as Trump’s previous NFT project. Others, like 0xCygaar, pointed out that the two have similar technical structures, which only added to the hype. Ok yeah the new Trump memecoin website is deployed almost identically to his previous NFT website. Same cloudflare setup, same deployment with Heroku, same SSL certificate issuer. Very similar HTML structure as before. pic.twitter.com/u1zLD7Vcv7 — cygaar (@0xCygaar) January 18, 2025 Explosive growth amid controversy After the launch, the token only took 15 minutes to reach a market cap of $400 million. The launch also saw SOL, Solana’s native token, rise to an all-time high of $267 due to the buzz around the TRUMP token. However, the TRUMP coin has soared and has recorded more than 12,000% adoption after its launch despite the backlash it has received. The token’s value reached close to $35 and then hovered around $29, taking the market capitalization to $5.98 billion. Successful traders have made a lot of money, with one of them reportedly making $50,000 to $1.1 million within a few hours. However, doubts remain about the prospects of the token in the future. Currently, only 20% of the 1 billion TRUMP coins are in circulation with the remaining 80% to be released over the next 36 months. At the moment, the first twenty holders possess 87.02% of the total token supply, which means only 12.97% remains for all other investors and traders. The developer wallet alone is estimated at about $15.5 billion, which raises questions about developers controlling and manipulating the market. Some critics have claimed that this sort of ownership control weakens the token in question. Crypto analyst JRNY Crypto raised concerns about the lack of concrete information coming from Trump’s advisors to support the project. The FOMO on the TRUMP token pushed many traders into action, causing a rise in the Solana price and an increase in its on-chain activity. Analyst Will Clemente pointed to the chaos, stating that traders have been dumping other assets to buy into the TRUMP phenomenon. However, some analysts have expressed concern that the fast pace may result in a quick drop. Never seen anything like this, SOL ripping and everything on chain nuking as people panic sell to fomo into Trump’s memecoin.

According to the company’s official announcement , trading for the controversial token began at 20:15 PM UTC on January 18. But as the token hits Kraken, it also saw a 35% decline in value. The token, which celebrates Trump’s leadership and his campaign slogan “Fight, Fight, Fight,” debuted only a few hours ago but has since seen an over 120,000 surge. TRUMP has now surpassed retail sensation stock GameStop (GME), which made history in 2021 and was thought to be the biggest market mania of the 2020s. The initial market frenzy sent TRUMP’s market cap soaring to nearly $6 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Trump launched the meme coin on January 17 through a post on Truth Social and X (formerly Twitter). In his signature style, Trump hyped the token as a rallying point for his movement, declaring, “My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!” The coin’s official website described TRUMP as a token for those who “don’t back down, no matter the odds.” And Trump’s highly-anticipated inauguration is less than 48 hours away. Behind the scenes, the token is managed by Fight Fight Fight LLC, a company promising to release an additional 800 million TRUMP tokens over the next three years. A first batch of 200 million coins hit the market during the launch. Exchanges pile on Other major centralized exchanges (CEXs) were ahead of Kraken. Singapore-based Crypto.com added trading pairs, allowing users to purchase TRUMP using USD, EUR, and 20 other fiat currencies. Meanwhile, Bybit opened pre-market trading for TRUMP/USDT with a call auction on January 18 at 9:35 AM UTC. On decentralized exchanges (DEXs), the token gained traction too. Platforms like Raydium, Orca, and Meteora listed TRUMP. In total, more than ten exchanges, including MEXC, HTX, and CoinW, now support TRUMP trading pairs. But this whole thing is just Trump putting his money where his mouth is. Last summer, he spoke at a Bitcoin conference in Nashville, promising to make America the “crypto capital of the planet.” His sons, Donald Jr. and Eric founded World Liberty Financial, a family-run venture focused on decentralized and centralized finance (DeFi and CeFi). Eric has called TRUMP “the hottest digital meme on earth.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",News|Kraken,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-18 23:33:39

Donald Trump the Bull (DONBULL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONBULL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Trump the Bull can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Trump the Bull could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Trump the Bull launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Trump the Bull on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Donald Trump the Bull by entering its contract address – AmgaL1uuQ97qJoXfUUxdHipLJmVd3toChivEBiSFn7MW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONBULL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|TRADING|DOGE|SOL|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-18 23:39:00

Despite seeing a 34% price drop, the Litecoin analysis suggests a potential recovery for LTC if it can break through resistance at $100. Likewise, Hyperliquid’s price has risen by 18%, showing signs of a possible recovery if it surpasses $24.62. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) has announced an exciting partnership with global hackathon leader HackerEarth. Through this collaboration, BlockDAG aims to build over 200 Web3 projects and engage 10,000 to 15,000 developers through four global hackathons. This exciting development comes as analysts predict major growth for BlockDAG, expecting BDAG to reach $1 this year, as its presale quickly moves toward its $600 million target. Litecoin (LTC) Analysis: What’s Next After the 34% Drop? Litecoin (LTC) analysis shows LTC had a strong run in late 2024, breaking key resistance levels and reaching a three-year high. However, the price has since dropped 34%, though it found support around $100, creating a higher low. If Litecoin continues its upward movement, it could break through its resistance and signal the end of the correction. Current Litecoin analysis shows that LTC is still in a bullish trend, with key indicators suggesting potential for further growth. A breakout above resistance at $95 could push Litecoin toward $184, marking a major price gain. Recovery Signs Appear as Hyperliquid Price Rises Hyperliquid’s price has seen an 18% increase, bouncing back from a recent low. After experiencing a bearish trend with a death cross earlier, Hyperliquid’s price now shows signs of recovery. The 9-period EMA has risen above the 20-period EMA, signaling a potential reversal. If HYPE breaks above key levels like $24.62, it could target $28.42, with further upside potential towards $40. However, if it faces resistance, the price could drop to as low as $15.11. The next few days will be crucial for determining the token’s direction. 200+ New Web3 Projects Coming to BlockDAG Network! BlockDAG is becoming a key player in Web3 innovation through its latest partnership with HackerEarth, a global leader in hosting online hackathons. Through this collaboration, BlockDAG plans to launch over 200 new projects on its network, helping teams create decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain solutions. With HackerEarth’s huge community of 7.6 million developers, BlockDAG will gain access to a large pool of talent, speeding up the growth of its ecosystem. To reach its goal, the network will host four global hackathons, involving 10,000 to 15,000 developers. These hackathons will offer developers a chance to showcase their work and gain exposure while also pushing the adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi), infrastructure, and governance solutions. Overall, this partnership goes a long way in boosting BlockDAG’s visibility and strengthening its position as a go-to network for developers aiming to make an impact in Web3. This surge in developer activity will likely lead to significant growth in BlockDAG’s ecosystem, potentially boosting the value of the BDAG coin. Analysts predict that as the mainnet launch gets closer and BlockDAG’s crypto presale —currently at $181.5 million—moves toward its $600 million target, BDAG could reach $1 in 2025. Currently priced at $0.0248 in batch 27 and having delivered a 2,380% ROI to early holders, BlockDAG remains one of the best crypto coins to buy now. Insider Pick: The Best Crypto Coin To Buy Now! The Litecoin (LTC) analysis shows strong potential for further growth, with a breakout above $95 possibly pushing its price toward $184. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid’s price shows signs of recovery, with potential upside if it breaks key resistance at $24.62, targeting $28.42 and beyond. However, BlockDAG remains the best crypto coin to buy today, offering impressive $1 growth potential alongside innovative partnerships. Its presale has already reached $181.5 million, and the partnership with HackerEarth is driving massive developer activity. In essence, BlockDAG’s ambitious goal of over 200 Web3 projects and four global hackathons this year make it a key player in Web3 innovation—and one of the top cryptos to buy in 2025.

Crypto stakeholders were expecting regulatory clarity and more friendliness toward the industry. Nobody saw him launching a memecoin days before his inauguration. According to reports, the incoming POTUS did not inform those in his circle of his plans to launch a memecoin. The token launch went live hours before the inaugural crypto ball hosted by Trump’s White House Czar, David Sacks. Analysts calm talks of reward for NFT holders Growing speculation that holders of Trump’s NFT cards could get allocations of the memecoin caused the collection’s floor price to surge over 400% today. The floor price surged as high as $1,000, making the trading cards one of the best-performing NFT projects in recent times. Trading activity of Trump NFT trading cards surged along with the memecoins. Source: MagicEden The NFTs were sold in multiple issues, with an average price of $99 per card. With today’s rally, some holders are up by as much as 13x their buying price on the NFTs. Investors active in the space quickly highlighted that the same company that helped launch the NFT collections, CIC Digital, is also involved with the TRUMP memecoin. However, it appears that NFT holders will not receive any automatic allocations or airdrops as outlined on the gettrumpmemes.com website. The “meme cards” term that led holders to speculate about a potential allocation appears to be another term the project used to describe its tokens, not the previously held NFT cards. UPDATE: Apparently they call the $TRUMP itself ""meme cards"" which is also in their terms & conditions. This makes an airdrop highly unlikely, since ""card allocation"" in this context means basically ""tokenomics"", not ""allocation for trading cards NFTs"" pic.twitter.com/B2rQmIYSWD — wale.moca 🐳 (@waleswoosh) January 18, 2025 The collection trades on Polygon and has seen a 24-hour trading volume of 2,380,000 $POL ($1.1 million). The project has yet to make any announcements or acknowledge any chatter about NFT holders receiving token allocations or airdrops. TRUMP token continues to divide opinions Like Donald Trump, his memecoin evokes mixed reactions on opposite ends of the spectrum. On one hand, some crypto citizens are excited by the POTUS interacting with crypto at this level. However, the other camp is skeptical about the long-term effect of involvement with the crypto community. Already, many in his circle have made bank thanks to the series of launches linked to his name. World Liberty Finance , the DeFi project linked to the Trump family is also closely tracked as some in the crypto space consider its transactions with projects as endorsements . Another issue investors have noted is that Trump Group affiliates CIC Digital LLC and Fighter Fight LLC hold 80% of the token’s total supply. However, those tokens are subject to a 3-year unlocking plan, which helps to allay fears of a sudden dump on the market. However, there are now claims the launch team has sold up to $500 million worth of the memecoin already. Still, the memecoin continues to soar to new levels. It has already gained over $5 billion in market cap and almost $13 billion in trading volume to trade for about $29.

The native token of the XRPLedger is rallying alongside the top crypto. Trump’s upcoming inauguration is one of the leading catalysts, alongside optimism on crypto regulation, pro-crypto policy and a new approach by financial regulatory agencies in the U.S. XRP could gain further, entering price discovery next week.

XRP supply distribution | Source: Santiment Market movers and Ripple lawsuit Monday’s inauguration is the largest market mover in crypto. But RippleNet’s rising adoption among institutions, the developments in RLUSD stablecoin and the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple are the three key market movers influencing the altcoin’s price. Even as the U.S. financial regulator filed an appeal against Ripple on Jan. 15, the altcoin continued its rally undeterred. The July 2023 ruling by Judge Analisa Torres that classified secondary sales of XRP as non-securities is being challenged and the SEC is seeking to have those retail sales classified as unregistered securities sales. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, told crypto.news in an exclusive interview: “XRP’s surge can be attributed to favorable outcomes in Ripple’s SEC lawsuit and a more crypto-friendly political climate in the US. If regulatory uncertainties are resolved, the influx of institutional investors could further solidify XRP’s position in the crypto market.” It remains to be seen whether the Trump administration will support pro-crypto regulation and whether it influences the outcome of lawsuits against firms like Ripple Labs.

XRP/USDT weekly price chart | Source: Crypto.news Expert commentary on XRP James Toledano, COO at Unity Wallet, told crypto.news in an exclusive interview: “Given that XRP was stuck at around $0.50 for literally 3 years, its recent breakout momentum reflects new levels of investor optimism around regulatory clarity and the potential approval of an XRP ETF in the following months. If the XRP ETF gets approved, it will have the potential to open the floodgates of capital inflow, meaning it could reach new heights in 2025.” Toledano warns XRP holders to be wary as altcoins take volatility to the next level in the current market cycle. He said: “Altcoin ETFs have genuine potential to attract capital, especially if supported by innovation-friendly policies with the new incoming U.S. administration. But, their success may be less consistent compared to Bitcoin ETFs due to the seemingly episodic nature of interest in altcoins. Just take a look at fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price this week. The factors are multifaceted; we could say it’s Trump, seasonality, geopolitics, macroeconomics and sentiment all blended together. To play devil’s advocate, we humans are pattern seekers but sometimes there are hidden drivers and the cause and effects are not always linked.” Read more: TRUMP surpasses $10B market cap in a day, listed on ChangeNOW and other exchanges for instant swap Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

From Dogecoin to Shiba Inu, and more recently Dogwifhat (WIF), these projects have proven that humor, community, and the power of the internet can turn even the quirkiest coins into success stories. Dogwifhat joined the ranks in December 2023, riding the wave of meme coin hype and delivering consistent market value despite limited utility. But as the crypto market evolves, so does the competition. Enter BTFD Coin, a meme coin designed not just to generate buzz but to create tangible value for its holders. With a 90% APY staking program, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, and an innovative presale model, BTFD Coin isn’t just here to follow the trend—it’s here to set the standard for the best coin presales to buy in 2025 . BTFD Coin: 90% APY Staking Rewards and Bulls Squad Power BTFD Coin is more than just a meme; it’s a full-fledged investment opportunity built on community strength and impressive tokenomics. At the heart of its appeal is the jaw-dropping 90% APY staking program , which offers investors a way to earn consistent, high rewards by simply holding and staking their tokens. This feature is a game-changer for those looking to maximize passive income from their crypto portfolio. Let’s break it down: Suppose you invest $6,000 during the presale at the current price of $0.000142 per coin. That nets you over 42 million BTFD tokens. When BTFD hits its projected listing price of $0.0006, your investment would already quadruple to $18,000. Add staking into the mix, and the potential compounding returns become even more attractive. Imagine using those rewards to fund a dream vacation, pay off debt, or reinvest in other crypto projects. The staking program isn’t the only reason to get excited. BTFD Coin launched its P2E game on January 1, 2025, blending entertainment with earning potential. Players can earn $BTFD tokens while enjoying a dynamic and engaging game, further integrating the coin into everyday use. BTFD’s presale performance has been nothing short of stellar. Stage 13 is already 97% complete, with over $5.2 million raised and more than 64 billion coins sold. With the price set to increase soon, now is the perfect time to join the 8,600+ investors already backing this project. Analysts predict a post-listing price of $0.006, which translates to a staggering 4000% ROI for early adopters. This is your chance to be part of one of the best coin presales to buy before it’s too late. How to Buy BTFD Coins: Getting started is simple. Set up your MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB or ETH, and connect it to the presale page . Once connected, select the amount you want to purchase, confirm the transaction, and you’re in. Dogwifhat: A Meme Coin That Made Its Mark Dogwifhat entered the scene as a playful addition to the meme coin family, featuring a dog wearing a quirky hat as its mascot. Despite lacking real-world utility, it gained traction thanks to its lighthearted branding and strong community support. Its value has remained relatively stable, making it a notable success in the meme coin space. Investors who got in early on Dogwifhat reaped substantial rewards. The coin quickly climbed from obscurity to prominence, proving once again that community-driven projects can thrive in the crypto world. However, like many meme coins, its success depended largely on its ability to generate hype and maintain interest over time. For those who missed out on Dogwifhat’s early days, BTFD Coin offers a fresh opportunity. Unlike Dogwifhat, BTFD brings tangible utility to the table with its staking rewards, P2E game, and referral program. These features make it one of the best coin presales to buy in 2025, providing a unique combination of fun and financial growth. The Final Thoughts Dogwifhat may have made its mark, but BTFD Coin is rewriting the rules of meme coin investing. With its 90% APY staking program, innovative P2E game, and record-breaking presale performance, BTFD is more than just another meme coin—it’s a movement. Don’t let this opportunity slip away. With Stage 13 nearly complete and the potential for 4000% ROI , now is the time to invest in one of the best coin presales to buy this year. Secure your spot in the Bulls Squad today and watch your crypto portfolio take off. The future of meme coins is here, and it’s called BTFD Coin.

At $28 per token, and with Trump-affiliated companies CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC controlling 80% of the supply, the value of his crypto holdings alone has soared to $22.4 billion. For context, Forbes last valued Trump at $5.6 billion last November. TRUMP traded at just $7 per token at launch but skyrocketed within hours, achieving a fully diluted valuation of $27 billion. This all comes less than 48 hours before Trump’s inauguration. Only 200 million tokens are currently circulating, but there’s a plan to expand this to 1 billion over the next three years, as per the token’s official website . The timing of the launch has drawn intense scrutiny. A US president-elect releasing a business product days before taking office is quite literally unheard of. At an unofficial crypto inaugural ball Friday night, Trump’s crypto and AI czar, David Sacks, promised that: “The reign of terror against crypto is over. Innovation in America for crypto has just begun.” Meanwhile, crypto companies have donated over $10 million to Trump’s inauguration, after donating over $300 million to him during the campaign. What critics are worried about But of course some people are not happy about any of this. Admittedly, TRUMP does blur the lines between his presidency and personal profit. But hey, this is Donald Trump. When has he ever followed rules? “It’s absolutely wild,” said Jordan Libowitz, vice president for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “Presidents-elect usually spend this time separating themselves from their finances. Trump is doing the opposite—launching a business and promising deregulation in ways that blatantly benefit him.” Anthony Scaramucci, once Trump’s communications director and now a crypto investor, slammed the launch on X, calling it “Idi Amin-level corruption.” He added, “Don’t delude yourself. This is bad for the industry.” Nick Tomaino, a venture capitalist and former Coinbase executive, warned that the level of ownership in TRUMP could harm smaller investors. “Trump owning 80% and timing the launch hours before inauguration is predatory, and many will likely get hurt by it,” he posted on social media. Blockchain data backs up these concerns. As was reported by Cryptopolitan, analyst Conor has revealed that Trump’s team has already offloaded $500 million worth of tokens. Transactions show $20 million worth of TRUMP tokens being sent to Bybit within seven hours of the launch. Most of the USDC reserves tied to these transactions were funneled into liquidity pools on Meteora, consolidating Trump’s position even more. The official TRUMP website has a disclaimer that the token is “not an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security.” Meanwhile, Solana saw a 16% price surge in the 24 hours following the TRUMP launch on its network, hitting an intraday high of 23%. According to CoinGecko data, this is Solana’s most profitable day of the year so far, despite Ethereum taking a 7% hit during the same period. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson said, “Apparently, 78.5 percent of Trump’s net wealth of 29.6 billion is in crypto, making him one of the richest cryptocurrency entrepreneurs.” Meanwhile, Solana has always been pitched as a “faster, cheaper,” alternative to Ethereum. The blockchain hosts a wide range of DeFi projects, and since last year, it has become the meme coin capital of the world. PEPE, WIF, PENGU, and MOTHER are just a few of the meme coins that have now made Solana invaluable to the industry. But TRUMP is different. See, just twelve hours after launch, it became the largest meme coin on Solana. SOL has already risen 25% this year, after posting an 85% gain in 2024. Bitwise, VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary have all submitted applications to launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on SOL, with a decision deadline set for January 25. And ProShares filed late Friday for four different ETFs tied to Solana.

Musk Kills Bears (MUSKBEAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBEAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Kills Bears can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Kills Bears could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Kills Bears launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Kills Bears on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Kills Bears by entering its contract address – 9yoxPCyAdEVRfAtkztzC7yKuhy7vEEEjXm3Ym8ajJEww – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBEAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-19 00:56:30

STRK is trading at $0.455 at time of writing. The 119th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 7% in the past 24 hours. Starknet surged past last month’s most-developed project, the decentralized oracle network Chainlink ( LINK ), which registered 311.57 notable GitHub events. Ethereum itself was third, with 219.13 events. An ERC-20 project is a standard that developers use to issue tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Santiment notes that it doesn’t count routine updates and utilizes a “better methodology” to collect data for GitHub events based on a “backtested process.” The analytics firm has previously said that heavy development activity centered around a crypto project indicates developers believe in the protocol. Development activity also suggests a given project is less likely to be an exit scam.

Stellar’s near-breakthrough to $0.50 signals optimism among institutional investors, while Dogecoin’s potential to reach $3 has speculators buzzing. Yet, amidst the excitement of short-term gains, Web3Bay (3BAY) offers something far more transformative—a tangible solution to real-world problems in global e-commerce. By integrating blockchain technology with decentralized governance, Web3Bay is creating a marketplace that reduces costs, enhances transparency, and empowers users. With over $830,000 raised and a projected 6,430% ROI for early adopters, Web3Bay isn’t just riding market trends; it’s building the foundation for the future of commerce. Web3Bay’s Vision: The Future of Global Commerce Web3Bay is not just a marketplace; it’s a vision for the future of commerce. Traditional platforms have long prioritized profits over user experience, but Web3Bay is changing that narrative. By integrating decentralized storage, multi-chain compatibility, and Layer-2 scaling solutions, the platform is building an infrastructure designed to last. Its hybrid payment model, combining cryptocurrency with traditional options like PayPal and Apple Pay, ensures inclusivity and ease of use for a global audience. Priced at just $0.0045626 in its fourth presale phase, the 3BAY token has already secured over $830,000 in funding. With every stage, the cost of the token rises, culminating in a launch price of $0.1959—a return of over 6,430% for those who buy early. The roadmap includes exciting developments such as the launch of an NFT marketplace and staking options for 3BAY holders, promising additional ways to engage with the ecosystem. As the presale continues to gain traction, Web3Bay is proving to be more than just an idea; it’s a tangible solution to the flaws of traditional e-commerce. Early adopters are not just investors; they’re pioneers in a movement that prioritizes transparency, security, and user empowerment. The Web3Bay revolution is here, and now is the time to join. Stellar Price Surges Amid Market Optimism As of January 16, 2025, Stellar price is trading at $0.482793, reflecting a 1.08% increase from the previous close. citeturn0finance0 The cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $0.514258 and a low of $0.4715, indicating notable volatility. The recent price uptick aligns with a broader positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, as investors anticipate favorable regulatory developments and increased institutional adoption. Stellar’s unique capability to facilitate cross-border transactions efficiently continues to attract attention from financial institutions and fintech companies. Analysts suggest that if the current momentum persists, Stellar could test the $0.50 resistance level in the near future. However, they caution that market dynamics remain unpredictable, and potential investors should conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. Dogecoin Price May Hit $3 Soon Dogecoin price has experienced notable price movements recently. As of January 17, 2025, DOGE is trading at approximately $0.4061, reflecting a 7.78% increase from the previous close. The intraday high reached $0.4061, with a low of $0.3688. This upward trend aligns with broader market dynamics, including Bitcoin’s recent surge past $107,000. Additionally, significant whale activity has been observed; large holders accumulated 200 million DOGE over 48 hours, indicating strong bullish sentiment. Analysts suggest that if Dogecoin price maintains momentum and surpasses the $0.40 resistance level, it could pave the way for a rally towards $3. However, investors should remain cautious, as the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. What’s Next In 2025 Stellar’s price resilience and Dogecoin’s whale-driven rally highlight the market’s speculative opportunities, but neither offers the comprehensive utility that Web3Bay delivers. The 3BAY token is more than a cryptocurrency—it’s the backbone of a decentralized marketplace designed to disrupt traditional e-commerce. Currently priced at $0.0045626 in its fourth presale stage, 3BAY offers investors unmatched growth potential, with a launch price of $0.1959 on the horizon.

39156253,https://timestabloid.com/?p=54930,1737248445,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Ripple CTO Warns XRP Holders While PropiChain Surges With a Predicted 43,000% ROI in 2025",https://timestabloid.com/ripple-cto-warns-xrp-holders-while-propichain-surges-with/,"Ripple CTO David Schwartz recently took to social media to warn XRP holders of a phishing operation targeting users of the popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. He indicated that the digital attack would come in the form of an email urging XRP holders to click a link to update certain information on their Coinbase accounts. Clicking this link could redirect the user to a malicious website where sensitive information could be stolen. Amid uncertainty about the security of Ripple’s XRP, investors are turning their attention to PropiChain (PCHAIN), a promising platform in the Crypto AI space. Following predictions of a 43,000% ROI in 2025, industry leaders believe PropiChain could be the next big thing in the real estate crypto market. Consequently, with PropiChain in the presale stage, the time to jump on the bandwagon is now. Ripple Left Reeling Amidst Phishing Warning Ripple recently enjoyed a surge, with the XRP token rising 12.75% to $2.97 . This surge pushes XRP within touching distance of reclaiming the $3 mark . Ripple’s anticipated legal victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and recent ETF buzz attracting large-scale investment have most likely aided its resurgence. However, fresh concerns over security integrity might throw a spanner in the works for XRP’s growth. As a result, eyes are beginning to turn toward PropiChain as investors search for the next big market player in crypto AI. With a revolutionary approach to real estate tokenization, AI integration, and Metaverse compatibility, PropiChain is seen as a viable long-term crypto investment. PropiChain Set to Revolutionize the Real Estate Market While Ripple’s XRP attempts to steady its ship, PropiChain continues to make waves in the real estate market with groundbreaking innovations in integrated AI and Metaverse technology. Redefining Real Estate With AI AI technology is the heart of the PropiChain platform. The asset is poised to change the real estate market as we know it by automating complex processes, predicting market developments, and optimizing decision-making. By leveraging AI, the platform can analyze vast amounts of data from multiple sources to provide live market evaluations, trends, and property valuations with incredible accuracy. Through the power of Automated Valuation Models (AVMs), investors can get a real-time look at property valuations and make educated decisions about their next investment. Additionally, 24/7 AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants are available to ensure that every issue is addressed promptly and satisfactorily. For example, new users can rely on these technologies to explain complex legal contracts and financial terms in simpler terms that they can easily understand. Promoting Equity in Real Estate With RWA Tokenization Through the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) using innovative blockchain technology, investors can own a fraction of real estate properties. This makes it possible for small-scale investors to own a fraction of a property they otherwise would not be able to. In addition, through the representation of property ownership on the blockchain, PropiChain facilitates more transparent, secure, and efficient property transfers without physical interaction. By leveraging blockchain technology and tokenization, PropiChain encourages simplified trading and transparent ownership to facilitate liquidity in the real estate market. Creating Immersion With Metaverse Integration PropiChain’s Metaverse integration has redefined the meaning of property exploration in real estate. By utilizing 3D technology, PropiChain has created an immersive virtual experience far superior to anything the sector has ever seen. For example, an investor in China can partake in virtual property tours of homes, offices, or commercial spaces in the U.S., saving time and money on travel expenses. Furthermore, virtual meetings can be held with all parties involved in transactions, further reducing the need for physical interaction on any level. PropiChain Delivering Massive Benefits for Investors With Ripple addressing security threats, PropiChain continues to gain momentum in its second stage of token presale. Early investors will reap major benefits such as property discounts, community rewards, zero-fee transactions, and more, making PropiChain among the most attractive tokens available. Having surpassed the $2 million mark in its token presale, PCHAIN is proving to have the attention of investors looking for a stable long-term investment while Ripple’s XRP altcoin tries to find its footing. Additionally, PropiChain has undergone a rigorous auditing process, with the leading security firm BlockAudit confirming the legitimacy of the platform. PCHAIN’s listing on CoinMarketCap also lends to its credibility and reliability while providing an interesting indication of future listings on other crypto exchanges. As investors begin to consider alternatives to Ripple, PropiChain continues to rise up the ranks as an innovative and exciting real estate investment opportunity. With Ripple’s XRP surge directly linked to external unpredictable factors, the growth stability offered by PCHAIN is an attractive prospect for long-term investors. Join the PropiChain Token Presale for Massive ROI PropiChain is currently valued at $0.011 per token with a view to a final listing of $0.032. This means that for those who missed out on the first stage of the token presale, this is the best time to seize this investment opportunity. Moreover, a post-listing profit of 800%+ means that an investment of $1,000 stands to return $80,000 or more by the end of the presale, with a predicted 43,000% ROI in 2025. This early prediction showcases confidence in PropiChain’s ability to lead the real estate market into the future. While Ripple’s XRP regains its footing, PropiChain investors are set to take over the $300-trillion-plus real estate market. Visit the PropiChain (PCHAIN) website today to join the token presale and become a property owner for as little as $1,000.

ADA & DOGE Price Predictions For 2025",https://thecoinrise.com/0-0248-entry-20-future-can-10-cex-listings-bring-huge-rois-for-blockdag-holders-ada-doge-price-predictions-for-2025/,"The Dogecoin price prediction is heating up, with analysts eyeing a potential leap to $2.50 by 2025. Meanwhile, Cardano’s whale activity is making waves as massive investors push ADA past $1, sparking fresh excitement among traders. But the real buzz is around the BlockDAG (BDAG) Network’s plan to list on 10 centralized exchanges. Analysts predict these CEX listings could be the key for BlockDAG to hit $20 by 2027, making it the top crypto for 2025. Traders are already rushing to lock in BDAG at the current presale batch 27 price of $0.0248 before the listings go live. Dogecoin Price Prediction: What Experts Expect for 2025 Dogecoin price prediction has become a hot topic among analysts as the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve. Recently, popular platforms like Grok shared forecasts for Dogecoin’s trajectory for 2025. Analysts estimate that Dogecoin could soar between $1 and $2.50 by 2025, marking a significant increase from its current price of $0.3611.Grok projects a broader range, with potential highs of $1.445. Despite being 25% below its recent peak of $0.4835, Dogecoin remains a focal point for optimistic investors. As varied DOGE price predictions surface, the possibility of Dogecoin reaching new heights fuels ongoing speculation. Cardano Whale Activity Fuels Surge Past $1 Recent Cardano (ADA) whale activity has drawn significant attention as large-scale investors collectively amassed 100 million ADA tokens over the past two days, propelling the cryptocurrency above the $1 threshold. This whale-driven momentum underscores growing confidence in Cardano’s potential, as their substantial purchases apply upward pressure on prices while attracting additional interest from retail investors. Technically, ADA’s recent breakout aligns with bullish patterns, supported by key indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Fibonacci retracement levels. As the Cardano whale activity increases, ADA’s ability to maintain critical support levels will be crucial in determining whether it can sustain its path toward the anticipated $1.50 milestone. Why 10 CEX Listings Could Push BlockDAG Toward $20 Valuation BlockDAG’s plan to list on 10 centralized exchanges (CEX) is a calculated step toward establishing itself as a significant force in the crypto space. By expanding to multiple tier-two and tier-three exchanges, the coin will gain broader visibility, making it accessible to millions of active traders. Increased liquidity through higher trading volumes is expected to stabilize its market activity, creating smoother transactions and stronger market confidence. As history has shown, major exchange listings often lead to a surge in demand, which naturally places upward pressure on prices. For BlockDAG, this milestone is critical in amplifying its presence and appeal. BlockDAG’s ongoing crypto presale has already highlighted its potential, with over $181.5 million raised and a 2380% increase in price since the first batch. Currently valued at $0.0248 in batch 27, BDAG offers an entry point that reflects its upward momentum while remaining accessible compared to its projected post-listing valuation. This presale success demonstrates strong confidence in the project, setting the stage for the upcoming exchange listings to build on an already solid foundation. With the coin gaining traction before these listings, it offers early supporters a chance to benefit from its growth trajectory. Analysts anticipate that the exchange listings could help propel BDAG toward its forecasted $20 valuation by 2027. In addition to BlockDAG’s upcoming listings and $20 forecast, its scalable technology and expanding global adoption are positioning it as the top crypto for 2025. The combination of enhanced liquidity, broader visibility, and a proven presale track record suggests that the coin is well on its way to achieving long-term success and recognition in the blockchain ecosystem. Which Is the Top Crypto In 2025? Dogecoin price prediction continues to point toward a possible jump to $2.50 by 2025, keeping the coin firmly in analysts’ discussions. The recent Cardano whale activity remains a driving force, with major investors propelling ADA past $1. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is gaining momentum as a top crypto for 2025 . With 10 centralized exchange listings on the horizon, BDAG is poised for unmatched exposure and liquidity, paving the way for its predicted $20 valuation by 2027. Currently valued at a presale batch 27 price of $0.0248, BDAG offers a rare opportunity to secure significant gains before its upcoming listings spark a massive value surge.

This revelation places Trump among the wealthiest cryptocurrency entrepreneurs globally. The statement coincides with Trump’s launch of the TRUMP memecoin, a controversial move that has drawn attention from the crypto community. Cardano Co-Founder Charles Hoskinson Reveals Donald Trump’s Crypto Fortune In a recent post on X , Charles Hoskinson disclosed that a substantial portion of Donald Trump’s wealth is invested in cryptocurrencies. According to Hoskinson, this amounts to 78.5% of Trump’s estimated net worth of $29.6 billion. The revelation establishes Trump as one of the most prominent figures in the cryptocurrency space. Hoskinson noted that Trump’s extensive involvement in crypto could lead to notable changes in the sector. His administration may redefine the IRS’s policies on taxation of capital gains and the evaluation of digital assets’ fair market value. These anticipated changes could shape the crypto industry’s regulatory framework. Charles Hoskinson added, “The nice part of Trump newfound enormous crypto wealth will be changes to the IRS’s interpretation of capital gains and fair market value of crypto.” Notably, Eric Trump also commented on the swift valuation of the $TRUMP memecoin, heralding it as “the hottest digital meme on earth.” He highlighted its rapid market cap increase to over $5 billion within a day of its launch as a testament to its popularity. TRUMP Memecoin Gains $8B in Hours Before Inauguration Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s launch of the TRUMP memecoin has added further intrigue to his financial connection to the crypto world. The meme coin amassed $8 billion in market capitalization within hours of its release. Trump’s company, CIC Digital LLC, reportedly owns 80% of the coin’s supply, positioning it as a lucrative venture. More so, the TRUMP meme coin rally is a key driver pushing SOL price to new all-time highs. This surge highlights growing speculative interest and expands market participation within the Solana ecosystem. The broad appeal of meme coins contributes to the cryptocurrency’s robust valuation. The meme coin rally coincides with Trump’s imminent inauguration as president. However, the timing has sparked ethical concerns, with critics questioning the propriety of a president-elect introducing a profitable product while preparing to assume office. Ripple Lawyer Bill Morgan Comments on Trump’s Crypto Venture Additionally, Ripple lawyer Bill Morgan has commented on how Trump’s promotion of the TRUMP memecoin might influence ongoing legal and regulatory battles. Morgan argued that Trump’s involvement in promoting a speculative digital asset could complicate the SEC’s legal approach, particularly in its case against Ripple and XRP. Morgan pointed out that Trump’s “presidential immunity” might shield him from regulatory scrutiny. However, this raises broader questions about the need for robust crypto regulations. Trump’s actions, combined with his administration’s policy changes will likely shape digital asset oversight moving forward. The Ripple lawyer also added that the appeal against Judge Torres’ decision is promising given the President’s view on token issuance without post-sale obligations. Morgan argued that Ripple’s sales of XRP similarly lacked such obligations. This perspective may reinforce Ripple’s decision to pursue its cross-appeal. The @Ripple appeal of Judge Torres finding against Ripple’s defense that there must be a contract or post sale obligations is looking good. After all the President of the USA thinks a token with no post sale obligations to buyers can be issued and promoted without being… https://t.co/OByrCesd8j — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) January 18, 2025 As Trump prepares to take office, his crypto-focused agenda could redefine the sector’s regulatory environment and influence ongoing legal cases such as the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit. It is worth noting that Charles Hoskinson recently announced upgrades for the Cardano Lace Wallet , aiming to expand its functionality. These enhancements will support its growth and establish it as a leading cryptocurrency wallet in the industry.

In a Jan. 18 post on X, Buterin outlined the goals of this overhaul, which include supporting decentralized application developers and championing decentralization, censorship resistance, and privacy. He emphasized that the Ethereum Foundation would steer clear of political lobbying, ideological agendas, or assuming a central role in the ecosystem’s development. These changes follow a challenging year for the Foundation in 2024, during which its spending, roadmap, and personnel decisions were criticized by members of the Ethereum community. The Ethereum Foundation introduced a conflict of interest policy in May 2024 after prominent researchers took paid advisory roles at the EigenLayer Foundation, which oversees the restaking protocol. Justin Drake, a long-time Ethereum Foundation researcher, accepted such a role in May 2024, followed by Dankrad Feist. Drake later stepped down in November 2024, apologizing to the community and committing to avoid advisory roles, investments, or council positions in the future. In March 2024, Ethereum released the Dencun upgrade, which significantly reduced transaction fees for layer-2 networks by up to 99%. This fee reduction led to a rapid increase in Ethereum layer-2 rollups, with L2Beat reporting 55 such networks currently in operation. However, the proliferation of layer-2 solutions sparked concerns among market participants about cannibalizing revenue on the Ethereum base layer. Data from Token Terminal revealed that base layer revenues plummeted by 99% during the summer of 2024 but eventually recovered to pre-Dencun levels by year-end. As Ethereum continues to evolve, these leadership changes aim to foster a more robust and decentralized ecosystem while addressing challenges faced in 2024.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today,EN,0,0,ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-19 01:36:00

Polkadot leverages parachain auctions to boost developer involvement, while Tron champions staking programs that benefit those in it for the long haul. Yet, it’s BlockDAG ’s LAUNCH300 that’s turning heads by delivering a unique and immediate advantage to its participants. It combines easy access with substantial bonuses, setting itself apart in a crowded market and attracting both individual and institutional interest. BlockDAG: Redefining Incentives with a Bold Approach At the heart of the action, BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300 initiative offers a limited-time 300% bonus for early birds in its presale stage. This isn’t just any perk—it’s a strategic decision aligned with BlockDAG’s pledge to honor buyer confidence. The setup is crafted to maximize immediate returns and encourage ongoing involvement. LAUNCH300 doesn’t play favorites; it levels the playing field for all, fostering an environment where everyone can thrive. The program’s simplicity is its strength, ditching complications like staking or coin locking, providing a clear, upfront benefit that’s both liquid and actionable. Raising over $181 million, LAUNCH300 has carved out new norms for presale perks in the crypto realm, escalating the coin’s value to $0.0248—a whopping 2,380% spike since its debut. This approach isn’t just filling wallets—it’s building a committed and active community around BlockDAG’s expanding ecosystem. Polkadot: Pioneering but Selective Polkadot’s game plan revolves around parachain auctions, which let projects snag slots on its network. While this fosters innovation, it tends to favor those with deeper pockets, often leaving smaller investors out in the cold. The rewards? Locked in for six to 24 months, they’re not exactly liquid, which can be a turnoff for anyone looking for quicker access to their gains. While Polkadot excels at nurturing its ecosystem and ensuring scalability, its focus might be a tad narrow, particularly for regular investors craving more immediate and flexible rewards. Despite its success in cultivating a strong developer base, it’s time for a rethink to keep up with more inclusive, investor-friendly models like BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300. Tron: Loyalty Over Liquidity Over at Tron, the emphasis is on staking rewards and incentives for continued ecosystem engagement—great for promoting long-term stability and participation. Yet, this approach demands a lengthy commitment, which might not sit well with everyone, especially those looking for faster returns. As the network grows, maintaining consistent staking rewards becomes a challenge, possibly affecting the reliability of these incentives. Market Trends & Strategic Shifts The crypto community’s response to BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300 has been nothing short of enthusiastic. Early signs show a robust uptick in presale activity, signaling strong market alignment with the desire for immediate, substantial rewards. By introducing upfront bonuses, BlockDAG may well set a new trend, shaping future incentive strategies across the industry. The standout success of LAUNCH300 poses a significant challenge for Polkadot and Tron, prompting them to revisit their incentive strategies as the market tilts towards offerings that provide quick, tangible benefits. Key Insights BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300 is a bold affirmation of its commitment to community value, clearly outperforming the growth strategies of established networks like Polkadot and Tron. As it continues to smash presale records, BlockDAG is not just on a growth trajectory but is actively redefining participation in the crypto landscape, offering both new and seasoned buyers exciting opportunities to join its success story.

The analyst expects blue-chip assets to struggle in the short term as volatility rises and the Donald Trump administration comes into power. Meanwhile, whales are turning their attention to PropiChain (PCHAIN), an AI-driven altcoin focused on transforming the real estate industry. PropiChain has already raised over $2 million as smart money and retail investors bet big on the low-cap altcoin. The low-cap altcoin has the potential to outshine XRP and Solana. Analyst: XRP Triggers Sell Signal A pundit has indicated that XRP is flashing a sell signal, suggesting a potential correction for the altcoin. XRP has surged 44% in a week, taking its price to $3.27. Its yearly gains have extended to 475%. XRP has reached its highest price since 2018 and is less than 6% away from a new all-time high. The pundit claims that XRP is due for a correction. Bitcoin is already trading below $98K after reaching $100K. However, other analysts say XRP could hit a new peak before plunging to less than $3. PCHAIN: Traders Rush to Undervalued Low Cap Altcoin PropiChain is an undervalued low-cap altcoin attracting savvy investors. It is 200% up in the first two rounds of the presale, with more gains expected after listing on secondary exchanges. The promising altcoin is tipped to outperform XRP, an altcoin calling the shots during the current bull market. Investors are piling cash into the PCHAIN token not only because of its low $0.01 price but because of its potential to transform the real estate market with tokenization and fractional ownership. Real estate tokenization enables PropiChain’s users to buy portions of high-end properties. This allows them to earn passive income through rental income while their investments appreciate. It offers investors the chance to diversify their investments and build generational wealth. The AI features powering PropiChain are a game-changer. With its AI-driven predictive market analysis, the platform’s users have access to future real estate market patterns, helping them make informed decisions. PropiChain’s automated valuation models provide accurate property appraisal, making transactions smoother and more reliable. Buyers and sellers can rely on real-time data, eliminating the guesswork. This makes it easier for real estate deals to be closed quickly. Another important feature is smart contract automation . It handles transactions such as auto-leasing and lease renewals on behalf of landlords and tenants. By automating real estate management, PropiChain eliminates manual work and enhances efficiency. The platform’s smart contracts have been thoroughly audited by BlockAudit, a leading Web3 security firm. This makes the platform safe for users and investors. The addition of a metaverse for virtual property viewing adds a cutting-edge layer to the platform. Investors can walk through properties digitally to improve their decision-making process. Solana Faces DApp Activity Decline Solana’s DApp volumes have dropped by 10%, but strong inflows helped it surge. The layer-1 network regained strength and reached $211, marking a 9.5% gain in the past week. However, an analyst believes that Solana and XRP could face selling pressure that will tank their prices. Solana has also seen a decline in the total value locked (TVL), further fueling the predictions for a short-term correction. Invest in PCHAIN for Insane Returns in Q2 2025 PCHAIN is the best low-cap altcoin to invest in for massive gains in the 2025 bull market. At only $0.01, PropiChain is highly undervalued, allowing investors to make life-change gains. The low-cap altcoin is already up 200% during the first two rounds of the ongoing presale. Whales are rushing to buy the PCHAIN token before the presale is sold out. After listing the PCHAIN token on CoinMarketCap , PropiChain is attracting a new wave of investors keen on earning maximum returns on their investments. This development has solidified PropiChain’s commitment to transparency. If you missed XRP or Solana, this is your chance to invest in a project with unlimited potential. Invest in PCHAIN’s presale today at only $0.01 per token to grow a $1,000 investment into $500K by Q2 2025.

He revealed that the Bitcoin upper hand has moved above $105,400 and hinted at where the flagship crypto could be heading next. What’s Next For Bitcoin Price As Upper Band Moves Above $105,400? In an X post, Severino revealed that Bitcoin’s upper band is now above $105,400. With this development, he alluded to a previous analysis in which he revealed what could happen once the price breaks above $105,400. In the analysis, the crypto analyst mentioned that things could get interesting once BTC breaks above $105,400. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Spikes To Nearly $5 Billion – Impact On Price He then predicted that Bitcoin could rally to as high as $170,000. The analyst made this prediction while revealing how BTC witnessed a 90% surge from the wick low at the lower band to the local high. This happened the last time the flagship crypto got a head fake to the lower band before moving to the upper band. Based on this trend, Severino believes the Bitcoin price could record another 90% surge and rally to as high as $170,000. This price target is significant as it could mark the top for the flagship crypto. The crypto analyst mentioned that the cycle top for Bitcoin can be discussed once BTC reaches this $170,000 target. However, market experts like Standard Chartered have suggested that Bitcoin could rally beyond this $170,000 target. The financial institution predicted that a rally to $200,000 by year-end is achievable. Bernstein analysts also described a rally to $200,000 by year-end as conservative, meaning Bitcoin could rally higher. This bullish outlook for Bitcoin mainly stems from the fact that Donald Trump is set to take office on January 20. The pro-crypto US president-elect is expected to implement a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for the country, which will boost the flagship crypto’s adoption. BTC Not Far Away From A New All-Time High Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has suggested that Bitcoin will soon reach a new all-time high (ATH). In an X post, he stated that BTC is one daily resistance away from breaking out to a new ATH yet again. The crypto analyst added that a daily close above the final resistance followed by a post-breakout retest would be enough to launch the flagship crypto into price discovery. Until then, Rekt Capital mentioned that Bitcoin would continue to range between $101,000 and $106,000. Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto offered a more optimistic outlook for the BTC, stating that the flagship crypto has started its rally. He remarked that, as anticipated, the crypto has broken through resistance and is now primed for a strong rally.

Trump Buys Solana (TRUMPSOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Buys Solana launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Buys Solana by entering its contract address – 8Ruz6rzYPpKHActX3jo49v8WBhiJ5KsGM6dyCghQj3i – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SOL|SHIB|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-19 02:22:00

Currently valued at approximately $3.23, XRP is positioned among the most robust performers in the cryptocurrency market, boasting an impressive 43% gain over the past month. This price resurgence has propelled the market’s second-largest altcoin to a seven-year high, inching closer to its previous price record of $3.40, set in 2018. Bullish Projections For XRP Price In a recent social media update on X (Formerly Twitter), market analyst Ali Martinez highlights the significance of XRP’s recent breakout from a month-long consolidation phase between $1.90 and $2.60. Martinez notes that this price breakout has occurred within a symmetrical triangle pattern on the weekly chart, suggesting an optimistic trajectory for the altcoin. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Double Holdings To 43% Post-Merge – Details The analyst projects a possible price target of $15 for XRP, which would represent a staggering increase of over 365% from its current valuation. Supporting this bullish outlook, XForceGlobal proposed a range of final targets for XRP, estimating potential prices between $7 and $12, with more ambitious projections reaching $20 to $40 and two potential routes for the altcoin’s price: Slower Route: This scenario anticipates a five-wave minor degree into an intermediate degree wave, followed by a wave 1-2 pullback. If XRP can manage a controlled pullback in this phase, it would create a favorable environment for further bullish action. While this route may involve a deeper correction, the analyst asserts it ultimately promises the greatest rewards for long-term holders. Faster Route: In this scenario, the current five-wave ascent may already be part of a larger primary wave 5. While this route could still lead XRP to significant price levels around $7 to $12, it also suggests that the bull market may soon reach its conclusion. Expert Warns Of Potential Correction March Despite the optimistic projections, some experts, like Egrag Crypto, caution investors to remain vigilant. Egrag predicts a significant market correction could occur in March 2025. However, the expert also emphasizes that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains bullish, indicating that XRP still has room for growth in the short term. He anticipates that XRP may reach price levels between $4 and $5 before any potential downturn.

Whether through slower or faster routes, the future looks bright for XRP holders, provided they navigate the anticipated volatility with care.

Deaton has urged for an end to the “crypto wars” led by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Deaton’s statement follows a series of high-profile legal battles involving major entities such as Ripple, LBRY, Coinbase, and others, which he argues have consumed substantial resources without addressing substantive fraud. John Deaton Urges US Regulators to Drop Ongoing Crypto Cases In a lengthy post on X, John Deaton, an attorney known for his support of Ripple and other crypto companies, vocalized his frustration with the ongoing regulatory actions by the US SEC. Deaton highlighted several cases where crypto companies have faced legal challenges and financial burdens despite not being accused of fraud. He argued that these cases have drained company resources and impacted the crypto industry negatively. Additionally, John Deaton pointed out several instances where companies incurred substantial losses due to legal battles with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Notably, he mentioned that Ripple had spent over $150 million on legal fees in a case that did not involve any fraud allegations. This situation has affected Ripple’s operations and influenced its partnerships and market activities, with consequences for XRP holders. The Pro-XRP Lawyer added, “Having filed amicus briefs in the Ripple, LBRY, and Coinbase cases, representing users, developers, individual investors, and content providers, I’m sitting here thinking about the incredible waste of time, energy, money, and resources wasted during the last 4 years.” Despite John Deaton’s call for a reduction in aggressive SEC actions, the regulator continues its strict oversight. Recently, the US SEC sued Digital Currency Group , citing failure to disclose risks tied to Three Arrows Capital, resulting in a $38 million settlement. Impact on Companies and Innovation Further illustrating the impact of US SEC actions, Deaton referenced the case of LBRY, a platform that was shut down by the SEC without any fraud charges. The closure led to job losses and financial setbacks for its founder, Jeremy Kauffman. John Deaton emphasized, “NO FRAUD was committed or even alleged. There was a very active LBRY community and ecosystem of users and content providers utilizing the platform. LBRY employees lost jobs. An American entrepreneur, Jeremy Kauffman, lost millions due to legal fees.” Additionally, despite Kraken’s attempt to settle by paying a $30M fine, the platform faced subsequent lawsuits, showing a pattern of aggressive regulatory pursuits. According to the Pro-XRP Lawyer, these moves threaten innovation and the growth of the crypto sector. Reevaluation of SEC’s Approach To Crypto Regulations John Deaton’s appeals reflect a growing concern within the crypto community about how the US SEC handles cryptocurrency regulations. The legal expert suggests that a balanced approach would support the development of the crypto industry and uphold the integrity of regulatory practices. In addition, other crypto leaders have also voiced their perspectives as Gary Gensler departs from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Most recently, Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty openly mocked Gensler’s exit, signaling a potentially transformative shift in SEC’s crypto enforcement. Despite criticism from figures like John Deaton, outgoing Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler insists on the necessity of strict regulatory oversight for the crypto market. He emphasizes the importance of enforcement actions to safeguard investors from risks in the crypto industry.

BTFD is the Top New Meme Coin to Buy Today with its Phenomenal Referral Program,https://thecoinrise.com/worried-about-missing-neiro-btfd-is-the-top-new-meme-coin-to-buy-today-with-its-phenomenal-referral-program/,"Meme coins have come a long way since Dogecoin and Shiba Inu first stole the spotlight. What started as a playful twist on cryptocurrency has evolved into a serious investment opportunity for people looking to capitalize on short-term gains. And let’s be real—everyone loves a good underdog story, especially when it’s tied to major profits. Today, two fresh players in the meme coin space are creating buzz: BTFD Coin (BTFD) and Neiro (NEIRO) . These coins don’t just bank on internet culture; they’ve got innovative features, real-world utility, and wild community support. If you’re hunting for the top new meme coins to buy today , you’re gonna want to stick around for this breakdown. And hey, if you’re worried about missing out on NEIRO, let’s pump the brakes on that FOMO. BTFD Coin’s unique perks—like its P2E game, referral program, and massive 90% APY staking rewards—make it a killer choice for investors chasing high returns. Plus, its presale performance has been nothing short of legendary. So, let’s dive in and find out why these coins are worth your attention. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolution If you haven’t heard of BTFD Coin yet, you might be living under a rock. This meme coin has taken the market by storm with its innovative ecosystem. It’s more than just a coin; it’s a movement built around features like P2E gaming, staking rewards, and a robust referral program. And let’s talk about those staking rewards for a sec—90% APY! That’s unheard of in the crypto world and a game-changer for anyone looking to make serious passive income. BTFD’s referral program deserves a standing ovation. Picture this: every time you refer a friend, you’re earning extra BTFD. It’s like getting rewarded for spreading the word about something you’re already hyped about. And with the coin’s presale picking up speed, those rewards are stacking up fast. This program isn’t just about referrals; it’s about building a community—a “Bulls Squad,” if you will. The Bulls Squad is BTFD’s elite group of supporters who get access to exclusive content, early updates, and even better earning opportunities. Imagine being part of a crypto family that’s growing wealth together. Speaking of wealth, BTFD’s presale has been on fire. It started at a humble $0.000004 per coin and is currently priced at $0.000142 in Stage 13. Over $5.2 million has been raised so far, with 64 billion coins sold to over 8,600 holders. Crypto analysts are predicting a post-presale price of $0.0006, which means huge potential gains for early investors. Let’s break it down with some real numbers. If you invested $7,500 at the current price of $0.000142, you’d snag around 52,816,901 BTFD coins. When the price hits $0.0006, your investment balloons to over $31,690. Talk about a solid ROI. The best part? Joining the presale is ridiculously easy. Head to the presale page , connect your wallet, input your purchase amount, and confirm the transaction. In just a few clicks, you’re in the game. Don’t sleep on this—the presale is already in Stage 13 of 16, and coins are flying off the shelves. It’s not just a coin; it’s an opportunity to be part of something bigger. Ready to make moves? Neiro: A Fresh Contender in the Meme Coin Scene On the flip side, we’ve got Neiro (NEIRO), a meme coin with its own unique spin. NEIRO’s pitch? Merging cutting-edge AI with the playful charm of meme coins. It’s like your favorite meme coin went to a fancy coding bootcamp. Neiro’s ecosystem is designed around AI-powered analytics and community-driven decision-making, which sounds fancy—and it is—but it’s also super practical for crypto enthusiasts who want more than just hype. One of NEIRO’s standout features is its AI-driven trading assistant. Imagine having a virtual assistant that analyzes market trends and helps you make better trading decisions. It’s like having a crypto guru in your pocket. This isn’t just some gimmick; it’s a tool that’s making NEIRO a serious contender in the meme coin space. And let’s not forget the coin’s community governance model. Holders get to vote on key project decisions, making it a truly decentralized experience. The coin’s presale has also been making waves, with early investors already seeing impressive returns. Crypto analysts are optimistic about NEIRO’s future, with some predicting a 10x increase in value by the end of the year. That kind of growth potential puts NEIRO firmly in the “top new meme coins to buy today” category. Sure, it’s not as flashy as BTFD’s presale performance, but NEIRO’s focus on long-term utility and community engagement makes it a solid choice for investors looking for stability and innovation. But here’s the kicker: while NEIRO’s AI features are cool, it lacks the immediate rewards and FOMO factor that BTFD offers. If you’re all about building wealth and having fun while doing it, BTFD might still be the better pick. That said, NEIRO’s commitment to innovation means it’s not one to overlook. If you’re looking to diversify your portfolio, adding a bit of NEIRO could be a smart move. Conclusion So, what’s the verdict? Both BTFD and NEIRO are making serious waves in the crypto world, but they cater to slightly different crowds. BTFD is all about that short-term gain, with insane presale performance, staking rewards, and a community-driven ecosystem that’s impossible to ignore. It’s the kind of coin that makes you wanna shout, “Take my money!” Meanwhile, NEIRO brings a unique blend of meme culture and AI-driven utility, making it perfect for investors who value innovation and long-term potential. Here’s the thing: you don’t have to choose one or the other. Why not invest in both and cover your bases? But if you’re itching to act fast, BTFD’s presale is where the excitement’s at. With a listing price of $0.0006 and analysts predicting big things, now’s the time to join the movement. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the Bulls Squad and make serious gains. Make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity with the BTFD Coin presale .

One major crypto whale took advantage of the situation and bought 860,895 TRUMP tokens for $12 million at an average price of $13.94, as revealed by Lookonchain. A whale dumped 860,895 $TRUMP for 23.8M $USDC just now.

At the same time, there were reports that Trump’s team sold $500 million worth of tokens, maintaining control of 85% of total tokens. This revelation has raised issues of market manipulation as well as the future of the coin. A wave of high-profile trades The token’s meteoric rise has attracted several high-profile traders to the token. Lookonchain also reported that a wallet called “LeBron” exchanged $1 million USDC and bought 4.52 million TRUMP tokens within the first 5 minutes of the launch, and the investment grew to over $2 million. Another trader made headlines after turning $1.1 million into $70 million within four hours. The individual sold 1.35m TRUMP tokens for 3.65m USDC while holding on to 4.62m tokens worth $67.5m.

By selling part of their holding for $812,000, they made a profit of more than $3.7 million. Market activity was also boosted by large investors, or ‘whales’. One whale moved 61,205 SOL — which is more than $14.3 million — from OKX to buy 1.27 million TRUMP tokens. Another also used 8.5 million USDC to buy 1.03 million tokens at an average price of $8.28. Even with the sharp selloff, TRUMP surged to a record high of $35, then pulled back slightly. Currently, the token is priced at $26.72 and has risen dramatically by 328% in the last day. However, only 200 million of the total 1 billion tokens are currently in circulation, which raises the question of how further token emissions can affect the market. Trump enters the cryptocurrency market The project was revealed by Trump on his social media pages with the token intended to represent triumph and recovery. “My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!” he wrote. The coin’s official website refers to it as a symbolic digital asset with no utility, meaning, or use as a medium of exchange or a store of value. As reported by Cryptopolitan, concerns have been raised over this particular token’s authenticity, especially due to its close association with Trump. As of this writing, its market capitalization has reached almost $6 billion, as shown by CoinMarketCap.The proposed plan of the project is to release 800 million more tokens in the next three years, which has raised concerns regarding the pressure that it will have on the prices.

Donald Trump the Bull (DONBULL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONBULL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Trump the Bull can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Trump the Bull could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Trump the Bull launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Trump the Bull on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Donald Trump the Bull by entering its contract address – AmgaL1uuQ97qJoXfUUxdHipLJmVd3toChivEBiSFn7MW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONBULL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|TRADING|DOGE|SOL|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-19 03:50:00

Many suspect Ripple and Lumen have new competition on the horizon. With Ripple (XRP) currently near $3.28 and Lumen (XLM) around $0.17, both have been top picks for rapid transactions. Yet a fresh project called Remittix is making waves, offering a PayFi model that could upend older networks. Below, you’ll see why Remittix (RTX) draws so much attention and how it challenges traditional giants like Lumen and Ripple. Stellar (XLM) Chases New Heights with On-Chain Analytics Stellar, often called Stellar (XLM), trades around $0.43, posting an 18.50% jump in the past week and 11% in the last 30 days. Recently, Stellar teamed up with Nansen AI to offer in-depth on-chain analytics. This partnership lets Stellar investors and developers access real-time data about wallet behavior, transactions, and overall network health. Many see it as a big step toward building trust since clearer insights can encourage more people to adopt Stellar’s blockchain. Fans hope this data boost will bring fresh energy to XLM, which often competes with other payment-focused tokens. If stellar performance data attracts major partners or traders, Stellar (XLM) might ride higher, reinforcing its position among well-known cross-border coins. Critics, though, say XLM still needs broader commercial usage to stand out in a crowded market. Regardless, Stellar’s new analytics push could be exactly what it needs to keep drawing attention—and possibly new investments. Ripple (XRP) Surges to 7-Year High Momentum Ripple trades around $3.26, posting a 40% climb over the last week and a 28% gain this past month. Ripple (XRP) has seen its strongest price uptrend since early 2018, fueled by the SEC’s recent move to appeal a court ruling that stated XRP wasn’t sold as an unregistered security. Market watchers note that Ripple’s market cap hit $175 billion, surpassing financial giant BlackRock’s $156.9 billion mark. Analysts highlight XRP’s fastest growth in years, with the token’s 14-month RSI hitting 92—its highest since October 2017. This level of momentum suggests XRP might keep climbing if regulatory developments tilt in Ripple’s favor. Still, skeptics warn that any unfavorable court action could stall its progress, reminding investors that legal twists can shift sentiment fast. However, Ripple (XRP) appears poised for more upside if the bullish wave continues. Remittix Gains Traction as Stellar (XLM) and Ripple (XRP) Soar Even though Stellar (XLM) and Ripple (XRP) have reached new highs recently, many analysts still think Remittix has a bigger advantage. They believe Remittix (RTX) is the one coin focusing on quick, no-hassle solutions for moving funds globally. A jump from $0.0199 to $0.0217 in its presale, plus 195 million tokens sold and over $3.5 million raised, shows buyers’ eagerness for a PayFi coin that goes beyond hype. With Stellar (XLM) and Ripple (XRP) each counting on institutional or corporate deals, Remittix zeros in on everyday use: let people send or receive money without hidden fees, converting crypto to fiat in a snap. Why Remittix (RTX) Could Outclass Older Payment Tokens Both Stellar (XLM) and Ripple (XRP) chase large-scale adoption, but top analysts argue that Remittix stands out by helping regular users, not just banks or big partners. Remittix’s Pay API offers a straightforward way for merchants to accept crypto and settle in fiat without complicated steps—something that truly matters to day-to-day businesses. If you stack that against XLM and XRP, neither token directly solves real-world payment headaches for the average person. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) addresses cross-border fees and slow processing right from the start, aiming to mainstream crypto payments. That’s why many think Remittix could outshine legacy tokens, luring traders and the people who simply want cheaper, faster transactions without needing a deep understanding of blockchain. .

XYZVerse, Ripple, Solana, and Dogecoin are attracting attention for their unique qualities and growth prospects. This article examines what sets them apart and why they might be key considerations for those planning ahead. Score Big with XYZ: The New Meme Coin Heavyweight The fans are losing it! The XYZ token is in the crypto ring, landing blows on the competition – bullshit coins, worthless farming schemes, and scam projects. Like a true champ, this first-ever all-sports meme token has fought its way through the bear market with fearless momentum and shows no signs of slowing down. With eyes set on a roaring 75X growth , XYZ is destined to leave the 2024 meme coin triumphants like BOME and WIF trailing in its wake. Own the field, earn while the crowd plays XYZ is creating the ultimate playing field with the award-winning XYZVerse , recognized as the Best NEW Meme Project . Its unique concept marries the thrill of sports with the energy of meme culture.

Remember Polymarket’s massive $1 billion trading volume during the US election betting fever? XYZ is gearing up for an even bigger win in the GameFi arena, letting its stakeholders cash in on the perfect combo of meme coin vibes, sports hype, and crypto mass adoption. Missed meme coin supercycle? By capitalizing on the ever-expanding gambling niche, XYZ is set to become the G.O.A.T of meme coins . BOME’s 5,000% takeoff and WIF’s 1,000% year-to-date rally are now relics of the past because XYZ is set to explode by over 7,400% from its current price by the TGE and outshine its sensational predecessors.

Dogecoin: From Meme to Major Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) was launched in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies. It features the Shiba Inu dog from the “Doge” meme as its logo. Unlike some cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin has no maximum supply limit. Ten thousand new coins are mined every minute, making it abundant. Initially considered a joke, it gained popularity due to its fun approach and active community. In 2021, Dogecoin’s value surged, placing it among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This rise was partly influenced by social media and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Its technology is based on the Litecoin blockchain, providing fast transaction times. Dogecoin’s current market position reflects its strong community support. Whether it is attractive in the current market cycle depends on various factors, including market trends and investor sentiment. Solana and SOL: A High-Performance Blockchain Platform Solana is a blockchain platform designed for scalability and speed, providing a foundation for decentralized applications (dapps). It competes with platforms like Ethereum and Cardano by offering faster transactions and flexible development options across multiple programming languages. SOL is the native cryptocurrency of Solana, playing a central role in its ecosystem. It facilitates transactions, powers custom programs, and rewards network supporters. The SOL coin holds value by underpinning the operation of the Solana ecosystem. It rewards participants and grants users access to a variety of projects on the platform. Unlike some other blockchains, Solana does not use sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. Instead, it focuses on a high-capacity network capable of hosting products and services with high activity levels. This approach may attract developers and users seeking efficient and scalable blockchain solutions. The attractiveness of SOL in the current market cycle depends on various factors, including market conditions and individual perspectives. XRP: A Fast, Low-Cost Cryptocurrency for Borderless Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency supported by the XRP Ledger, designed to enable fast, low-cost, and borderless transactions. It operates on a decentralized system without a central authority, making transactions secure and irreversible. XRP is digitally native and programmable, resistant to censorship or counterfeiting, and does not require a bank account for settlements. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with an initial supply of 100 billion tokens. XRP aims to facilitate seamless payment transfers across various currencies, enhancing network liquidity and supporting the ecosystem. Ripple, initially known as OpenCoin Inc., was gifted 80 billion XRP for further development and placed 55 billion XRP in escrow to control the supply release. The technology behind XRP allows for quick settlement times and low transaction costs, which can benefit cross-border payments. In the current market cycle, XRP’s focus on speed and efficiency may appeal to users and institutions seeking reliable and cost-effective transaction solutions. Conclusion In the 2025 bull run, DOGE, SOL, and XRP show strong potential, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out by uniting sports fans globally and aiming for massive growth as a cultural icon.

The post , shared on his X account (formerly Twitter), portrays XRP as a token primed for significant growth. The GIF, created by eToro, a multi-asset trading platform, illustrates XRP’s mascot propelling toward the moon. This imagery aligns with the widespread belief in crypto that an asset described as “going to the moon” is expected to experience a substantial price increase. Portnoy’s post has garnered significant attention, amassing over a million views and more than 12,000 likes since it was published. With a following of over 3 million on X, Portnoy’s influence in sparking discussions on XRP’s potential has not gone unnoticed. pic.twitter.com/inLxvk1srs — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) January 15, 2025 Portnoy’s Involvement with XRP Portnoy’s engagement with XRP dates back to last year when he revealed his investment in the token. During a live stream for his “Davey Day Trader Global” series, he disclosed owning approximately $1.3 million worth of XRP. This announcement was warmly received by the XRP community , with individuals like Abs from Good Morning Crypto referring to him as an “official XRP Army Member.” XRP’s Market Performance Portnoy’s recent post coincides with a notable rally in XRP’s price. The cryptocurrency surpassed the $3 mark yesterday, a milestone it last achieved in 2018. XRP climbed to a high of $3.39 before stabilizing below $3.20. At the time of writing, XRP is valued at $3.28 reflecting a 1.40% increase in the past 24 hours. The asset’s market capitalization has also surged, reaching $188.7 billion. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s remarkable performance can be traced back to November, following Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Since then, XRP has gained over 500%, rising from approximately $0.49 to its current levels. Market speculation suggests the incoming administration might intervene in the legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty has shared updates hinting at the possibility of the lawsuit’s dismissal, fueling optimism among investors. The renewed confidence in XRP, amplified by figures like Portnoy, underscores the growing belief in the token’s potential for long-term gains. As legal uncertainties surrounding Ripple’s case with the SEC appear closer to resolution, market sentiment continues to strengthen.

This marks the first publicly known case in Russia of using digital currency to fund a military group. Crypto-Funding to Ukrainian Army A resident of the Mirninsky District in Yakutia has been sentenced to seven years in a maximum-security penal colony for financially supporting a Ukrainian terrorist organization, the FSB Directorate for the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) reported on January 14. The individual, an employee of a diamond mining company, was found guilty of transferring funds to Ukrainian forces via cryptocurrency. The financial assistance was directed toward a unit of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), aiding their reconnaissance and subversive activities against Russian security interests. The investigation revealed that the offender joined a terrorist organization group on a social network, where he received detailed instructions from Ukrainian curators on how to transfer the funds to a designated cryptocurrency wallet. This sentencing follows an earlier report on January 10, where a resident of Yenakiyevo in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) was detained on charges of treason. The detainee was accused of repeatedly transferring money to electronic accounts that funded Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel. This decision comes in the wake of a related case where a Russian national was apprehended for funding digital accounts linked to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Russia’s Crypto Embrace Amidst a global push for Bitcoin adoption, Anton Tkachev, a State Duma deputy from the New People Party, formally proposed establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve in Russia in December. Meanwhile, domestic firms have already started utilizing Bitcoin and other digital assets for international payments, which is enabled by recent legislative adjustments designed to offset Western sanctions. These moves align with President Vladimir Putin’s earlier statement wherein he highlighted Bitcoin’s resistance to global regulation and indicated his endorsement of cryptocurrencies, linking the asset class’s rise to the declining role of the US dollar as a reserve currency due to its political use.

In a tweet that has sparked widespread discussion, King underscored Ripple’s growing influence in the financial technology sector and its long-term vision to reshape the industry. King’s tweet emphasized Ripple’s significant investment—over $100 million—in its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to prove that XRP is not a security. With this legal victory secured, Ripple is now poised to expand its operations aggressively. Many still view Ripple as a payments company, but King argues this perception is outdated. Ripple is now a serious competitor to major fintech companies like Stripe and PayPal. Ripple spent over $100,000,000 to prove that $XRP is not a security — now they are switching from defense to offense. Most people still think this is just a payments company — and they couldn't be more wrong. Here is what you should know as $XRP enters this next phase: pic.twitter.com/NscK4mtYX8 — Austin King (@0xASK) January 17, 2025 Ripple’s Strategy: Building, Not Improving According to King, Ripple’s 10-year strategy has been to build an entirely new financial infrastructure rather than improving existing systems. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is a testament to this vision, designed to facilitate fast, low-cost payments while offering scalability and versatility for tokenization. King asserts that this approach sets Ripple apart from its competitors, who remain entrenched in legacy systems. Ripple’s ambition extends far beyond the $500 billion fintech market. The company is focusing on tokenization, a burgeoning sector with the potential to transform trillions of dollars in assets. In the U.S. alone, over $55 trillion in assets could be tokenized, offering immense growth opportunities. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Tokenization: The Next Frontier Tokenization converts physical and traditional financial assets into digital tokens on a blockchain. The XRP Ledger is optimized for such applications, making it a strong contender for leading the tokenization market. However, Ripple recognizes the importance of collaboration and interoperability in achieving this goal. King revealed that Ripple works with partner networks, such as Omni Network, to distribute tokenized assets across the broader blockchain ecosystem. Omni Network aims to enhance the XRP Ledger’s capabilities by designing mechanisms to allow XRP to collect fees from transactions on other chains, further increasing its utility and adoption. Ripple’s Impact on the Fintech Industry Ripple’s advancements are prompting responses from established fintech players. Companies like Stripe and PayPal are expanding their product offerings and making billion-dollar acquisitions to counter XRP’s growing influence. This competition underscores Ripple’s disruptive potential in the industry. As King notes, Ripple’s ability to execute its vision is rooted in its focus on innovation and partnerships. By leveraging the XRP Ledger’s unique capabilities, Ripple aims to dominate the tokenization market and position itself as a leader in the next wave of blockchain applications. As Ripple continues to evolve, stakeholders in the crypto and fintech sectors should closely monitor its developments.

Despite this notable interest, XLM’s price has been struggling over the past few days following its bullish breakout. On January 15, 2025, XLM broke out from a bullish inverted head-and-shoulders price action pattern. Since then, the price has entered a consolidation phase. Long-term holders appear to be consistently accumulating, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . $20 Million XLM Worth XLM Outflow Data from spot inflow and outflow analysis reveals that exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of $20 million worth of XLM over the past three days. This substantial outflow, following a bullish breakout, is considered an ideal opportunity. Source: Coinglass In cryptocurrency, outflow refers to the transfer of assets from exchanges to wallets, indicating potential accumulation. This can create significant buying pressure and drive further upward price momentum. XLM Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, XLM appears bullish but is currently stuck in consolidation. Based on recent and historical price momentum, if XLM breaks out of this consolidation and closes a daily candle above the $0.50 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 25% to reach the $0.65 level in the future. Source: Trading View On the positive side, XLM’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains below the overbought zone, indicating that the asset has ample room for significant upward movement. Current Price Momentum At press time, XLM is trading near $0.48 and has experienced a price surge of over 2% in the past 24 hours. Additionally, its trading volume has increased by 5% during the same period, indicating growing interest from investors and traders, which could potentially drive XLM’s price higher.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|XLM|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-19 04:39:54

With Solana reaching new all-time highs and XRP making gains, there’s a lot of bullish momemtum. XRP continues to consolidate just below its all-time high, which isn’t surprising as it may take some time before the price breaks and sustains above this level. The key support levels for XRP remain defined between $2.52 and $2.94, and these levels are still valid. At the moment, XRP is experiencing a pullback, which is a natural part of any price movement and could present an opportunity for future growth. Key Support Levels: At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.21 and is down by more than one percent in the last 24 hours. However, the altcoin has gained an impressive 25 percent in the last week. The retracement levels are expected to reach between the 38.2% and 78.6% Fibonacci levels, with support areas at $2.94, $2.81, $2.68, and $2.52. Possible Outcomes: In terms of possible outcomes, if Wave A extends slightly lower, it would still be part of a healthy three-wave move down. A bounce from these levels would likely be corrective in nature, leading to another dip before a potential rally. Looking ahead, if XRP breaks above $3.39 or $3.40, we could see prices move toward the next major Fibonacci level, possibly reaching $4.19 or even $5. However, if the price falls below $2.52, it would invalidate the bullish structure. Conclusion: The latest market data shows XRP holding a strong position with a market cap of over $180 billion. Despite a recent 7% dip, many see this as a buying opportunity for long-term gains. As the inauguration draws closer and Trump’s influence in the crypto space increases, some experts predict significant price movements ahead.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-19 04:43:23

While other cryptocurrencies like XRP and Bitcoin (BTC) recorded massive gains in this bull market, Cardano (ADA) maintained a relatively muted price last year, experiencing significant volatility. Despite this, analysts remain bullish on ADA, emphasizing its potential for a substantial price recovery and a surge to new ATHs. Cardano Price Targets $6 ATH Ali Martinez, a prominent crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), shared a bullish price prediction for Cardano, forecasting a massive surge to $6. The analyst compared the similarities in ADA’s current price movement to historical patterns. He shared two parallel price charts of Cardano depicting its price action from 2018 to 2021 and 2022 to 2025. Related Reading: Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts Dogecoin Price From January To December 2025 In the left chart, ADA traded within a sideways accumulation zone, highlighted by the rectangular box, before experiencing a breakout above $0.14. Following the breakout, Cardano’s price corrected by about 43.6%, a massive decline that pushed its value below the $0.1 mark. As is often seen among cryptocurrencies, Cardano’s significant price crash established a solid foundation for a notable rally. After its substantial decline, the cryptocurrency initiated a significant price rally, reaching a peak of approximately $3.08. This remarkable price surge represented a gain of over 4,095%. In the right chart, Martinez identifies a similar sideways accumulation pattern between 2022 and 2023 of this year’s bullish cycle. Following this, Cardano broke out to reach a new price high of $0.8. After this, the altcoin underwent a 42.65%, mirroring the crash in 2021. Based on the historical fractal, Martinez predicts that Cardano could soon initiate its second leg up, potentially mimicking its impressive price rally in 2021 within the next two to three weeks. As a result, the analyst has set a bullish target for Cardano at above $6, marking a significant gain of 2,220.68%. While historical patterns do not accurately predict future price movements, they can provide insights into market trends, conditions, and other factors. Martinez’s bullish prediction for the Cardano price relies on the assumption that it can repeat similar market behavior and conditions during its 2021 bull rally. Related Reading: XRP Price Rallies To ATH At $3.4, Here’s What’s Driving It And Why The Pump Will Continue Update On ADA Price Analysis As mentioned earlier, the Cardano price declined severely last year despite bullish sentiment spreading to other altcoins in the market. In the last few weeks, ADA seemed to be recovering from bearish trends, as CoinMarketCap’s data showed a price increase of 16% over the past week. Cardano also experienced notable price gains in the last month, rising by over 10%. Although its price has reclaimed its $1 mark, ADA’s momentum seems to be fading, as the cryptocurrency has pulled back, recording a decline of 4% over the last 24 hours.

According to Fox Business, within 24 hours, the value of $TRUMP skyrocketed from just a few cents to $33.87, marking an incredible gain of over 18,000%. Adding to the excitement, Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the U.S., announced that it would list the $TRUMP coin.

The $TRUMP website reveals that 80% of the coin is controlled by CIC Digital, an affiliate of the Trump Organization, along with a co-owned entity called Fight Fight Fight. Coinciding with Trump’s upcoming inauguration, the meme coin’s release has sparked further interest as speculation grows around what role the new administration will play in the future of cryptocurrency. Trump is reportedly planning to issue executive orders related to Bitcoin and the broader crypto industry on his first day in office or shortly thereafter. One of the key points of his campaign was to advocate for a more relaxed regulatory approach to digital currencies. Additionally, Trump has discussed the possibility of creating a Bitcoin strategic reserve as part of his crypto policy. As Trump prepares to step into office, the crypto world is eagerly awaiting how his policies may shape the future of digital assets. $TRUMP’s dramatic launch is just the beginning, and many are watching closely to see what other developments unfold in the coming days.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-19 05:04:48

Musk Kills Bears (MUSKBEAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBEAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Kills Bears can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Kills Bears could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Kills Bears launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Kills Bears on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Kills Bears by entering its contract address – 9yoxPCyAdEVRfAtkztzC7yKuhy7vEEEjXm3Ym8ajJEww – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBEAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|SOL|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-19 05:13:00

While the likes of Solana and Dogecoin have dominated the market for a long time, newer DeFi tokens like Elluminex could outrank both in the coming week. Elluminex is a next-generation DeFi project that has come to redefine how crypto transactions are executed. Projected to launch on TON blockchain, It will address issues related to fragmented liquidity, high gas fees, and complex interfaces inherent in the DeFi landscape. Expert Predicts $4 Milestone For XRP, Once Key Resistance Level Is Broken The Ripple price chart shows that the altcoin is experiencing a market correction that opens the door to buying the dip. For Ali Chart , an on-chain analyst on X, the XRP token has been consolidating in the current bull flag for a while, and should it pass the $2.60 resistance level, it will head to $4. Based on data from CoinMarketCap , XRP price has already soared by 116% in the past month. Although the price dipped by 3% a few days ago, XRP trading volume is up by 37%, a signal of an impending bullish rally. As per Tradingview , XRP crypto currently trades above the 50-day SMA, with its 14-day RSI showing 66. Given that the XRP market sentiment is bullish, if the XRP crypto price should pass the $2.70, $2.84, and $2.97 resistance zone, the altcoin price will likely head towards the $4 next target. Solana Coin Sees Temporary Dip, But Trading Volume Surges By 41% Although the Solana token price has dipped in the past weeks, investors remain optimistic of a market rally in the coming weeks. According to CoinMarketCap , Solana’s price declined 10% in the past month and a further 3% in the past 7 days. However, the Solana trading volume has increased by over 25% in the past 24 hours due to the increasing whale accumulation. A crypto trader on X, Allien Ovich , believes Solana’s price could turn higher despite trading within a downtrend channel. According to the tweet, when Solana crypto breaks above $227.5, it can only go higher. However, despite the bullish outlook, Solana’s market sentiment remains neutral. Also, Solana recorded 13 green days in the past month, which is a concern for most holders. Although Solana is struggling to stay above the crucial $220 support zone, the growing adoption of the Solana blockchain makes it one of the altcoins to watch in the coming weeks. Investors Eyeing Dogecoin Breakout Towards $1 Mark Dogecoin (DOGE) has failed to capitalize on Bitcoin’s recent bullish rally as the meme coin price continues to drop. Dogecoin price plummeted by 2% in the past week, as per CoinMarketCap , and 3% some days ago. This means this coin is undergoing correction, which could be a good time to buy. While analysing the Dogecoin price chart on X, Andrew Griffiths claims that Dogecoin is currently building upward momentum. Using the 4-hour Heikin Ashi Chart, Andrew projects bullish momentum for the Dogecoin crypto, which could pave the way for a rally toward $0.54. Meanwhile, Dogecoin market sentiment is bearish despite price volatility of 4%.key oscillators such as Awesome Oscillator (5, 34) and VWMA (10) are flashing sell signals; however, Coincodex projects a massive 226% price gain in the short term. Elluminex: A Top DeFi Project Projected For Massive Rise Based on data by Mordor Intelligence , the DeFi market size is projected to hit $78B by 2029. To improve the DeFi space and harness its full potential, Elluminex (ELX) is launching a new DeFi hub on the TON blockchain, which will address major issues relating to interoperability, scalability and security that users face in the DeFi industry. The new DeFi protocol is designed to connect isolated blockchains while offering users a high level of liquidity that is hard to match by other platforms. Through the Elluminex decentralized exchange, users will be able to trade seamlessly with little or no slippage and earn profits. The Elluminex ecosystem is designed with advanced trading features, like the AI portfolio tracker, which provides real-time data and analytics, allowing traders to trade with insight and earn rewards all from one place. Outside of that, there is an educational platform designed to enhance users’ understanding of the DeFi industry. Elluminex aims to leverage the TON blockchain to develop a platform which allows users to trade, stake, farm, bridge and track their portfolio with ease. Given the limited 350M total supply and the deflationary mechanism, the Elluminex native token, ELX, could follow the path of Dogecoin 2021 bull season. Which Top Cryptocurrencies Will Experience Explosive Growth Soon? With the altcoin season far from over, Solana, XRP and Dogecoin prices could witness massive rallies before the end of the bull cycle. However, Elluminex is coming up with a solution to common DeFi problems, which will likely trigger its adoption. With the goal of bringing DeFi to the TON ecosystem, the ELX token price might follow the path of the Dogecoin 2021 bull season.feF For more information about Elluminex (ELX) visit the links below: Website: https://elluminex.com/ Twitter/X: https://x.com/elluminex Telegram: https://t.me/Elluminex Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

Bitcoin (BTC) price resurged to the $105K level as the week closed, whereas Ripple’s XRP witnessed gains of nearly 30% in the past seven days. Further, the new meme coin TRUMP has emerged as the talk of the cryptocurrency town, surging phenomenally ahead of Donald Trump’s upcoming presidential inauguration. So, let’s delve deeper into some of the most buzzworthy crypto market updates reported by CoinGape over the past week. BTC & Crypto Market Carry Momentum Ahead Of Donald Trump’s Presidential Inauguration Notably, a pro-crypto wave appears to have engulfed the broader market as Donald Trump is set to take office on January 20. The 47th U.S. president’s pro-cryptocurrency stand and immense support for digital assets have significantly impacted the market. Amid soaring optimism in light of Trump’s presidential inauguration, BTC and top crypto prices recovered following a recent waning action, further underscoring the Republican’s influence on the market. BTC price gained over 10% in the past seven days and exchanged hands at the $105K level as the week closed. ETH price gained slightly by 3% during the same period, closing the week at the $3,370 level. Simultaneously, Solana closed the week at around $257, a massive 37% surge in the past seven days. Also, meme coins such as SHIB and DOGE pumped 5%-20% over the past week. As mentioned above, the rising trajectories fall in line with Donald Trump’s upcoming presidential inauguration. Moreover, in light of this saga, Oklahoma recently introduced a Bitcoin Reserve Act, further bolstering support for the asset amid a bullish market. Additionally, CoinGape reported that even Wyoming proposed legislation to allow state funds’ investment in BTC. Overall, the abovementioned developments as the Republican is set to commence his presidential term have underlined a bullish impact on the crypto market. Ripple’s XRP Hovers Above $3 Simultaneously, Ripple’s native coin has emerged as another hot buzz in the market, surging 28% over the week to close at $3.26. The crypto leverages a broader bullish momentum as the 47th U.S. president is set to begin his term, as mentioned above. Besides, a stockpile of other developments garnered additional attention toward the digital asset. Notably, the odds of an XRP ETF have gained significant weight amid Gary Gensler’s exit. As per Nate Geraci, filings for ProShares Leveraged & Inverse XRP ETFs and ProShares XRP Futures ETF have been submitted recently. This development has ignited considerable market optimism surrounding Ripple’s coin. Further, Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen has reportedly moved $60.54 million XRP from his wallet, sparking discussions amid new filings in the lawsuit against the SEC. Intriguingly, even Ripple whales moved over 130 million tokens as both parties agreed to file stipulations regarding cross-appeals, and the SEC filed its new opening brief. Altogether, the abovementioned events emerged as some of the most impactful news for the Ripple community this week. TRUMP Meme Coin Gains Traction On the other hand, Donald Trump announced the TRUMP meme coin launch this week, sparking additional discussions. Notably, the Official TRUMP coin witnessed a phenomenal 3000% uptick within just 20 hours, reaching right behind Pepe Coin in terms of market cap. The token’s rising popularity ahead of the presidential inauguration has further raised eyebrows among traders and investors globally. Meanwhile, it’s also noteworthy that the whale accumulations for the new meme coin on Solana have witnessed a remarkable rise, sparking optimism over the asset’s future movements.

As Render’s price shows resilience and Aptos boasts a surging TVL fueled by expanding DeFi and AI integration, blockchain innovation is taking giant leaps. These projects are redefining their niches, but the spotlight now shifts to Web3Bay . Web3Bay is rewriting the rules of online shopping by combining blockchain efficiency with user-friendly features. Its presale is quickly gaining traction, offering a first-mover advantage in decentralized e-commerce. With 3BAY tokens priced to rise at each stage and projected to deliver high ROI, missing this presale could feel like skipping Bitcoin or Ethereum’s early days. Will you act now or watch from the sidelines? Web3Bay’s Blueprint for E-Commerce Dominance Will Web3Bay’s presale turn into one of those moments you regret passing up, like missing out on Bitcoin or Ethereum in their infancy? As a pioneer in decentralized e-commerce, Web3Bay is building an entirely new way to shop online. Its 3BAY tokens act as the foundation for a system that eliminates intermediaries, ensuring faster, more secure transactions. The platform’s ongoing presale, now in its 4th stage with 3BAY priced at $0.004562, has already gained significant attention, raising over $830,000 and selling 220 million tokens to date, making it a contender among high ROI crypto opportunities. Web3Bay’s strength lies in its ability to merge Web2 familiarity with Web3 innovation. By incorporating user-friendly features and supporting traditional payment options like PayPal (planned for future integration), it ensures usability for both crypto enthusiasts and everyday shoppers. This inclusive approach could drive mass adoption and position Web3Bay as a game-changer in online retail. With decentralized storage via IPFS and token incentives such as governance rights and purchase discounts, the platform appeals to users on multiple levels. The roadmap ahead includes major milestones like DAO implementation, 3BAY token listings on top exchanges, and new feature rollouts that could substantially enhance token value. Each presale stage raises the token price, creating structured prices to the benefit of the community. Missing this opportunity could mean watching Web3Bay redefine e-commerce without you. Render Price Update: What’s Driving RNDR’s Momentum? The Render price recently touched $7.48, reflecting a slight pullback after reaching an intraday high of $8.09. This follows a 30% surge earlier in 2025, showcasing renewed market confidence in the RNDR token. Analysts suggest this upward trend could target $14.32 and possibly the $19-$20 range if the bullish momentum continues. With growing adoption in AI-powered rendering and holographic media, Render Network’s influence in creative industries is expanding rapidly. 2024 was a transformative year for Render, with its usage rate tripling and partnerships powering high-profile projects like the Las Vegas Sphere’s visuals. As Render sets new standards in decentralized rendering, the current Render price reflects its growing role in reshaping 3D media creation. RNDR’s utility and market demand are driving attention, positioning it as a strong contender for significant growth in 2025. Aptos TVL Surges Amid Ecosystem Growth The Aptos TVL has been climbing steadily, now supported by a thriving DeFi ecosystem that saw a 28-fold increase in daily decentralized exchange volumes, reaching $21.5 million within a year. Aptos’ focus on seamless AI integration and expanding its financial ecosystem has made it a key player in blockchain innovation. Recent reports highlight over 27.7 million active addresses and 1.7 billion transactions processed, with a record 326 million transactions completed in a single day. As Aptos introduces stablecoins like USDT and USDY to its ecosystem, its Aptos TVL growth reflects both scalability and user confidence. Plans to expand AI-driven clienteling and modern POS solutions on the Aptos ONE platform are set to fuel further adoption. These strategic advancements suggest Aptos is positioning itself for long-term impact in decentralized finance and retail technology. The Final Take With the Render price aiming for targets beyond $14 and Aptos’ expanding ecosystem reflected in its rising Aptos TVL, these projects demonstrate blockchain’s potential for innovation and growth. However, as promising as these established names are, Web3Bay brings a fresh opportunity to the table. Its presale offers access to 3BAY tokens at prices designed for high growth potential, making it a compelling choice for those seeking a high ROI crypto. With plans to bridge Web2 and Web3, upcoming token listings, and community-driven governance, Web3Bay could redefine decentralized e-commerce. The question remains: Will you regret overlooking Web3Bay’s presale as it sets the stage for long-term dominance in a rapidly evolving market? The time to act is now.

Here Are The Top 10 Coins With The Most Potential,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/will-trumps-inauguration-boost-crypto-here-are-the-top-10-coins-with-the-most-potential/,"As President-elect Donald Trump prepares for his inauguration on January 20, the crypto community is buzzing with anticipation regarding the potential impact of his administration on digital assets. Analysts are closely examining which crypto assets may benefit the most during this pivotal period, especially given Trump’s vocal support for making the United States a leader in the crypto space. Market expert Xremlin suggests that Trump’s presidency could usher in a “golden era” for crypto. His analysis focuses on US-founded coins and assets linked to the Trump family, indicating that the inauguration might catalyze significant price movements for certain altcoins. Notably, Eric Trump has publicly shared his investments in Sui (SUI), Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), and Bitcoin (BTC), suggesting a focus on already established cryptocurrencies. The Leading Crypto Contenders Ethereum (ETH): The analyst shares that Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem, known for its smart contract functionality and diverse use cases. He suggests that as a leading platform for decentralized applications (dApps), its significance in the market is undeniable, making it a staple in any crypto portfolio. Bitcoin (BTC): Often referred to as digital gold, Bitcoin is the most recognized cryptocurrency and serves as a benchmark for the entire market. Xremlin observes its potential inclusion in a US Strategic Bitcoin reserve could further solidify its status and drive additional interest from institutional investors. Solana (SOL): As a US-founded blockchain with a robust user base, Solana has gained attention for its speed and scalability. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve In The US: 65% Chance It Happens In 2025 The analyst speculates that it could soon see the launch of an exchange-traded fund (ETF), which would enhance its visibility and accessibility to mainstream investors. Sui (SUI): Positioned as a direct competitor to Solana, Sui boasts higher transactions per second (TPS) but still lacks a significant user base. Being US-founded, it reportedly stands to gain from any favorable regulatory developments that may arise during Trump’s administration. World Liberty: Initiated by the Trump family, is another one to watch, according to Xremlin. Although it has yet to launch, its connection to the Trump name could reportedly generate price spikes once it enters the market. Additional Contenders For The “Trump Trade” Beyond the aforementioned digital assets, Xremlin highlights several other US-founded projects are gaining traction and could play a role in the so-called “Trump trade”: Ripple (XRP): Known for its blockchain-based payment protocol, Ripple facilitates real-time cross-border payments, making it a key player for financial institutions. Chainlink (LINK): As a blockchain-agnostic platform, Chainlink connects various chains to major financial institutions, enabling seamless data connectivity and interoperability. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts When Dogecoin Price Will Hit $3 This Cycle Ondo (ONDO): This platform bridges traditional financial products like US bonds and treasuries to the blockchain, enhancing accessibility and efficiency in the DeFi space. Hedera (HBAR): Governed by a council that includes tech giants like Google and IBM, Hedera is designed for fast and energy-efficient transactions, ensuring stability and transparency. Stellar (XLM): Focused on facilitating low-cost cross-border payments, Stellar collaborates with companies such as Circle and MoneyGram to integrate blockchain solutions into the U.S. financial system.

In his post , Kwok contrasted the hype surrounding an $8 billion XRP ETF with the far greater opportunities in real-world tokenized assets (RWAs), emphasizing their capacity to revolutionize markets like real estate and mortgages. A $16 Trillion Opportunity Kwok referenced his experiences presenting alongside Ripple CTO David Schwartz, who envisions a path to a $16 trillion market in tokenized assets. According to Kwok, this massive opportunity lies not in catering to ETFs but in addressing significant inefficiencies across industries such as real estate, mortgages, and liquidity management. Real estate, a $200 trillion market, is riddled with challenges, from fractional ownership complications to liquidity constraints and inefficiencies in mortgage financing. Kwok emphasized the potential of blockchain technology, particularly the XRPL , in providing innovative solutions to these longstanding issues. lots of hype about an $8bn $xrp etf. but as a builder, i couldn’t care less. i’ve presented on-stage with ripple cto david schwartz twice. and he sees an easy straight line to a $16 TRILLION market in tokenised assets. how? hint: it’s not about building for etfs a thread pic.twitter.com/IyLLQQM3I6 — Phil Kwok | EasyA (@kwok_phil) January 15, 2025 Real-World Applications of Tokenization Kwok highlighted two specific applications of tokenization: Expanded Mortgage Markets: Tokenization could enable the issuance of mortgages not just on homes but on any asset class. This innovation could dramatically expand lending markets, creating new economic opportunities. Fractional Ownership: Blockchain technology could allow individuals to own shares of properties worldwide without navigating complex paperwork or legal barriers. Such developments would democratize access to investment opportunities, empowering individuals to participate in high-value markets that were previously inaccessible. Why the XRP Ledger? The XRP Ledger’s attributes make it uniquely suited for these applications. Its fast transaction speeds, low costs, and secure fixed functionalities position it as a preferred platform for tokenizing real-world assets. The XRPL could unlock unprecedented value across various markets by addressing inefficiencies and enabling seamless peer-to-peer transactions. Kwok’s stance on ETFs underscores his belief that blockchain technology’s true potential lies in creating transformative use cases rather than building solutions for traditional financial instruments. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Perspective Kwok’s insights resonated with other members of the blockchain community. One X user, “TheGameoflife,” noted , “Blockchain technology fixes trust. Today we have brokers, agents, [and] middle men all with their hand in the cookie jar. When we can do peer-to-peer transactions using a decentralized trust system, the possibilities are endless.” This comment highlights the broader sentiment that decentralization and tokenization have the potential to eliminate intermediaries, streamline processes, and build trust in industries traditionally burdened by inefficiencies. A Paradigm Shift in Blockchain Applications Kwok’s argument aligns with a growing belief among blockchain builders: the most transformative applications of the technology lie in real-world use cases. The tokenization of assets represents a shift toward creating systems that address tangible problems and unlock new value propositions. While the $8 billion XRP ETF represents a milestone, Kwok’s vision for tokenized assets positions the blockchain space as an enabler of far larger economic opportunities. With a focus on RWAs and the capabilities of the XRPL, the blockchain community appears poised to redefine how value is created, managed, and distributed. This perspective reminds builders and investors alike that the journey toward a $16 trillion tokenized asset market is just beginning.

The cryptocurrency ( TRUMP ), which President-elect Donald Trump launched as an homage to himself, is quickly gaining traction in the digital asset space, with trading volumes surging on major platforms like Binance and OKX, where it is listed. The coin’s rally reflects a growing appetite for meme coins backed or launched by famous individuals. The downside is that these types of assets often experience speculative booms due to their viral appeal. Some are even called out for being rug pulls. The Official Trump coin has both going for it, but at last check Sunday, it’s up almost 330%. Source: CoinGecko You might also like: What is a crypto rug pull? How to stay safe from rug pulls What critics are saying TRUMP’s creators, and Trump himself, are leaning into the president-elect’s political brand, positioning the token as both a financial asset and a cultural statement. For example, its logo — emblazoned with the words “Fight Fight Fight” — differentiates the token from other unofficial Trump meme coins that flooded the market. Official Trump’s listing on Binance and OKX has further legitimized it, providing access to millions of global traders. However, the coin has not been without controversy. Critics argue that TRUMP represents a potential conflict of interest, particularly as Trump is about to be sworn in as commander-in-chief of the U.S. Stephen Findeisen, also known as the crypto sleuth Coffeezilla on YouTube, called the launch “ historic in its stupidity .” Anthony Scaramucci, a Bitcoin bull who briefly worked for Trump and now runs the investment firm SkyBridge Capital, warned his one million followers on X not to “delude” themselves about the Official Trump meme coin launch. The Trump meme coin stuff is bad for the industry. Don’t delude yourself. It’s Idi Amin level corruption. — Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) January 18, 2025 Ben Meiselas, co-founder of Meidas Touch, suggested Trump could have focused on more urgent matters rather than meme coins. https://twitter.com/meiselasb/status/1880455817306206589 Despite the criticism, TRUMP’s rapid rise underscores the ongoing influence of political and cultural figures in the cryptocurrency market, raising questions about the intersection of finance, politics, and blockchain technology. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy also chimed in, equating Trump’s meme coin launch to the alleged pump-and-dump scheme involving Haliey Welch, the viral “ Hawk Tuah ” star. I have a dumb 2 part question. 1. What’s the difference between the Hawk Tuah coin and the Trump coin besides nothing? 2. Can I string up my own coin now and tell people it’s a Ponzi scheme from the jump and I’m gonna rug pull at some point and you better just hope you’re… — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) January 18, 2025 It’s worth noting that the Trump family already actively promote tokens tied to World Liberty Financial. In September, CoinDesk reported that 70% of the platform’s tokens were held by its founders, team members, and service providers. The same goes for Official Trump. Some 80% of the meme coin is reportedly held by CIC Digital, a Trump Organization affiliate.

However, Elluminex (ELX) is set to outperform them both with its unique premise that could revolutionize the entire DeFi space and unlock the latent potential of the TON blockchain. Let’s dive deeper and discover why this project could be one of the hottest plays in 2025. How Elluminex Is Pioneering DeFi On TON TON is the fastest-growing blockchain in the Layer 1 space, tapping directly into Telegram’s massive 950-million user base. Although TON already asserted itself in the crypto gaming niche with viral Telegram-based titles like Notcoin and Hamster Kombat, it still lacks a unified DeFi solution, meaning significant revenue is being left on the table. Ethereum’s numbers and usability skyrocketed when Uniswap was released, the same happened with Binance Smart Chain and Pancake Swap. Soon, TON will have its very own DeFi protocol — Elluminex . However, Elluminex is not just another run-of-the-mill decentralized exchange, it brings forward a 360-degree ecosystem that addresses all inefficiencies commonly found in old-guard protocols. Through its revolutionary cross-chain bridge, Elluminex will integrate all major blockchains and allow them to interface with one another. This in turn will translate into a deep, unified liquidity pool, as liquidity is sourced from the various chains, allowing users to trade and invest with minimal slippage and greatly reduced waiting times. At the core of the Elluminex ecosystem is the $ELX utility token, which will power key features like governance and staking. Holders of the token can opt to stake their $ELX and earn up to 18% APY. This model not only ensures long-term holding but combined with the automated burn mechanism, deflationary pressure will drive the price of $ELX much higher, allowing crypto players to to benefit from both staking rewards and appreciation gains. The launch of the $ELX presale is yet to be unveiled, and once it is live, early buyers will have the opportunity to build a future-proof $ELX position at a discounted price. Keep an eye on Elluminex’s socials and official website to stay up to date with the latest developments. Fantom Is In The Red, Will It Go Lower? After bottoming out during the summer slump Fantom (FTM) skyrocketed with a triple-digit surge, peaking at $1.43 just a few days ago. However, as the market-wide correction began, Fantom faced significant declines that saw it breach below $1.20. At the time of writing, Fantom trades at $1.15 following a 13.5% intraday decline. The 90% rise in trading volume underscores significant trader activity happening at these levels, and over the last 24 hours, about $950 million worth of FTM has changed hands across platforms. Over the last year, Fantom has been finalizing its rebrand to Sonic and since yesterday, the new Layer 1 is now live. FTM holders will be able to swap their tokens for the native S token on a 1:1 ratio. Staking and governance features will also be live soon. This revamped Fantom ecosystem boasts 10,000 TPS, near-instant finality, and an upcoming $260M airdrop, positioning Sonic as the successor to Fantom’s legacy. Solana-Killer Sui Continues To Make Strides In 2024 Sui (SUI) topped headlines and positioned itself among the leading Layer 1 platforms. This has also been reflected by its stellar performance, as Sui has been in up-only mode for months, breaking to a new all-time high several times in a row. The latest Sui peak was at $4.93 but as traders booked profits, a pullback followed, and today, Sui sells for $4.73 with a slight 1.5% increase on the daily timeframe. In terms of raw numbers, Sui’s 120,000 transactions per second could pose a threat to Solana’s dominion as the fastest blockchain in the space. Just recently, Sui partnered with SatLayer to integrate Bitcoin’s security and liquidity into its ecosystem, enabling Bitcoin restaking and DeFi (BTCfi) capabilities.

Coinbase posted on Sunday that it plans to list the TRUMP token. The announcement came via its Coinbase Assets X account, which provides information on new assets, however the exchange did not provide a concrete timeline for listing. Binance said it plans to open trading for the TRUMP token on the the morning of Jan. 19. The token is already trading on many other centralized exchanges, such as Bitget, KuCoin and Kraken according to CoinGecko. On-chain data shows that the token has a market cap of just over $7.6 billion, and trading volume of approximately $15 billion. While many of the largest crypto exchanges have eagerly embraced Trump’s official memecoin, the first Trump-themed token, one of the original Political Finance (PoliFi) tokens, had trouble getting listed on exchanges. As CoinDesk reported earlier this year, ByBit and OKX rejected the team’s application to list the token given concerns about the project being too political. Kraken did not respond to their application to list, and would not discuss the matter on the record. The first Trump token, the Ethereum-based MAGA, is down 84% from its June high of $17.80, according to CoinGecko , but continues to be actively traded. MAGA dumped hard after the launch of the officialTrump token, falling from $3.50 to $1.44 over the weekend with its market cap declining from $158 million to $64 million. The token has slowly recovered after the initial fall likely due to general interest in Trump-themed tokens on the eve of the inauguration. The tokenomics of TRUMP have been criticized by many online, who have pointed out that 80% of the token supply is controlled by wallets owned by CIC Digital. CIC Digital LLC is the Trump Organization affiliated firm that launched Trump Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) in 2023. Data from OpenSea shows that there’s a second wave of interest in these NFTs with over 2,800 sales in the last 24 hours worth over 765 ETH ($2.5 million).",Markets,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BNB|MARKET|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-19 06:24:36

Donald Trump the Bull (DONBULL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONBULL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Trump the Bull can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Trump the Bull could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Trump the Bull launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Trump the Bull on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Donald Trump the Bull by entering its contract address – AmgaL1uuQ97qJoXfUUxdHipLJmVd3toChivEBiSFn7MW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONBULL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|TRADING|DOGE|SOL|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-19 06:29:00

While Bitcoin remains a household name, other projects like Avalanche and Immutable X have made serious strides, carving out niches in blockchain innovation. Joining these big names is Qubetics ($TICS) , a project that’s redefining Web3 utility. If you’re seeking the Top Coins for Significant Returns, these three cryptos should be on your radar. Avalanche and Immutable X have proven their worth over the years with their scalability and innovation, but Qubetics is a game-changer that’s shaking things up. With its focus on interoperability and a suite of groundbreaking tools, Qubetics is poised to lead the charge for significant returns in 2025. Let’s dive into what makes these projects the Top Coins for Significant Returns. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Interoperability in Web3 Qubetics is not merely another cryptocurrency; it is the world’s first Web3 aggregator, designed to integrate multiple blockchains seamlessly. Its advanced interoperability tools enable businesses, developers, and individuals to interact effortlessly across various ecosystems, fostering a unified and efficient digital environment. Imagine you’re a property developer in Miami wanting to tokenize an apartment complex. With Qubetics, you can create digital tokens that represent shares of the property, allowing global investors to buy in with ease. Or think about a freelance artist in São Paulo selling tokenized ownership of their latest work, opening new revenue streams. Qubetics makes these scenarios practical and accessible. In its 17th presale stage , Qubetics has raised over $9.8 million, onboarded more than 14,800 token holders, and sold over 423 million $TICS tokens. At $0.0501 per token, analysts project exponential growth: $TICS could reach $0.25 by the presale’s end, offering a nearly 400% return. Post-presale predictions of $1, $5, or even $15 highlight Qubetics’ massive potential, making it one of the Top Coins for Significant Returns. Qubetics’ focus on interoperability is equally groundbreaking. Businesses can bridge their operations across blockchains, creating new efficiencies. Developers can build dApps that work on multiple platforms without extra coding. And for everyday users? Transactions and asset management just got a whole lot simpler. This commitment to real-world usability cements Qubetics’ place among the most exciting projects in crypto. Avalanche: Speed and Scalability at Its Core Avalanche is known for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and unparalleled scalability. It’s one of the most robust platforms for deploying decentralized applications (dApps) and enterprise-grade solutions. Whether it’s DeFi, NFTs, or gaming, Avalanche has become a go-to for developers who need performance without compromise. In 2025, Avalanche continues to deliver on its promise of efficiency. The network can process over 4,500 transactions per second, making it a favorite for projects that require high throughput. Imagine a DeFi platform in New York managing thousands of trades per second or a gaming company in Tokyo powering millions of in-game transactions seamlessly. Avalanche makes it all possible. Its native token, AVAX, has also been a consistent performer. Trading at around $20, AVAX is considered undervalued by many analysts, especially given its growing adoption. With more projects choosing Avalanche as their foundation, the token’s value is poised to rise significantly, making it one of the Top Coins for Significant Returns. Immutable X: Redefining NFTs and Gaming Immutable X has quickly become a leader in the NFT and gaming space, offering a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. By eliminating gas fees and speeding up transactions, Immutable X has made it easier than ever for creators and gamers to interact with blockchain technology. It’s no wonder the platform is often touted as a game-changer in its niche. In 2025, Immutable X continues to dominate by providing a seamless experience for NFT minting and trading. Imagine a digital artist in Los Angeles creating an NFT collection without worrying about exorbitant gas fees. Or a game developer in London enabling players to trade in-game assets instantly. These are just a few of the possibilities made real by Immutable X. What sets Immutable X apart is its focus on sustainability. By leveraging Ethereum’s security while minimizing environmental impact, it’s winning over eco-conscious users and developers. If you’re bullish on the future of NFTs and gaming, Immutable X deserves a spot in your portfolio as one of the Top Coins for Significant Returns. Conclusion: Don’t Miss the Chance Crypto investing is all about timing and spotting potential. Qubetics, Avalanche, and Immutable X each bring something unique to the table. Qubetics is redefining interoperability , Avalanche is leading the way in speed and scalability, and Immutable X is transforming the NFT and gaming landscapes. Qubetics’ presale offers a rare opportunity to get in early on a project with massive upside potential. Don’t wait—join the revolution today and position yourself for significant returns with the Top Coins for Significant Returns.

Despite his previous hesitations about cryptocurrency, Trump had expressed his belief that America would become “the crypto capital of the planet” once he returned to Washington. The timing of the launch has raised some eyebrows. Critics have accused Trump of capitalizing on his imminent presidency to profit from the popularity of cryptocurrencies, particularly meme coins. However, some experts are focusing on how this move could have an impact on ongoing legal battles in the crypto space, particularly the high-profile lawsuit between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple Lawsuit: Could Trump’s $TRUMP Coin Affect the Case? Attorney Bill Morgan recently discussed thE implications of Trump’s actions on the Ripple lawsuit. Morgan pointed out that the appeal of Judge Torres’ finding against Ripple’s fair notice defense is now looking more promising. For context, the SEC has been pursuing legal action against Ripple, claiming that the company’s sale of XRP violated securities laws. However, Ripple argues that it had no clear notice that its sales of XRP were subject to SEC registration requirements. Morgan drew attention to Trump’s stance on the issue of cryptocurrencies and investment contracts. While Trump has issued and promoted the $TRUMP meme coin, he does not believe that such tokens should be classified as investment contracts that require SEC registration. This is a key issue in the Ripple lawsuit, where the SEC argues that XRP should be treated as a security, while Ripple maintains that it is a digital asset. The @Ripple appeal of Judge Torres finding against Ripple’s defense that there must be a contract or post sale obligations is looking good. After all the President of the USA thinks a token with no post sale obligations to buyers can be issued and promoted without being… https://t.co/OByrCesd8j — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) January 18, 2025 Given that Trump has issued a speculative meme coin without adhering to the traditional regulatory frameworks that the SEC enforces on other tokens, Morgan questioned how the SEC v. Ripple case could continue under these circumstances. He said that Ripple’s sales of XRP, like the promotion of $TRUMP, did not involve any post-sale obligations, which is a point of contention in the Ripple case.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-19 06:31:02

According to DeFi Llama , Solana’s ( SOL ) DEX protocols handled $19.47 billion in volume, up from $19.37 billion the previous day. The previous daily record was $7.5 billion in November last year. This surge happened because of the recent launch of the Official Trump ( TRUMP ) meme coin that launched on Friday, Jan. 17. So far, the token has gained a market capitalization of over $7.5 billion, while its 24-hour trading volume jumped to $11 billion. You might also like: Official Trump meme coin surges 330%, critics raise concerns Most of this volume is happening in Solana DEX networks, led by Meteora, Raydium, Orca, and Lifinity. Other centralized exchanges like OKX, Binance, Bitget, and MEXC have also listed the token and are starting to gain some market share. Solana’s DEX volume was significantly higher than other leading layer-1 and layer-2 chains. Ethereum’s ( ETH ) protocols handled $3.63 billion in the last 24 hours, while BNB Chain, Base, and Arbitrum handled $3 billion, $2 billion, and $1 billion, respectively.

Bonk ( BONK ) jumped by 10%, with its 24-hour volume reaching over $1 billion. Fartcoin price jumped by almost 30%, with its volume reaching $557 million. This performance led to higher fees for the Solana blockchain. Data by TokenTerminal shows that the fees jumped to $4.7 million, the highest level since Jan. 8.

It jumped to a high of $275 on Jan. 19, crossing last year’s high of $265 and invalidating the double-top pattern that formed. A double-top is a risky sign that often leads to a bearish breakout, initially to the neckline. In this case, the neckline was at $170, its lowest point this month. Solana’s price has remained above all moving averages, while the Money Flow Index has tilted upwards and is nearing its overbought level.

As a result, the crypto market is already surging exponentially, with several altcoins set to skyrocket on 20 Jan. Interestingly, Official Trump meme coin, Solana and XRP, might create new ATHs on Monday. A ‘Trump Pump’ Might Surpass Buyers’ Expectations With less than a day until President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20th, traders are excited to see how his administration, which is rumored to be supportive of crypto, will influence the industry’s future. Also read: XRP Lawsuit News: Ripple’s Fight with SEC Faces New Twist as Trump Promotes Meme Coin On Friday, Bitcoin reached its highest price of 2025, with investors looking forward to Donald Trump’s second presidential inauguration on January 20th. Trump is said to be planning to sign over 100 executive orders right away, some of which might address Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. As a result, several altcoins, along with a new meme coin launched by Donald Trump, have begun to see significant increases in value. However, there is also worry about potential pump-and-dump schemes in the market, although the likelihood of this happening is quite low. Official Trump Price Analysis Donald Trump announced a new cryptocurrency called the Trump memecoin just days before his inauguration. Despite concerns of potential scams, the excitement drove the memecoin’s value on the Solana blockchain to soar to a market capitalization (FDV) of over $38 billion. The hype is expected to grow as the meme coin endorsed by the incoming president boosts trader confidence. Currently, the Official Trump meme coin is trading at $38.8, having surged over 190% in the last 24 hours. It is anticipated that the Trump coin will maintain its buying demand on January 20th. With the price chart showing a rising wedge pattern, the coin’s value is predicted to skyrocket above $40. The target price for January 20th is set between $70 and $80. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana price continues to surge above immediate resistance lines, reaching its November highs. As of writing, SOL price trades at $270, increasing over 8.9% from yesterday’s rate. The 20-day average price has begun to rise, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved into overbought territory, hinting at a minor retest of immediate support level. There’s a slight resistance at $303, but it’s expected that this price can be surpassed. If so, the SOL/USDT pair might increase to $350 tomorrow. XRP Price Analysis XRP continues to surge due to the fact that the new SEC might bring fresh crypto policies, impacting Ripple’s legal lawsuit positively. XRP price has been surging exponentially and is preparing for further surges tomorrow by consolidating at $3.2. For a robust surge, XRP needs to hold above the EMA20 trend line.

Moreover, the Company has significantly improved its financial performance, turning large losses into net income over the past three years. Year-end results will be reported in April 2025; I anticipate that those results, which will reflect the Trump crypto rally, should serve as a catalyst to propel the stock higher. Introduction When I last covered Defi Technologies Inc. ( OTCQB:DEFTF ) (the "" Company "") for Seeking Alpha on December 7, 2021, the crypto market, including the Company, was in a bubbly bull market. The Company's stock price was $2.87 then compared to $3.08 today (1/16/25). While on the surface it might look like the stock price has been largely range bound over the period, the reality is that the ride from then to now has been an epic roller coaster as shown in the chart below. Seeking Alpha Indeed, the Company would go on to lose more than 95% of its value at its nadir during the course of the crypto bear market of 2022-2023. It is more than three years later, and for the reasons described herein, I still believe the Company remains a BUY and I include the Company in the speculative bucket of my Model Asset Allocation . A Growing Business Business Segments Per it most recent Management Discussion & Analysis ("" MD&A ""), the Company generates revenue via a half dozen business segments: 1. Valour Asset Management ("" Valour ""). Valour is the Company's key business segment, offering Exchange Traded Products (“ ETPs ”) that ""synthetically track the value of a single DeFi protocol or a basket of protocols."" See MD&A linked above. Valour's products are mainly offered in Europe. As of September 30, 2024, such products offer exposure to the following, among other protocols: Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ); Ethereum ( ETH-USD ); Solana ( SOL-USD ); Polkadot ( DOT-USD ); Cardano ( ADA-USD ); Uniswap ( UNI-USD ); Cosmos ( ATOM-USD ); Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ); Chainlink ( LINK-USD ) and Enjin Coin ( ENJ-USD ). See MD&A above for further details (Note 12, page 23). 2. The Company's DeFi Alpha segment operates an arbitrage trading desk (the "" Trading Desk ""). The Trading Desk seeks to ""identify low-risk arbitrage opportunities within the crypto ecosystem."" Per the Company's website : With a primary focus on both centralized and decentralized markets, the trading desk ensures minimal exposure to market and protocol risks, effectively mitigating revenue volatility. Since its inception, DeFi Alpha has delivered significant results, generating over C$133.1 million (US$97.5 million) in cash and digital asset equivalents in 2024."" 3. The Stillman Digital segment is, according to the MD&A, ""a leading digital asset liquidity provider that offers limitless liquidity solutions for businesses, focusing on industry-leading trade execution, settlement and technology."" The Company acquired Stillman Digital in October 2024, issuing Company shares to finance the acquisition. The Company's year-end financials should provide investors with initial insights into this segment's performance. 4. The Company's DeFi Ventures segment invests in decentralized finance businesses, seeking to maintain a diversified portfolio of companies. The portfolio companies of Defi Ventures are described here . 5. Per the MD&A, the Company's DeFi Infrastructure segment offers ""governance services and products within the DeFi ecosystem."" For more information regarding services and the Company's partners, see this link . 6. Finally, the Reflexivity LLC business segment is a provider of boutique crypto industry research. Co-founded by Anthony Pompliano and Will Clemente, the Company acquired Reflexivity LLC in the first quarter of 2024. *** Notably, in my prior articles concerning the Company, including my original article linked here , I noted that the Company retained an interest in crypto miner, Hive Digital Technologies Inc. ( HIVE ). Today, however, that investment no longer appears to be on the books of the Company. Certain Recent Developments After the close of the third quarter of 2024, the Company has made some positive announcements that demonstrate positive momentum for Valour. Per the MD&A, those developments include: In October 2024, Valour listed the Valour Sui ( SUI-USD ) ETP on the Spotlight Stock Market in Stockholm, Sweden (the "" Spotlight Stock Market ""). SUI, a protocol that I own, is a Layer 1 blockchain with a high quality management team (previously part of the Diem project of Facebook/Meta Platforms, Inc. ( META )). Also in October 2024, Valour listed the first-ever Valour Bittensor ( TAO-USD ) ETP on the Spotlight Stock Market, providing investors with access to Bittensor's ""decentralized machine learning protocol."" [The Author is unfamiliar with this protocol.] A month later, in November 2024, the Company announced that Valour and affiliates had introduced a new physically backed, high-yield Bitcoin ETP for German investors in collaboration with Core Foundation . Net Income The Company has grown revenues and net income materially over the last three years. (Canadian Dollars) September 30, 2021 September 30, 2024 Total Revenues 9,967,376 152,436,040 Total Expenses 25,376,938 55,199,666 Net Income (21,454,530) 95,145,316 Indeed, the Company has turned large losses into profits. Keep in mind too that the bull market in crypto accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2024 in anticipation of (and following) the Trump victory. The Company is estimated to report 2024 year-end earnings on April 2, 2024. I am anticipating that the Company will have a solid quarter as its assets under management ("" AUM "") more than doubled year over year (and exceeded $1 billion (Canadian)). This could be a big catalyst for the stock price, particularly if the Company can continue to show overall growth in AUM and net inflows into its ETPs. Balance Sheet (Canadian Dollars) September 20, 2021 September 20, 2024 Current Assets 264,598,501 832,070,950 Current Liabilities 246,809,926 789,761,126 Current Ratio ** 1.07 1.05 Total Assets 372,062,311 928,959,248 Total Liabilities 246,831,974 789,761,126 Shareholder Equity 125,230,337 139,198,122 Shares Outstanding (Diluted) 189,037,949 339,793,738 ** Not included in the linked balance sheets included above. Added by Author. The balance sheet has grown over the last three years, but liquidity has not necessarily improved as the Current Ratio has actually declined. Shareholder Equity has slightly improved, but there has been significant shareholder dilution along the way. With profits and AUM growing, however, it is important for the Company to begin to improve its liquidity profile. I will be looking at year-end results closely in this regard. A risk I see is that management is possibly doing too much and making investments in too many verticals. Other risks are noted or referenced below. Risks Key risks are enumerated in the MD&A linked above. Notably, however, the decline in the Canadian dollar is having an adverse effect on the Company. The chart below shows the performance of the Canadian dollar via the Invesco CurrencyShares® Canadian Dollar Trust ETF ( FXC ) and the US Dollar Index ( DXY ) over the last three years. Seeking Alpha Moreover, a large number of the Company's ETPs are listed on European exchanges, and the recent trend for the Euro has been downward as well. The chart below shows the performance of the Euro via the Invesco CurrencyShares® Euro Currency Trust ETF ( FXE ) and the US Dollar Index ( DXY ) over the last three years. Seeking Alpha Needless to say, ownership of the Company includes material foreign currency risk associated with the Canadian dollar , the Euro and certain other European currencies. Further, due to the Company's size (under $1 billion market cap) and it being domiciled in Canada, it is not included in any large stock indexes (at least as far as I can tell) and, as such, the Company is not the beneficiary of material passive flows. This could prove to be a competitive disadvantage. Lastly, with significant exposure to alt-coins, the Company is very volatile. Since it began trading on public markets (in or about March 2020), it makes Bitcoin look very dull by comparison as shown in the chart below. Seeking Alpha In short, this kind of volatility is not for everyone. Conclusion With its fast growing asset management business, the Company is a speculative BUY . Moreover, it continues to hold promise as a call option on the crypto/DeFi space. Consequently, it holds a place in the speculative bucket of my Model Asset Allocation .",DEFTF|DEFI:CA,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-19 06:56:03

In 2022, the Department of Justice managed to take control of 94,643 of 119,754 bitcoins associated with the hack, paving the way for restitution. The DOJ is working on getting the rest of the stolen coins, which were subjected to money laundering attempts. Before the hack, the stolen amount of bitcoins was worth around $72 million. Following the price drop, these coins’ value was estimated at $58 million. As of Jan. 19, 2025, the value of 94.6k BTC is estimated at $9 billion. The number of stolen assets was more than half of the bitcoins controlled by Bitfinex at the time. Table of Contents The details of the ruling The people behind the hack and money laundering Is the ruling controversial? The details of the ruling The ruling may be found controversial as every single Bitfinex client holding money on the exchange in 2016 was affected regardless of whether criminals emptied their wallets because the unaffected addresses were partly emptied by the exchange (“a sole victim”) itself. Read more: Bitfinex could be ‘sole victim’ of 2016 hack, US government says The platform cut every deposit by 36.06% and compensated it with some amounts of BFX tokens or Right to Recovery Tokens issued by the parent company iFinex. These tokens could be redeemed for cash or converted into iFinex equity. The ethical questions behind cutting the clients’ deposits by a third aside, the compensation was hardly just even in 2016, considering that the hack caused a substantial BTC price drop. Nevertheless, the latest ruling leaves a window of opportunity for the affected Bitfinex clients, as they can claim the portions of the restitution individually until January 28. According to the judge, neither the exchange nor its users fit the victim criteria; however, thanks to plea agreements, voluntary restitution became possible. The people behind the hack and money laundering People behind the plea are Ilya Lichtenstein and his wife Heather Morgan, a man who made a bigger-than-life crypto hack, and his wife with whom they tried to launder the money. The press dubbed them “Bitcoin Bonnie and Clyde.” In contrast to the real-life Bonnie and Clyde, Lichtenstein and Morgan turned out to be far more interesting and entertaining than the legendary crime couple of the 1930s, immortalized in pop culture. While Lichtenstein was a low-key IT entrepreneur and didn’t catch the public eye, Morgan was writing for Inc. and Forbes, but most famously following the arrest, she became a “weirder-than-Bjork” rapper under the Razzlekhan moniker. She dropped her latest video on January 10, 2025, and it really adds a nice portion of surrealism to an entire situation. However, we cannot underestimate Lichtenstein’s enigma as well as the smart methods of hacking Bitfinex and ways to launder the money stolen from the exchange. Lichtenstein and Morgan’s actions became the subject of a Netflix documentary series, which is currently in the works. Lichtenstein and Morgan admitted their involvement in money laundering, while Lichtenstein alone pleaded to hacking Bitfinex. He got a 5-year sentence, while his wife is facing 3 years in jail. On Dec. 19, 2024, the prison video of Lichtenstein apologizing for the hack and regretting his past deeds was posted on his X account. In the video, Ilya took 100% responsibility for the heist and said his wife didn’t know about the hack. He said he was willing to return all the stolen money. I have something to say #FreeRazzlekhan pic.twitter.com/9HIvOxcbgr — Ilya Lichtenstein (@unrealdutch) December 19, 2024 Lichtenstein and Morgan admitted their involvement in money laundering while Lichtenstein alone pleaded to hacking Bitfinex.

There are several ways to look at the situation and decide whether the ruling was a victory or a failure for the crypto community. Those who believe that the U.S. should not sell any bitcoins cannot applaud this ruling as, according to it, the money held by the DOJ will be sent to a company headquartered in Taiwan and the British Virgin Islands. However, if the government chooses to accumulate one million bitcoins, 94,643 bitcoins will not be critical damage on the way to this goal. Not good news anyway. Should be returned in kind to the users as well since they all took a haircut due to this hack. — Mike (@immortalbitcoin) January 15, 2025 Those who believe that the stolen funds should be returned to the affected clients barely see the ruling as justified. The time frame set to claim a partition of the restitution (until January 28) seems to be tough. All in all, it’s good to have an opportunity. And, finally, those who prefer Bitfinex having these coins over the DOJ can celebrate as the coins will be released from the government back to Bitfinex and the affected party will get most of what they had on their balance. The money is likely to hit the market again. Hopefully, it will improve the opportunities for exchange in the recovery of clients’ funds.

XRP: The Borderless Coin Aiming to Revolutionize Digital Payments XRP is a cryptocurrency designed to make money move as fast as information. It runs on the XRP Ledger, a decentralized system without a central authority. Transactions are quick, low-cost, and secure. With XRP, you don’t need a bank account to send or receive funds. It’s open to everyone, borderless, and resists censorship or counterfeiting. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP started with 100 billion coins. They gave 80 billion to Ripple, a company working to improve the network and support the ecosystem. Ripple uses XRP to boost liquidity and help with currency exchanges. To control the supply, they’ve placed 55 billion XRP in escrow, releasing it slowly over time. The name XRP comes from “ripple credits,” showing its goal to make payments flow smoothly across different currencies. In the current market, XRP stands out for its speed and low transaction fees. Compared to other coins, it offers practical solutions for global payments. As digital transactions grow, XRP’s technology could make it an attractive option for those looking for efficient and affordable transfers. Conclusion In the current bull run, coins like XRP perform well, but XYZVerse’s unique sports-memecoin fusion positions it for remarkable growth and potential to outshine others.

Nevertheless, meme coins remain highly volatile and risky assets, and investors should be wary before allocating funds to them. The president-elect shook the entire crypto market on Friday night when he announced the launch of the OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP) meme coin and invited his millions of followers and supporters to join his community. Despite the controversial launch and fears about a potential hack or a scam, the token became an overnight sensation. Its price is now worth $40, while its market capitalization has soared past $8 billion, making it the third-largest meme coin, sitting behind only DOGE and SHIB. With this remarkable rise in value within mere hours, the number of success stories for traders who got in early (possibly insiders) and have already sold some portions to capture massive profits has gone through the roof. Turned $1.1M into $70M in just 4 hours—incredible! This trader has sold 1.35M $TRUMP for $3.65M, and still holds 4.62M $TRUMP ($67.5M), bringing his total profit to over $70M! https://t.co/m1k6zmKgLA pic.twitter.com/U3IeU23PER — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 18, 2025 After the initial buying spree, more information emerged later from Lookonchain about deposits to large exchanges, such as OKX, where the same traders most likely capitalized on the price rally by selling off their tokens. Whale “Fpj236…uVJr” deposited all 1.27M $TRUMP ($43.9M) into #OKX an hour ago, with a profit of $29.6M! https://t.co/RN5fXx11CW pic.twitter.com/4HyHZSHgou — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 19, 2025 One of the more famous traders, which Lookonchain called ‘legendary,’ made $6.8 million on the TRUMP token within a day after securing a $12.5 million profit from BOME last year. OFFICIAL TRUMP’s launch was a highly successful and impressive story. However, not all meme coins have the same spectacular path. There are thousands of such tokens released on a daily basis, and most turn into quick rug pulls, leaving investors with empty hands. As such, traders should be wary when dealing with meme coins, even if they are launched by the upcoming US president.

This surge in stablecoin issuance highlights the growing activity within the ecosystem and the increasing adoption of the XRP Ledger for financial applications, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi). JUST IN Total 7,876,559 #RLUSD Minted In Last 24 Hours #XRP Ledger pic.twitter.com/Y8V1VdYqpA — XRP CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) January 17, 2025 RLUSD, a stablecoin issued on the XRP Ledger, is gaining traction as a reliable asset for transactions and settlements. The latest data from the XRP Ledger showcases multiple high-value transactions involving RLUSD, such as a 690,000 RLUSD transfer and another for 2,008,333 RLUSD. These transactions emphasize the scalability and efficiency of the ledger in handling large volumes of digital assets with minimal transaction costs. For example, fees for these transfers were as low as 0.000135 XRP, further reinforcing the utility of the XRP Ledger as a cost-effective platform. The rapid minting of RLUSD aligns with the broader adoption of stablecoins in the cryptocurrency industry. Stablecoins like RLUSD are crucial for mitigating volatility in digital asset markets, providing users with a stable value tied to fiat currencies while leveraging the transparency and speed of blockchain technology. With RLUSD gaining momentum, the XRP Ledger is solidifying its position as a preferred platform for stablecoin issuance and DeFi applications. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Growing Optimism Surrounding XRP ETFs Amid this surge in RLUSD activity, anticipation is also growing around an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval. During an interview with Bloomberg, Ripple President Monica Long recently expressed confidence about the prospects of an XRP ETF . She highlighted the improving regulatory landscape in the United States, creating favorable conditions for cryptocurrency-based financial products. The push for an XRP ETF gained traction in October 2024 when Bitwise became the first asset manager to file an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This move was soon followed by filings from other major institutions, including Canary Capital and 21Shares, signaling strong institutional interest in XRP as an investment vehicle. An XRP ETF, if approved, is expected to drive further adoption by providing institutional and retail investors with regulated exposure to XRP. Market analysts believe such a product could catalyze mainstream acceptance of XRP and its associated technologies, such as the XRP Ledger. As RLUSD continues to gain momentum and institutional interest in XRP grows, the ecosystem appears poised for significant growth. Whether through stablecoin adoption or the introduction of ETFs, the XRP Ledger is solidifying its role as a foundational platform for blockchain-based financial solutions.

Related Reading: Chainlink Weekly Chart Looks Promising – If Bulls Reclaim $30 ‘ATH Are Next’ Chainlink Faces Potential Correction In a recent X post, More Crypto Online shared a cautious technical analysis of the LINK market. Using the Elliott Wave Theory, these analysts have determined Chainlink must stay above $23.85 to preserve its current bullish trend. For context, the Elliott Wave Theory is a trading tool used by traders to predict market breeds based on crowd psychology and market cycles. In price prediction, the Elliott Wave Theory can often present a white scenario i.e. the optimistic bullish case and the yellow wave i.e. an alternative case most likely a correction before an uptrend continues. For the LINK market, the white scenario assumes upward movement will continue provided the asset stays over $23.85 which represents a critical support zone. Any price fall below $23.85 could cause a shift in market dynamics, potentially halting Chainlink’s bullish charge. However, there is also potential for a corrective yellow wave. In this context, this yellow wave follows as an initial upward movement and represents only a temporary pullback before the trend resumes its bullish trajectory. According to the analysts at More Crypto Online, if LINK dips below $23.85, the corrective wave is expected to occur between $19.26 and $22.39, converting this region to a potential retracement zone for further gains.

In other news, certain crypto analysts are highly bullish on LINK amidst the asset’s price rally. In an X post, market pundit AMCrypto has backed Chainlink to experience massive price gains in February. According to AMCrypto, LINK is currently still in consolidation despite recent gains. The analyst predicts the cryptocurrency will experience more weeks of range-bound movement below $30, before executing a major price breakout in February. Based on AMCrypto’s forecast, Chainlink is expected to trade as high as $54 in this projected price surge indicating a potential 125.37% gain on the coin’s current market price. At the time of writing, LINK trades at $23.95 following a 2.75% decline in the past day. On the other hand, the tokens’ trading volume valued at $957.45 million reflects a 13.97% gain in the past day. With a market cap of $23.94 billion, Chainlink continues to rank as the 12th largest cryptocurrency in the world.

The BTC price dropped to around $90,000 earlier this month before reclaiming $100,000 on Thursday. Since then, the prices have continued to surge, hitting a high of $105,900 on Friday. Trump’s new meme token has stirred the Bitcoin and overall crypto community On Friday, Trump launched his new meme token, sending shockwaves through the world of Bitcoin and crypto. Crypto investor and Youtuber Anthony Pompliano even asked investors to “buckle up,” saying financial markets were not prepared for what was to come. At the time, the meme token’s market cap was close to hitting $8 billion , but it has now climbed to nearly $9 billion. Moreover, CNBC crypto trader and founder of Crypto Banter Ran Neuner remarked: “The Trump meme coin is real. This is just a taste of what we can expect for the next four years!” You’re not bullish enough.” ~ Ran Neuner Most analysts and traders are bracing for continued volatility across crypto markets. Nonetheless, Trump’s promotion of his new meme coin has sent an optimistic message that he intends to fulfill his crypto promises, fueling analysts’ expectations. On Friday afternoon, Bitcoin was already trading at $104,800 before surging to $105,900 later in the day. Bitcoin is trading at $105,283, a 0.83% rise in the last 24 hours. Its 24-hour trading volume is at $50.24 billion. News on possible crypto orders has also helped to push BTC prices up Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to issue over 100 executive orders immediately after his inauguration. Some have hinted that some of the executive orders will be related to Bitcoin or crypto, rallying high price expectations once he enters office. According to sources familiar with the matter, analysts should expect at least one crypto executive order for the first 100 days of Trump’s term. Furthermore, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.9% in the 12 months through December. According to traders, this makes another Fed rate cut seem more likely, which could make Bitcoin more attractive. As we await a new presidency, the collective insights from many analysts paint a diverse picture of Bitcoin’s potential trajectory. While some predict stability or modest gains, reflecting a tempered optimism, others anticipate more pronounced fluctuations driven by investor sentiment and political climate changes.

The asset has now received backing from two of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges amid its mindblowing rally and spectacular trading volumes. Binance, Coinbase Join the Pack It’s not every day that you see the release of a meme coin by a former and upcoming US president. But we do live in wild times, and that’s what happened on Friday evening when the president-elect, who will return to office on January 20, announced the launch of such a token dubbed Official Trump. Within a day or so, the asset exploded in value and is currently the 23rd-largest, according to CoinGecko, and 21st-biggest on CoinMarketCap. Despite the discrepancies, both platforms agree that its price is well above $43, and its market cap is somewhere around $9 billion, creating numerous success stories in the meantime. Moreover, the trading volumes went through the roof (over $11 billion within a 24-hour period). This has turned many leading exchanges toward the TRUMP token. Binance and Coinbase were the latest (and among the biggest) to join the craze. The largest US-based crypto exchange said it had added TRUMP to its roadmap, which typically means that it will be listed for trading soon. Binance noted that trading for TRUMP will begin on January 19 at 8:30 UTC, and the first pairs will be against the two biggest stablecoins, USDC and USDT. Withdrawals will be available from January 20 at the same time. Above PEPE After speculating yesterday whether TRUMP can become the largest meme coin by market cap, the asset, which was in fourth place at that time, has climbed a spot and is now above PEPE. The frog-based meme token peaked at around $0.000021 yesterday, but when the TRUMP mania went wild, it started to lose value rapidly. It now sits below $0.000018, down by 15% within a day. Its market cap has dropped to $7.5 billion on CG, well below TRUMP’s $9 billion. Next on Official Trump’s path toward the number one spot is Shiba Inu, which is also down daily. Its market cap stands close to $13 billion, which seems doable given the massive rally that transpired since TRUMP’s launch.

It’s like Ronaldo’s passes — unstoppable. It’s the crushing power of Tyson’s punches — leaving competitors dazed. It’s McGregor’s precision — hitting the target with knockout profits. XYZVerse is in the ring, and its target is no less than 999X growth. Whoosh, and 10 stages of the presale already passed. Hefty $5 million already raised. From $0.0001 to $0.002. Those who missed buying XYZ in the first stage must be really sorry. The current presale is just a heat-up.

The biggest luck that people might have as crypto lovers is getting into a high-potential project that is still in its presale phase. By the way, the presale for XYZ is in full swing now. Out of 15 total stages, 9 have already sold out, showing strong momentum as the token approaches its Token Generation Event (TGE). Here’s how the numbers stack up right now: $0.002 – Current price per token $0.0025 – Price at the next stage (+25% increase) $0.1 – Price at the final presale stage (+5,000% increase) $5 million – Raised so far, with excitement building daily The biggest advantage of joining a presale is getting in at a steep discount. Early adopters who jumped in at Stage 1 bought XYZ at just $0.0001 — a whopping 99.9% discount compared to the final stage price. The golden rule of presales is simple: the earlier someone invests, the bigger their potential rewards. As the token gains exposure and demand increases, so does its value.

Musk Kills Bears (MUSKBEAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBEAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Kills Bears can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Kills Bears could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Kills Bears launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Kills Bears on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Kills Bears by entering its contract address – 9yoxPCyAdEVRfAtkztzC7yKuhy7vEEEjXm3Ym8ajJEww – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBEAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|SOL|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-19 07:48:40

The event also highlighted the importance of liquid staking on Solana while empowering holders to influence platform governance.

The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the JITO price from an immediate surge. However, if the JITO price successfully breaks above $3.472, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $4.32. If bulls cannot initiate a surge, JITO price may drop below the immediate support line at $3.122, resulting in a correction to $2.752. Is Jito a good investment? For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network’s largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2024 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Why is the JTO price down today? JTO’s price lost its momentum around $3.5, resulting in a minor correction. Buyers are currently defending a drop below $3. Will JTO’s price recover? If JTO’s price faces buying demand around the current price level, we might see a strong rebound and JTO might surge toward $4. Will JTO reach $10? JTO price might reach the $10 mark in 2025 if buying demand surges and Jito attracts altcoin investors. However, our JTO price prediction states it might reach the $10 level by 2026. Will JTO price reach $100? Due to the effort of the Solana community, JITO Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is currently no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment. Recent news/opinion on JTO news Solana staking pool Jito clocked monthly revenue from priority fees and tips of more than $100 million in November and December, according to a Dec. 26 note from Kairos Research, a cryptocurrency researcher. Jito price prediction January 2025 Over the last few days, JTO coin prices have aimed to surge above crucial Fib levels. If the BTC price aims for a hold above $100K this month, we might see a solid surge in the JTO price.

Burniske tells his 317,600 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) four-year cycle may witness an abrupt end with the installment of a pro-crypto US government. BTC’s four-year cycle is based on halving events when Bitcoin miner rewards are slashed in half every four years. In the past, halvings have correlated with parabolic rallies for Bitcoin as the reduction in new BTC emissions created an imbalance between supply and demand. Says Burniske, “Continue to believe there are high odds we break the simplistic four-year cycle that BTC has honored the last ~12 years… With a supportive US administration, crypto could be entering a Goldilocks period over the next many years, where returns aren’t as parabolic, but instead we see steadier growth, not to mention majors stop suffering 85-95% drawdowns.” In investing, a Goldilocks scenario is when an asset class sees moderate and sustainable growth over a long period of time. Burniske also predicts market meltdowns that crypto investors have been accustomed to will likely be in the rearview mirror once digital assets enter Goldilocks territory. He believes that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will support the steady rise of crypto assets while minimizing market drawdowns. “On drawdowns: I’m not saying they’ll stop, I’m saying it’s possible they get less extreme for the majors, which could whiplash people who overtrade with too much aggression… I also think BTC and ETH both having ETFs, and perhaps SOL+ soon, will provide more consistent buying pressure for these assets.” While the investor believes in steady growth for large-cap coins, he notes that digital assets could still witness gut-wrenching corrections but they likely won’t be as severe as the ones seen in the past. “If you ever want to see the percentage drawdown BTC could be exposed to, look at the 200-week SMA (simple moving average), which has been our most reliable technical support each bearish period. Right now at ~$40,000 that suggests a 60% drawdown is possible, which is a far cry from 80%+ (has to drop another 50% from 60% down, to hit 80% down). As BTC rises, so too will the 200-week SMA.” Burniske concludes by saying that 2025 will likely be a “great year” for crypto investors.

XRP Army Reacts",https://timestabloid.com/top-pundit-says-if-you-bought-xrp-under-1-you-are-a-legend-xrp-army-reacts/,"XRP, one of the most discussed digital assets in the crypto industry, has seen a dramatic price increase over recent months. This upward trajectory has sparked notable commentary from prominent figures in the crypto community, including XRP Queen, who recently highlighted the significance of purchasing XRP under $1. Her statement, “If you bought #XRP under $1 you are a LEGEND,” resonated widely, prompting mixed reactions. An X user, Jim Schwarzbauer, remarked , “Didn’t feel like a legend for the past couple of years,” reflecting the frustration many investors faced during XRP’s prolonged price stagnation. Another user, C.S. Webb, echoed the sentiment. However, recent data suggest that patience has rewarded investors, with XRP currently trading at $3.16, according to CoinMarketCap. Despite a minor 1% dip over the past 24 hours, XRP has seen a 27% surge in the last seven days, showcasing its resilience and potential. Historical Perspective and Current Trends In November 2024, XRP was priced at around $0.55. This marked a low point before a significant rally that pushed the price to as high as $3.39 on January 16, 2025—a multi-year high. This represents a staggering increase exceeding 450% within a short period. Such growth has positioned XRP as a standout performer in the crypto market, cementing its appeal among investors. Edoardo Farina, CEO of Alpha Lions Academy and an ardent supporter of XRP, has been consistently advocating for accumulation. In November 2024, Farina advised investors to secure at least 3,000 XRP , which required an investment of approximately $1,650. Today, the same quantity is valued at $10,170, underscoring the exponential growth in XRP’s price. Farina recently highlighted that the rising cost of XRP has made it increasingly challenging for the average investor to acquire substantial holdings, noting that “most people don’t have that in savings.” Implications for Investors XRP’s rise reflects broader trends in the cryptocurrency market, including renewed institutional interest and growing use cases for blockchain technology. Its performance is particularly notable given its historical challenges, including regulatory scrutiny in the United States. The token’s ability to surpass significant price milestones underscores its potential as a long-term investment asset. While the current price of XRP represents a substantial appreciation for early investors, market dynamics remain fluid. Investors must weigh the opportunities against the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies. For those who acquired XRP under $1, the gains reaffirm the value of patience and strategic accumulation in volatile markets.

Nachi revealed in a recent post that the TRUMP token has shaken up his portfolio but believes it signals a massive shift in the crypto market. “All the coins in my portfolio were attacked by TRUMP, but only one coin skyrocketed,” Nachi said. “It doesn’t matter if you missed the TRUMP trade, I missed it too, but now there is a simpler and more obvious opportunity.” The trader claimed that Trump’s support positions Solana as the “American blockchain,” a move that further undermines Ethereum’s dominance. “Trump is basically telling us that Solana is the ‘American blockchain,’ which he fully supports, and it’s putting another nail in Ethereum’s coffin,” he said. Related News: Donald Trump's Wealth Surged After Memecoin Launch - Here is Trump's Last Personal Wealth According to Nachi, this support is a potential catalyst for Solana to surpass Ethereum (ETH) in market cap. Nachi predicts that more high-profile names will launch memecoins on Solana, further increasing its momentum. “I always believed that SOL would surpass ETH; it just needed a big catalyst, and now that catalyst has finally arrived,” he added. The trader also claimed that many Ethereum maximalists are reallocating their assets to Solana due to the changing market dynamics. “There has already been a huge wealth effect. Many Ethereum maximalists I know have had to sell ETH to buy SOL,” he said. Looking ahead, Nachi suggested that Solana could double its current price and potentially reach $500 per token. “Even if it takes time, it shouldn’t be difficult for SOL to double to $500,” he said. “Today will be remembered as a significant victory for the Solana community and one of the darkest days for the Ethereum community,” Nachi concluded. *This is not investment advice.

Such a move would be a bold step for any government, pushing government blockchain policy into uncharted territory. Some in the crypto world hope that new leadership will embrace altcoins more openly, possibly creating a strategic stockpile of multiple digital assets. Yet the big question is which tokens might make the cut and whether this reserve could also open the door for Remittix (RTX) . Solana (SOL) in the Spotlight Among the tokens rumored for inclusion, Solana (SOL) stands out for its fast transactions and robust ecosystem. Developers flock to Solana for its ability to handle high traffic with minimal congestion, which has spawned successful DeFi and NFT projects. If Washington’s government blockchain policy leans toward tokens that can scale effectively, Solana could easily become a prime candidate for adoption. After all, the U.S. might see the advantage of a lightning fast network as part of a national crypto reserve. Notably, whales who love Solana (SOL) are also showing interest in other promising projects like Remittix (RTX) , hinting that these tokens could gain traction at the federal level. XRP’s Edge in Cross-Border Payments No conversation about a national crypto reserve would be complete without mentioning XRP . This token has long been favored for cross border transfers due to its low fees and rapid settlement times. Many believe that a future U.S. policy might single out XRP for its potential to streamline domestic and international transactions. While legal uncertainties once clouded its future, recent developments have improved XRP ’s reputation. If American officials decide to stockpile altcoins, XRP could be near the top of the list especially if they plan to create a user-friendly payment hub for government agencies and beyond. Remittix (RTX): The Dark Horse Then there’s Remittix (RTX) , a rising altcoin focused on simplifying cross-border remittances. By letting users convert multiple cryptos into fiat and send money directly to bank accounts, Remittix (RTX) solves real-world problems in a straightforward way. Many see it as a hidden gem that could benefit enormously if the U.S. endorses altcoins for official use. If the rumored reserve aims to incorporate tokens that bridge crypto and everyday finance, Remittix (RTX) might catch policymakers’ attention. Whales already love Remittix (RTX) for its locked liquidity and transparent fee system, which might align well with stricter government oversight. Government Blockchain Policy Realities While talk of a broad-based national crypto reserve is exciting, skeptics caution it might be more political hype than an actionable plan. Setting up a brand new framework for altcoins would involve significant regulatory hurdles and community buy-in. Yet the debate alone shows how far government blockchain policy has progressed. Not long ago, the idea of any government holding crypto, let alone altcoins like Solana or Remittix (RTX) , seemed unthinkable. Today, some leaders see digital assets as a strategic resource the U.S. could leverage for technological and financial advantages. Conclusion Whether or not we’ll see a Trump administration unveiling a national crypto reserve with Solana (SOL) , XRP and Remittix (RTX) remains uncertain. Much will depend on how policymakers weigh the risks of volatility against the benefits of technological leadership. For now, the mere possibility has stirred conversation across the crypto landscape. Enthusiasts of Solana , fans of XRP and backers of Remittix (RTX) watch closely, hoping their favorite token might land in Uncle Sam’s digital wallet. Regardless of how it plays out, the buzz highlights the growing impact of altcoins in shaping the future of finance.

Dan Novaes, co-founder of the loyalty platform EARN’M, highlighted this trend in a recent interview , describing it as a natural progression for a maturing industry. Novaes identified over-tokenization as a significant challenge, particularly for utility-based altcoins. “Altcoins have generally been the worst performing sector of newly launched coins,” he noted, pointing to the diminishing speculative appeal of altcoins in favor of memecoins and emerging trends. The EARN’M executive likened this consolidation to the early days of mobile app development, where overcrowding led to the survival of the most adaptable platforms. This consolidation phase is further bolstered by the incoming Trump administration’s pro-crypto stance . With deregulation and a cabinet supportive of blockchain innovation, the stage is set for a surge in mergers and acquisitions among startups and established players. A Shift Towards Consolidation As the crypto market grapples with saturation, many projects are opting to merge rather than compete. Novaes emphasized that this trend is not a sign of decline but rather an indication of a more mature and sustainable ecosystem. The shift comes at a time when speculative investments in altcoins have been overshadowed by high-profile memecoins and other viral narratives, leaving many utility-based projects struggling to maintain relevance. The parallels drawn between crypto and early mobile app markets suggest that the current phase of consolidation will streamline offerings, making the industry more efficient and accessible. Major Acquisitions Signal Maturing Crypto Market Already, the wave of acquisitions is underway. Leading fiat-to-crypto onramp company MoonPay recently acquired Helio , a crypto payment processor, for $175 million. This deal aims to simplify transactions for merchants and expand MoonPay’s service offerings. Similarly, blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis announced its $150 million acquisition of fraud prevention company Alterya. Alterya’s AI-driven fraud detection technology, which identified over $10 billion in scams last year, will bolster Chainalysis’ capabilities in combating rising crypto-related fraud. Even larger players are drawing interest. Crypto options exchange Deribit, reportedly valued at $5 billion , has attracted several buyout offers. While no sale is currently in progress, the interest underscores the appetite for strategic acquisitions in this rapidly evolving market.

The attached chart reveals XRP’s trading volume at $1.77 billion, accounting for 28.02% of Coinbase’s spot trading activity. By comparison, Bitcoin recorded $1.18 billion in volume, representing 18.64%, while Ethereum’s trading volume stood at $424 million, or 6.71%. Hedera and Tether followed with $373 million (5.91%) and $354 million (5.61%), respectively. This surge in XRP’s activity underscores its growing traction within the crypto market. BREAKING: #XRP dominates the spot trading volume on Coinbase! pic.twitter.com/h1YKx2eMg4 — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) January 17, 2025 An X (formerly Twitter) user, LYMPID, commented on the development, suggesting that the rise in XRP’s dominance reflects improving market sentiment and regulatory clarity. They wrote, “This is what happens when regulatory uncertainty starts clearing up. With potential ETF approvals , XRP’s role in cross-border payments, and the growing push for RWA settlements, we might be seeing the early stages of a supply crunch.” Market Dynamics and Regulatory Developments The increased trading volume comes at a pivotal period for XRP and the broader cryptocurrency market. Following its partial legal victory against the SEC in 2023, XRP has regained momentum as regulatory uncertainties gradually dissipate. Market participants closely monitor the potential approval of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which could further enhance liquidity and mainstream adoption. Additionally, XRP continues to play a critical role in cross-border payments, leveraging its efficiency and speed compared to traditional systems. Its integration into real-world asset (RWA) settlements is also gaining attention as blockchain-based solutions become viable for financial institutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Price Performance According to data from CoinMarketCap, XRP is currently trading at $3.20. Despite experiencing a slight price decline of 0.5% over the last 24 hours, the asset has surged by 28% over the past week. This growth indicates robust demand and aligns with the heightened trading activity observed on Coinbase. Market analysts suggest that the increased volume and price movements could signal a potential supply crunch for XRP. As institutional interest grows and retail investors seek exposure to assets with utility-driven value, XRP’s market dynamics may experience further shifts. XRP’s Regulatory Clarity XRP’s dominance on Coinbase highlights the evolving preferences of crypto investors. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have traditionally led trading activity, the recent focus on utility-based tokens like XRP underscores the market’s maturation. As regulatory clarity improves and institutional adoption accelerates, assets with tangible use cases may continue to gain prominence. The recent surge in XRP’s trading volume reflects a combination of factors, including improved market sentiment, regulatory progress, and growing adoption for practical applications. Whether this trend continues will depend on broader market developments, including ETF approvals and advancements in blockchain-based payment systems.

Multiple large-cap tokens based on Solana surged higher Saturday, and the blockchain’s native SOL token set fresh highs above $275 as the incoming U.S. president backed a new Solana-based TRUMP token Friday night, calling it his “official” memecoin. The choice of Solana as an issuance network bumped demand and sentiment for SOL tokens, as CoinDesk reported Saturday. SOL trading volumes have rocketed from Thursday’s $3 billion to over $26 billion in the past 24 hours, with Saturday’s moves bringing weekly gains to over 46%. That’s a nearly 3,000% surge since three-year lows of $9 in December 2022 following the implosion of crypto exchange FTX and prominent backer Sam Bankman-Fried, which dented sentiment for Solana at the time. Trump’s official memecoin was issued in late U.S. hours Friday on the Solana blockchain by a team including ecosystem giants Jupiter and Meteora. Prices of Jupiter’s JUP tokens are up 30% in the past 24 hours. The token launch was co-ordinated by CIC Digital LLC - an affiliate of the Trump Organization, and the newly-formed company Fight Fight Fight LLC, per BBC . The duo holds 80% of the tokens, subject to a vesting period of over three years, and it is unclear how much money Trump might make from the venture. TRUMP prices rocketed from a few cents to $14 in less than six hours amid widespread confusion on whether the token was actually backed by Trump or if someone had hacked Trump’s account and issued a fake token. It trades above $44 in Asian afternoon hours Sunday, grabbing listings on prominent exchanges Coinbase and Binance, as well as several futures products. It has become the third-largest memecoin by market capitalization behind dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB), flipping pepecoin (PEPE).",Markets,EN,0,0,SOL|MARKET|SHIB|EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-19 08:55:48

If the trend of 2025 is any indication, Rexas Finance , Ripple, Aptos, Bonk, and Cardano are set to be the best investments. These coins have significant room for growth and development, making them the right assets for informed investors. Rexas Finance (RXS): Changing the Meaning of Asset Ownership Rexas Finance is actively monopolizing the world of asset ownership through its tokens. The concept of owning a fraction of real-world assets, such as real estate and physical commodities, raised the bar, with $37 million in the presale and over 404 million tokens already sold. During the current stage 11, RXS is offered at $0.175, making this engaging concept appealing. With a CertiK audit assuring investors of its viability and its presence on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko amplifying its popularity, RXS has gained traction with both whales and retail investors in mere weeks. Combined with promotion via giveaways, this strong use case highlights RXS's immense potential for further growth. The value of RXS over the long term helps serve as a building block for creating a well-rounded portfolio. Ripple (XRP): Optimism Predominates with RLUSD and Hiring Surge In 2025, Ripple achieved impressive global recognition as its RLUSD stablecoin increased adoption by 2,000%, providing it with an edge in implementing blockchain-based financial solutions. Ripple currently holds a market cap of $136.25 billion and is trading at $2.37. It is also experiencing hiring events resulting from a 10% rise due to the ""Trump effect."" The embedding of Ripple’s coin into Bank of America's internal transaction liquidity and the 83 patents owned by this firm’s ongoing ecosystem demonstrate Ripple’s increasing use case as part of global payments in the future. Recently, these international market updates were featured or confirmed by the CEO of Sound Planning on Fox Business, further increasing trust in the market. Market analysts forecast that Ripple will continue trending, making it a target for investors seeking security and growth in their portfolios. Aptos (APT): Aiming at 80% Increase The formation of a falling wedge pattern has caused APT to slide down in recent months, but the coin has started trading at $9.72, bringing its $5.43 billion market cap back after the fall. The bullish momentum seems to rise after breaking past the ascending trendline. Analysts have pegged the anticipated surge at 80% from the current valuation. The Aptos Foundation is conducting its monthly scheduled unlocking of APT, allowing around 11.31 million coins to be distributed to core contributors, the community, investors, and the foundation, similar to previous coin releases. These unlocks occur at specific intervals through September 2032, ensuring an influx of coins and continuous growth while being distributed seamlessly within the ecosystem. Though the Aptos network is said to have stablecoins valued at $646 million, an amalgamation of Aries Markets, Echo Protocol, Thala, and Echelon Market has led the coin to accrue a total locked value of $1.07 billion. Given the strong fundamentals and consistent growth surrounding Aptos, long-term investments show promising gains based on current trends. Bonk (BONK): Breaking the Meme Coin Giants BONK, trading at $0.00003107 with a market cap of $2.37 billion, is one of the meme coins likely to become a significant rival in this field. Analysts predict it may rise by approximately 45% in the next few months, surpassing competitors such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe. BONK's distinctive branding and close ties to the Solana ecosystem make it unique. It has attracted whales' attention, leading to high price volatility and making it appealing to both retail and professional investors. For risk-takers looking to profit from meme coin mania while diversifying their portfolios, BONK offers an opportunity for extremely high returns. Cardano (ADA): $10 Is Within Reach Cardano is priced at $1.01, with a market cap of $35.67 billion, making it a perfect example of resilience and potential for long-term growth. Within a day, whales bought 100 million ADA tokens, indicating strong confidence in the market. Cardano is one of the best blockchain networks for facilitating smart contracts and DApp adoption, which has been its major driver. Market analysts suggest that ADA may reach $10 during this cycle, making it more pronounced among the top cryptocurrencies. Cardano’s reliability and innovation, evidenced by its ability to attract significant investments, make it a solid part of any diversified cryptocurrency portfolio. Conclusion: The Right Coins for Building Wealth Rexas Finance , Ripple, Aptos, Bonk, and Cardano combine innovation with stability and high growth rates to grow wealth and succeed in crypto investing. RXS provides opportunities for asset tokenization, while Ripple leads in global payments through blockchain technology. Additionally, Aptos and Cardano have strong ecosystems and bullish market indicators, while Bonk excites with its link to meme coin momentum. Strategically investing in these tokens positions you to benefit from future lucrative changes. These five coins fit whether you seek a consistent increase in your portfolio or an exponential rise.

According to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the sandbox will likely be launched around October and will be located in Phuket. According to Shinawatra, the move will be a turning point for the country, noting how well they have thrived regarding the crypto industry. Shinawatra also thinks that Thailand is well equipped compared to other regions, as they continue to move ahead in the crypto industry. He noted that the crypto industry has been boosted by the decision of the United States President-elect Donald Trump to push for it. Bitcoin and other assets saw a rally as Trump, who made so many promises to the sector during his campaign, won against Kamala Harris in a hard-fought battle. Thailand wants to pursue crypto industry growth In a discussion about the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region’s economy, Shinawatra noted that most countries in the region have been holding extensive talks with Thailand. He noted that since Thailand have been able to make a commendable feat regarding the crypto industry, it has presented an opportunity to inject money into the economic system. In addition, he said that discussions on this subject are underway, hopeful that it will come to a fruitful end. Shinawatra also mentioned that cryptocurrencies should be leveraged quickly, as a delay might lead to the best minds moving to a better-suited environment like the United States. He added that digital assets are a new form of digital currency, which should not be confused with gambling. Stablecoins, the least volatile assets, are usually backed by other assets like gold or government bonds. He highlighted that stablecoins carry less risk than others. He mentioned that the country will not adopt digital assets that present high risks, adding that a sandbox is expected to be launched in October. In addition, the sandbox will include the private sector, as it presents a way to rub minds on the subject. Crypto sandbox to encourage tourists to use crypto Shinawatra discussed the crypto sandbox idea at a recent Pheu Thai party seminar. He is currently the de facto leader of the party, which currently houses the majority ruling members in the country. In the seminar, Shinawatra introduced the idea of using Phuket as the location for the sandbox. According to the former Prime Minister, housing the sandbox in Phuket will encourage tourists holding digital assets to spend it in the country. The idea was accepted by attendees, with Gulf Binance Chief Executive Nirun Fuwattananukul hailing the project. Fuwattananukul added that the project will boost Thailand’s competitiveness and attractiveness to tech-savvy tourists and visitors. He also added that the sandbox approach will be a win for both regulators and the residents. Fuwattananukul noted that it will provide a controlled environment as regulators will have a hands-on approach to monitoring activities, while businesses and individuals will gain benefits and practical experience. Thailand has endured a mixed relationship with cryptocurrencies, with the Thailand Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announcing updated crypto-friendly regulations for the sector in 2022 after an outright ban on payments in 2022. The agency highlighted financial security as its reason, noting that trading and investing in the assets were still permitted. With the country aiming to push for a crypto sandbox, the law banning payments via crypto may likely be revisited, but under stricter guidelines. Thailand SEC may also come up with a regulatory framework to monitor this aspect, making sure that individuals and entities comply with the regulations. Stricter penalties may also be enforced, which could be in terms of fines, jail terms, or both as seen in other places globally.

Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) edges closer to $3.5 million raised during its presale, with a unique value proposition and a growing reputation in the PayFi space. Designed to revolutionize the $190 trillion cross-border payments industry, Remittix is gaining attention from investors worldwide. So how low could Ethereum drop now, and how will Remittix perform in the next quarter? Ethereum Posts 11% Loss in Last 30 Days Ethereum (ETH) has almost been teasing its holders as it looked like it might surpass $3,500, a significant psychological threshold, before hurtling downwards. Ethereum (ETH) started trending upwards on the 13th January and though it briefly peaked at $3,507on the 17th, Ethereum (ETH) immediately began to drop, and now finds itself 3.71% down overnight. Ethereum continues to focus resolutely on developing an environmentally friendly blockchain, though it’s possible this focus has taken away from Ethereum fleshing out other parts of its ecosystem. Where Ethereum is likely to end up in 2025 remains to be seen, but its trajectory is now a downward one.

Privacy and Security at the Core Privacy and security are integral to the Remittix platform. Transactions processed via Remittix arrive as standard bank transfers, ensuring recipients have no indication that cryptocurrency was involved.

Advancing Financial Inclusion Remittix also aims to promote global financial inclusion. Critically, this 24/7 platform is accessible to underserved populations without traditional banking infrastructure. Part of Remittix’s mission is to open up access to global commerce for individuals living in these areas of the world, facilitating smooth global trade while reducing financial inequality. Remittix Surpasses $3.5 Million in Presale With the Remittix presale underway, RTX tokens are selling fast. These powerful tokens have several functions within the ecosystem but also give investors a share in Remittix’s future. Now available for $0.0217 in the presale , RTX tokens have already attracted significant interest, with over $3.5 million raised. The project’s value proposition within a high-value sector has prompted analysts to forecast a steep 800% price surge by the presale’s conclusion and further exponential growth post-launch. Remittix is poised to disrupt the PayFi sector in 2025, offering a forward-thinking solution for an industry rife with inefficiencies.

The Trump Inauguration is set to do the same! However, not all coins will benefit. Recently, a few coins have taken over the headlines. So, experts believe that these four stand to gain the most from the Trump Inauguration! The coins in question? They include FXGuys ($FXG) , Hedera (HBAR), AAVE, and Shiba Inu (SHIB). However, out of these four, FXGuys, a new crypto trading platform, stands to gain the most! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE FXGuys: The New Crypto Trading Platform That Will Take Over After the Trump Inauguration As mentioned, out of the four coins mentioned above, FXGuys is the most promising.

Hedera Forms a Bullish Pattern as Its Price Rises The recent market dip took HBAR’s price down below $0.27. However, now, HBAR’s price is rising. So far, HBAR’s price has risen by 22% from its lows. Also, the Hedera community hasn’t lost its confidence in the token, which is another great sign. Furthermore, interest in Hedera hasn’t decreased. Many took advantage of HBAR’s price dip to buy more. Also, HBAR is forming a symmetrical triangle pattern right now. HBAR is also trading above its 50-day EMA. Both of these suggest that Hedera will see a strong bullish breakout soon. This will be further fueled by the Trump Inauguration. So, with this in mind, experts say that Hedera’s price could reach $0.50 in just a few weeks! AAVE’s Price Is Rising With the Market Recovery AAVE’s price was also affected by the recent market dip. Namely, AAVE’s price went below $260 because of it. However, AAVE was quick to recover, currently at $315 already. So, in less than 2 days, AAVE’s price rose by 21% . This large recovery was driven by the market as a whole and by the AAVE community. Even during the dip, the AAVE community remained unfazed, showing how confident they are in the token. Also, AAVE got new bids at the lows, and now there’s significant buzz around it. Because of this, AAVE is deemed one of the most promising tokens for the Trump Inauguration. With the buzz that it has, experts see AAVE’s price rising by at least 100% after the Trump Inauguration, and even more later! New Listing for Shiba Inu Will Fuel SHIB’s Price Rise The Trump Inauguration will also be very good for Shiba Inu. That’s because of the new developments that Shiba Inu has been seeing lately. Namely, SHIB is set to be one of the 7 memecoins listed on the new exchange called Noladex. This new listing will generate new interest for SHIB, which can drive its price higher. So, this, combined with the Trump Inauguration could be amazing for SHIB. Shiba Inu’s price was also affected by the dip a few days ago. Namely, SHIB’s price went to $0.000020 because of it. Now, Shiba Inu is recovering, rising by around 10% already. This healthy recovery is yet another great sign for Shiba Inu, solidifying SHIB’s place as a great investment! So, with the Trump Inauguration and the new listing, experts see SHIB’s price rising by 200% in the weeks to come. They also say that SHIB’s price can rise even more as the market heats up! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG: Invest in the Trump Inauguration Leader Early!

In a January 18 post on X, Buterin outlined ambitious goals for the Foundation’s restructuring, aiming to better support decentralized application developers while upholding Ethereum’s core principles of decentralization, privacy, and censorship resistance. Buterin made it clear that the Foundation would steer clear of political lobbying or taking a central role in the ecosystem’s development, signaling a renewed focus on maintaining the network’s decentralized ethos. These changes come in response to criticism from the Ethereum community following a turbulent 2024, a year marked by controversy over spending, roadmap execution, and ethical concerns. Ethereum Leadership Overhaul One of the key challenges the Ethereum Foundation faced in 2024 was its handling of conflicts of interest. In May 2024, the Foundation introduced a conflict of interest policy after several researchers, including Justin Drake and Dankrad Feist, accepted paid advisory roles with the EigenLayer Foundation, an organization overseeing Ethereum’s restaking protocol. While the advisory positions were intended to guide the EigenLayer Foundation, they sparked community backlash. Drake eventually resigned from his role in November 2024 and issued a public apology, pledging not to take on similar positions in the future. This overhaul seeks to rebuild trust by ensuring the Foundation remains impartial and focused on the ecosystem’s technical progress. Layer-2 Expansion Another issue the Foundation aims to address is the rapid expansion of Ethereum’s layer-2 networks following the Dencun upgrade in March 2024 . The upgrade significantly reduced transaction fees on layer-2 networks, making them more accessible but causing a proliferation of rollups. According to L2Beat, there are now 55 active layer-2 networks in the ecosystem. While this growth showcases Ethereum’s scalability, it has also led to concerns over cannibalization of revenue on the base layer. Data from Token Terminal revealed a 99% drop in Ethereum base layer revenues during the summer of 2024, before recovering by year-end.

The blockchain would realize its main goal: to help the world’s population lead a healthy and active lifestyle. The project prides itself in being the first to execute a convenient move, earn concept and inspire millions. To join the wave, you need to download the STEPN mobile app on the Google Play Store for Android users and the Apple App Store for iOS device users. You can then register an account and create your own wallet. You can deposit SOL tokens into the created wallet, buy NFT, and wait for 24 hours. The waiting period is necessary as it is when energy replenishment occurs.

Although the cryptocurrency went through losses in the past week, today the circumstances turned more negative. The coin value has dropped down to $0.0141 today. The overall market sentiment remains negative considering the current downside. Technical indicators give out a bearish signal along with the price charts. Is Green Satoshi Token a good investment? Green Satoshi Token presents both opportunities and risks as an investment despite being pegged to the Japanese yen. While it has shown recent bullish momentum with a 0.25% price increase over the past week and strong market capitalization, it is still a highly volatile asset. Technical indicators show mixed signals: while short-term simple and exponential moving averages suggest buying, longer-term indicators lean bearish. Investors should weigh these factors against the speculative nature of GST before considering it a good investment. Why is GST down? The GST/USD crypto pair price has devalued today as the selling influx abruptly took over the market, devaluing the price to $0.0141. The bulls have been targeting resistance beyond this value, but overall, the coin’s value has decreased significantly over the past 24 hours, especially since the December 7 depreciation negatively impacted the coin’s value. Will GST reach $0.05? Yes, GST should rise above $0.05 in 2027. After that, its price will range between $0.056868 and a minimum of $0.052378. Will GST reach $0.1? Yes, GST should rise above $0.1 in 2030-1031. During that period, its price will range between $0.092785 and $0.116729. Will GST reach $1? It might be unlikely for the Green Satoshi Token to reach $1 in the next five years; however, it can attain a maximum value of $0.116729 by then. Does Green Satoshi Token have a good long-term future? Per expert opinions, Green Satoshi Token GST will gain significant value in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory.

Green Satoshi Token (GST) historic price sentiment Green Satoshi Token price history Green Satoshi Token was launched by the STEPN blockchain in December 2021 with an opening price of $1.32. • The GST/SOL token saw a good price increase during the first month of its launch as its price reached $2.93, gaining more than 100% value. Even though GST observed significant gains, its price crashed to $1.73 in just a few days during the same month, showing extreme volatility. GST soon started to recover and followed a continuous bullish pattern with regular corrections till April 2022. Grenn Satoshi Token observed its all-time high of $8.51 on April 28, 2022. Up until the beginning of May, the GST token was doing well. However, May 2022 proved to be a month of steep declines as GST value kept decreasing at a high rate, and on June 1, it finally dipped below its opening price for the first time. The decline happened when the UST stablecoin and its sister token LUNA collapsed; a number of other cryptocurrencies also fell, and GST began a lengthy fall that ended on September 30 at a low of $0.021. From July 2022 till the end of 2023, GST kept trading lower near $0.0124 following different sets of consolidation near this range. 2024 started with GST trading near $0.0183 while prices often dipped near the $0.0145 level. At the start of March, GST jumped higher to $0.150 but could not sustain this level and closed at $0.100 on the same day, March 5, 2024. On March 6, 2024, GST started following a downward trend, reaching down to $0.0252 by mid-May. June saw further declines, and GST’s price plummeted to the $0.0162 level, while in July GST traded near the $0.0153 range. In August, GST consolidated near the $0.0133 level and got a break upwards on August 22, reaching $0.0153. The token traded below $0.0153 till November, when it finally reached $0.0213, while in December GST touched $0.0272. GST is trending downwards since the second week of December and has reached $0.0148 in January 2025.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BUSINESS|LUNA,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-19 10:11:00

Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 843,900 followers on the social media platform X that he’s keeping a close watch on the OTHERS chart, which tracks the market cap of all crypto excluding the 10 largest coins and stablecoins. According to Pentoshi, OTHERS is flashing a bullish continuation signal as it threatens to take out its final resistance at around $500 billion. “Say what you will, but alts look great as a whole here. Bull flag/consolidation over the previous highs from last year. Markup soon.” Source: Pentoshi/X Traders keep an eye on the OTHERS chart to get a broad sense of how the altcoin markets are likely to perform. Meanwhile, a bull flag typically indicates that an asset is taking a breather before igniting a fresh leg up. At time of writing, OTHERS is trading at $362.22 billion. Pentoshi is also closely watching the TOTAL chart, which tracks the market capitalization of all crypto assets excluding stablecoins. The trader predicts that TOTAL could surge at least 18% from current levels but can print as high as 88% gains before the crypto bull market comes to a close. A rising TOTAL chart indicates that Bitcoin ( BTC ) and altcoins are surging in value. “Guessing we top at $4.2 trillion – $6.7 trillion currently. I will narrow it down more later. But the first target is $4.2ish trillion.” At time of writing, TOTAL is trading for $3.553 trillion.

The firm predicts that Bitcoin could either surge past $161,000 or drop below $76,000, depending on whether it breaks through a key resistance level at $114,000. Alphractal’s analysis focuses on the Fibonacci-Adjusted Market Average Price, a metric that tracks potential tops and bottoms for Bitcoin. This metric is derived from the Market Average Price, which calculates the average price of the blockchain without taking into account mined Bitcoins. According to Alphractal, if Bitcoin manages to break above $114,000, it could trigger a bullish rally with targets above $161,000. In an optimistic scenario, Bitcoin’s price could even approach $190,000, depending on investor sentiment and market conditions. Related News: BREAKING: Vitalik Buterin Makes a New Profile Picture Linked to This Altcoin, Price Fluctuates However, failure to break above $114,000 could lead to a sharp decline, with Bitcoin potentially falling below $76,000. Alphractal noted that Bitcoin has recently been testing resistance levels seen at key moments in its history, including late 2019, late 2021, and March 2024. Despite strong momentum earlier, Bitcoin struggled to sustain its rally in early 2025 due to selling pressure from long-term holders and high leverage on exchanges. The Market Average Price currently stands at $61,500, which Alphractal describes as the worst-case scenario for Bitcoin, similar to market conditions during the May 2021 mining crackdown in China. *This is not investment advice.

TRUMP Above SHIB It’s safe to say that the past 36 hours or so belong to Donald Trump’s official meme coin, which saw the light of day on Friday evening. The token took the crypto world and turned it upside down. Within less than a weekend, it has garnered the attention of the entire community. Its price has shot up to over $60 now, and its market cap is at roughly $13 billion on CMC and CG. Moreover, TRUMP has now become the second-largest meme coin by that metric after surpassing PEPE in the morning and SHIB minutes ago. The other notable gainer from TRUMP’s success is SOL since the meme coin was launched on the latter’s blockchain. SOL jumped to a fresh all-time high of $270 yesterday, only to break it to almost $280 today. In contrast, most other larger-cap alts, especially meme coins, are deep in the red.

It started with a massive price dump to below $90,000 for the first time since November, but the bulls didn’t allow any further declines and helped the asset recover all losses within days. Even the CPI numbers from the US couldn’t keep BTC down, and it flew past $100,000 just a few days after that multi-month low. Moreover, it kept climbing and exceeded $105,000 on a couple of occasions since Friday to mark its highest price tag in about a month. As of now, bitcoin trades close to $105,000, and its market cap is up to $2.075 trillion. Its dominance over the alts is also on the rise to 55.4%. BTCUSD.

In tandem, the Ethereum Spot ETFs also produced an overall positive performance to record their first weekly net inflows in 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin At Risk Of Supply Shock As ETF Issues Buy More BTC Than Was Produced In December Bitcoin Spot ETFs Register $2.42 Billion Net Flows In 2025 Following a turbulent end to December 2024, the US Bitcoin Spot ETFs have launched 2025 on a strong bullish note with significant market inflows reminiscent of their impressive performance in the majority of Q4 2024. According to data from ETF analytics site Farside Investors, these Bitcoin ETFs recorded an aggregate inflow of $1.862 billion in the third trading week of 2025 resulting in a total net flow of $2.42 billion in the new year. Interestingly, this week started on a negative note as these ETFs suffered withdrawals valued at $493.9 million between 13 January – 14 January amidst a Bitcoin flash crash to below $90,000. However, a surge in Bitcoin prices in the remaining three trading days corresponded with a rise in investors’ confidence translating to a cumulative inflow of $2.35 billion during this period. In familiar fashion, BlackRock’s IBIT registered the largest net inflows of the week valued at $745.7 million, with Fidelity’s FBTC taking second with investments worth $680.2 million. Bitwise’s BITB and Ark’s ARKB also registered significant inflows, totaling $216 million and $204.7 million, respectively. Other ETFs such as Invesco’s BTCO, Grayscale’s BTC, WisdomTree’s BTCW, VanEck’s HODL, and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC recorded modest net inflows of not more than $40.1 million. Unsurprisingly, Grayscale’s GBTC produced the only net outflow of the week valued at $87.7 million. Meanwhile, Valkyrie’s BRRR was also another outlier registering zero net flows. At the time of writing, BlackRock’s IBIT maintains its market dominance with $38.41 billion in cumulative net inflow. IBIT also boasts $59.28 billion in net assets accounting for almost half of the total net assets ($120.95 billion) in the Bitcoin Spot ETF market.

The BlackRock ETHA emerged as the focal center of these gains, registering $151.3 million in net flows over the week. At the time of writing, the Ethereum Spot ETFs now hold a total net asset of $12.66 billion representing 2.99% of Ethereum’s market cap.

Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL) have significantly brought massive profits to users in the past cycles. However, investors are yearning for more, looking for other new crypto projects that can return massive returns. Rollblock (RBLK) offers great opportunities for investors with its unique GambleFi protocol. This unique project merges a functional casino with blockchain technology to offer players and users a new gaming experience. The Dogecoin Price Conundrum Four years ago, DOGE recorded an all-time high Dogecoin price of $0.7376, and since then, Dogecoin has struggled to reach such height despite pushing hard in different profit cycles. In the past 30 days, the Dogecoin price has fluctuated between $0.3881 and $0.4132, with a trading volume of $6.13 billion. However, its users expect Dogecoin price to surge due to Elon Musk’s involvement in DOGE and its integration with X platform for monetization. Solana (SOL) battles instability It is popularly known that the Solana ecosystem opens up more opportunities for decentralized applications (DApps) and DeFi projects (or solutions). This makes its native token, SOL, a crucial token due to its utility. Despite its vast use cases, SOL has struggled to bring tangible profits to investors. In the past 30 days, Solana has been quite unstable. The Solana price has touched the $170.63 low and reached the $222.95 high. While the current Solana price is $270.89, investors are still wary of a relapse, and that’s why they’re considering a new crypto for gains. Rollblock (RBLK) Setting for the Moon as it takes on the casino market The casino market is big, but Rollblock (RBLK) brings more juice. Rollblock is a casino gaming platform that allows you to transact using its native token, RBLK. As a DeFi token that aims to solve the top-priority problem (transparency) in casino markets, it maximizes the synergy between centralized and decentralized gaming platforms. Using blockchain technology amplifies its trustworthiness for its users and token holders as a new crypto project. As a decentralized gaming platform, it enables each transaction to be traceable, secure, and immutable. As a result of this transparency as a core value, investors are beginning to throw their weight behind RBLK. This new crypto opportunity assures investors and token holders of safe and secure investment with compounding upward profits. Likewise, blockchain technology opens it up to a global audience without restrictions. Another important accessibility feature Rollblock brings to the casino world is granting users access without needing a KYC verification process. As a user, you only need to connect your wallet to the platform. Meanwhile, you can open an account on the platform with your email only. This eliminates participation barriers without age or geographical restrictions. It is noteworthy that Rollblock makes over 7,000 games available for users, covering thousands of the biggest sporting events globally. Due to these unique casino gaming features, investors are rushing to purchase more RBLK tokens because of its huge profit potential. Beyond being a native token, an embedded reward system allows token holders to stake in the near future for more rewards. Likewise, Rollblock is set up to share a percentage of the casino earnings with token holders to support the token value for more growth. The token-burning mechanism implemented also ensures a decrease in the circulation of this new crypto token supply. This, in turn, leads to scarcity and increasing token value. RBLK is currently in stage 9 of the presale, priced at $0.046 a token with over 50 million RBLK sold before proceeding to the next stage with a token price of $0.052. Meanwhile, the token price at stage 1 was $0.01. As a result, experts believe there could be a 500% value increase before the token launch and rise as one of the new top altcoins. There is no better time to join Rollblock’s active community now. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

The fear of missing out (FOMO) is increasing as more and more investors leap in. Remittix is fast becoming popular, and many people think it might follow PEPE’s footsteps and become even better, thereby providing great possibilities for those that enter early. Don’t miss out on this exciting opportunity! Pepe Coin Suffers Amid Broader Market Decline Third-largest meme currency Pepe currency (PEPE) has seen a dramatic drop—trading at $0.0000156—its lowest price since December 20. Rising bond rates and declining stocks rule the financial scene, so this decline coincides with a larger collapse of the bitcoin market driven by a risk-off attitude. With Bitcoin falling to $90,000 and the whole cryptocurrency market capitalisation down by 4% to $3.19 trillion, Pepe’s price reflects the trend in the market overall. Reflecting mounting market concern, key indices like the Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100, and S&P 500 all saw notable declines. Pepe’s drop draws attention to meme currency fragility in times of market instability. The Federal Reserve’s hawkish posture is the main reason for the continuous crypto fall as the U.S. economy is still doing very well. Recent figures showed a decline in the unemployment rate to 4.1% in December coupled with the 256,000 job creation. These numbers raise questions about whether the Fed will keep raising interest rates for an extended term, therefore reducing the excitement about riskier assets like Pepe. Looking forward, market mood will be much shaped by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) release. From 2.7% in November to 2.9% in December, economists predict inflation climbed. This information will probably affect Pepe’s performance and help to decide if it can stop its declining course or get back on track.

Monero (XMR) looks to be rebounding after a slow 2024, while Polkadot (DOT) struggles amid big price swings. Another emerging contender in the DeFi arena is Remittix (RTX), a promising PayFi solution addressing inefficiencies in the cross border payment sector. As the market gears up for upcoming political changes that will inevitably cause disruptions, these projects are shaping up to play pivotal roles in the crypto landscape this year. So will Monero, Polkadot and Remittix survive or thrive? Polkadot Sees 12% Gain After Losses In Early January Some major changes have been going on for Polkadot (DOT) lately. Between the 7th and 13th January, extreme fluctuations were observed. This window saw Polkadot (DOT) start trading at $7.8076 and plummet to $6.0772 by January 13. But recent days have seen some level of recovery, as Polkadot (DOT) posted a huge 11.94% weekly gain. Polkadot is still benefiting from its parachute auctions despite these fluctuations. Such auctions remain a key part of Polkadot’s ecosystem, providing projects with slots on the network’s Relay Chain. Recently, there has been a spike in adoption, with millions raised through community contributions, attracting developers and fostering the growth of new projects within the Polkadot network. Monero (XMR) Posts Strong Weekly Gain Monero (XMR) took its holders on an emotional rollercoaster throughout 2024, zigzagging in every direction left, right, up, down and everything in between. The start of 2025 was no different for Monero, with large fluctuations throughout much of early January. However, Monero (XMR) now seems to be seeing a resurgence, posting a 9% gain in the last week. Technical indicators support this positive momentum for Monero. The Relative Strength Index is currently 58, sitting above the neutral 50 mark, which points to increased buying pressure. Remittix Levels Up The Cross Border Payments Space While Monero and Polkadot face headwinds, Remittix (RTX) is quickly gaining recognition for addressing inefficiencies in the $190 trillion cross border payments industry. The platform comes with some impressive engineering, enabling users to convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat and send funds directly to bank accounts worldwide. Revolutionizing Payments for Businesses The Remittix Pay API stands out for its ability to simplify the integration of crypto payments into existing financial systems while offering seamless fiat settlements. Additionally, merchant accounts allow companies to manage transactions across 50+ cryptocurrency pairs and 30+ fiat currencies, making Remittix (RTX) an adaptable and efficient solution for businesses operating in global markets. Privacy and Flexibility Remittix’s (RTX) platform ensures privacy by processing payments as standard bank transfers, concealing their cryptocurrency origins. This feature appeals to both businesses and individuals seeking discretion in their financial activities. With its focus on flexibility and usability, Remittix is positioning itself as a key player in the PayFi sector, bridging the gap between blockchain and traditional finance. Remittix Presale Gathers Momentum The $RTX token at the heart of the Remittix ecosystem is currently available for $0.0217 in the project’s presale phase. Remittix has quickly raised more than $3.4 million and isn’t slowing down anytime soon. Analysts expect a staggering 800% price surge by the presale end and further growth post launch. Owing to its advanced approach within a prosperous sector, Remitix finds itself in a prime position to disrupt the market in 2025.

When the tech company bought VMware in a $69 billion deal in 2023, its clients could choose from thousands of different products to manage their data centers. Before long, Broadcom reduced the number of products to five. According to Hock Tan, Broadcom’s chief executive , the initial plan was to lower the VMware products to four. Still, clients stubbornly rejected a series of changes, leading to the addition of the fifth product. Tan told the Financial Times in an interview: One of the commitments we made was to make VMware easier to use and to make the whole availability of the product much simpler. Maybe going down to four was a bit too much . . . but we certainly do not need 8,000. ~ Hock Tan VMware acquisition and AI integration will lead to higher earnings Tan assured investors that the deal would earn huge profits, surpassing the $8.5 billion it initially expected. The deal has made Tan appear shrewd as he focuses on the next Broadcom acquisition. VMware is the dominant alternative for firms uncomfortable handing over their data to US cloud providers in an era where artificial intelligence adoption dictates how data centers are run. VMware’s virtualization system overcomes the underlying difficulties of the various servers, storage, and switches that make up a data center. This makes it possible to run as a software platform, allowing customers to spend less on hardware and making their infrastructure more resilient and secure. According to Tan, VMware gives businesses control, ownership, and the ability to run their data centers. It resolves an issue that most businesses have struggled with for several decades. For the past two years, the success of ChatGPT has inspired businesses to assess and deploy AI tools for easy business operations. However, the element of control has become more critical. Broadcom customers push back on changes Data protection is a sensitive element in Europe, and several stringent data regulations target big tech firms. These rules always fuel the concept of “sovereign” data centers, where client or corporate data is kept in a data center, either by companies or a local cloud provider. The situation is ideal for Broadcom; its VMware is a competent alternative to the public cloud. However, 2024 saw the company receive a lot of backlash, which made the firm take considerable time to improve how it sold VMware’s tools. It also shifted from upfront license fees for VMware’s products to an annual subscription that increased costs several times over. Towards the end of Q3, AT&T, the US telecoms group, accused Broadcom of trying to force it to pay a king’s ransom for a subscription it didn’t want. The firms eventually reached a consensus to resolve the matter.

Table of Contents Sui token gains over 168%, prepares for the next pump Avalanche ecosystem gears to launch its mainnet upgrade Next-gen DeFi hub Elluminex champions cross-chain transactions on TON Network Best investment alternative for 2025 Undoubtedly, Bitcoin is the most valuable coin in the crypto industry. However, the high-value status of Bitcoin has made it difficult to buy the coin and make a high-end ROI. That is why investing in lower-priced crypto tokens with high growth potential is necessary to realize a massive profit. Here are three top tokens that have the potential to generate great ROI within the next two months. They include Sui, Avalanche, and Elluminex (ELX). Although new, Elluminex is developing the next-generation DeFi on the TON blockchain, which will solve common issues relating to interoperability and security that traders encounter in the DeFi space. You might also like: The bull market is in full swing but these 3 cryptos still look cheap Sui token gains over 168%, prepares for the next pump The Sui crypto has been one of the top-performing altcoins so far in Q4, having gained over 168% in value. The current bullish cycle has seen Sui’s price reach its all-time high of $4.89 with clear signs of breaking through the $5 mark. Sui’s market cap is also at its all-time high of $14 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Crypto gurus are bullish on the altcoin with many projecting extended rallies. An analyst that goes by the username 0fficialmaddawg on X forecasts that Sui’s market cap could reach $20 billion by early 2025. While analyzing the Sui price chart, the speculator anticipates a rise to $7.99 which will be followed by a slight retracement to $4.76 before moving to the $16 mark. Sui technical indicators are extremely bullish, with the altcoin price above the 50-day and 200-day EMAs. The overall market sentiment is bullish, with the Fear and Greed index (76). In their short-term Sui price prediction, analysts at Coincodex forecast a rise to $15.38, putting Sui among the altcoins to watch in 2025. Avalanche ecosystem gears to launch its mainnet upgrade The Avalanche blockchain launched its mainnet upgrade on Monday, December 16th. According to an X post from Avalanche’s official account, the upgrade will reduce L1 cost by 99% while making the blockchain “faster, cheaper, more scalable…than ever.” Meanwhile, market stats show that the Avalanche token is bullish, having gained over 50% within the last month. The launch of the Avalanche mainnet could propel the token’s value beyond $60 and further to $100 before 2025. A popular crypto analyst with over 100K followers on X, Nihat Cetinkaya, believes that as long as the Avalanche price stays above the $46 support zone, the AVAX price will hit $65 very soon. In an earlier tweet, CryptoBullet, another popular predictor, projected a rise to $150 – $180. With AVAX’s price still above the $50 support zone, it could mount a challenge at $60 soon. Next-gen DeFi hub Elluminex champions cross-chain transactions on TON Network The Elluminex project is leading the course toward providing cross-chain liquidity solutions to over 950 million active TON users. The Elluminex platform is designed to provide members on the TON blockchain with a seamless DeFi transaction environment where they can trade in a secure protocol. Elluminex harbors strong use cases in the TON network, some of which provide a DEX exchange with a high liquidity offering and a wide range of trading options at low fees. The cross-chain bridge feature will allow members to seamlessly transfer assets between multiple blockchains. Through the AI-powered portfolio tracker, users will be able to transmit real-time data, analytics, and insights, allowing them to stay updated on market trends. Basically, Elluminex will be to TON what Uniswap is to Ethereum. In view of the project’s high growth potential, macro traders are already monitoring the project’s presale to position themselves for growth. The Elluminex platform will offer traders passive income opportunities, such as staking the ELX token to provide liquidity. Users can also trade, farm, and track their portfolios with ease. With the DeFi market witnessing massive adoption, platforms like Elluminex could witness high adoption. Best investment alternative for 2025 Avalanche and Sui tokens have shown varying bullish momentum in the altcoin market. However, Elluminex harbors a bigger percentage growth potential, given that it is still in its nascent presale stage. As such, buying the Elluminex presale could be key for exponential ROI in 2025.

Introduced on January 17, just days before Trump’s inauguration, the Solana-based token soared by an astonishing 10,643%, reaching $27.50, according to the trading platform Moonshot. Trump’s foray into cryptocurrency has onboarded over 200,000 new users to the blockchain space, according to Moonshot. This influx of activity has driven Solana’s native token to an all-time high of $270, showcasing the market’s explosive response. Pav Hundal, lead analyst at crypto exchange Swyftx, described the phenomenon as “astonishing,” adding that Solana’s decentralized exchange volumes have skyrocketed off the back of the TRUMP memecoin launch. While some industry leaders see the memecoin as a promising step toward crypto adoption, others caution that its long-term implications may be less favorable. A Memecoin Frenzy Propels Solana to New Heights The overwhelming enthusiasm surrounding the TRUMP token highlights the potential of crypto to capture public interest. Scott Melker, widely known as “The Wolf of All Streets,” acknowledged the token’s success in introducing millions to crypto. However, he also expressed concerns, calling it “bad for humanity.” Adding to the controversy, blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence revealed that 80% of the TRUMP token supply is concentrated in a single wallet, potentially belonging to Trump. This concentration has raised eyebrows, but some, like crypto advocate Erik Thoughts, argue that it makes the token safer for holders, as the vested interest could prevent a rug pull. Concerns Over Concentration and Industry Impacts Not everyone views the TRUMP token as a net positive for the industry. Critics like TradeZella founder Umar Ashraf questioned the ethical implications of a sitting president promoting his own cryptocurrency. “This is not the right direction for crypto,” Ashraf remarked . Luke Youngblood, founder of Moonwell Finance, echoed these sentiments but urged Coinbase to list the token for accessibility, suggesting that it could protect buyers from scams. Meanwhile, Trump’s memecoin launch coincided with the high-profile “Crypto Ball,” which brought together industry heavyweights like Michael Saylor and the Winklevoss twins. Despite its polarizing reception, the TRUMP token has undeniably cemented itself as a focal point in the crypto conversation, leaving the industry to grapple with its implications.

The flagship current is up over 2% in the past 24 hours and nearly 12% over the past week. If the markets rally following Donald Trump’s inauguration, BTC could surge past $108,268 to a new all-time high. Robert Kiyosaki reiterates Bullish Stance Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, has reiterated his bullish stance for Bitcoin (BTC) , predicting the flagship currency will reach a staggering $250,000 in 2025. Kiyosaki’s bullish prediction indicates confidence in BTC’s potential, with the cryptocurrency trading around $104,500 at the time of writing, after setting a new all-time high in December 2024. According to analysts, BTC’s latest price jump is due to a surge in inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing expectations of pro-crypto policies under the incoming administration. Kiyosaki shared his broader perspective on the asset in a post on X, stating, “Why I love Bitcoin: As an old guy, you had to be very smart to get rich. Bitcoin makes getting rich easy. All you have to do is buy one satoshi and HODL. The only people who cannot get rich with Bitcoin are stupid. My price prediction for Bitcoin 2025: $175,000 to $350,000.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered over the week and reclaimed $100,000 as markets build momentum leading up to Donald Trump’s inauguration. BTC bulls have prevented a break below $90,000 and are now looking to surge past the asset’s all-time high, with some analysts predicting a peak of $200,000. One analyst believes the cryptocurrency is in its last bullish cycle, coinciding with Trump’s inauguration, and a correction could follow. He also believes BTC will peak at around $125,000 in 2025, after which the flagship currency could expect a steep correction, as seen in previous rallies. While such declines are less likely thanks to BTC’s growing market cap, analysts believe a correction over 50% could be possible. Looking at the price chart, BTC entered the current week on a relatively muted note, registering a marginal decline on Saturday and a marginal increase on Sunday to settle at $94,585. The price collapsed on Monday as BTC dropped below $90,000 to an intraday low of $89,397. However, buyers bought the dip, allowing the price to recover and reclaim $90,000. BTC ultimately settled at $94,492, registering only a marginal decline. Bullish sentiment returned on Tuesday as BTC registered an increase of 2.19% to move past the 20-day SMA and settle at $96,566. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as the price crossed the 50-day SMA and $100,000 to settle at $100,050. Source: TradingView However, it lost momentum on Thursday, dropping to an intraday low of $97,094 before settling at $99,798. BTC bulls were back in action on Friday as BTC rose almost 4% to surge past $100,000 and settle at $103,732, but not before reaching an intraday high of $105,761. After a marginal drop on Saturday, BTC is up almost 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $104,400. The MACD indicates considerable bullish sentiment, and BTC could surge to a new all-time following Donald Trump’s inauguration. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Is the DOGE price rally at risk of losing momentum ? Dogecoin (DOGE) Dips Below $0.40 as Trump’s latest move shifts investors focus Dogecoin (DOGE) emerged one of the standout performers since Donald Trump was re-elected in 2025. However, after Donald Trump launched an official ‘TRUMP’ memecoin in a TruthSocial post on January 18, the market dynamics have shifted considerably. Dogecoin price action | DOGEUSD Dogecoin was left lagging as the global crypto market gained further traction on Sunday. According to TradingView data, while BTC breaching $105,000 and Solana price reaching a new all-time high of $275 per coin, DOGE price declined 8.8%, falling below the $0.40 mark at press time on January 19. DOGE Stumbles as Trump Token Pulls $15B Market Demand Over the past three months, DOGE has enjoyed a close association with the Trump administration, partly due to Elon Musk’s influence within government circles. Musk, a vocal proponent of DOGE, frequently promoted the memecoin during his public appearances and campaigns. However, this dynamic shifted significantly with the recent launch of President-elect Donald Trump’s official memecoin, TRUMP, hosted on the Solana blockchain. Within 48 hours of its debut, the TRUMP token amassed an impressive market capitalization of $7.2 billion, reflecting widespread positive sentiment among investors. While this rapid growth indicates widespread positive market reception for TRUMP, it has also triggered an unintended negative impact on older, legacy memecoins. Tokens such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) appear to have lost traction as the TRUMP token encroaches more market share. Trump PolitiFi Tokens Performance (January 19, 2025) | Source: SosoValue The SosoValue chart above presents the performance of select cryptocurrency tokens remotely linked to the Trump administration. As depicted, TRUMP token market capitalization crossed $7.84 billion while attracting a staggering $14.8 billion in trading volume on Sunday. This figure nearly triples the $5.4 billion in trading volume accrued to Dogecoin, the largest memecoin by market capitalization during the same period. The disparity in performance highlights a clear shift in investor focus. First, the simultaneous decline in DOGE trading volume and price suggests that many investors are reallocating funds from Dogecoin to TRUMP, likely to capitalize on the fresh profit opportunities and novelty of Trump’s new project. If this trend persist, the ascent of the TRUMP token could further disrupt the market dominance of legacy memecoins like DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and FLOKI. Meanwhile the likes of Dogwifhat (WIF), BONK, and Pudgy Penguins stand to benefit immensely, as the Trump coin launch brings new entrants, fresh capital inflows, and additional media attention towards the Solana memecoin ecosystem. Dogecoin price forecast: Bulls to regroup at $0.40 support level Despite a 9% drop off to $0.38 technical indicators suggest further bearish outlook for Dogecoin price prediction. The Bollinger Bands (BB) show significant price contraction, with DOGE testing support near $0.3593 (lower BB boundary). This indicates rising pressure, potentially favoring a bearish breakout if selling persists. Volume Delta readings also show negative momentum, with -$529.82M in net outflows, reinforcing short-term bearish sentiment. Should DOGE breach $0.36, the next support lies at $0.3027, aligning with December lows. Dogecoin Price Forecast | DOGEUSD Conversely, the midline of the Bollinger Bands ($0.3593) intersects with the 50-day Moving Average, offering a possible pivot for recovery. If bulls regain control, DOGE could reclaim $0.40 (upper BB), a psychological and technical resistance Traders should monitor volume shifts and potential retests of the $0.36 zone. While short-term weakness persists, long-term momentum could favor bulls, provided macro sentiment supports memecoins. DOGE traders can anticipate a prolonged cautious consolidation near the $0.37-$0.41 price range.

As two of the largest memecoins by market cap, Pepe and Shiba Inu will undoubtedly attract interest from investors ahead of the bull run. However, the smart play could be to invest in Rollblock, a new crypto currently in the ninth stage of its presale, tipped by analysts to surge 100x in 2025. Rollblock and the 100x opportunity Statista data suggests the online gambling market will grow to 281.3 million users by 2029. Rollblock’s combination of centralized and decentralized gambling makes it well-positioned to attract most of these users. What truly makes Rollblock stand out is its solution to concerns related to online gambling, such as price volatility, security, and scalability. It ensures user data and financial transaction history are safe with the latest blockchain encryption, and its architecture is designed to accommodate many users and transactions without any drawbacks to speed, performance, and user experience. Furthermore, it prevents price volatility by allocating a portion of its revenue to support its native RBLK token. The RBLK supply is also fixed to avoid inflation, and a token burn mechanism has been implemented to elevate the token’s scarcity and subsequent value. Currently in the ninth stage of its presale and going for $0.046 per token, Rollblock represents a low-risk, high-reward investment that could yield higher returns than Pepe and Shiba Inu. It could become a category leader in the burgeoning GambleFi space. SHIB price rally continues as token hits $14 billion market cap As the second largest memecoin by market cap, Shiba Inu is among the best performers in the memecoin category. Shiba Inu has enjoyed a three-day positive price action, briefly surging from a $12.42 billion market cap to $14 billion from Jan. 15 to Jan. 18. Despite its recent success, SHIB price remains at a modest $0.000023 per token, making it a no-brainer for investors going into the bull run. The SHIB price aside, the sheer number of decentralized applications (dApps) and services in its ecosystem make it an ideal choice for investors heavy on utility. There is the ShibaSwap, its in-built decentralized exchange (DEX); Shibarium, the native layer 1 (L1) blockchain; and Shib Eternity, the native gaming platform. Of course, Shiba Inu is integral to all these products, facilitating everything from transactions to purchases. Pepe continues 7-day surge In a world dominated by dog and cat-themed memecoins, Pepe stands out in both appearance and utility. Donning the familiar Kermit the Frog as its logo, Pepe is the only frog-themed meme coin in the top 10 meme coins by market cap, and its recent price rally explains why. Pepe enjoyed a seven-day profitability run, which was up nearly 8% at that time. Rumors of a bull market haven’t affected the Pepe coin price much, as it remains at a modest $0.000087. However, analysts predict the Pepe coin price could rise as much as 50% over the next few weeks, so it is certainly one to watch out for. Rollblock: Can the new crypto outperform SHIB and Pepe? While all three tokens represent low-risk opportunities for investors ahead of the bull run, Rollblock edges Shib and Pepe in terms of potential, utility, and use cases. It is poised to play a massive role in the fast-growing online gambling market and could become a category leader. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

It could all be tied to President-elect Donald Trump’s upcoming administration, which could bring significant changes to U.S. crypto policies, including plans to elevate cryptocurrency as a national priority and repeal restrictive SEC regulations. Let’s dig deeper. Bitcoin Thailand's SEC is considering approving local Bitcoin ETFs to expand crypto investment options and establish the nation as a digital asset hub. Italian banking giant Intesa Sanpaolo has taken its first cautious steps in Bitcoin trading by purchasing $1 million worth of the crypto as a strategic test to meet client demand. The inauguration of Donald Trump as the next president of the United States is likely to have huge consequences for Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency industry. Altcoins BlockDAG has tackled key challenges like scalability and security to create a network that feels tailor-made for the future of decentralized technology. President-elect Donald Trump’s social media accounts have shared what appears to be an official Solana meme coin called TRUMP days before his inauguration. As the Bitcoin price continues to play with the $100,000 level, the next stage of the bull market could soon be upon us. Among the altcoins, Solana (SOL) is poised to lead this next rally higher. Web3 Aurora Labs is handing memecoin creators and decentralized application developers their very own blockchain on a plate with the launch of its super-simple, user-friendly Aurora Cloud Console . High throughput Layer 1 blockchain Somnia has outlined its vision for mainstreaming web3 gaming, believing it can stand out in an increasingly crowded GameFi marketplace. Sony has announced the mainnet launch of its Soneium blockchain platform after a four-month testing period that attracted over 14 million users. Regulation President-elect Donald Trump plans to release an executive order to elevate cryptocurrency to a national priority in the US, giving the industry a presence within his administration. U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis has accused the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) of destroying documents linked to digital assets, citing whistleblower claims from within the agency. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially appealed the Ripple ruling as the legal battle between the regulator and Ripple Labs continues. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to repeal the SEC’s SAB 121 on his first day in office, potentially enabling banks to hold cryptocurrencies as assets rather than liabilities, signaling a pro-crypto shift in U.S. policy.

According to LookonChain , a wallet named LeBron flipped a $1 million USD Coin investment into $2 million by purchasing 4.52 million tokens minutes after it launched. The issue of insider trading is the latest development to raise suspicion within the crypto community. Issues arising from the token’s allocation also persist. The CEO of Web3 security firm QuillAudits, Preetam Rao, expressed concerns about the allocation structure and purpose. “Eighty percent of the supply is locked for CIC Digital, a company owned by the Donald Trump Revocable Trust. This is the same entity that launched Trump NFT Trading Cards three years ago. The website says it’s ‘not an investment but a show of support,” he said. Rao also added that the top 10 token holders share about 89% of the entire supply, and the developers are yet to share any details about the liquidity pool burn status. In addition, he noted that the launch was done in an Asian morning timezone, calling the president’s motive into question. “Interestingly, the token was launched in an Asian morning time zone. It feels like this is just a way for Trump to make money,” he added. Bitcoiners criticize launch as TRUMP goes mainstream The Bitcoin community has criticized Trump’s decision to launch his Solana-based memecoin, calling the move opportunistic and fundamentally against what Bitcoin stands for. Swan Bitcoin vice president of revenue, Brandon Quittem, highlighted that the token is nothing like Bitcoin. “Trump coin is such an extreme case of shitcoinery that it will ultimately help differentiate Bitcoin further. Trumpcoin is a get-rich-quick scheme, it’s nothing like Bitcoin,” he said. Vice president of research at Riot Platforms, Pierre Rochard also gave his opinion, noting that Bitcoin’s fundamental design is what sets it apart from these tokens. “The Bitcoin system as a whole is engineered to maximize long-term reliability, that’s why BTC isn’t just another ‘memecoin token’,” he said. Meanwhile, the popularity of the token has surged after popular crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance announced its listing. According to CoinGecko , there has been some heavy activity related to the token in the last 24 hours. Bitget leads the pack at $864.9 million, followed by MEXC at $842.7 million, and KuCoin at $445.2 million. At the time of writing, TRUMP is trading at $64, up by 170% in the last 24 hours. The surge also affected the Solana ecosystem, with its largest DEX Raydium seeing $25 million in fees and $2.85 million in revenue. According to DefiLlama, the figures are the highest recorded on the platform. Moonshot also processed $400 million in volume over the last 12 hours, breaking other records and recording over 200,000 new users on-chain. Amid the frenzy, users were speculating the potential of a new USA coin in development. However, Eric Trump dismissed the rumor as fake news.

Many Claims Are Circulating,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/did-donald-trump-really-buy-solana-sol-many-claims-are-circulating/,"As it is known, the new President of the United States, Donald Trump, launched a memecoin yesterday and made a big splash in the cryptocurrency market. After examining onchain data, it was claimed today that Trump's wallets started actively purchasing Solana. So how true is this claim? Looking at the data, we see that Trump is constantly transferring liquidity to TRUMP pools on Meteora, a memecoin launch platform. However, the fees accumulated in these pools are withdrawn by the team and Solana is actively purchased. However, there is one more detail. It was observed that the team, which was seen to have purchased a total of $7 million worth of SOL, sent these SOL coins directly to OKX and probably sold them. In other words, it seems that Trump and his team have no intention of accumulating SOL in the current situation. Related News: Analysis Company Claims: ""If Bitcoin Crosses This Level, It Will Pave The Way Up To $ 161 Thousand, But If Not..."" However, a recent article in the New York Post claimed that Trump was open to the use of US-based cryptocurrencies such as SOL and XRP as a strategic reserve in the US. Considering that Trump launched his latest memecoin on the Solana network, it can be said that he is at least more positive about SOL than other cryptocurrencies. *This is not investment advice.

Specifically, an analysis by prominent cryptocurrency expert Ali Martinez observed that XRP has broken out of a bullish flag patter n—an indication that the asset might confirm a continuation of its prior uptrend after a prolonged consolidation, he said in an X post on January 19. This breakout signals that XRP’s price could climb higher, potentially targeting $4 in the coming days. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts A bullish flag forms after a sharp rally, where the price consolidates in a rectangular pattern as traders pause. A breakout above the upper trendline points to renewed momentum, often matching the initial rally’s height. Martinez’s analysis suggests that XRP’s recent breakout aligns with these patterns, potentially driving the token to $4, a gain of over 20% from its current price. For the long term, Martinez noted that XRP could potentially target the $15 mark after breaking out of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the monthly chart. This pattern typically indicates market indecision, but once a breakout occurs, it leads to a notable price trend. XRP price analysis chart.

This technical pattern, characterized by tight consolidation following a steep rally, often signals the continuation of an upward trend. XRP price analysis chart.

A breakout above the pennant’s upper trendline could see the token targeting $3.60 or higher, based on the height of the prior rally. Overall, XRP has witnessed bullish momentum in recent months after breaking out of a prolonged consolidation below the $1 mark. The asset’s current price movement hinges on several factors, including regulatory and political developments. Notably, its recent momentum was partly inspired by the election of Donald Trump , who is considered bullish for digital currencies. At the same time, Gary Gensler’s exit as the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is seen as another bullish factor for the token. The SEC’s case against Ripple has been widely regarded as a significant inhibitor of XRP’s price growth. Nevertheless, before the new administration takes office, the SEC remains persistent in pursuing the legal matter. Specifically, the regulator recently appealed the case, challenging a July 2023 ruling that dismissed some claims. The appeal questions whether Ripple’s XRP sales to retail investors qualify as unregistered securities under the Howey Test, citing investor profit expectations tied to Ripple’s promotions. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, criticized the filing as a “rehash of failed arguments.” He believes the case will lose momentum under the Trump administration. As expected, the SEC’s appeal brief is a rehash of already failed arguments –and likely to be abandoned by the next administration. We’ll respond formally in due time. For now, know this: the SEC’s lawsuit is just noise.

These sealed records include confidential and personally identifiable details about Ripple’s summary judgment motion.

However, the cryptocurrency appears to be recovering nicely, reflecting the improving market climate. According to a popular crypto analyst on the social media platform X, the Chainlink price is readying for another leg up over the next few weeks. The LINK token has mostly struggled over the weekend, but this sluggishness has barely made a dent in the altcoin’s performance in the past week. Can LINK Price Reach A New All-Time High In This Cycle? In a Jan. 18 post on X, renowned crypto pundit Ali Martinez put forward an exciting projection for the price of Chainlink over the next few weeks. Martinez took to the social media platform to explain how the Chainlink price could grow by more than 100% in the current cycle. Related Reading: XRP Breakout Alert: Expert Predicts Potential Surge To $15 After Triangle Formation This bullish prediction is based on the formation of a bullish flag on the Chainlink price chart on the four-hour timeframe. In technical analysis, the bull flag pattern is often considered a strong continuation pattern for upward price trends. The bull flag pattern is characterized by a period of almost vertical upward price movement (the flagpole), which is then followed by a consolidation period (the flag itself). In some scenarios — as seen in the chart below, the flag could be a little tilted downward. As highlighted by Martinez, the LINK price seems to be breaking out of the consolidation range of the bull flag. A successful close above the upper boundary of the flag could see the price of Chainlink move significantly to the upside. The price target from the bull flag pattern is usually calculated by measuring the length of the initial flagpole and adding to the price at the breakout level. Using this method, the potential price target from this bullish setup sits around the $50 mark. This would represent over a 100% surge for LINK from the current price point. Moreover, this potential rally could see the Chainlink token return to its all-time-high price of $52.7, which was forged in May 2021. Chainlink Price At A Glance After briefly reaching above the $25 level in the early hours of Saturday, January 18, Chainlink has now retraced to around $24. As of this writing, the LINK token is valued at $24.13, reflecting an almost 6% downturn in the past 24 hours. Nevertheless, the Chainlink price is up by about 20% in the last seven days, according to data from CoinGecko. Related Reading: Chainlink Price Shines With 40% Rally — Is $28.5 Possible?

Trump managed to capture the crypto community’s attention via a very surprising and extraordinary move made on Friday evening. The meme coin that he and his team launched and promoted has skyrocketed in a spectacular fashion, becoming the second-largest in its field. Is that good or bad for the overall meme coin landscape and crypto as a whole? The Bad It has been less than two full days, but Official Trump, going under the ticker TRUMP , has become a top 20 altcoin on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap and is even close to cracking into the top 10 on the latter. Its market capitalization has shot up to nearly $15 billion on CMC, and it could be even higher by the time you read this article. This is a spectacular and never-before-seen type of surge for a cryptocurrency. It literally went from 0 to (almost) 100 in less than a whole weekend, making multiple savvy traders overnight millionaires . Its story continues to amaze even the most experienced crypto market participants, as it is now the second-largest rep of the meme coin space, which was already quite overcrowded. But its rise has been met with the demise of many alternatives. CoinGecko’s meme coin chart shows that almost all competitors have bled out since TRUMP’s launch on Friday evening. On a daily scale, DOGE is down by over 9%, SHIB has plummeted by 10%, and PEPE has slumped by over 16%. This only goes to show that crypto, and meme coins in particular, is a dog-eat-dog world. And the biggest and ‘baddest’ now is the Donald Trump-backed rep, which is taking everyone down. The Good Although it’s true that most meme coins, and even altcoins as a whole, are dumping hard today, TRUMP’s launch could actually be a blessing in disguise for them as well. After all, the upcoming US president has backed a crypto asset, which would probably mean that it will attract new investors to the market. The craze is more than obvious now and could continue for days and even weeks, especially since his inauguration is 24 hours away. However, those market participants will eventually start seeking alternatives once TRUMP’s rally reaches an exhaustion point, which could benefit some of its competitors or other alts. Let’s not forget that the president-elect made numerous pro-crypto promises during his campaign, which aim to propel the entire industry forward. In conclusion, it’s too early to say whether Donald Trump’s official entrance to the crypto asset world will have positive or negative long-term consequences for the market. However, it’s certain that it will impact it big time.

According to the SEC’s complaint , Nova Labs has been selling unregistered investment contracts since April 2019 through two main products: “Hotspots” — electronic devices that mine three different Nova Labs crypto assets (HNT, MOBILE, and IOT tokens), and a “Discovery Mapping Program” that rewards users with MOBILE tokens for providing network data. The complaint alleges that Nova Labs promised investors their Hotspots and participation in the Discovery Mapping Program would generate returns through the company’s efforts to build and expand a wireless network. Nova Labs claimed this would increase demand and value for their crypto tokens, leading to profits for investors. You might also like: TRUMP meme coin pushes Solana DEX volume, SOL price to all-time high Nova Labs made false statements about its wireless network In a serious allegation of fraud, the SEC states Nova Labs falsely told investors that major companies, including Nestlé, Salesforce, and Lime, were actively using its wireless network. The complaint reveals that when Nestlé and Lime discovered Nova Labs was publicly claiming these nonexistent relationships, they sent cease-and-desist letters to the company. The SEC charges that these false partnership claims were material to investors’ decisions to purchase Nova Labs’ Hotspots and company stock, violating antifraud provisions of federal securities laws. The case specifically cites violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 for unregistered securities offerings and alleged fraud violations under Section 17(a)(2). The Commission is seeking several remedies, including permanent injunctions, disgorgement of illegal profits with interest, and civil monetary penalties. This enforcement action continues the SEC’s focus on cryptocurrency companies operating outside securities registration requirements while allegedly making false claims to attract investors.

This transaction was made from the South Korean exchange Upbit to an unidentified wallet, raising speculation about potential market activity. Analysts predict that XRP may experience a significant price surge, with a potential breakout to $4. XRP Price Breaks Out of Bullish Chart Patterns Crypto analysts are closely monitoring XRP’s price movements, citing a bullish flag pattern as a possible indicator of further gains. This chart pattern, characterized by a sharp upward movement (flagpole) followed by a consolidation period (flag), suggests the continuation of XRP’s upward trajectory. According to Ali Martinez, a market analyst, the price of XRP has broken out from this bullish flag and may rise to $4. XRP broke the $3 mark for the first time since 2018, peaks at $3.40, then dropped to $3.16. According to analysts, if XRP continues to trade above $3.40 and breaks through this level again, it could signal that the expected increase has begun. On the flip side, a drop below the $2.91 level may open the way for testing the $2.59 support level. Symmetrical Triangle Breakout Signals Long-Term Growth On a larger scale, analysts are pointing to the fact that XRP price is trading out of a symmetrical triangle that has been in place for years. This pattern started right after the XRP reached its ATH of $3.80 in December 2017, which is a bullish pattern. As per Martinez, the long-awaited breakout was initiated by XRP’s recent rally from November 2024, indicating that the price may rise even more. He has set a price target of $15 that is five times of the current price and this could be the long term target. According to Martinez, the fact that XRP broke the $3 mark for the first time in seven years supports the idea that it should keep rising. Nonetheless, this positive outlook has attracted criticism. Some skeptics like the crypto commentator Tribal Trader has questioned the possibility of hitting $15 citing the market cap bar. At $15 per coin, XRP’s market capitalization would be over $860 billion, more than double that of Ethereum right now. Martinez retaliated that with a market capitalization of $180 billion, XRP already has a market capitalization greater than the financial behemoth, BlackRock. Optimism Builds as XRP ETF Approval Looms XRP investors’ confidence has been boosted further by the possibility of the U.S. approving XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This optimism comes after Ripple emerging victorious in a lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2024. Even though the SEC has moved to appeal the decision , experts are positive that with a crypto-friendly chairman expected to join the SEC soon, Ripple will find better luck. If the regulatory climate becomes more favorable for cryptocurrencies, then it could also mean the approval of XRP ETFs, which could in turn push the price even higher. Transaction volumes for XRP have been on the rise in the past few weeks, which is a sign of interest from investors. The cryptocurrency has appreciated by more than 560% since November 2024 and the market capitalization has more than doubled in this time.

With so many coins popping up daily, it’s tough to figure out where to put your cash. Big names like Monero and XRP have been around, making headlines for their unique tech and market moves. But the real question is, are they still worth betting on, or is there something fresher and more rewarding out there? Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a next-gen blockchain project that’s shaking things up. While Monero focuses on privacy and XRP aims for lightning-fast bank transactions, Qubetics is solving real-world problems by making cross-border transactions seamless and affordable. Oh, and did we mention their presale is on fire right now? Every week before Sunday, they’re offering a 10% discount, and after that, prices shoot up. This might be your shot to get in early on something big. Qubetics Is Redefining Cross-Border Transactions Let’s be real—sending money across borders can be a nightmare. High fees, slow processing times, and confusing systems leave people frustrated. Businesses struggle too, especially small ones trying to expand globally. This is where Qubetics steps in. It’s not just another blockchain project; it’s a game-changer in how we move money across countries. Imagine you’re a freelance graphic designer in the U.S. working with clients in Europe. Normally, you’d have to deal with PayPal’s fees or bank wire charges, eating into your profits. With Qubetics, you can get paid almost instantly with minimal fees, making your hustle more rewarding. For businesses, especially those sourcing products internationally, this is huge. They can pay suppliers in different countries without waiting days or paying sky-high fees. What makes this possible is Qubetics’ cutting-edge blockchain tech . Their system seamlessly connects multiple blockchains, eliminating the middlemen who slow things down and charge extra. On top of that, Qubetics has partnered with SWFT Blockchain, enhancing their wallet’s cross-chain capabilities. This means faster, smoother, and safer transactions, whether you’re sending $10 or $10,000 across borders. If you want to learn more about how Qubetics is changing the game, check out this video . Qubetics Presale Is Heating Up Now, here’s where it gets exciting. Qubetics is currently in its 17th presale stage , and the price sits at $0.0501 . So far, they’ve raised over $9.8 million , with more than 14,800 holders and a whopping 423 million $TICS tokens already sold. But here’s the catch—each presale stage only lasts 7 days, and every Sunday at midnight, the price increases by 10%. So if you jump in before Sunday, you’re basically getting a sweet discount. Let’s break it down. Say you throw in $500 now—you’re getting more tokens than you would if you waited until Monday. Considering projections that $TICS could hit $1 or even $5 in the future, that’s serious ROI. This limited-time discount creates serious FOMO, and honestly, it should. Investors who recognize the potential of Qubetics now could be the ones laughing all the way to the bank later. Why Monero Continues to Be a Privacy Powerhouse If privacy is your top concern in crypto, Monero (XMR) has probably been on your radar. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have public ledgers, Monero hides everything—sender, receiver, and the amount sent. This makes it the go-to choice for people who value privacy in a world where surveillance is everywhere. But Monero isn’t just for the privacy-obsessed. Small businesses, freelancers, and everyday users are starting to catch on. Think about it: would you want every payment you make to be public? Probably not. Monero solves that problem. It’s becoming especially popular in countries with unstable governments or strict regulations, where financial privacy is more than just a preference—it’s a necessity. Recently, Monero’s community has been pushing for updates that make transactions even faster and cheaper. This focus on staying ahead of the privacy game has helped Monero maintain its spot as a major player in the crypto market. Why this coin made it to this list: Monero’s commitment to privacy and ongoing tech upgrades make it a solid bet for anyone looking to invest in crypto with real-world utility. XRP’s Push to Dominate Global Payments XRP isn’t new, but it’s still one of the most talked-about cryptos. Created by Ripple Labs, XRP’s mission is to help banks and financial institutions make fast, cheap, and secure global transactions. Traditional banks take days to move money internationally, and fees stack up. XRP fixes that with its insanely quick settlement times—transactions complete in seconds with almost zero fees. Despite its legal battles with the SEC, XRP has held its ground and even gained traction. Ripple’s partnerships with big banks and financial institutions worldwide show that they’re still a powerhouse. Recently, Ripple expanded into regions like Asia and the Middle East, where cross-border payments are a big deal. This could drive massive adoption in the coming years. Plus, Ripple is working on integrating XRP into central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), which could take the coin’s use case to another level. Imagine XRP becoming the backbone of digital payments globally—that’s not far-fetched. Why this coin made it to this list: XRP’s real-world partnerships and global payment solutions make it a strong contender for long-term growth, especially as it pushes through regulatory hurdles. The Best Time to Act Is Now If you’re serious about finding the Top Coins to Invest in Today, you can’t afford to ignore what’s happening right now. Monero is crushing it in the privacy sector, and XRP is making bold moves in global finance. But Qubetics? That’s where things get spicy. With its focus on solving the nightmare of cross-border payments and a presale that’s heating up, it’s the kind of project that could explode in value. The best part? You’ve still got time to jump into the Qubetics presale before this Sunday and snag that 10% discount. Once the weekend’s over, the price goes up, and so does the FOMO. Whether you’re looking for privacy with Monero, financial infrastructure with XRP, or next-gen solutions with Qubetics, now’s your moment. Don’t sit this one out—take action, make a move, and set yourself up for serious gains.

With its presale raising $11.3 million at $0.00525 per token, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as the project to watch in 2025. Notecoin Niche Player With Limited Growth Potential Notcoin (NOT), a community-driven cryptocurrency that originated from a viral Telegram game, has experienced significant growth since its inception. In mid-2024, it reached an all-time high of $0.02836, with a market capitalization exceeding $1 billion. However, recent market trends indicate a decline, with the current price around $0.0066 and a market cap of approximately $677 million. Despite its initial popularity, Notcoin's niche appeal and limited utility beyond its gaming origins may constrain its long-term growth potential. The cryptocurrency market's volatility further adds to the uncertainty surrounding Notcoin's future performance. Investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before considering involvement with such niche digital assets. Why Investors Are Turning to Lightchain AI Lightchain AI is redefining what's possible in the blockchain world.

(ChatGPT Analyzes),https://cryptopotato.com/can-cardano-ada-flip-solana-sol-this-cycle-chatgpt-analyzes/,"TL;DR Cardano’s strong community, potential partnerships, and ecosystem upgrades could boost its market performance against Solana. Analysts forecast significant gains for ADA, with some seeing a potential rally like the one experienced by Ripple’s XRP. Analyzing the Chances The cryptocurrency market has pumped impressively in the past few days, with Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) being some of the best performers. While both assets are currently among the top 10 biggest digital assets in terms of market capitalization, SOL has a serious lead over its rival. We decided to ask ChatGPT whether ADA can erase that gap and surpass its competitor during this bull run cycle. For starters, we have to mention that the two cryptocurrencies have charted similar gains in the last week, meaning that their progress is currently going hand in hand. Yet, SOL broke above during the TRUMP craze and marked a new all-time high of over $290. However, the AI-powered chatbot estimated that several factors could help ADA outperform SOL. First, it mentioned the strong community base behind Cardano, “which helps sustain interest and development activity.” Second, ChatGPT claimed that ADA could experience a solid rally if the entity behind it inks important collaborations in the following months. As CryptoPotato recently reported , there have been increased rumors of an upcoming partnership between Ripple and Cardano. Additionally, Charles Hoskinson (Cardano’s founder) revealed his intentions to work alongside Trump’s administration to create a comprehensive and possibly more favorable regulatory environment for the crypto industry. Lastly, ChatGPT reminded that Cardano’s ecosystem is set to undergo some serious developments this year and that potential progress might positively affect the market performance of its native token. Some of the improvements involve the Hydra scaling solution. To explore other planned upgrades, please check out our detailed video below: ADA Price Forecasts Multiple market observers think Cardano’s coin might pump substantially in the foreseeable future. X user CryptoBullet assumed that ADA could mimic XRP’s impressive spike. Recall that the price of Ripple’s native token recently skyrocketed to almost $3.40, standing just 1% away from its ATH registered seven years ago. Its weekly increase equals over 40%. Whale Insider and Tom Crown also gave their two cents .

Generally speaking, coins being sent to exchanges is bearish since it implies more of the supply is available to be sold off on the open market.

Marketed through Trump’s social media accounts, especially Truth Social and X, $TRUMP quickly went viral, garnering significant enthusiasm as the buzz around his imminent inauguration continues to captivate the broader crypto market.

Go to https://t.co/GX3ZxT5xyq — Have Fun! pic.twitter.com/flIKYyfBrC — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2025 While it generated a bit of criticism, with some even calling it a potential rug pull, $TRUMP has been a standout performer since its debut, flipping the likes of Bonk, Dogwifhat, Pudgy Penguins, and Floki Inu to break into the top four list of the largest meme coins by market cap. At the time of writing, the Solana meme coin is trading around $25, up by a whopping 11,000% from its debut price. While its market cap has already dropped below the $6 billion mark, $TRUMP still remains the top crypto gainer over the past 24 hours. Degen investors are buzzing over this strong performance though some still seek clarity on whether Trump actually promoted this project or his accounts were compromised. Is $TRUMP the best Solana meme coin to buy now? What is $TRUMP? $TRUMP, according to its website (GetTrumpMemes), is inspired by the iconic “Fight, Fight, Fight” rallying statement made by Donald Trump during his life-threatening experience at a campaign in Pennsylvania on July 13, 2024. It is described as a way through which supporters of the President-elect can engage with his political brand in the digital realm, especially as he warms up to champion the growth of cryptocurrencies in the United States. $TRUMP’s announcement on Trump’s social media accounts first appeared on Truth Social, encouraging users to visit GetTrumpMemes to acquire the tokens. A similar message was eventually shared on his verified X account. Promoted as the official Trump meme coin, these announcements have been met with plenty of skepticism, with some notable persons questioning the legitimacy of the project. There are also concerns as to whether Trump’s accounts have been compromised though no official retraction or clarification from his team yet. here’s the $TRUMP distribution BEFORE launchnotice anything? 👀 pic.twitter.com/khKX9du9lA — Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) January 18, 2025 Another pronounced concern pointing to potential red flags with $TRUMP is its distribution before launch. Bubblemaps, a top-tier auditing tool for DeFi tokens and NFTs, revealed the allocation of 80% of its 1 billion total supply to creators, which further raises the pessimism around the project. $TRUMP Price Prediction - Is The Solana Meme Coin A Good Investment? In spite of the uncertainty around the genuinity of this project, many meme coin traders are buying the coin in droves. Per Dexscreener data , the TRUMP/USDC trading pair has witnessed not less than 78,960 buy orders over the past 24 hours, compared to only 20,530 sell orders. Diving deeper, technical indicators on the 15-minute charts indicate that buyers are still exerting more pressure to gain bigger control over their seller counterparts. Nonetheless, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is well above the mean level of 60, suggesting that the token is not yet overbought. In terms of performance, the token’s price has seen a triple-digit increase in the last 24 hours, despite the noticeable downtrend in the broader market. The meteoric surge mirrors the strong influence of Donald Trump in the crypto space as well as the broader appeal of meme coins as investments that could generate significant returns within a short timeframe. Meanwhile, with Trump’s inauguration barely a few hours away, $TRUMP could even witness a bigger buying frenzy that would potentially shoot its price above $30. However, this prediction is only plausible, provided there is no retraction from his team concerning the project. In the event that Trump denies endorsing the project - which is not unlikely - it could dampen investors’ confidence in its potential and trigger massive selling pressure that could pull its price back below $1. However, considering the controversy surrounding the launch model of $TRUMP and its unclarified connection with Donald Trump, investors might seek out upcoming meme coin listings like Wall Street Pepe and Flockerz - two brand-new projects that have been making headlines due to their novel unique value propositions and rapidly growing communities. New Meme Coin Alternatives To $TRUMP - Wall Street Pepe & Flockerz Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) Thanks to its ruthless Wolf of Wall Street trading style, meme coin appeal, and impressive staking perks, Wall Street Pepe has been heating up the crypto space since landing on presale. The project’s major highlight stems from its plan to take away the control of the market from the corrupt whales and return it to the people. Basically, Wall Street Pepe is bringing together a team of small yet ambitious traders who are ready to move the market and optimize their returns in the next bull run. Members of the movement will enjoy exclusive access to elite market insights, strategies, and signals that can help them outtrade the whales. An insider group, similar to the ones accessible to whales, will also be created so that members can share potential market opportunities before they become public knowledge. Similarly, the project plans to organize trading competitions every week, where members can submit their successful trades for the purpose of earning big rewards. Another key attraction is its staking facility, which offers dynamic yet generous passive rewards. The aforementioned aspects of the project have been fueling its demand, allowing it to raise over $50 million to date. With various projections suggesting a prolonged bull run in 2025, market analysts have identified WEPE as the next 100x gem. Visit Wall Street Pepe Flockerz (FLOCK) With just a few days to the end of its viral presale, Flockerz has been making top headlines, with experts projecting between 10x to 50x post-launch gains for the token. At its core, this hen-themed project plans to bring the full promise of decentralization to the meme coin space. Crowned the people’s meme coin - a title once held by Dogecoin - Flockerz’s major appeal lies in its Vote-to-Earn technique - Flocktopia DAO - specially developed to give a voice to the community. This powerful solution will serve as a means through which members of the community can participate in decisions that could shape the future of the project, including future listings, use cases, partnerships, token burns, integrations, and more. In return, they get rewarded. An additional highlight is the staking feature, which still offers an annual percentage yield of over 260% at press time. Flockerz’s VTE and staking rewards make participation in the project even more valuable and stimulate interest in the token. With over $10.5 million already raised, experts are eyeing an explosive start for Flockerz when it eventually lands on exchanges in the coming days.

It surpassed Bonk, Dogwifhat, Pudgy Penguins, and Floki Inu, securing a spot among the top four meme coins by market cap. Currently trading at approximately $25, the Solana meme coin has surged by an astonishing 11,000% from its initial price. Although its market cap has dipped below $6 billion, $TRUMP continues to be the leading crypto gainer over the past 24 hours. Investors, particularly those with a high-risk tolerance, are buzzing about its impressive performance, though some remain uncertain if Trump genuinely supports the project or if his accounts were hacked. Is $TRUMP currently the best Solana meme coin to invest in? Understanding $TRUMP According to its website, GetTrumpMemes, $TRUMP draws inspiration from Donald Trump's memorable ""Fight, Fight, Fight"" slogan during a perilous campaign event in Pennsylvania on July 13, 2024. The coin aims to offer supporters of the President-elect a means to engage with his political brand in the digital landscape, especially as he gears up to foster the growth of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. The initial $TRUMP announcement appeared on Trump's social media, initially on Truth Social, inviting users to get the tokens through GetTrumpMemes. This message later appeared on his verified X account. Marketed as the official Trump meme coin, these posts have met with skepticism, with some questioning the project's authenticity. Concerns about whether Trump's accounts were hacked remain, as his team has not issued any clarifications. here’s the $TRUMP distribution BEFORE launchnotice anything? 👀 pic.twitter.com/khKX9du9lA — Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) January 18, 2025 Significant concern arises from $TRUMP's distribution model before launch. Bubblemaps, a leading DeFi token and NFT auditing tool, disclosed that 80% of its total 1 billion supply was allocated to creators, further fueling doubts about the project's legitimacy. $TRUMP Price Forecast - Is the Solana Meme Coin Worth Investing In? Despite the ambiguity surrounding the project's authenticity, many meme coin enthusiasts are heavily investing in it. According to Dexscreener , the TRUMP/USDC trading pair has recorded over 78,960 buy orders in the past day, against just 20,530 sell orders. Upon closer inspection, technical indicators on the 15-minute charts show that buyers are still applying pressure to dominate sellers. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains above the 60 mark, indicating that the token hasn't reached overbought levels yet. In terms of its recent performance, the token's value has experienced a triple-digit increase over the last 24 hours, defying the general downtrend in the market. This rapid rise reflects Trump's significant influence in the crypto world and the broader appeal of meme coins as potentially lucrative investments. With Trump's inauguration just hours away, a further surge in $TRUMP's buying activity could push its price past $30. However, this is contingent on his team not retracting support for the project. If Trump disavows the project, which is a real possibility, it could undermine investor confidence and lead to significant selling pressure, potentially driving its price below $1. Given the controversy surrounding $TRUMP's launch and its uncertain ties to Donald Trump, investors might turn to upcoming meme coin releases such as Wall Street Pepe and Flockerz , both of which are gaining traction due to their unique value propositions and rapidly expanding communities. Exploring New Meme Coin Options: Wall Street Pepe & Flockerz Introducing Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) Wall Street Pepe is making waves in the crypto world with its aggressive Wolf of Wall Street trading style, meme appeal, and enticing staking rewards. The project is focused on redistributing market power from corrupt whales back to the people. Wall Street Pepe brings together a group of small but determined traders ready to influence the market and maximize their gains in the next bull market. Members will gain privileged access to elite market insights, strategies, and signals to help them outmaneuver bigger players. An exclusive group, akin to those available to whales, will be established for sharing potential market opportunities before they are publicly disclosed. Additionally, the project will host weekly trading competitions where participants can submit their successful trades to earn significant rewards. The staking facility is another major draw, offering dynamic and ample passive returns. These features have been driving demand for the project, helping it raise over $50 million so far. With predictions of an extended bull run in 2025, market experts are eyeing WEPE as a potential 100x opportunity. Visit Wall Street Pepe Flockerz (FLOCK) Overview As its viral presale nears its conclusion, Flockerz has captured the spotlight, with experts forecasting post-launch gains of 10x to 50x for the token. This hen-themed initiative aims to fully realize decentralization in the meme coin sector.

The SEC claims that Helium’s Nova Labs broke several statutes and intends to hold it responsible for violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC seeks permanent and conduct-based injunctions, ejection of ill-gotten gains, pre-judgment interest, and civil penalties. The Nova Labs trial will begin after Gary Gensler’s tenure The SEC has alleged that since April 2019, Nova Labs has defrauded the public in several ways by making unregistered offers and securities sales. The firm offered and sold electronic devices called “Hotspots” that mined Nova Labs’ crypto assets. Moreover, Nova Labs sold “Discovery Mapping,” a program where users can exchange their private data for Nova Labs’ crypto assets. Investors are vulnerable to unregistered securities since they can lose layers of protection while transacting. It is very difficult to identify clear money trails or even track an investment if it’s failing. The SEC had previously brought many such lawsuits under Gary’s leadership. Nova Labs was also charged with issuing materially false and deceptive statements to lure prospective investors. According to the SEC, Nova Labs lied that prominent companies like Lime, Nestlé, and Salesforce are using its wireless network for their operations. However, upon investigation, it was clear that these firms were not relying on this network. SEC’s new team may close several cases in 2025 Paul Atkins, Trump’s crypto-friendly pick for SEC chair and former agency commissioner, is widely expected to end a crypto crackdown led by President Biden’s Democratic SEC chair, Gary Gensler. However, it is unclear when the Senate will confirm him. The Security and Exchange Committee leadership is bound to change as Gary Gensler steps down on January 20. With the new pro-crypto chair, discussions are underway about freezing cases that are not fraud-related. Steps to freeze these actions are expected through policy adjustments that may be more favorable compared to the outgoing regime. Trump, a vocal pro-crypto president, has maintained his support for digital assets and is considering the idea of a Bitcoin reserve. According to Reuters, the SEC may review its court cases and proceed with only fraud-related cases in the first few days after President-elect Donald Trump assumes office on January 20. It is unclear if the Nova Lab case will continue or will be among the few that will be nixed. The report suggests that SEC Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda — both Republicans, like Trump — could review the regulator’s rules on the definition of securities and ongoing court cases with crypto firms.

One project rapidly gaining attention is Lightchain AI , a cutting-edge platform combining blockchain with artificial intelligence. With its presale raising $11.3 million, Lightchain AI’s innovative features are attracting traders from TON and UNI, signaling a potential shift in the market. TON and UNI Established Giants Facing New Competition Toncoin (TON) and Uniswap (UNI) are key players in the cryptocurrency market. TON, the native token of The Open Network, is expanding its ecosystem with initiatives like The Open League, which rewards community participation. Collaborations, such as with Jupiter to build a new liquidity aggregator, aim to boost DeFi capabilities within TON. Uniswap, a top decentralized exchange, continues to lead in the DeFi space as a go-to platform for token swaps. However, both face growing competition from new projects offering advanced technologies and unique features. To stay ahead, TON and UNI must keep innovating and adapting in the ever-changing crypto landscape. Lightchain AI Redefining Blockchain with Artificial Intelligence Lightchain AI sets itself apart by integrating artificial intelligence into blockchain technology, enabling the creation of AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps). One of Lightchain AI’s standout features is its emphasis on secure and scalable AI computations, allowing businesses to optimize data handling while maintaining privacy. This functionality goes beyond the capabilities of TON and UNI, providing a fresh perspective on how blockchain can be used to address global challenges. The platform’s interoperability with other blockchain networks further enhances its appeal, making it easy for developers and businesses to adopt its technology without disrupting existing systems. For TON and UNI traders, this versatility represents an opportunity to invest in a project with long-term growth potential.

Lightchain AI’s presale success , raising $11.3 million, demonstrates strong investor confidence in its innovative technology and future prospects.

While SUI signals optimism and SHIB enjoys a bullish outlook, Web3Bay takes the lead by solving e-commerce pain points with blockchain innovation. Unlike speculative assets, Web3Bay delivers a decentralized e-commerce platform that addresses real-world challenges like high fees and centralized control. With $830,000 raised and over 215 million tokens sold at $0.004562625, Web3Bay offers an unparalleled 6,430% ROI potential. This combination of practicality and profitability positions Web3Bay as a leader in the next wave of blockchain innovation. SUI Crypto Sees Increased Whale Accumulation Amid Market Optimism Sui (SUI) has recently attracted significant attention from major investors, commonly referred to as ""whales."" Reports indicate a notable increase in large-scale acquisitions of SUI crypto, suggesting growing confidence in its potential. This surge in interest aligns with broader market trends, as cryptocurrencies like Solana and XYZVerse also experience heightened whale activity. Such movements often precede bullish market phases, indicating that influential investors anticipate favorable performance from these assets. As of January 18, 2025, SUI is trading at $4.66, reflecting a slight decrease of 0.05477% from the previous close. The intraday high reached $4.96, with a low of $4.61. The increasing whale accumulation of SUI crypto underscores a positive sentiment among large investors, potentially signaling a forthcoming upward trend for the asset. Shiba Inu Price Surges Amid 883% Spike in Outflows: What's Driving the Trend? Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen its outflows soar by 883% this week, with large holder transactions increasing from 647 billion SHIB to 1.11 trillion SHIB in a single day, according to IntoTheBlock. While typically signaling profit-taking, SHIB’s price surged nearly 10% within 24 hours, indicating strong demand absorbing these sell-offs. The SHIB price climbed from $0.000022 to $0.0000246, reflecting the broader crypto market rebound. Key metrics such as trading volume and whale activity have also risen, supporting this upward trend. SHIB is now up 14% weekly and could see further gains if it breaks above the 50-day SMA at $0.00002482, targeting $0.00003 and beyond. On the downside, strong support at the 200-day SMA around $0.000019 provides a safety net for the bulls. With the RSI above the midpoint, Shiba Inu maintains a bullish outlook. Web3Bay: The Crypto Marketplace Revolutionizing Online Retail Web3Bay is reshaping e-commerce by combining blockchain innovation with practical, user-focused solutions. Traditional platforms impose high fees and centralized control, but Web3Bay offers a decentralized alternative that prioritizes security, transparency, and cost-effectiveness. The platform’s 3BAY token is the backbone of its ecosystem, offering perks like staking rewards, governance rights, and a 5% discount on marketplace transactions. The ongoing presale has already reached its fourth stage, raising over $830,000 and selling more than 215 million tokens at a price of $0.004562625. With each stage, the token price increases by 15%, culminating in a launch price of $0.1959. This structured approach offers early investors a rare chance for a 6,430% return, making Web3Bay one of the most exciting investment opportunities in crypto today. Web3Bay’s roadmap is equally impressive. From decentralized governance through a DAO to plans for cross-chain compatibility and NFT integration, the platform is geared for long-term growth. Its scalability is powered by Layer-2 solutions, ensuring fast and seamless transactions even during high demand. Web3Bay isn’t just a marketplace; it’s a glimpse into the future of decentralized, borderless e-commerce. Conclusion While SUI’s whale-driven momentum and Shiba Inu’s enduring appeal capture attention, both rely heavily on market sentiment. Web3Bay, by contrast, combines blockchain innovation with tangible utility, creating a decentralized e-commerce ecosystem that redefines global commerce. From staking rewards to NFT integration and DAO-driven governance, Web3Bay’s roadmap promises scalability and long-term growth. Investors who act now can secure 3BAY tokens at their lowest presale price before the $0.1959 launch. For those seeking a high-growth investment that goes beyond hype, Web3Bay is the ultimate choice to align profitability with purpose. The future of decentralized commerce is here—don’t miss out.

In a detailed Twitter message, Deutscher outlined how the launch could reshape the industry, with significant bull and bear implications. Before presenting his analysis of the potential impact, Deutscher said: “The TRUMP launch changed the nature of crypto in many ways. But it's not as simple as 'rise' or 'fall'. It's a nuanced issue.” Deutscher listed several key reasons why the launch of TRUMP will have a positive impact on the crypto market: Bullish on Solana (SOL): With Solana being chosen as the platform for TRUMP, the network has been unofficially dubbed “America’s chain,” which could boost its reputation and adoption. Pro-crypto stance solidifies: Trump’s endorsement of a cryptocurrency signals his strong support for the industry, potentially influencing pro-crypto policies in the US. Potential policy supports: Deutscher thinks Trump’s launch could pave the way for policies in favor of Bitcoin (BTC), real-world assets (RWA), decentralized finance (DeFi), and altcoins. Rising interest: With apps like Moonshot climbing the app store rankings, crypto could see a wave of mainstream interest, especially as the launch receives more media coverage in the coming weeks. Green light for innovation: Deutscher noted that this move could open the door for more capital inflow and innovation in the US crypto market, but he warned that there is a flip side to this argument. Related News: Analysis Company Claims: ""If Bitcoin Crosses This Level, It Will Pave The Way Up To $ 161 Thousand, But If Not..."" While acknowledging the positives, Deutscher also identified potential downsides to Trump’s memecoin launch: Liquidity concerns: TRUMP’s rise could take liquidity away from other on-chain altcoins, potentially hurting their performance. Reputational risk in Congress: The launch could negatively impact crypto’s image among policymakers and possibly hinder Trump’s ability to enact pro-crypto legislation. Dilution via the memecoin craze: TRUMP’s success could inspire a wave of similar launches by celebrities and public figures, leading to market dilution despite increased exposure and engagement. Acceleration of the market cycle: Deutscher warned that increased volatility often precedes market tops and suggested that the launch could signal an overheated market. Bearish trend for Ethereum (ETH): Solana’s prominence in this context could further weaken Ethereum’s position, leading to increased selling. Deutscher noted that the full impact of TRUMP's launch will become clearer in the coming days, especially as Trump himself speaks and outlines his first steps as part of this initiative. *This is not investment advice.

One of them, Coffeezilla, a YouTuber popular for exposing shady dealings, has alerted people in view of their concerns that insiders get 80% of this TRUMP coin supply, which means only a tiny fraction is available to the public, which could lead to a market manipulation scenario. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve In The US: 65% Chance It Happens In 2025 According to Coffeezilla, this structure shows the project as more of a “grift” than a legitimate crypto venture. Insiders Control The Majority One major red flag is the concentration of 80% of Trump Coin’s total supply. This disproportionate allocation means that a select group of people, likely developers or influencers involved with the coin, could control the vast majority of the token’s value. For the general public, this spells trouble, as the market could be easily manipulated by those holding most of the tokens. Red Flags Concerning Transparency But given the fast-speed promotion, issues of transparency revolve around actual utility. The notion that a meme coin would carry significant weight in the market is unsettling for some analysts, especially when it lacks clear backing or innovation. While Trump Coin has been verified on the Phantom Wallet, critics argue that this doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a safe investment. My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2025 The project has been criticized for possibly taking advantage of its investors. Coffeezilla’s criticism focuses on the fact that such ventures usually take advantage of the excitement and hype of popular figures such as billionaire Donald Trump, making it easier to encourage people to invest in tokens of little value. Critics argue that this is more about making fast money for the insiders rather than creating long-term value for the crypto community. Potential Impact On Crypto Reputation Attention given to Trump Coin may also mark a stain to the crypto sector. Projects like this, which focus on short-term gains, often deter new investors from taking the crypto market seriously.

It seems that this new venture will set off controversy and debate in a digital currency landscape already inflamed by volatility and other related factors. Coffeezilla is well-known for his stinging exposés of purported cryptocurrency scams, such as Andrew Tate and Hawk Tuah Girl.

Each token has its strengths, from AVAX’s focus on fast transactions to TRX’s high profitability and TON’s growing activity. However, a newer player, Rollblock (RBLK), is quickly capturing the spotlight. With its unique GambleFi concept, booming casino platform, and innovative revenue-sharing model, analysts believe Rollblock could outshine these giants and become the top choice for investors in 2025. Avalanche Poised for a Potential Breakout With its price down 28% over the previous month to trade at $36.70, Avalanche has been trapped in a negative trend. At $35, the token is almost at a vital support level that may decide its next major price movement. Should buyers intervene and effectively defend this important level, Avalanche may develop a double-bottom pattern, therefore driving its AVAX price to $50, should the larger market turn positive. Avalanche may drop further, first trying $33.60, if the $35 support fails, however. In a worst-case scenario, continuous selling pressure might drive the token much down to $30.60 or less. Is Tron A Top Choice for Crypto Profitability? Though recently dropped 3.2% to $0.2525, TRX has been the most lucrative cryptocurrency among the top 50 assets. Outstanding rivals including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano, Tron's 156.16 million wallet addresses now show 95.73% in profit. Tron dominates profitability as just 1.15% of Tron addresses, or around 1.88 million, are at a loss. Tron's strength comes through in current market swings. Reflecting only a 1.4% dip in the previous 24 hours, the price of Tron slipped below $0.25 but has rebounded to $0.2642. A 31.75% increase in 24-hour trading volume to $924.19 million indicates a possible comeback and shows investor hope still strong. TON Experiences Sharp Price Drop Amid Increased Trading Activity CoinGecko claims that TON's price dropped significantly on January 17, 2025, from $5.20 to $4.80 in an hour. This quick TON drop draws attention to an abrupt loss of investor confidence after a market release. Reflecting a wave of sell-offs and increased market activity, trading volume rose from 10 million to 25 million TON over the same time. On Binance, the TON/USDT pair reflected this trend: the price reached $4.75 and trade volume surged TON by 11:00 AM UTC. Nansen's on-chain statistics showed a 20% rise in active addresses after an announcement, therefore indicating more market involvement in TON. Why Rollblock's RBLK Token is the Best Coin to Buy Now in 2025 Rollblock is revolutionizing the online gaming world with its unique GambleFi ecosystem, and its native token, $RBLK, is at the center of this innovation. Currently priced at just $0.046 during its presale token phase, $RBLK presents an unmatched opportunity for investors seeking a coin presale 2025 that combines real utility, growth potential, and revenue-sharing benefits. A thriving casino means increased revenue, which Rollblock strategically uses to buy back $RBLK tokens from the market.

As Rollblock’s revenues grow, so does the incentive for RBLK holders to remain engaged with the platform. The platform itself is already live and offers over 7,000 games alongside sports betting on thousands of global events, attracting a rapidly growing user base. Since the casino’s launch, registrations have increased by an impressive 30% month-over-month, further boosting its revenue streams. This continuous growth directly benefits RBLK holders by amplifying the buyback, burn, and staking reward mechanisms. Rollblock's tokenomics are meant to guarantee long-term sustainability and reciprocal advantages for all users, with a fixed quantity of 1,000,000,000 tokens 60% of which is earmarked for presale. Rollblock’s innovative approach to online gaming, its deflationary RBLK token, and rapidly growing user base make it the best coin to buy now. Early investors have the chance to benefit from the booming casino revenues, consistent token burns, and exceptional staking rewards. With RBLK, you’re not just buying a token—you’re investing in a platform designed for success and long-term growth. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

Each has its unique strengths: AVAX is known for fast transactions, TRX boasts high profitability, and TON is seeing increased activity. However, a fresh contender, Rollblock (RBLK), is quickly gaining traction. With its distinctive GambleFi model, thriving casino platform, and innovative revenue-sharing system, experts predict Rollblock could surpass these prominent tokens and become the preferred choice for investors by 2025. Avalanche on the Verge of a Breakthrough Avalanche has been caught in a downward spiral, with its value falling 28% last month to $36.70. The token is hovering near a critical support level at $35, which could determine its next significant price movement. If buyers step up and successfully defend this crucial point, Avalanche might form a double-bottom pattern, potentially pushing its AVAX price to $50, assuming the broader market turns favorable. However, if the $35 support collapses, Avalanche could slip further to $33.60. In a worst-case scenario, persistent selling pressure might drag the token down to $30.60 or lower. Is Tron Leading in Crypto Profitability? Despite a recent 3.2% dip to $0.2525, TRX remains the most profitable cryptocurrency among the top 50 assets. Surpassing rivals like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano, Tron's 156.16 million wallet addresses show an impressive 95.73% in profit. Tron leads in profitability, with only 1.15% of Tron addresses, or about 1.88 million, experiencing losses. Tron's resilience is evident in current market fluctuations. After a 1.4% decrease in the last 24 hours, Tron's price dipped below $0.25 but bounced back to $0.2642. A 31.75% surge in 24-hour trading volume to $924.19 million signals a potential rebound and indicates that investor confidence remains robust. TON Faces Steep Price Decline Amid Rising Trading Volume According to CoinGecko, TON's price plunged dramatically on January 17, 2025, dropping from $5.20 to $4.80 within an hour. This sudden fall highlights a rapid loss of investor confidence following a market announcement. Amidst a wave of sell-offs, trading volume soared from 10 million to 25 million TON during the same period. On Binance, the TON/USDT pair mirrored this pattern: the price hit $4.75 while trade volume surged by 11:00 AM UTC. Nansen's on-chain data revealed a 20% increase in active addresses after the announcement, suggesting heightened market engagement with TON.

The AI startup, which grew from a $500 million valuation at the start of 2024 to $9 billion by the end of it, submitted its proposal to ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company. The report said that the plan is to create a new mega-entity combining Perplexity, TikTok US, and multiple other financial backers. Per the plan, ByteDance’s existing investors would retain their stakes, while Perplexity would gain TikTok’s unmatched video platform. “The deal could bring more video integration to Perplexity while keeping ByteDance’s shareholders happy,” said CNBC. ByteDance’s refusal to outright sell TikTok US makes this merger proposal one of the few realistic options on the table. The report says the potential price tag for the deal is north of $50 billion, depending on which ByteDance investors decide to cash out and which stay on board. TikTok’s US survival Without assurances from the Biden administration that Apple, Google, and Oracle won’t face penalties for supporting TikTok, the app would go dark tomorrow. But Biden has remained silent. However, President-elect Donald Trump told NBC News that he’s “most likely” giving TikTok 90 extra days to figure things out once he’s sworn in on Monday. TikTok’s CEO, Shou Zi Chew, acknowledged Trump’s decision in a video posted Friday, saying, “I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.” The US government’s crackdown on TikTok allegedly comes from fears that its Chinese ownership is a major national security threat. Congressmen and intelligence officials have been warning us for months that the Chinese Communist Party could exploit TikTok for ‘espionage” or “propaganda.” ByteDance has repeatedly denied these allegations, insisting that the app operates independently of Beijing. But in March, Congress passed a law requiring ByteDance to either sell TikTok or face a nationwide ban. Interestingly, during his first term, Trump signed an executive order to ban TikTok, but courts blocked it. But earlier this year, he opposed Congress’s divest-or-ban measure, arguing that it unfairly benefited Facebook, which had banned him for two years. Now, as he prepares to take his Oval back, Trump has filled his administration with staunch China hawks. Among them is Mike Waltz, a Florida congressman and former Green Beret, who will serve as National Security Adviser. Waltz has vowed to keep TikTok operational but only under strict measures. Rush Doshi, a former Biden administration China expert, took to X (formerly Twitter) to call out ByteDance, writing, “TikTok had 268 days to sell itself so it wasn’t operated by China. That would have solved everything. But they didn’t even try. China wouldn’t let them.” He added that any fallout from a shutdown would be “on them.” Now ByteDance’s resistance to divestment and the tight timeline place the spotlight on Perplexity’s merger bid as a possible solution.

So, all you have is 3 days to join this one-of-a-kind Vote to Earn (V2E) decentralized meme coin. The V2E model looks to form a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) known as FlockTopia. The DAO puts the power of decision-making in the hands of the token-holder community. Each $FLOCK holder can vote on crucial decisions like key project developments, marketing strategies, token burn, expansion plans, and so on. This way, the power to decide the future of the project is in the hands of people who actually care and not a small group of insiders. Not only do you get to shape the path of the token, but you also gain $FLOCK rewards in the process. 25% of the total supply of Flockerz tokens is reserved for rewards for holders who actively participate through votes. Why Should You Buy $FLOCK Now? Available at a price of $0.0066883 per token, $FLOCK has already raised $10.7M in presale funding. Experts predict a high of $0.8 in 2025 with a potential low of $0.2. So, even at the lowest expected price, $FLOCK can still give you 2,900% returns. ClayBro, a popular crypto influencer, has also predicted that Flockerz can be the next 100x meme coin once listed on exchanges. Moreover, there are some very good reasons to believe this, too. For instance, Flockerz is a community-driven meme coin, and the token already has massive support on X and Telegram . With close to 31K followers on X , there are a lot of investors watching it keenly. Ever since the appointment of pro-crypto Donald Trump as the next president of the US, the crypto market has been booming. Bitcoin breached the $100,000 mark, and Solana ($SOL) has seen a 55% up move in the last 5 trading days. Reports predict a 3,000% increase in the price of Solana by the end of 2030. All in all, we could be standing at the start of another crypto bull run. This makes it important to identify multi-baggers early with massive returns potential. And $FLOCK is currently at the lowest price you can get. Once listed, the prices are expected to surge. A good thing about the project is that only 20% of the total supply has been offered for presale. This means developers are keen on maintaining the demand-supply ratio to create enough interest in the token. What’s more, 10% of the supply has been kept for maintaining liquidity on listing, saving investors from shocks of dumping. As $FLOCK’s whitepaper states, the project has been audited by Coinsult and SolidProof, both of which didn’t find any critical vulnerabilities. Buying $FLOCK is pretty straightforward, too. You just need to connect your wallet (our top recommendation for this is Best Wallet ) with the official $FLOCK presale website . Make sure there’s enough ETH, BNB, or USDT to complete the purchase. Next, enter the number of coins you need and approve the transaction from your wallet. That’s all you need to do to own one of the hottest meme presale coins . However, we advise you to do your own research before jumping in on the frenzy.

Ethereum’s Evolution: Why Ether Could Shine in the Next Market Cycle Ethereum is a groundbreaking blockchain platform that changed how we use digital technology. Created by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, it introduced smart contracts and a vast range of decentralized applications. These include finance tools and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon, which make transactions faster and cheaper. In 2022, Ethereum moved to a Proof-of-Stake system with the Merge, making it more efficient. The upcoming sharding upgrade aims to boost speed and lower costs even more. Ether (ETH), the platform’s native coin, is key to this system, used for transactions, staking rewards, and as a valuable asset. With ongoing improvements and strong community support, Ethereum shows great potential. Some predict that ETH could reach up to $6,580.53 next year, with a yearly low estimated at $2,700.31 in 2025. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum’s continuous development may enhance its appeal in the market. As the crypto world looks forward to the next Bitcoin halving, Ethereum’s advancements could lead to increased adoption and value. However, investing in cryptocurrencies comes with risks, and prices can change quickly. This is not financial advice, and it’s wise to research thoroughly before making investment decisions. Solana’s SOL Coin: Speeding Ahead in the Crypto Market Solana is a blockchain platform designed for speed and scalability. While platforms like Ethereum and Cardano are well-known, Solana sets itself apart by focusing on quick transactions and the ability to handle many operations at once. Developers can build apps on Solana using different programming languages, making it flexible and accessible. The SOL coin is the heart of this system. It powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who support the network. In today’s market, SOL looks promising. Unlike others that rely on complex methods to scale up, Solana keeps things straightforward, avoiding techniques like sharding. This simplicity makes it attractive to developers and investors alike. With its high-capacity network, Solana can host busy products and services without slowing down. As more projects turn to Solana for its speed and efficiency, the value of SOL could continue to grow. Conclusion Ethereum and Solana are on the rise, but XYZVerse shines as the first sports memecoin, uniting fans and targeting huge growth with a community-driven approach.

So, what’s igniting the XRP fire? Well, this altcoin is seeing skyrocketing transactions, among other bullish trends. Renowned market analyst Ali Martinez acknowledged , “The number of transactions over $1 million on the XRP network is on the rise, hitting 341 transactions in the past 24 hours.” Source: Santiment It, therefore, means that the presence of whales and institutional investors is heavily felt in the XRP ecosystem, depicting heightened confidence and interest. Is it a Matter of When XRP Hits a New All-Time High? XRP has significantly turned tables, given that it had been gridlocked in a stagnant symmetrical triangle for the better part of three years as the lawsuit between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intensified. XRP is currently trading at $3.12, a stone’s throw away from its all-time high (ATH) price of $3.84 set in January 2018. Therefore, it seems it’s not a matter of if but when XRP will reach new historical highs, given that it recently breached the psychological threshold of $3, a scenario last seen in 2018.

Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) token retreated to $0.00002099, down by 9%. Source: CoinGecko Its retreat mirrored that of other popular meme coins like Pudgy Penguins, Dogwifhat, Popcat, and Peanut the Squirrel. One potential reason for this price action is that some traders rotated from Shiba Inu to Official Trump ( TRUMP ), which has a fully diluted valuation of over $71 billion. Shiba Inu has several catalysts that may push its price higher. First, Bitcoin ( BTC ) continued rising and moved closer to the all-time high of $108,200. A move above its all-time high will likely draw crypto investors to other altcoins, including Shiba Inu. See below.

According to Shibburn , the burn rate jumped by 950% to over 30 million SHIB tokens, bringing the total number of Shiba Inu burned to 410 billion. Burning is a process that reduces the number of tokens in circulation by sending them to an inaccessible wallet. Third, Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 network, crossed a key milestone last week as its transaction count jumped above 800 million on Friday. According to Shibariumscan , the network’s transactions have now risen to 815 million as the number of addresses rose to 2.1 million. Shibarium’s success has a mild impact on Shiba Inu price because some of the BONE fees are converted into SHIB and incinerated. Meanwhile, on-chain data shows that the daily active address in Shiba Inu has grown by 54% in the last seven days, a sign of growing adoption. Shiba Inu price technical analysis SHIB price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the SHIB price made a bullish breakout last week but found a strong resistance at $0.000025. That was a crucial level since it was also the highest swing on Jan. 4. On the positive side, SHIB has remained above the 200-day moving average. It has also made a break and retest pattern, where an asset moves above a resistance point, then retests it and resumes the trend. In this case, Shiba Inu moved above the upper side of the falling wedge pattern and has now retested it. That could be a sign of a potential rebound. More gains will be confirmed if the coin moves above the key resistance at $0.000025. Such a move will point to more gains, potentially to $0.000033, its December high. Shiba Inu, created in August 2020 by the pseudonymous “Ryoshi,” has evolved from a meme coin into a utility-focused ecosystem. It includes ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange for trading, staking, and earning rewards, and Shibarium, a Layer 2 blockchain offering faster transactions and lower gas fees. The ecosystem also features LEASH and BONE tokens for governance and staking, and it is developing SHIB: The Metaverse , where users can buy virtual land.

Like other major cryptocurrencies, ADA has enjoyed the latest Trump-spurred upsurge, largely due to its parent company, Input Output Global (IOG) being a U.S.-based organization. As ADA strives to hold above $1, a veteran analyst has suggested that the token is poised for a “grand bull market” based on its bullish market structure. “Grand Bull Market” Underway For ADA: Brandt Prominent trader Peter Brandt said in a recent post on the X platform that irrespective of a parabolic altcoin season, Cardano has formed a price bottom as per its weekly chart. The trader noted that the crypto asset had established a double-bottom base, which held for over a year before recently soaring above the $0.81 mark. ADA bulls have turned this level into support, with the price seeing a “retest congestion.” “Make no doubt about it, Cardano $ADAUSD has bottomed for a grand bull market,” Brandt said. The confirmation of the bullish double-bottom base pattern could propel ADA’s price higher in the coming days. Another crypto analyst, Altcoin Sherpa, shared a similar view on ADA. Altcoin Sherpa said ADA’s chart “looks pretty strong.” He thinks Cardano will continue rising as long as other crypto majors assets continue to move higher. Cardano Tailwinds Forthcoming U.S. President Donald Trump is rumored to be open-minded about creating a strategic reserve with other US-based cryptocurrencies like Solana, USDC, and Ripple’s XRP. The reports have triggered speculations of a potential altcoin season in the near term. In November 2024, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson declared his intention to position himself as a recognized voice in President-elect Donald Trump’s ear when he assumes control of the White House on January 20. He added at the time: “I’m going to be spending quite a bit of time working with lawmakers in Washington, D.C., and quite a bit of time working with members of the [Trump] administration to help foster and facilitate, with other key leaders in [the] industry, crypto policy.” Moreover, Cardano has inched closer to its next major milestone on its path to fully decentralized governance. On Jan. 18, IOG approved the activation of the Plomin hard fork on the mainnet, scheduled for this month. As noted by IOG, this indicates that all conditions for the governance action stated by the Interim Constitution have been met. As such, Cardano’s (ADA) shift toward the Plomin stage is now deemed constitutional.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|TRADING|ALTCOIN|MARKET|FORKS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-19 13:52:35

Technical indicators as well as the price charts continue to give out selling signals. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as we shall explore in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2024 to 2030. It is expected that SNX will reach $44 by 2030. Why is SNX down? The cryptocurrency market is under bearish pressure, and SNX faces the same sentiment. However, it is discouraging that SNX is one of the best performers and has maintained its price level after December 21, 2024. The SNX price has decreased to $1.692; moreover, it has gained up to 7.14% of its value in the last 24 hours. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does not justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach $5 by 2026. Will SNX reach $10? According to SNX price prediction, SNX will reach the $10 level by the fourth quarter of 2028. The last time SNX was seen at the $10 level was November 2021. Will SNX reach $100? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next ten years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like $100 is too far-fetched. Does SNX have a good long-term Future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $16.37 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

Synthetix historic price sentiment SNX price history Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38.

Analyst Names the 2025 Altcoin Favorite!",https://nulltx.com/invest-1000-in-xrp-hbar-or-xyzverse-analyst-names-the-2025-altcoin-favorite/,"Choosing where to invest $1,000 in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency market can be a challenge. With numerous altcoins competing for attention, an analyst has spotlighted one that stands out for 2025. This article delves into the prospects of three contenders—XRP, HBAR, and XYZVerse—and reveals which one is projected to be the top performer. XYZ: The Next Meme Coin Champion Ready to Dominate 2025 The game is on, and XYZ is here to generate record profits with unstoppable momentum! This sensational all-sports meme token is poised to become the next big thing in 2025, capturing the attention of both crypto enthusiasts and sports fans worldwide. As it charges ahead, XYZ is set to deliver jaw-dropping gains, leaving the likes of BOME and WIF far behind. With eyes on a staggering 7,400% growth, XYZ is ready to claim the meme coin crown in the 2025 crypto bull marathon! Rule the game, cash in as the bets roll in XYZ is the star player in XYZVerse – an award-winning meme coin project that blends the sports thrill and meme culture. This community-centered ecosystem is the perfect playground for crypto degens and sports fans alike. Think back to Polymarket’s $1 billion trading volume during the US elections betting frenzy, and now, picture that on steroids with XYZVerse. With millions of sport bettors getting ready to jump in the action, opportunities for early investors in XYZ are really huge! XYZ is currently undervalued, and with major listings on the way, presale participants stand to secure life-changing gains. >>>Be Part of the 2025 Breakout Story—XYZ Is Waiting for You! XRP: The Borderless Coin Aiming to Revolutionize Digital Payments XRP is a cryptocurrency designed to make money move as fast as information. It runs on the XRP Ledger, a decentralized system without a central authority. Transactions are quick, low-cost, and secure. With XRP, you don’t need a bank account to send or receive funds. It’s open to everyone, borderless, and resists censorship or counterfeiting. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP started with 100 billion coins. They gave 80 billion to Ripple, a company working to improve the network and support the ecosystem. Ripple uses XRP to boost liquidity and help with currency exchanges. To control the supply, they’ve placed 55 billion XRP in escrow, releasing it slowly over time. The name XRP comes from “ripple credits,” showing its goal to make payments flow smoothly across different currencies. In the current market, XRP stands out for its speed and low transaction fees. Compared to other coins, it offers practical solutions for global payments. As digital transactions grow, XRP’s technology could make it an attractive option for those looking for efficient and affordable transfers. HBAR: The Fast and Eco-Friendly Crypto Taking On Bitcoin Hedera Hashgraph is a new kind of network that promises faster and cheaper transactions. Unlike traditional blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Hedera uses a different technology called hashgraph for its ledger. This means it doesn’t rely on miners, so it uses less energy and is better for the environment. HBAR is the native currency of this network. People use it to pay transaction fees and to keep the network secure through a Proof of Stake system. HBAR offers a more secure, fast, and cost-effective way to handle transactions and smart contracts. This makes it attractive for finance and other industries. While Hedera’s technology is innovative, it’s competing in a crowded market with big players like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Its patented technology might limit how the community can engage compared to open-source projects. However, Hedera has big plans and support from major companies. This could mean a bright future for HBAR as a unique platform in the crypto space. As the market looks for faster and greener options, HBAR might be a coin to watch in the current cycle. Conclusion XRP and HBAR are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out for 2025, blending sports and memes with a 20,000% growth target.

The TRUMP token launch caught the attention of the crypto market and could be behind Solana’s new price highs. Solana Price Hits New Record High The crypto market experienced a big surprise on Jan. 18 when the ‘official’ Trump (TRUMP) meme coin, endorsed by President-elect Donald Trump, debuted without prior notice. Despite the highly competitive memecoin market, TRUMP quickly reached a jaw-dropping market capitalization of $14.7 billion, according to CoinGecko. TRUMP is currently sitting at a price of about $73.27. The Solana token is now the 16th most valuable coin on the market. TRUMP was immediately listed on Bitget, Kraken, and KuCoin. The TRUMP token is set to soon be listed on major crypto exchanges, including Coinbase and Binance . Donald Trump’s son, Eric Trump, praised the launch on X, positing : “I am extremely proud of what we continue to accomplish in crypto. $Trump is currently the hottest digital meme on earth.” The meme coin’s outstanding debut sparked a rally in Solana’s SOL, pushing it to a fresh lifetime high of $293.31 — eclipsing its previous all-time high set in November. At press time, CoinGecko shows SOL up 16.4% on the day at a current price of $291.79. The Ethereum killer is the best-performing among the top 10 coins over the past 24 hours. SOL is the fourth-largest crypto with a market cap of $139 billion. SOL ETFs Next? Meanwhile, some crypto commentators expect a U.S.-listed spot Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) to be approved by the end of this year, thanks to the anticipations of a more pro-crypto White House after Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20. As ZyCrypto reported earlier, banking giant JPMorgan estimates that SOL-based products could attract between $3 billion and $6 billion within the first six to 12 months if approved. That said, whether SOL is classed as an unregistered security or a commodity by the new Securities and Exchange Commission commissioners will be pivotal in the ETF approval process.",Cryptocurrency|News|Donald Trump|SOL|Solana|trump,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-19 13:56:38

Title: Dogecoin: From Meme to Market Power Dogecoin started in 2013 as a playful spin on cryptocurrencies, featuring a Shiba Inu mascot. Its design stands out from Bitcoin due to its plentiful supply, with no maximum cap and 10,000 new coins every minute. Initially considered a “memecoin,” Dogecoin’s value soared in 2021, becoming a top ten cryptocurrency with a market cap over $50 billion. Social media, driven largely by Elon Musk, played a key role in this rise. Created as a joke by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, Dogecoin’s journey highlights the powerful role of community and social media in shaping financial markets. Its abundant supply and community support make it an intriguing option, especially during market surges. Shiba Inu: A Memecoin with Ethereum Backbone Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer known as Ryoshi. It is inspired by Dogecoin and runs on the Ethereum blockchain. SHIB began with one quadrillion tokens, with half sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin’s donation of his SHIB to a Covid Relief Fund and burning of tokens boosted SHIB’s visibility. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB uses Ethereum’s infrastructure to create applications like ShibaSwap. ShibaSwap is a decentralized exchange. Future plans include a non-fungible token platform and governance system. These elements suggest SHIB has potential for wider use in the cryptocurrency market. Its unique features might make it attractive to some in the current market. Conclusion With DOGE and SHIB showing less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming for financial freedom for all. Offering a 700% ROI during its presale, triple utility features, and a mission to unite enthusiasts against crypto villains, Catzilla invites participation through acquiring $CATZILLA tokens and joining the fight for true financial freedom.

Musk Kills Bears (MUSKBEAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBEAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Kills Bears can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Kills Bears could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Kills Bears launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Kills Bears on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Kills Bears by entering its contract address – 9yoxPCyAdEVRfAtkztzC7yKuhy7vEEEjXm3Ym8ajJEww – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBEAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|SOL|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-19 14:58:00

United States President-elect Donald Trump successfully launched the Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin on the Solana network, triggering the latest bullish momentum for the SOL token. This recent burst of positivity has now pushed Solana into an exciting price setup, which could see its value skyrocket over the next few months. According to a popular crypto analyst on social media platform X, the Solano price could be on its way to $4,700. Is SOL Price Gearing For A Parabolic Move? Prominent crypto pundit Ali Martinez took to the X platform to share an interesting update on the Solana price setup. According to the crypto trader, the price of SOL has just broken out of a bullish pattern, setting the stage for a parabolic move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast Of $150,000 ‘Too Low’ Amid Rising Adoption, Crypto Trader Says This bullish pattern is a cup and handle formation on the Solana monthly chart. As the name suggests, a cup and handle pattern is a technical analysis formation that looks like a cup with a handle. The cup typically is formed like the letter “u” while the handle is tilted a little downward. The cup and handle pattern serves as a bullish indicator, suggesting that an upward trend is going to continue. To validate the bullish setup, though, the cryptocurrency’s price needs to close above the upper boundary of the handle. As seen in the highlighted chart, the Solana price appears to have successfully breached the handle’s upper trendline around the $220 mark. A price target is calculated by measuring the length from the right cup lip (breakout point) to the cup’s bottom and adding it to the breakout level. According to Martinez, SOL could travel as high as $4,700 if the altcoin’s price holds above the upper trendline. This potential move would represent a whopping 2,000% rally for Solana from its current price point. Solana Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of SOL stands at around $262, reflecting a nearly 20% rally in the past 24 hours. Unsurprisingly, this price upswing has also impacted the coin’s action on broader timeframes, making it one of the best-performing large-cap assets in the past week.

However, as the market matures, investors are increasingly looking toward altcoins like Lightchain AI , which are gaining traction due to their innovative approaches and real-world applications. Shiba Inu and Dogecoin - Holding Their Ground As of January 18, 2025, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) continue to maintain their positions in the cryptocurrency market. SHIB is trading at approximately $0.00002423, showing stability with a slight increase of 0.09986% from the previous close. DOGE is priced at around $0.411812, reflecting an 8.86% increase. Both meme-based cryptocurrencies have demonstrated resilience amid market fluctuations. Shiba Inu's recent price movements suggest a potential for growth, with some analysts predicting it could reach $0.0000365 by January 17, 2025. Dogecoin has experienced a notable surge, partly attributed to Elon Musk's appointment to co-chair the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which shares its acronym with the cryptocurrency. Despite the emergence of new competitors in the meme coin sector, such as Rexas Finance (RXS), SHIB and DOGE continue to hold their ground, supported by strong community backing and ongoing developments within their ecosystems. Lightchain AI - Gaining Traction With Innovation Lightchain AI stands out from meme coins by merging blockchain and artificial intelligence to address real-world challenges with innovative solutions.

Both of these meme-inspired digital currencies have shown resilience despite market volatility. Recent price trends for Shiba Inu indicate a potential upward trajectory, with some experts forecasting it might hit $0.0000365 by January 17, 2025. Dogecoin has recently seen a significant boost, partly due to Elon Musk's new role as co-chair of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which amusingly shares its acronym with the currency. Despite the arrival of new contenders in the meme coin space, like Rexas Finance (RXS), SHIB and DOGE continue to stand firm, buoyed by robust community support and ongoing advancements within their respective ecosystems.

Additional proof of Trump’s unprecedented positive impact on crypto is the fact that around 46% of capital invested by crypto VC funds in Q4 2024 was poured into startups in the United States. So, institutional investors have shown their hand; they’re betting on the US’s upcoming administerial changes and pro-crypto stance to catapult the industry to new heights. The best thing retail investors can do now is to follow the footprints of smart money, and one of the best ways to do so is to invest in high-potential altcoins like the ones we’ve handpicked for you in this article. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Overall Best Altcoin for First-Time Investors From AI models predicting it to be the next multi-bagger to its presale breaking one record after another (over $50M raised so far), there’s little debate that Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is one of the hottest cryptocurrency presales right now. Its one-of-a-kind mission to level the playing field for small crypto investors has been the biggest reason for its popularity. As a $WEPE token holder, you’ll get access to trading strategies, market insights, and alpha trading calls, as well as a vibrant community of like-minded retail investors. Through collaborative effort and a unique assortment of tools, Wall Street Pepe plans to eliminate the unfair dominance of crypto whales, who have been feasting on retail money thus far. With less than a month to go until the presale’s close, the current price of $0.0003665 per $WEPE token offers unbeatable value for money, especially considering that it’s being touted as the next 100x meme coin. If this is your first time investing in a crypto presale, check out our guide on how to buy $WEPE . 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana’s First-Ever Layer-2 Solution Solaxy ($SOLX) is Solana’s potential life-saver and biggest catalyst, seeing as it promises to remove the network’s biggest issues, namely congestion, failed transactions, and scalability. As a multi-chain token, Solaxy combines the best of both worlds: Ethereum’s infrastructure and liquidity and Solana’s low fees and speed. Solaxy’s Layer-2 solution for Solana is also turning heads because of its massive 308% staking rewards. Moreover, since the token offers serious utility, its price is expected to not only be stable but also increase after listing. With Solana expected to surge by more than 3,000% by 2030, Solaxy offers an almost unprecedented opportunity to ride the momentum. Each $SOLX token is currently available for $0.001606, with its presale having already raised over $11.5M so far. Prices increase in the next couple of days, so hurry up! 3. Mind of Pepe ($MIND) – Real-Time Crypto Investment Advice with Hive-Mind Analysis Simply put, MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is a sentient AI agent that combs through all the chatter around cryptocurrencies on platforms like X.com and then analyzes that to compile robust crypto investment advice for its token holders. Artificial Intelligence has been all the rage in the past few years, so there should be little surprise that a cutting-edge, new-gen, AI-based crypto token is one of the best meme coins to invest in in 2025 . Interestingly, MIND of Pepe is not too dissimilar from its Pepe brethren, Wall Street Pepe. Both of them seek to offer their token holders (retail traders) insider knowledge to give them the opportunity to flip the script on institutional players and generate handsome profits. $MIND’s presale has been a blockbuster hit from the very beginning. It raised over $1M within just 24 hours since its launch. You can grab 1 $MIND for just $0.0031509 right now, but with the price set to increase in the next 12 hours, interested investors should get in quickly. 4. XRP ($XRP) – Listed Meme Coin to Continue Rising After Fresh Breakout The native token of the open-source XRP Ledger, $XRP has emerged as a fierce Bitcoin rival because it consumes less energy than Bitcoin, is more cost-effective, and also has speedier transaction times. Experts believe that a 25% move upwards in the last week is only the beginning of a long bullish rally for XRP. After recently surging past $3.2 because of a massive spike in whale activity, XRP looks ripe for a big move upwards – potentially to $15 . It’s currently hovering around its all-time highs, with the price nicely consolidating as we speak. This provides interested buyers a great entry point.

Which Crypto Could Be the Top Performer for 2025?",https://bitzo.com/2025/01/dogecoin-solana-or-rollblock-which-crypto-could-be-the-top-performer-for-2025,"Crypto investors are debating which cryptocurrency might be the best choice for 2025 gains, considering Dogecoin, Solana, or Rollblock, each of which could be a formidable candidate for substantial growth in 2025. Each project has its unique appeal: Dogecoin, the pioneer meme coin, relies on community support and adoption; Solana is favored by developers for its incredibly fast blockchain. Meanwhile, Rollblock blends DeFi and gaming through its GambleFi-powered model, offering passive income to token holders. Analysts foresee an 880% rise during its presale and a potential 100x increase post-launch. While all three cryptocurrencies hold promise, Rollblock's innovative strategy makes it a standout opportunity for building wealth. Let's delve into what distinguishes these projects and which might be the top choice for gains in 2025. Dogecoin: Transforming from Meme to Mainstream Dogecoin started as a joke but has amassed a loyal community and celebrity endorsements, notably from Elon Musk, propelling it into the spotlight among cryptocurrencies. It boasts minimal transaction fees and straightforward usability. DOGE is gaining traction as a payment option, with Tesla Stores, under Musk's leadership, accepting only Dogecoin for digital transactions. Recent collaborations with payment services and businesses adopting DOGE for transactions have elevated its practical use. However, Dogecoin's growth is heavily reliant on hype, and its lack of deflationary features might make its future growth less predictable compared to Rollblock’s innovative model. Solana: Revolutionizing Blockchain Speed Solana is renowned for its ultra-fast blockchain, handling tens of thousands of transactions per second. Its rapidly expanding ecosystem supports a variety of applications, including memecoin trading. With a significant user base and a market capitalization exceeding $105 billion, SOL is a strong candidate for long-term gains. However, one downside is that rewards are mainly limited to staking, offering no direct financial benefits to token holders. Rollblock surpasses this by providing consistent passive income to its token holders through its distinct revenue-sharing approach. Rollblock: The Fusion of Gaming and Financial Empowerment Rollblock (RBLK) brings a fresh perspective on capital gains by integrating decentralized finance with gaming. Unlike Dogecoin and Solana, which focus on transactions and development frameworks, Rollblock directly rewards its community through its GambleFi-powered system. First, explore Rollblock's casino and sports gambling offerings. Leading a new era in live casino gaming, Rollblock provides a live casino experience. While many casinos have native tokens, few share profits with their token holders. Rollblock ensures fair play through its provably fair system, guaranteeing randomness and fairness for all participants. Everyone benefits, whether they are token holders or casino players. Additionally, its certification by Anjouan Gaming, a global licensing body, attests to its legitimacy. Now, let's discuss the native Rollblock (RBLK) token. Holders of this token enjoy a share of profits from the Rollblock online casino, making RBLK appealing to those seeking passive income. Beyond rewards, the tokens appreciate in value due to deflationary strategies that continually reduce Rollblock's supply. Rollblock: The Leading Choice for 2025 Growth While DOGE and SOL generate buzz with hype and infrastructure, Rollblock blends entertainment with utility and financial benefits. At a current price of $0.046, its presale offers a rare chance to join a project that analysts predict will rise by 880% in the presale alone and potentially 100x after launch. As the first to reward its community through revenue-sharing and staking, Rollblock stands out as the premier choice for 2025 growth among investors.

Which Crypto Is the Best Bet for 2025 Gains?",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/dogecoin-solana-or-rollblock-which-crypto-is-the-best-bet-for-2025-gains,"Crypto investors have been wondering which crypto is the best bet for 2025 gains and trying to choose between Dogecoin, Solana, or Rollblock, each of which can be a strong contender for significant gains in 2025. Each of these projects has something different to offer: Dogecoin, as the first-ever meme coin, depends on community and adoption, but Solana remains a first choice for developers because of its lightning-fast blockchain. On the other hand, Rollblock has combined DeFi and gaming with its GambleFi-powered model to give passive income to its token holders. Analysts predict it will surge by 880% during the presale alone and 100x more after its launch. While all three cryptos have potential, Rollblock’s innovative approach sets it apart as a unique opportunity for wealth creation. Let’s explore what makes these projects stand out and which might be the best bet for 2025 gains. Dogecoin: From meme to mainstream adoption Initially a farce, Dogecoin built up a strong community and high-profile supporters, such as Elon Musk, who helped it gain prominence among all other cryptocurrencies. It has very low transaction fees and is relatively simple. DOGE is gradually being accepted as a means of payment, with Elon Musk’s Tesla Stores now accepting only Dogecoin as a digital currency. Recent partnerships with payment providers and companies integrating DOGE for transactions have further boosted its utility. However, Dogecoin’s reliance on hype and lack of deflationary mechanisms could make its growth trajectory less predictable than Rollblock’s innovative model. Solana is redefining blockchain performance Solana has gained a reputation as a lightning-fast blockchain, capable of processing tens of thousands of transactions per second. Solana's fast-growing ecosystem has been the foundation for many applications like memecoin trading. SOL is a strong contender for long-term gains, having the most active users and boasting over $105 billion in market capitalization. A significant drawback, however, is that its rewards are strictly limited to staking returns, and token holders do not have direct financial benefits from being a holder. This is where Rollblock outshines, providing token holders with consistent, passive income through its unique revenue-sharing model. Rollblock: Where gaming meets financial empowerment Rollblock (RBLK) offers a different approach to capital gains from tokens by merging decentralized finance with gaming. Unlike Dogecoin and Solana, which primarily focus on transactions and development infrastructure, Rollblock rewards its community directly through its GambleFi-powered model. First, let’s dive into the casino and sports gambling section of Rollblock. Rollblock offers a live casino, which is leading a new revolution in live casino gambling. Most casinos offer native tokens, but none share rewards with their token holders from their casino gains. Also, they ensure that all games are fair by using the provably fair system, which ensures randomness and equity for all players. Be it the token holder or the casino player, everyone wins. Finally, their certification by Anjouan Gaming, a global licensing organization, shows the casino is legit. Now, let’s get into the native Rollblock (RBLK) token. The fact that holders of this token receive a share of the profit from the Rollblock online casino has made RBLK very popular among passive earners. Apart from just giving them rewards, their tokens also increase in value due to the deflationary measures put in place to constantly reduce the supply of Rollblock. Rollblock: The best bet for 2025 gains While all the hype is going for DOGE or all the infrastructure talk surrounding SOL, Rollblock strikes an ideal balance between entertainment and utility, topped with financial gain. At $0.046 currently, its presale is one of those scarce chances to enter a project that analysts predict will surge by 880% during the presale alone and 100x more after its launch. Being the first to reward its community via revenue-sharing and staking, Rollblock immediately stands out as the best bet for 2025 gain among investors.

This legal action was announced on Jan. 17, just days before SEC Chair Gary Gensler, a known crypto skeptic, steps down from his role on Jan. 20 . The SEC has also alleged Nova Labs sold unregistered securities through their “Hotspots, which mine cryptocurrency called Helium (HNT). Another example, according to the regulator, is the firm’s “Discovery Mapping” program under which users get rewarded in crypto for providing personal data. False Claims of Network Adoption In the lawsuit filed by the commission, it also accuses Nova Labs of deceiving potential investors with false pretenses. Among the accusations made against Nova Labs include those stating that big companies such as Lime, Nestlé, and Salesforce were using its wireless network or relied on it in their operations, which the commission says were lies to attract other investors. These accusations are in line with broader concerns from regulators about deceptive marketing practices within the cryptocurrency sector-a recurring theme under Gensler’s leadership. Ripple’s Impact and the SEC’s Broader Crypto Strategy The lawsuit against Nova Labs is part of a broader pattern of aggressive enforcement actions from the SEC in recent years. But even after Ripple Labs scored a landmark legal victory in 2023, with a court ruling that sales of XRP on digital asset exchanges did not constitute unregistered securities, the SEC has shown no signs of slowing. In fact, the agency filed an appeal to try to overturn the Ripple decision-a sign that it will continue holding crypto companies’ feet to the fire for perceived violations of securities laws. Critics argue that this approach has stifled innovation within the rapidly changing crypto industry and continue to demand more subtle and tailored regulation. SEC Leadership Change May Mean Shift in Crypto Enforcement With Gensler stepping down on Jan. 20, speculation on the direction of the SEC’s approach to cryptocurrency enforcement has been ripe. A report from Reuters on Jan. 15 suggested that the agency may freeze or drop some of the ongoing cases, especially those that do not involve fraud allegations-a game-changing scenario for a crypto industry where companies have been stuck in litigation. In turn, the decision in the case of Nova Labs will likely act as a milestone for crypto businesses operating in U.S. territory and navigating around the securities law.",Blockchain|Regulation|SEC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|HNT,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-01-19 15:14:59

In this ecosystem, coins like Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Bonk (BONK) have dominated, creating robust communities and strong returns for those who dared to believe. But now, a new player is charging into the field: BTFD Coin (BTFD) . If you’ve been looking for the best meme to invest in, this week’s presale performance of BTFD is making waves, drawing in both seasoned investors and crypto newbies. With over $5.2 million raised and more than 64 billion coins sold to over 8,600 Bulls , BTFD is a movement you can’t afford to miss. BTFD Coin: A Bold New Era for Meme Coins Imagine jumping into the crypto game during its most rewarding phase, when opportunities are fresh and the community is buzzing. That’s the reality for those diving into BTFD Coin’s presale , now in its 13th stage. With a current price of just $0.000142 , early supporters are locking in gains at a fraction of the future value. Analysts predict that by the presale’s conclusion, the price will climb to $0.0006, delivering significant returns. For example, if you invest $3,500 in this 13th stage, you’ll acquire approximately 24,647,887 BTFD coins. By the end of the presale, your investment could soar to $14,788 —a jaw-dropping opportunity in today’s crypto world. BTFD isn’t just about trading; it’s about building. With its full Play-to-Earn (P2E) game live, users can earn rewards while having fun. Add to that a staking system offering 90% APY, and you’ve got a utility-driven ecosystem designed to maximize engagement and growth. Meme coins thrive on community interaction, and BTFD takes it a step further. The Bulls Squad embodies this ethos, connecting investors with shared goals and rallying them around the vision of buying every dip. From Baby Bull’s meme-savvy leadership to Nerdy Bull’s technical expertise, the squad is the heart of BTFD’s appeal. Here’s How to Grab Your Stake Timely: Set up a wallet with MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT. Go to BTFD’s presale page and confirm your purchase. Once the presale ends, claim your tokens and start earning rewards. Pepe Coin: The OG Meme King Pepe Coin is a veteran in the meme coin arena, loved for its witty homage to the iconic Pepe the Frog meme. Over the years, it has cemented itself as a go-to investment for traders seeking both fun and returns. Pepe thrives on its ability to engage a passionate community, creating a social media buzz that fuels its market position. What makes Pepe so intriguing is its resilience. Despite the market’s ups and downs, it remains a fan favorite. Its simple utility as a community-driven token proves that sometimes, a strong community is all you need to thrive. While it doesn’t offer advanced features like staking or gaming, Pepe’s enduring charm keeps it on the radar for those chasing the meme coin thrill. Bonk: Solana’s Community Favorite Bonk, known as the “Dogecoin of Solana,” has been a game-changer for its ecosystem. As the first meme coin to make a splash on Solana, it brought the meme coin frenzy to a new blockchain, fueling a surge in adoption and innovation. Bonk’s appeal lies in its ability to reward loyalists with massive token airdrops, which often leads to renewed interest and trading activity. Its commitment to Solana-based growth ensures that it remains a solid alternative for those seeking diversity in their crypto portfolios. Beyond its meme appeal, Bonk contributes to the ecosystem through partnerships and utility projects. While it lacks the presale buzz of BTFD, its established position, and community-driven approach make it a noteworthy player in the meme coin space. Why BTFD Stands Out as the Best Meme to Invest While Pepe and Bonk have carved their niches, BTFD Coin is revolutionizing how a meme coin should be. It combines the community focus of Pepe with the innovative drive of Bonk, all while offering unparalleled utility. With staking rewards, a live P2E game, and a presale that’s already raised millions, BTFD is more than just a token—it’s a movement among the best memes to invest in now. The presale structure ensures that early investors are rewarded, while the ongoing development promises a sustainable future. Conclusion: Join the Next Meme Coin Bull Run In the ever-evolving world of crypto, timing is everything. Based on current trends and the incredible momentum of its presale, BTFD Coin is undeniably the best meme to invest in right now. With a thriving community, innovative features, and analysts predicting strong future growth, it’s your ticket to turning dips into moonshots. Ready to charge forward?

After Ethereum's Pectra Upgrade, Can ETH Remain One of the Top Altcoins to Buy? The upcoming Ethereum Pectra upgrade is set for early 2025 and could be a game-changer. This upgrade combines the Prague and Electra changes to bring enhanced wallet functions and the ability to batch transactions. A raised validator stake limit and improved scalability are also part of the update. While Ethereum’s tokenomics remain stable, the Pectra upgrade aims to boost speed and usability. These changes solidify Ethereum's position as one of the trending altcoins for DeFi enthusiasts to buy. However, ETH's price movement was slow last week. ETH is currently valued at $3,135.50, a 7.37% decline from last week. Concerning price predictions, some Ethereum experts suggest a bullish run for ETH in the coming weeks because of the upcoming Pectra upgrade. This could catalyze ETH's surge to $3,950. As such, Ethereum experts see the coin as one of the trending altcoins that could turn $100 into $10,000. Conversely, if the bullish trend persists and ETH drops below the $2,900 support level, it could plummet to $2,300. This mixed forecast is pushing investors to $FXG, a DeFi coin they believe could turn $100 into $10,000 due to its unparalleled utility. Experts Chatter About Looming Cardano Hard Fork, But Trending Altcoins Like ADA Decline Cardano enthusiasts are preparing for the highly awaited Plomin hard fork. This upgrade could bring a fully decentralized governance system to Cardano’s network. The Plomin hard fork is receiving strong support from stake pool operators. Voting is currently taking place, and the final decision on this upgrade is expected by January 29, 2025. Once finalized, this update will make Cardano even more decentralized, allowing more people to have a say in its future. Meanwhile, ADA’s price movement lags other trending altcoins. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that ADA is trading at $0.945, a 4.74% decline from last week. Moving forward, some top Cardano experts believe that ADA's value will surge in the coming weeks due to the upcoming hard fork. They believe that this could push its value up to $1.350 in a few weeks. On the other hand, with the crypto market currently experiencing a downturn, some experts wonder if ADA can turn $100 into $10,000. They believe that ADA's value could potentially fall to $0.830 soon. This is why they believe $FXG, one of the hottest ICOs in the market, is the better investment option to turn $100 into $10,000. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG Gains Attention as a Top Pick to Turn $100 Into $10,000 in 2025 Investors are starting to move past the market dip of late 2024. ADA and ETH are both showing positive signs. These two altcoins are preparing for a potential bull run. However, experts are now pointing to $FXG as a top contender. FXGuys is attracting attention due to its special PropFi features. These features are gaining popularity in the DeFi sector. As more people recognize its value, the token continues to gain momentum. Currently, $FXG is priced at $0.04 during Stage 2 of its public presale. It has already raised $3.4 million, with many investors eager to join. Those who get in now could see significant returns once it officially launches. When $FXG hits the market, it will start at $0.10. That means those who invest now could make over 150% gains. The growth potential for $FXG is looking very promising. Experts predict that $FXG could see a huge price increase after its launch. Some are forecasting a 100x price boost, meaning that it can turn $100 to $10,000. This makes $FXG one of the best altcoins to buy right now!

The anticipated Ethereum Pectra upgrade is slated for early 2025 and could significantly change the landscape. This upgrade merges the Prague and Electra enhancements to improve wallet capabilities and enable transaction batching. It also includes an increased validator stake limit and better scalability. While Ethereum’s tokenomics remain stable, the Pectra upgrade aims to enhance speed and usability, reinforcing Ethereum's status as a sought-after altcoin for DeFi enthusiasts. However, ETH's price saw little movement last week. Currently, ETH is priced at $3,135.50, marking a 7.37% decline from the previous week. Regarding price forecasts, some Ethereum specialists anticipate a bullish phase for ETH soon due to the upcoming Pectra upgrade, potentially driving ETH to $3,950. Consequently, Ethereum experts view it as one of the promising altcoins capable of turning $100 into $10,000. On the flip side, if the bullish sentiment weakens and ETH falls below the $2,900 support level, it may drop to $2,300. This uncertain forecast is steering investors towards $FXG, a DeFi coin believed to have the potential to turn $100 into $10,000 thanks to its exceptional utility. Cardano Hard Fork Sparks Expert Discussions, Yet ADA's Value Declines Among Altcoins Cardano fans are gearing up for the eagerly anticipated Plomin hard fork. This upgrade could introduce a fully decentralized governance framework to Cardano’s network. The Plomin hard fork is gaining substantial backing from stake pool operators. Voting is underway, with the final verdict on this upgrade expected by January 29, 2025. Upon approval, this update will enhance Cardano's decentralization, allowing more community involvement in its future. Meanwhile, ADA’s value is lagging behind other popular altcoins. According to CoinMarketCap , ADA is trading at $0.945, reflecting a 4.74% decrease from the previous week. Moving forward, some top Cardano analysts predict ADA's value will rise soon due to the upcoming hard fork, potentially reaching $1.350. Conversely, with the crypto market experiencing a slump, some experts question whether ADA can turn $100 into $10,000. They speculate that ADA's value could drop to $0.830 shortly. This is why they consider $FXG, a leading ICO on the market, to be the more promising choice for transforming $100 into $10,000. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG Rises as a Premier Choice to Transform $100 into $10,000 by 2025 Investors are beginning to move beyond the late 2024 market slump. Both ADA and ETH are showing positive signs as they gear up for a potential bull market. Nevertheless, experts are now spotlighting $FXG as a top prospect. FXGuys is catching attention due to its unique PropFi features, which are gaining traction within the DeFi sector. As more people recognize its advantages, the token's momentum continues to build. At present, $FXG is available at $0.04 in Stage 2 of its public presale, having already attracted $3.4 million, with many investors keen to join. Early investors stand to gain significantly once it officially launches. When $FXG enters the market, it will debut at $0.10, offering over 150% potential gains for early investors. The growth prospects for $FXG appear highly favorable. Experts foresee a substantial price surge for $FXG post-launch, with some predicting a 100x increase, effectively turning $100 into $10,000. This positions $FXG as one of the most attractive altcoins to invest in currently!

Bitcoin ( BTC ) surpassed $105,000 on Sunday, Jan. 19, as it attempted to retest its all-time high of $108,200.

Source: CoinGecko Solana, Raydium, and Jupiter also surged , riding the Trump meme coin wave. In the days ahead, keep an eye on ( AVAX ), Terra Luna Classic ( LUNC ), and Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ). Here’s why. Terra Luna Classic in focus amid a potential Cardano partnership LUNC, the remnant of Terra’s crash, will be a crypto to watch this week after Charles Hoskinson hinted that he was open to a partnership. In an X post on Saturday, he said that his goal was to integrate Bitcoin’s DeFi on Cardano, improve scalability, and creating partnerships. A Terra Luna Classic fan replied to the message and suggested a potential collaboration between the two. He noted that the community took over the project after it was abandoned by Do Kwon. In a response, Hoskinson noted that he was open to that idea, meaning that a potential partnership between the two projects. $LUNC has been doing this since 2022 @IOHK_Charles . Would love to see both chains collab. The communtiy took over after @stablekwon abandoned it and #Binance burns the supply monthly. People need to check it out. — Mr. Diamondhandz1💎 (@MrDiamondhandz1) January 18, 2025 A potential partnership would likely help the LUNC bounce back now that it has crashed by 50% from its highest swing in December. It has also dropped below the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since Aug. 24. It has also moved below the 50-day moving average, meaning that a drop to $0.00005475, its August low is possible.

It retreated to $36.95, its lowest point since Jan. 14. AVAX will be a crypto to watch this week as the network unlocks 62.25 million coins. A token unlock introduces new coins in the network, and often has an impact on the staking yield. Avalanche price may bounce back in the next few days since it has formed a falling wedge chart pattern on the daily chart. This pattern is made up of two falling and converging trendlines and often leads to a strong bullish breakout. Such a move will see it rally to last December’s high of $55.7, a 52% increase from the current level.

Traders still talk about how some early birds transformed a mere $27 into nearly $50 million when PEPE soared to its all-time high. Now, a fresh contender has entered the ring, and rumors are swirling about whether it can reach the same dizzying heights. This project is Remittix (RTX), a token that aims to bring a dose of practicality to the meme coin buzz. Supporters say it fits neatly into the pattern of altcoin viral growth, combining hype with real-world utility. Revisiting PEPE When PEPE debuted, almost nobody saw it coming. But thanks to internet memes, speculation, and a dash of luck, PEPE launched from obscurity to legendary status. Rapid gains made headlines worldwide, and PEPE’s success story became a rallying cry for newcomers hunting for the next big thing. Skeptics insisted that the rocket ride would end in tears, yet some fans of PEPE pocketed life-changing money along the way. The mania taught everyone just how powerful a perfectly timed meme coin can be. Enter Remittix (RTX) But if PEPE taught us anything, it’s that new tokens can appear overnight and transform the market if they strike the right chord. That’s where Remittix (RTX) enters the scene. Instead of purely relying on meme culture, Remittix (RTX) focuses on solving a major issue: cross-border payments. This platform offers a straightforward way to convert dozens of different cryptocurrencies into fiat and send those funds directly to global bank accounts. In a sea of meme coins, this approach lends Remittix (RTX) an edge in credibility. Potential for Altcoin Viral Growth Many in the community are already tagging Remittix (RTX) as the latest example of altcoin viral growth. The project’s presale phase has gained traction among traders who value tokens that solve practical problems—especially in an industry known for hype-fueled bubbles. If broader market conditions remain favorable, some analysts say Remittix (RTX) might match the dramatic momentum that made PEPE a household name among meme coin enthusiasts. While PEPE rose on pure excitement, Remittix (RTX) tries to balance hype with a clear use case. The idea of global remittances resonates with both seasoned investors and regular users who face high fees and long wait times when moving money. By offering a blockchain-based alternative, Remittix (RTX) stands out from typical meme coins that lack any practical function. This hybrid of utility and community support could help it surge if the right catalysts appear—just like PEPE did. Risk vs. Reward Naturally, any coin aiming to replicate PEPE’s surge carries immense risk. Meme coins and new projects can be unpredictable, and the fortunes of Remittix (RTX) depend on whether it can keep momentum and community interest alive. Nonetheless, the potential upside has caught the attention of risk-friendly traders looking for the next 100x or even 1000x. Should the community rally around Remittix (RTX) the way they did for PEPE, a massive jump isn’t out of the question, though it’s not a given either. Conclusion Few cryptos will ever match PEPE’s meteoric run. However, Remittix (RTX) seems determined to try, offering a compelling blend of hype and real-world purpose. In a market that adores dramatic tales of altcoin viral growth, it’s easy to see why the buzz around Remittix (RTX) keeps growing. Will this new altcoin follow in PEPE’s footsteps and turn a small stake into millions? Only time will tell—but if you’re the type who loves chasing the next big thing, it might be worth keeping an eye on.

Investors still recount how early adopters turned a modest $27 investment into an astonishing $50 million when PEPE hit its peak. Now, a new player has emerged, sparking speculation about whether it can achieve similar extraordinary success. This new contender is Remittix (RTX), a token that aims to mix practicality with the meme coin frenzy. Supporters believe it follows the pattern of viral altcoin growth by merging hype with tangible utility. Reflecting on the PEPE Phenomenon When PEPE first hit the market, it took many by surprise. Fueled by internet memes, speculation, and a bit of luck, PEPE catapulted from obscurity to fame. Its rapid rise made global headlines, becoming a beacon of hope for those seeking the next big opportunity. Critics warned of an inevitable crash, but many PEPE enthusiasts managed to secure substantial profits. The craze demonstrated the immense power of a well-timed meme coin. Introducing Remittix (RTX) If PEPE taught us anything, it's that new tokens can emerge unexpectedly and shake up the market if they strike the right note. Enter Remittix (RTX). Unlike its predecessors that rely solely on meme culture, Remittix (RTX) is dedicated to addressing a significant issue: cross-border transactions. This platform provides a seamless way to convert multiple cryptocurrencies into fiat and transfer those funds directly to international bank accounts. Among meme coins, this strategic focus gives Remittix (RTX) a credibility boost. The Potential for Viral Altcoin Growth Many in the crypto community are already dubbing Remittix (RTX) as the latest model of viral altcoin growth. The project's presale has caught the attention of traders who are keen on tokens that address real-world challenges—particularly in a field known for its hype-driven bubbles. Should the broader market remain supportive, some analysts suggest that Remittix (RTX) could replicate the explosive momentum that made PEPE a favorite among meme coin fans. While PEPE thrived on sheer excitement, Remittix (RTX) aims to blend buzz with a defined use case. The concept of global remittances resonates with both experienced investors and everyday users who deal with high costs and delays in transferring money. By providing a blockchain-powered alternative, Remittix (RTX) differentiates itself from typical meme coins lacking practical functionality. This combination of utility and community backing could propel it to new heights if the right factors align—much like PEPE's journey. Balancing Risk and Reward Of course, any coin striving to mimic PEPE’s skyrocketing success carries significant risk. Meme coins and fresh projects are unpredictable, and Remittix (RTX)’s future will hinge on its ability to sustain momentum and community engagement. Yet, the potential for high returns has attracted risk-taking traders searching for the next 100x or even 1000x opportunity. If the community embraces Remittix (RTX) as they did with PEPE, a massive surge could be possible, though not guaranteed. Final Thoughts Few cryptocurrencies will ever match PEPE's phenomenal ascent. Still, Remittix (RTX) appears driven to try, offering an intriguing mix of hype and genuine purpose. In a market that thrives on dramatic stories of altcoin viral growth, it’s easy to understand the growing buzz around Remittix (RTX). Will this new altcoin replicate PEPE’s trajectory and turn a small investment into millions? Only time will tell—but if you’re someone who loves chasing the next big opportunity, it might be worth watching.

In a post on the social media platform X, Hougan tells his 60,000 followers that the dramatic difference between the previous and current presidential administrations is not yet priced in and that a reevaluation of crypto assets will need to take place. “On my first road trip of the year speaking with traditional investors. One takeaway: the change in Washington’s attitude toward crypto is not priced in. The reason is, it’s hard for people outside of crypto to imagine just how oppressive the environment has been. Unless you’ve been close to crypto, things like Operation Choke Point 2.0 and ‘arbitrary and capricious’ regulators sound conspiracy theories. I suspect the market re-rates crypto quickly in the next six months as it realizes the quantum of the shift.” Earlier this month, Hougan said that the adoption of Bitcoin by nation-states could end up being the major catalyst that sends BTC to much higher prices. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley recently said in a post on X that the firm had been talking with an unnamed nation-state about Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), but Horsley didn’t mention any specific details about the conversation. “We just provided some information for a nation-state asking about Bitcoin ETFs. Considering moving some exposure from foreign currency government bonds into BTC. Bitcoin is entering a new chapter.” At time of writing, BTC is trading at $105,338.

Recently, an early Polygon investor announced plans to back Lightchain AI , a rising blockchain-AI hybrid, instead of Monero (XMR). With Lightchain AI’s innovative features and its presale raising $11.3 million at $0.00525 per token, the decision reflects growing confidence in its transformative potential. Case for Monero Monero (XMR) is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that ensures anonymous and untraceable transactions through advanced cryptographic techniques. Its commitment to user privacy has garnered significant attention, particularly among individuals seeking enhanced financial confidentiality. Recently, Monero has demonstrated robust bullish momentum, with its price reaching $204.92 on January 14, 2025, and technical indicators suggesting potential for further gains. Additionally, Monero's long-to-short ratio has climbed to 1.20, the highest in over a month, reflecting growing bullish sentiment among traders. Despite regulatory challenges and delistings from certain exchanges due to its privacy features, Monero maintains a dedicated user base and continues to be a prominent player in the cryptocurrency market. Why Lightchain AI Is Stealing the Spotlight While Monero focuses on privacy, Lightchain AI offers a comprehensive platform that integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. This combination addresses critical challenges like inefficiency and data management, making it highly versatile. One of Lightchain AI’s standout features is its open-source innovation framework, which encourages developers worldwide to contribute to its ecosystem. By creating a collaborative environment, the platform fosters rapid innovation and ensures that it remains adaptable to evolving market demands. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s real-time task execution model supports industries requiring instant data processing and decision-making, such as logistics and predictive analytics. This practical approach sets it apart from projects with more limited applications. Why the Early Polygon Investor Chose Lightchain AI For investors used to supporting high-growth projects like Polygon, Lightchain AI’s early-stage momentum and robust technological foundation are major attractions. Unlike Monero, which mainly caters to privacy enthusiasts, Lightchain AI targets a broader audience, including businesses and developers seeking practical blockchain solutions. By integrating AI with blockchain technology, Lightchain AI tackles challenges in scalability, governance, and privacy, positioning itself as a leader in decentralized intelligence. Its focus on real-world applications across diverse industries highlights its potential for widespread adoption. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Despite facing regulatory hurdles and being delisted from some exchanges due to its privacy features, Monero retains a loyal user base and remains a significant player in the cryptocurrency space.

Bitcoin stays on top, while Solana and XRP impress with new innovations. Shiba Inu is still loved by meme coin fans. But the real excitement is around Rollblock, a new player ready to shake up a $500 billion industry. Let’s see why these cryptocurrencies could have an exciting year ahead. After Rallying Bitcoin Now Eyes $150K The original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, shows no slowing down either. Driven by growing institutional acceptance and Bitcoin ETFs gaining momentum, analysts estimate BTC might reach $150,000 by 2025. Long-term investors are still drawn to the blockchain by its limited quantity of 21 million BTC and standing as digital gold. With around 900,000 active BTC wallets reported daily, on-chain data shows an increase in wallet activity. In order to appeal more environmentally, bitcoin mining activities have also switched toward renewable energy. Though the market is always changing, Bitcoin's function as an inflation hedge keeps it very much in focus. Solana Is Targeting New High with Rapid Growth Solana is a main rival in the blockchain market because of its cheap transaction costs and quickness. Driven by growing acceptance and a possible Solana-based ETF, SOL, well-known for running NFTs and DeFi apps, may reach $500 in 2025. Whale activity is rising; noteworthy wallets totaling millions of SOL tokens exist. Solana's attractiveness to developers and investors both increases with its alliances with significant DeFi and NFT initiatives. Should Solana maintain its technical advantage, Ethereum's supremacy in distributed apps might be challenged. Legal Clarity Could Spark a Rally For XRP Investors' major attention is on XRP's continuous legal struggle with the SEC. Should Ripple find a positive result, XRP may soar above $10 due to restored institutional trust. Thanks to Ripple speed and economy, the remittance-based coin is becoming popular in cross-border transactions. Rising in the crypto payments market, XRP's expanding ecosystem consists of alliances with financial giants. Shiba Inu Has Its Utility on the Rise From a meme currency, Shiba Inu is becoming a utility-driven ecosystem. Using its Layer-2 scaling technology, SHIB seeks to lower transaction costs and increase application scope. SHIB's worth would rise if it were more embraced in e-commerce and gaming. Shiba Inu's creators are dedicated to providing holders long-term value, even when its meme status attracts attention. If these patterns hold true, analysts estimate SHIB might hit $0.0002 by 2025 ending. Can Rollblock Disrupting a $500B Industry with Innovation?

Bitcoin remains dominant, while Solana and XRP capture attention with fresh innovations. Shiba Inu continues to charm meme coin enthusiasts. However, the true buzz surrounds Rollblock, a newcomer poised to revolutionize a $500 billion market. Let's explore why these cryptocurrencies might have an exhilarating year ahead. Bitcoin's Ambitious Target: $150K After Its Rally Bitcoin, the pioneer of cryptocurrencies, shows no signs of losing momentum. With increasing acceptance among institutions and the rise of Bitcoin ETFs, experts predict BTC could hit $150,000 by 2025. Long-term holders remain drawn to its capped supply of 21 million BTC and reputation as digital gold. Currently, over 900,000 BTC wallets are active daily, according to on-chain data indicating a surge in activity. Bitcoin mining is also shifting towards renewable energy to enhance environmental appeal. Although the market is ever-evolving, Bitcoin's role as a hedge against inflation keeps it under the spotlight. Solana's Rapid Expansion Aiming for New Heights Solana is emerging as a formidable contender in the blockchain arena due to its low transaction costs and speed. With growing adoption and the potential launch of a Solana-based ETF, SOL, known for its NFT and DeFi capabilities, might reach $500 by 2025. There's a noticeable increase in whale activity, with significant wallets holding millions of SOL tokens. Solana's appeal is growing among developers and investors, especially with partnerships with major DeFi and NFT projects. Retaining its technical edge could challenge Ethereum's dominance in decentralized applications. XRP's Legal Developments Could Ignite a Surge XRP's ongoing legal battle with the SEC remains a focal point for investors. A favorable outcome for Ripple could see XRP soar past $10, regaining institutional confidence. Thanks to Ripple's speed and cost-effectiveness, the remittance-oriented coin is gaining traction in international transactions. As it rises in the crypto payments sector, XRP's expanding network includes collaborations with major financial institutions. Shiba Inu's Growing Utility Base Evolving from a meme coin, Shiba Inu is becoming a utility-focused ecosystem. By leveraging its Layer-2 scaling solution, SHIB aims to reduce transaction fees and broaden its application range. Greater adoption in e-commerce and gaming could boost SHIB's value. Despite its meme origins, Shiba Inu's developers are committed to delivering long-term value to holders. If these trends persist, analysts predict SHIB could reach $0.0002 by the end of 2025.

Experts think so, as Remittix rises as a game-changer in crypto-to-fiat payments. Unlike SHIB, which relies on hype, Remittix focuses on real-world utility, providing fast, secure, and cost-effective global transactions. With its innovative approach and growing popularity, Remittix is gaining traction among investors. Could this promising token be the one to overtake SHIB and redefine the future of cryptocurrency? Let's get into it. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Faces Major Setback Amid Inflation Concerns and Market Pullback As the wider bitcoin market pulls back, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has suffered a notable decline. The price of SHIB has declined 8.2% throughout the last twenty-four hours. This drop corresponds with Ethereum by 7.4% and Bitcoin by 5% as fresh economic data causes investor worries. The sell-off follows the publication of startling job numbers by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). With 8.1 million job opportunities in November, more than expected from analysts—7.7 million. Strong economic activity shown by this surprising gain might lead to higher inflation. Such inflation worries have driven U.S. Treasury rates to rise, therefore influencing markets like SHIB. Investors in Shiba Inus fear that the Federal Reserve may delay interest rate reductions should inflation continue. High interest rates often deter more risky investments, including cryptocurrencies like SHIB. The benchmark rate is high to combat inflation even if the Fed just lowered rates. For SHIB and other tokens, slower pace of rate decreases would be unfortunate. Though SHIB has lately suffered losses, its community is still strong. Investors are wary, meanwhile, because of market uncertainty related to interest rates and inflation. The price of SHIB responds to changes in the state of the economy; so, the future of SHIB probably depends on larger market recovery and investor attitude. SHIB holders are closely monitoring forthcoming economic data right now and hope for a market turn-around.

Unlike SHIB, which thrives on hype, Remittix is grounded in practicality, offering rapid, secure, and affordable international transfers. Its innovative strategy and increasing popularity are drawing investors' attention. Could this promising token be poised to surpass SHIB and reshape the future of cryptocurrency? Let's dive in. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Struggles Amid Inflation Worries and Market Downturn As the broader cryptocurrency market experiences a downturn, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has faced a significant drop. SHIB's value has decreased by 8.2% in the past day, mirroring Ethereum's 7.4% and Bitcoin's 5% declines as new economic data raises investor concerns. This sell-off was triggered by unexpected job figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). With 8.1 million job openings in November, exceeding analysts' expectations of 7.7 million, the robust economic activity might lead to heightened inflation. Such inflation worries have pushed U.S. Treasury rates higher, affecting markets like SHIB. Shiba Inu investors worry that persistent inflation might cause the Federal Reserve to delay cutting interest rates. High rates typically deter riskier investments, such as cryptocurrencies like SHIB. Even though the Fed recently lowered rates, the benchmark remains elevated to combat inflation. A slower pace of rate cuts would negatively impact SHIB and similar tokens. While SHIB has faced recent setbacks, its community remains strong. However, investors are cautious due to market uncertainty linked to interest rates and inflation. SHIB's price reacts to economic conditions, and its future likely hinges on broader market recovery and investor sentiment. SHIB holders are keenly observing upcoming economic data, hoping for a market rebound.

With 10,000 new coins mined every minute, Dogecoin is abundant. Initially a “memecoin,” its value skyrocketed in 2021, joining the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap.

Even though Ethereum (ETH) usually steals the show with its massive DeFi ecosystem, and Cardano frequently draws attention for its proof-of-stake innovations, Remittix is gaining ground fast. Some analysts are even dubbing Remittix as the new XRP, pointing to its speedy transactions and growing adoption as reasons behind the hype. The Rise of Ethereum (ETH) Everybody knows that Ethereum is unchallengeable in decentralized finance as a category. Ethereum (ETH), by all accounts, has had a claim to fame as the blockchain of choice for smart contracts, NFTs, and all forms of dApps. Periodic traffic jams and high costs, however, push Ethereum to rank high in developers’ choices. However, even with the change of direction with the proof-of-stake model, ETH is not the only player in the market any longer. ETH is not short on upgrade plans but newer projects such as Remittix just continue to chip away at the Ethereum brand’s market share. Cardano’s Steady Approach Meanwhile, Cardano has garnered praise for taking a methodical, research-driven path. Launched by Charles Hoskinson, one of the minds behind early Ethereum concepts, Cardano aims to deliver strong scalability and security without sacrificing decentralization. Critics argue that development on Cardano can be slow, though supporters feel the project’s careful approach pays off over time. Even so, with so many emerging players, Cardano occasionally gets overshadowed—especially when a fresh contender like Remittix starts making waves in remittance solutions. Remittix (RTX) Taking the Lead But why is Remittix leaping ahead of Ethereum and Cardano right now? By focusing on simple, low-fee cross-border transactions, Remittix (RTX) has carved out a direct use case that resonates with both individual users and businesses. Instead of competing only in DeFi or NFTs, Remittix (RTX) aims to resolve everyday pain points in global banking. This strategy has caught on quickly, drawing in more fans who want real-world utility rather than pure speculation. No wonder some are calling Remittix as the new XRP—the altcoin appears well on its way to becoming a go-to solution for fast money transfers. Ethereum (ETH) Still a Heavyweight Of course, don’t expect Ethereum (ETH) to simply fade away. Its gigantic community of developers, massive liquidity, and well-known DeFi projects mean Ethereum isn’t going anywhere soon. Every major upgrade promises to tackle long standing issues like high transaction fees. Yet the fact remains that Ethereum has serious competition now. Projects like Remittix (RTX) are drawing attention away with faster settlements and a more user-friendly approach. Why Remittix (RTX) Stands Out Unlike Ethereum or Cardano, Remittix (RTX) isn’t trying to be everything for everyone. Its core goal—making cross-border payments simpler and cheaper—gives Remittix an edge in a huge global market. By focusing on remittances, Remittix (RTX) attracts both crypto veterans and newcomers who want a convenient way to move money without hefty bank fees or long wait times. This clear use case has been vital in driving adoption, and the project’s locked liquidity and contract audit help boost confidence among skeptics. Final Thoughts Seeing Remittix outperform heavyweights like Ethereum and Cardano has turned heads across the crypto space. While ETH keeps innovating with its large ecosystem and Cardano follows a research-based roadmap, Remittix (RTX) zeros in on real-world payments. As crypto gurus continue praising Remittix as the new XRP, many wonder if this up-and-comer can keep outshining more established networks. Time will tell whether Remittix holds onto its momentum, but for now, it has clearly put both Ethereum and Cardano on notice. Thinking of exploring Remittix before it takes off?

Known for its robust blockchain supporting smart contracts, NFTs, and various dApps, Ethereum (ETH) remains a favorite among developers despite occasional congestion and high fees. While Ethereum has embraced the proof-of-stake model to evolve, new players like Remittix are chipping away at its market dominance, challenging its position. Cardano: A Methodical Journey Cardano has earned respect for its deliberate, research-focused strategy. Founded by Charles Hoskinson, a key figure in early Ethereum development, Cardano strives for scalability and security without losing sight of decentralization. While some critics highlight the slow pace of development, supporters believe this careful strategy will pay dividends over time. However, with new contenders emerging, Cardano sometimes finds itself overshadowed, especially by newcomers like Remittix making significant strides in remittance solutions. Remittix (RTX) Steps into the Spotlight So, what sets Remittix apart from Ethereum and Cardano currently? By concentrating on straightforward, low-cost cross-border payments, Remittix (RTX) has identified a niche that appeals to both individuals and businesses. Rather than solely focusing on DeFi or NFTs, Remittix (RTX) seeks to address common issues in global banking. This approach has quickly won over supporters who prioritize practical utility over speculation. It's no surprise that some are calling Remittix the new XRP, given its potential to become a preferred option for fast money transfers. Ethereum (ETH) Remains a Key Player Ethereum (ETH) isn't disappearing anytime soon. With a vast network of developers, significant liquidity, and renowned DeFi projects, Ethereum maintains a formidable presence. Each major update aims to resolve persistent challenges like high transaction costs. However, the reality is that Ethereum now faces serious competition. Projects like Remittix (RTX) are capturing attention with faster transaction times and a more accessible approach. What Makes Remittix (RTX) Stand Out Unlike Ethereum or Cardano, Remittix (RTX) doesn't aspire to cater to every need. Its primary focus on simplifying and reducing the cost of cross-border payments gives it an advantage in a vast global market. By zeroing in on remittances, Remittix (RTX) attracts both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and newcomers seeking an easy way to transfer money without high bank fees or delays. This clear use case has been crucial in driving its adoption, and the project's secured liquidity and contract audit increase trust among skeptics. Concluding Thoughts The fact that Remittix is outperforming established giants like Ethereum and Cardano has caught the attention of the crypto community. While ETH continues to innovate with its extensive ecosystem and Cardano sticks to a research-centric path, Remittix (RTX) focuses on practical payment solutions. As experts praise Remittix as the new XRP, many are curious if this rising star will continue to outshine more established networks. Time will tell if Remittix can maintain its momentum, but for now, it's certainly making Ethereum and Cardano take notice. Interested in checking out Remittix before it gains even more traction?

Following months of low trading levels, the past month has seen a notable price rally. Despite Cardano's recent upward trend bringing hope, investors are increasingly interested in Remittix (RTX), an emerging leader in the PayFi sector. By targeting inefficiencies in cross-border payments, Remittix is gaining traction in its presale phase. So, how are these two projects shaping up for the months ahead? Cardano (ADA) Experiences a 21.59% Increase Over 7 Days Cardano (ADA) is beginning to reap the benefits of its intense development work in 2024. The team focused heavily on the Hydra scaling solution to enhance the network's transaction processing capabilities. This was followed by the Mithril protocol's implementation in late 2024, simplifying the process of running lightweight nodes and enhancing network decentralization and accessibility. Despite these efforts, Cardano's price didn't immediately reflect these advancements. However, with a 21.59% rise in the last week, these efforts seem to be paying off now. While other competitors experienced more dramatic growth in 2024, Cardano (ADA) is positioned with a technological advantage for 2025. Remittix: Seizing a $190 Trillion Market Potential As Cardano strives to sustain its momentum, Remittix (RTX) is emerging as a transformative player in the $190 trillion cross-border payments industry. By merging blockchain transparency with traditional fiat systems, Remittix is offering efficient, cost-effective solutions for users worldwide. Transforming International Money Transfers Remittix (RTX) allows users to convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies and transfer money directly to bank accounts around the world. Unlike traditional systems burdened by high fees and sluggish processing, Remittix offers flat-rate pricing and fast transactions, often completed in less than 24 hours. This transparency and affordability distinguish Remittix from older systems, attracting both crypto enthusiasts and mainstream users who seek a dependable, economical option for international transactions. Effortless Business Integration For businesses, Remittix (RTX) offers significant potential to enhance financial operations. Merchant accounts allow conversion from crypto to fiat in over 30 fiat currencies and more than 50 cryptocurrency pairs. This robust feature set enables businesses to extend their reach globally without the traditional banking system's risks and costs. Remittix eliminates these barriers, aiding businesses in competing more effectively in a globalized market. Remittix Presale Exceeds $3.5 Million At the core of the Remittix ecosystem lies the RTX token, serving various roles such as in staking, rewards, and governance. Significantly, it offers investors an opportunity to benefit from Remittix's growth. Currently priced at $0.0217 during its presale, the token has amassed $3.3 million in investments. Analysts predict an impressive 800% price increase during the presale, with further growth anticipated post-launch. As Remittix tackles longstanding issues in the cross-border payments field, it is set to disrupt the PayFi market and establish its presence in 2025.

With some notable reports on the matter of Ripple’s potential prioritization under the new government, the question arises of what could happen to the token’s price. XRP’s Potential Under Trump Ripple’s cross-border token exploded shortly after the US elections due to the long-awaited change in the upcoming government, especially in the SEC’s leadership. Most recently, the asset touched its 2018 all-time high of $3.4, which represented a massive 460% surge since early November when it stood below $0.6. The latest rally came after reports that the president-elect, who steps into office on January 20, will focus on US-based cryptocurrency projects, such as Solana, Cardano, and Ripple. It seems a bit far-fetched now to consider that any crypto asset, including BTC, could be included in the US treasury, but there have been many reports suggesting that it is possible under a favorable administration. Consequently, we decided to ask ChatGPT what would happen to XRP’s price should something as shocking as this indeed take place in the next four years. The popular AI chatbot responded that the first price target for the third-largest cryptocurrency would be $6 before it could really take off. Based on a positive market environment and a more suitable regulatory landscape, XRP, alongside ADA and SOL, could continue its rise. ChatGPT laid out two scenarios for a price peak. Optimistic Scenario : Some analysts speculate XRP could reach $10-$15 in the medium term if added to the reserve and supported by consistent utility and adoption. Aggressive Projections : In a highly favorable scenario, where XRP gains significant institutional adoption globally, prices could exceed $20 or even $50 over time. It’s safe to say that even the more modest scenario sounds quite bullish and maybe slightly unrealistic. A price level of $10 would put XRP’s market cap at over $570 billion – meaning Ripple’s token will be way ahead of ETH (if it remains close to its current level of $410 billion). The $50 projection would mean a market cap of well over $2.5 trillion, which will make it the number one cryptocurrency. As of January 19, this sounds exaggerated, to say the least. XRP Will Face Challenges ChatGPT further outlined some of the challenges ahead of XRP, most of which are related to the competition. Aside from the aforementioned ADA and SOL, Ripple’s asset will have to fight an uphill battle against BTC. Moreover, the AI platform warned that Trump’s plans might have changed with the introduction of his own crypto asset. As reported during the weekend, the president-elect announced the launch of a meme coin called Official Trump (TRUMP). It has already taken the crypto world by storm, becoming the second-largest meme token at one point before retracing slightly. Nevertheless, it could be a viable competition to XRP and the rest of the market as its impact on the industry is still debated .

Donald Trump the Bull (DONBULL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONBULL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Trump the Bull can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Trump the Bull could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Trump the Bull launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Trump the Bull on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Donald Trump the Bull by entering its contract address – AmgaL1uuQ97qJoXfUUxdHipLJmVd3toChivEBiSFn7MW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONBULL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|TRADING|DOGE|SOL|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-19 16:40:00

Bitcoin currently stands at $102,305, reflecting a modest 0.5% increase over the past 24 hours, following a remarkable 8.5% rise during the previous week. In the meantime, experts are already looking ahead to the post-inauguration phase, identifying Solana, Avalanche, and Remittix's token as the three with the greatest potential to soar in February. Solana: On a Remarkable Growth Path Solana (SOL) is valued at $233 right now, marking an 8.7% uptick in the past day. Over the last week, its price has been somewhat volatile, including a 5% drop on January 13 when it dipped below $170 for the first time since November 2024. Despite this, it now boasts an impressive 25.3% increase over the same period. Technical analysis indicates that Solana has garnered strong support above $183, contributing to its current notable performance. Analysts are optimistic about this token, with some predicting it could hit $300 in February if the momentum persists. However, a few analysts are wary, expecting a potential decline to $201.33 by day's end. The future movement of Solana will hinge on its support level and the overall market trend. Looking at a longer timeline, Solana might reach $1,000 by 2030, given ongoing advancements and improvements to its blockchain infrastructure. Yet, whether investors are willing to wait for such a substantial return remains uncertain. Could Avalanche Rally in February? In contrast to recent gains in major cryptocurrencies, Avalanche has been on a downward trend, experiencing a 5.8% decrease in the past day and a 9.6% drop over the past month. Although the market anticipates a strong upswing following the release of U.S. CPI data, Avalanche's value has slid to $38.9. The AVAX token is trading below the significant $40 threshold, yet it remains the 11th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, currently valued at $16 billion. Despite this price challenge, AVAX has shown a bullish 6.8% rise over the past week. For February's price outlook, Avalanche's recovery rally is facing resistance at the $40 psychological barrier and the 200 SMA line, both of which are hindering upward momentum. A breakthrough is necessary to sustain this bullish trend. Examining the Fibonacci levels, the triangle breakout rally is likely to meet the 50% Fibonacci level at $44.71. Beyond this point, the next significant resistance is located at the 78.60% level, priced at $51.09. Consequently, data suggests the possibility of AVAX reaching the $50 psychological level. Is Remittix the Leading Altcoin for February? Experts are particularly optimistic about RTX's price as its presale progresses. RTX, the native token of Remittix (RTX), is revolutionizing global payments by combining blockchain technology with fiat transactions to offer swift and affordable cross-border solutions. Remittix supports over 40 cryptocurrencies, such as Cardano, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Ethereum. The platform also facilitates instant conversions into fiat currencies like USD and GBP, allowing seamless deposits into recipients' bank accounts. By bridging the gap between crypto and fiat, Remittix holds a competitive edge over traditional payment platforms like Stripe and Wise, as well as crypto-exclusive services like Coinbase Wallet. With support for more than 30 fiat currencies and 50 crypto pairs, Remittix ensures accessibility and inclusivity for businesses and individuals, simplifying global commerce with its wide range of options. Notably, the platform employs an open flat-fee approach, reducing costs and providing transparency over the high fees and unfavorable exchange rates often seen with conventional banks. This strategy ensures that the full amount sent reaches the recipient, positioning Remittix as a transformative force in the payments industry, where opaque practices are unfortunately common. Additionally, Remittix's token offers investors an opportunity to engage with a project possessing potential similar to Solana and Avalanche in their early stages. In fact, fundamentals suggest RTX may surpass these tokens and redefine the standards for blockchain-based financial solutions. Currently, the RTX token is priced at $0.0217 during its presale, presenting a compelling investment opportunity. This presale has raised over $3.5 million, showcasing investors' confidence in the project. Analysts anticipate substantial growth, predicting a 25x increase during the presale phase and over 1,500% gains following its launch, as the demand for innovative cross-border payment solutions continues to climb.

For the long-term run, Solana could reach $1,000 by 2030 with the continuous development and enhancements to its blockchain infrastructure. However, whether investors are willing to wait this long to get this massive yield remains uncertain. Is Avalanche Ready To Surge in February? Despite the recent surges in major coins, avalanche is on a dip form, trading at 5.8% loss in the past day and 9.6% loss in the past month. While the market points to a strong upsurge after the US CPI data release, avalanche is down to $38.9. AVAX token price is trading below the $40 psychological mark, but still remains the 11th biggest crypto by market capitalization, currently standing at $16 billion. Despite the price hurdle, AVAX is on a bullish 6.8% rise over the past week. For price prediction in February, Avalanche’s recovery rally faces opposition from the $40 psychological mark and the 200 SMA line. This is a key resistance to the upward moves. holding the momentum down. Hence, a breakout is needed for this bullish trend. Looking at the Fibonacci level, the triangle breakout rally will likely challenge the 50% Fibonacci level at $44.71.

Former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra announced the program during an ASEAN economic discussion. According to the Bangkok Post report , the sandbox will focus on stablecoins to minimize risk while allowing innovation. This controlled testing environment allows businesses and consumers to experiment with cryptocurrency transactions, particularly in the tourism sector. Gulf Binance CEO Nirun Fuwattananukul welcomed the project, stating that the sandbox approach provides a balanced framework for testing cryptocurrency adoption while maintaining regulatory oversight. Crypto.news first reported about the pilot initiative in December. You might also like: SEC charges Nova Labs over crypto securities fraud and false partnership claims The program specifically targets Bitcoin usage in Phuket’s tourism industry to attract digital currency holders and encourage crypto spending in the region. Under current Thai law, cryptocurrencies are classified as digital assets rather than legal tender. The Thai Securities and Exchange Commission regulates cryptocurrency trading and initial coin offerings through the Emergency Decree on Digital Asset Businesses, requiring exchanges to obtain proper licensing. The announcement aligns with Thailand’s cryptocurrency developments, including considerations to allow Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs on local exchanges for the first time. A pilot project focused on testing cryptocurrency payments for tourists is also set to launch in Phuket, aiming to streamline transactions for foreign visitors. Thaksin emphasized ongoing discussions with other ASEAN nations about cryptocurrency adoption, noting regional interest in Thailand’s initiatives. He warned that delays in adoption could lead to talent migration to the United States, particularly given the incoming Trump administration’s cryptocurrency plans. The sandbox program shows Thailand’s strategic approach to balancing technology with regulatory oversight in the cryptocurrency space. By creating a controlled environment for testing and monitoring cryptocurrency transactions, Thailand plans to establish itself as a regional leader in crypto adoption in Asia.

The price is now nearing its all-time high of $108K, where a breakout could ignite a short liquidation cascade, potentially pushing the asset into uncharted territory. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart The $90K support zone has proven to be a robust floor, holding the price steady in recent months and showcasing strong buyer confidence. This resurgence of buying interest has driven Bitcoin above the channel’s middle trendline, positioning it close to the ATH at $108K. That peak level represents a substantial resistance region with concentrated supply and heightened selling pressure. As Bitcoin approaches this critical threshold, short-term volatility is expected due to the ongoing battle between buyers and sellers. If bullish momentum continues, reclaiming the ATH at $108K could trigger a short liquidation cascade, likely resulting in another surge as market participants rush to cover positions. The 4-Hour Chart The lower timeframe highlights the importance of the $90K support, which has consistently halted downward momentum in recent months. This has fueled an impulsive bullish move, driving Bitcoin toward the $108K resistance zone. This region not only represents Bitcoin’s ATH but also aligns with the ascending channel’s middle boundary, further reinforcing it as a critical juncture. A successful breakout and consolidation above this level could pave the way for a sustained rally toward new highs. The upcoming price action at the $108K resistance region will be crucial in determining Bitcoin’s next trend, with heightened volatility expected in the short term. On-chain Analysis By Shayan The realized price of UTXO age bands, particularly for the 1-3 month cohort, offers critical insights into short-term holding behavior and broader market sentiment. This metric represents the average acquisition price for recent buyers, acting as a dynamic support or resistance line that reflects market confidence. When Bitcoin is above this short-term cohort’s realized price, it signals growing bullish momentum. This indicates that new buyers are confident in holding their positions, even at elevated price levels. Conversely, a drop below this threshold suggests a heightened risk of sell-offs, as these participants face unrealized losses. Recently, the realized price for the 1-3 month UTXO cohort at the $90K region has acted as a crucial support level, pushing the asset up toward its ATH. Bitcoin holding above this level signals a bullish sentiment in the market, with the potential for the price to continue its upward trajectory. However, if the cryptocurrency breaks below this dynamic support line, market sentiment could shift to a fearful state, increasing the likelihood of a distribution phase.

It would provide the state treasurer with authority to invest up to 3% of Wyoming’s general fund, permanent Wyoming mineral trust fund, and permanent land fund into Bitcoin. The cap of 3% in this bill is meant to make sure that the scales of potential gains are balanced against prudent risk management. Strengthening Wyoming’s Leadership in Digital Assets The bill is in line with Wyoming’s history of leading the charge on blockchain and cryptocurrency . Since 2018, Wyoming has passed more than two dozen laws in support of digital assets, including recognizing Bitcoin as property and establishing the Wyoming Special Purpose Depository Institution (SPDI) framework. The bill for her state was welcomed by Senator Cynthia Lummis, an avid Bitcoin proponent, as a progressive move: “This forward-looking approach benefits our state as we lead the nation in financial innovation,” Lummis said. Jacob Wasserburger highlighted Wyoming’s innovative spirit: “From women’s suffrage to digital assets, Wyoming has consistently set national standards for progress.” Massachusetts Joins the Bitcoin Reserve Initiative Notably, this move ran parallel to a bill filed by Massachusetts State Senator Peter Durant that would create a Bitcoin reserve of the state’s funds, considered a major step for the latter. Durant has said, “This legislation is a step toward securing our state’s financial future.” Massachusetts’ entry into the discussion underlines growing recognition of the strategic importance of Bitcoin among the states of the Union. The Economic Rationale for a Bitcoin Reserve Over the past decade, Bitcoin has gained substantially and shown much resilience; it is often referred to as “digital gold.” Its decentralized nature and capped supply make it an attractive hedge against inflation and economic instability. Setting up a Bitcoin reserve would protect a state like Wyoming against currency devaluation and economic shocks with diversified investment portfolios. Representative Wasserburger said, “We can’t afford to sit on the sidelines while others move forward.” National and Global Momentum The momentum of Bitcoin reserves doesn’t stop there: Texas has proposed Senate Bill 778 on the same initiative, and internationally, the central bank of the Czech Republic is doing research into Bitcoin as a reserve asset. These signals mean a lot when it comes to the emerging trend in integrating digital assets into financial strategy. Wyoming and Massachusetts are first in setting some sort of example for other states to study Bitcoin’s potential in public finance.",Bitcoin|Blockchain|Web3,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-01-19 16:51:00

Now that the milestone has been hit, the team has added a 30-day countdown timer to the website, marking the final leg of the presale. But here’s the kicker: countdowns have a history of turbocharging sales. If the daily raise rate spikes, the presale could wrap up long before the 30 days are over. $WEPE’s backstory and Wall Street-inspired branding have struck a chord with meme lovers and serious investors alike. It’s not just a token – it’s a movement, riding the cultural zeitgeist of financial memes. Don’t miss the last chance to buy $WEPE at the current price of $0.0003665.

It’s built to help crypto enthusiasts navigate the wild world of investments. Think portfolio management tools and staking rewards, all infused with AI wizardry. If you’re looking for a meme coin with both charm and utility, $MIND has you covered. Dogecoin ($DOGE) The OG of meme coins, $DOGE , never stays out of the spotlight for long. With Elon Musk teasing potential new use cases for Dogecoin as he reshapes Twitter, excitement around $DOGE is bubbling up once more . From payments to tipping, and even integrating into Musk’s rumored “everything app,” $DOGE is poised for a resurgence. Its massive community and Musk’s unpredictable influence ensure it’s always a wildcard in the meme coin universe. Flockerz ($FLOCK) $FLOCK is gearing up to soar as its presale enters the final stretch. With just 2 days left , this V2E (vote-to-earn) token has already raised $10M, capturing the imagination of meme coin enthusiasts. What makes Flockerz different? It’s not just about memes, it’s about governance. The platform combines meme culture with decentralized decision-making, letting holders vote on the future direction of the project. With exchange listings around the corner, Flockerz could be flying into wallets everywhere soon. Official Trump ($TRUMP) Love him or hate him, Trump-themed tokens continue to dominate headlines – and none more so than the Official Trump coin.

This meteoric rise has caught the attention of crypto enthusiasts and political supporters alike, with trading volumes exceeding $200M in just one day. What makes $TRUMP unique is its ability to blend meme culture with political identity, creating a token that feels like both a rallying cry and an investment opportunity. However, as with any meme coin, the hype-driven market brings risk alongside the rewards. Whether $TRUMP is a moonshot or a bubble waiting to burst, one thing is clear: it’s the talk of both the crypto and political arenas.

But there are some altcoins that have racked up big numbers on their onchain data, attracting analysts’ attention. Among standout opportunities, DTX Exchange comes in first, followed by SUI blockchain and the Ripple price gains. But why do these coins make sense in current market conditions? Let’s explore. DTX Exchange Gains Global Interest with Large Holders DTX Exchange has recently taken center stage in the crypto world and could offer better gains than the current Ripple price and the SUI blockchain. Plus the onchain data shows that over 300,000 wallets now hold DTX tokens. The fact that it managed to get so many holders during presale shows the popularity of the DTX Exchange. Based on this, analysts are predicting that the project would be a game-changer in crypto. On top of such an enormous holder base, DTX Exchange offers a bunch of other awesome features that would amplify the whole trading experience. One such feature is the huge variety of assets that has over 120,000 financial instruments which would make it easy for traders to diversify their portfolios. This huge asset selection pairs perfectly with DTX Exchange’s high leverage feature, offering 1000x profit potential. This means traders could make huge gains even with a small investment. This brilliant combination of centralized and decentralized features gives DTX Exchange a major edge on platforms like SUI blockchain. With an array of such advanced features, a fast framework is also needed. That’s why DTX Exchange uses cutting-edge VulcanX blockchain that gives it a 200,000 TPS. So traders can take advantage of market opportunities as soon as they pop up. This speed resembles the XRP swift technology, meaning DTX could enjoy gains similar to the Ripple price. High Onchain Activity Lifted the Ripple Price Since launch, Ripple (XRP) has completely changed the digital financial landscape. Famous for being fast, cheap, and energy-efficient, XRP facilitates cross-border transactions in just 3-5 seconds. This means transaction costs are as low as $0.00001 which is remarkable. The Ripple price has recently seen a pump and is now trading over $2 . One of the key factors behind the Ripple price surge is the increase in onchain network growth. This key metric indicates how many new addresses conducted their first blockchain transaction. On January 9, XRP started to grow in this area. Source: Santiment But the recent numbers show a decline in network growth, which signals waning demand for XRP. Many analysts think that the Ripple price could struggle if this trend keeps up, causing the price of XRP to drop below $2. SEED Partnership Could Boost the SUI Blockchain SUI Blockchain uses an innovative layer-1 platform to provide global blockchain solutions that are scalable and secure. Because SUI uses an object-centric data model and the Move programming language, it eliminates the inefficiencies in traditional blockchain architectures. Recently, the SUI Blockchain has seen more onchain activity that indicated rapid growth. On January 4, 2024, SUI spiked by 20% , resulting in a 150% increase in trading volume. At that time the SUI blockchain was around $5.27 and had tremendous growth even better than major cryptos. Source: CoinMarketCap But now the SUI blockchain price has downshifted a bit. However, a significant event has occurred. The SUI blockchain recently formed a strategic partnership with SEED to revolutionize gaming for 100 million users. Many analysts think SUI’s price may go up because of this. Interestingly DTX offers a similar opportunity that could provide insane profits. The platform’s growing demand for its presale, which has already collected over $11.5 million, could be an appealing factor. Conclusion Considering high on-chain activity, these three altcoins could be ideal for traders looking for transformative gains. While the SUI Blockchain and Ripple price could be affected by market volatility, DTX Exchange excels with over 300,000 holders, a blazing 200,000 TPS, and access to a huge library of financial instruments. The DTX ongoing presale could be a good opportunity to make big money before the launch.

On-chain data shows the SOL blockchain network attracting an unusually high number of new entrants as bulls target further price discovery. Trump Token Launch Drives Solana price to All Time High Solana (SOL) has emerged as the standout performer in the cryptocurrency market ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration. While Solana had maintained a bullish outlook throughout the past week, the rally significantly accelerated following the announcement of the $TRUMP meme token, hosted on the Solana network. Investor enthusiasm for the $TRUMP token has translated into a surge in demand for SOL, as it is the prerequisite native coin for the Solana ecosystem. The $TRUMP token’s rapid rise— gaining over 3000% within 24 hours —has directly bolstered Solana’s bullish price momentum. As of Sunday, January 19, Solana reached a new global all-time high of $275, with its price consolidating above $270 at press time. This remarkable SOL price rally marks a 51% gain over the last six days, extending Solana’s winning streak and solidifying its status as the best-performing cryptocurrency among the top 20 ranked digital assets in 2025. Solana Price Action (SOLUSD) Having added over market capitalization soaring by more than $75 billion in the past week, this establishes SOL as the most in-demand digital asset in the build up to Trump’s inauguration. If Trump’s administration enacts crypto-friendly policies, as many investors speculate, Solana could see continued long-term gains, potentially strengthening its market dominance. New users execute 5.3 million SOL transactions after $TRUMP token launch Solana’s 25% rally on Saturday was largely driven by speculative demand from traders anticipating short-term gains from Trump’s decision to launch his $TRUMP token on the Solana network. However, on-chain data shows that SOL also received significant organic demand from new users who joined the Solana network after the $TRUMP token was launched for trading. Emphasizing this narrative on-chain data from HelloMoon chart below presents the number of transactions executed by newly-created SOL wallets on a given day. Solana Daily First Signers | Source: Hellomoon.io The chart above shows that first-signers executed 5.32 million transactions on January 18, coinciding with Trump’s token launch. Notably this is the second-highest number of new user traction the Solana blockchain network has recorded since December 17. According to Forest Bai, co-founder of crypto investment firm Foresight Ventures , there is growing optimism that the market rally could advance further after Trump’s inauguration. “I had expected he might use a range of measures—like lowering interest rates, establishing national reserves, encouraging businesses to buy crypto, or introducing crypto-friendly policies. But in the end, Trump chose the most direct approach: launching a memecoin, which immediately brought in millions of new users.” Forest Bai, co-founder of crypto investment firm Foresight Ventures When a cryptocurrency’s price surge is accompanied by a significant increase in new user transactions, it creates positive sentiment for two key reasons. First, it signals that Solana’s price rally is driven by fresh, organic demand rather than over-leveraged speculative buying, which often leads to rapid price corrections. Secondly, the sharp increase in SOL demand from new users helps absorb the rising supply, which could be pivotal to holding key price support levels during consolidation phases. Solana Price Forecast: $300 breakout in sight? Solana price forecast chart is hinting at a steady consolidation above $265 after reaching a local peak of $275. This comes after a breakout from a falling wedge pattern, a typically bullish setup. The daily chart shows a robust increase in trading volume and a rising Bull-Bear Power (BBP) indicator, both pointing to strengthened buying momentum. The successful breakout above $232.36, the falling wedge’s resistance, validates the pattern’s bullish implications. In a bullish scenario, sustained buying pressure could push SOL toward the next psychological resistance at $280. If SOL closes decisively above this level, it could trigger a breakout to $300, aligning with the measured target of the wedge pattern. Solana Price Forecast: $300 breakout in sight? The rising volumes and increased transactions from new users also supports this outlook, signaling strong buying support. Conversely, a bearish reversal remains possible if buyers fail to maintain control above $266. In such a case, SOL risks revisiting the $234.18 support zone, which aligns with the wedge’s breakout level. The BBP’s steep rise could indicate short-term overbought conditions, warranting caution. A close below $232.36 would invalidate the bullish setup, exposing SOL to further downside toward $168.88. With trading volumes signaling oversupplied, Solana price appears poised for another potential sharp move in either direction. It remains to be seen if Solana traders will take profits after Trump’s inauguration or if further crypto-friendly comments from the inauguration speech could spark further gains.

Table of Contents SUI price analysis: Key drivers for the DeFi token price pump Pull up in the bullish zone with FXGuys Is TRON’s TRX on its way to recovery? 100x gains? Check with FXG presale tokens Top altcoins witnessed a massive price dip in the past week, and many DeFi tokens fell to even double-digit losses in the weekly timeframe. However, the crypto market is known for its volatility, and coming right back up is key to volatile trends. Sui and TRON (TRX ) were sinking in the bearish waves last week, but they could be off to quite the recovery already. FX Guys (FXG) is a new DeFi project that’s causing even investors on other bullish DeFi tokens to reconsider. And who won’t when FXG prepares for a staggering 100x pump after its launch? Apart from token price surges, there’s a host of features that users can only find on the FX Guys platform! SUI price analysis: Key drivers for the DeFi token price pump The Sui token has been the very image of development since its launch in 2023. Sui was almost immediately a ‘Solana killer,’ owing to its similarity to the SOL ecosystem. And with Solana dubbed the ‘Ethereum killer,’ it seems the succession timeline in the DeFi sector has been planned. It’s all for good reason, too, as the SUI token is treading on Solana’s and Ethereum’s paths to greatness. That path comprises loads of development that have kept the Sui network busy in the past two months. Separate from the crypto rallies, the SUI blockchain has hosted other token launches and attracted institutional investors like Gray-scale and Van Eck. The recent Sui intraday surges will put many traders in the green, but they are out for FX Guys instead.

After completing the trading objectives on the challenges, the trader is eligible for funding. Funding starts from $2,500 and goes up to $500,000.

Maximum gains and with a real chance to become a community member? It’s no wonder traders are all over the presale. Is TRON’s TRX on its way to recovery? The TRX token has been subject to massive bearish waves on the weekly and monthly charts, as TRON’s TRX deals with 5.70% and 22.01% losses on weekly and monthly timeframes. The losses worsened at the start of this week’s trading as TRX is testing its 100-day EMA level. However, things seem to be switching up for TRON lately. The bearish waves have pulled the TRX price under, and the token might be making a rebound as it nears the oversold region on the Relative Strength Index. The next price target for TRX is its $0.28 level, from where the token can then test its resistance at $0.32. There’s also bearish potential, as much as the bulls are optimistic. TRON could keep plunging, going as low as its 200-day EMA level at $0.19. 100x gains? Check with FXG presale tokens Analysts have been harping on about one of the top altcoins with a 100x growth potential; that presale token is finally here, and FXG coins are all but open for business.

Many in the crypto sphere have started dubbing this emerging platform the new XRP contender thanks to its focus on rapid cross-border transactions. While SOL has previously captured headlines for its lightning-fast network, the big wallets behind it are now piling into RTX at a rate few saw coming. A Quick Look at Solana (SOL) Before going into what makes Remittix (RTX) so appealing to whales, consider Solana (SOL). Solana (SOL), which has extremely fast transaction rates and a robust DeFi ecosystem, has attracted legions of developers who prefer scalable infrastructure. Its token, SOL, remains one of the most valuable crypto assets. Yet, the same whales who once championed SOL appear ready to diversify, betting on the next wave of cross-border solutions. Why Whales Are Eyeing Remittix (RTX) As on-chain data highlights, significant addresses once dedicated to Solana (SOL) have begun scooping up large amounts of Remittix (RTX). But why this pivot? For starters, Remittix (RTX) offers a seamless method for converting cryptocurrencies into fiat and wiring them directly to bank accounts worldwide. This practical approach to bridging crypto and traditional finance has many calling it the new XRP contender because XRP carved out its reputation by tackling cross-border payments. With global remittances hitting billions of dollars each year, whales see the potential for massive adoption of a solution like Remittix (RTX). The Technical Appeal of Remittix (RTX) Beyond its real-world use cases, Remittix (RTX) relies on a secure contract audited to ensure minimal vulnerabilities. Early adopters appreciate not only its transparent fee structure but also the locked liquidity meant to shield it from wild price swings. When high-volume traders notice these security measures, they often view the token as a more stable investment. Given that whales linked to Solana (SOL) transactions are typically savvy, their bet on Remittix (RTX) suggests they see strong fundamentals in this newcomer. What Makes It the “New XRP Contender?” Observers compare Remittix (RTX) to XRP for two main reasons: cross-border efficiency and speed. While XRP set the stage by partnering with banks to streamline global payments, Remittix (RTX) approaches a similar challenge from a more grassroots angle—direct wallet-to-bank account remittances. Some fans argue that if Remittix (RTX) gains enough traction, it might replicate or even surpass XRP’s early hype. This possibility piqued the interest of large holders who previously stuck with Solana (SOL) and other top altcoins. On-chain trackers show consistent inflows of RTX into whale wallets once affiliated with SOL positions. This shift might indicate that whales anticipate a substantial price rise if the general market sentiment turns bullish. It doesn’t necessarily signal the end for (SOL), but rather a strategic hedge—whales want exposure to multiple high-potential coins. Should Remittix (RTX) continue developing its payment platform and forging strategic partnerships, that early whale accumulation could yield notable returns. Conclusion The fact that Solana (SOL) whales are flocking to Remittix (RTX) underscores a shift in where the smart money is going. With its focus on hassle-free remittances and a locked liquidity system, Remittix (RTX) appeals to those who value practical solutions over hype. Combined with on-chain data suggesting heavy whale accumulation, it’s no wonder people are calling it the new XRP contender. Whether Remittix (RTX) can truly live up to that title remains to be seen, but the current wave of whale activity signals at least one thing: major investors see something special in this rising cross-border payment platform.

This emerging platform is being hailed by many in the crypto community as the next XRP challenger due to its emphasis on swift cross-border transactions. Although SOL has been in the spotlight for its rapid network speeds, the major players behind it are now amassing RTX at an unexpected pace. Examining Solana (SOL) Before diving into what attracts whales to Remittix (RTX), let's take a closer look at Solana (SOL). Known for its exceptionally fast transaction speeds and strong DeFi ecosystem, Solana (SOL) has won over numerous developers seeking scalable infrastructure. Its token, SOL, is still among the most valuable in the crypto world. However, the same whales who once backed SOL seem eager to diversify their investments, eyeing the future of cross-border solutions. Reasons Whales Are Interested in Remittix (RTX) On-chain data shows that large addresses previously associated with Solana (SOL) are now acquiring significant amounts of Remittix (RTX). But what's driving this shift? Firstly, Remittix (RTX) provides an effortless way to convert cryptocurrencies into fiat and transfer them directly to global bank accounts. This practical bridging of crypto and traditional finance is earning it comparisons to XRP, renowned for addressing cross-border payments. With global remittances reaching billions annually, whales recognize the potential for wide adoption of a service like Remittix (RTX). The Technical Draw of Remittix (RTX) Aside from its practical applications, Remittix (RTX) employs a secure contract that has undergone auditing to ensure minimal vulnerabilities. Early users appreciate its straightforward fee structure and the locked liquidity designed to protect against extreme price fluctuations. High-volume traders, noticing these safety features, often view the token as a more reliable investment. Given the astute nature of whales associated with Solana (SOL) transactions, their investment in Remittix (RTX) implies they recognize strong foundational elements in this new player. Why Is It Considered the ""New XRP Challenger?"" Remittix (RTX) is likened to XRP mainly for its efficiency and speed in cross-border transactions. Whereas XRP made strides by collaborating with banks to facilitate global payments, Remittix (RTX) tackles the same issue from a grassroots level—enabling direct remittances from wallets to bank accounts. Some enthusiasts believe that if Remittix (RTX) gains enough momentum, it could echo or even exceed the initial buzz surrounding XRP. This possibility has caught the eye of substantial holders previously committed to Solana (SOL) and other leading altcoins. On-chain trackers indicate a steady inflow of RTX into whale wallets previously linked to SOL holdings. This transition may suggest that whales are expecting a significant price increase if market sentiment turns bullish. It's not necessarily a move away from (SOL), but rather a strategic approach—whales want exposure to multiple promising coins. Should Remittix (RTX) continue to enhance its payment platform and establish key partnerships, early whale investments could prove highly lucrative. Conclusion The movement of Solana (SOL) whales towards Remittix (RTX) highlights a shift in the direction of informed investments. With its emphasis on seamless remittances and a secured liquidity system, Remittix (RTX) attracts those prioritizing practical solutions over mere hype. Coupled with on-chain data indicating substantial whale accumulation, it's no surprise this coin is being called the new XRP challenger. Whether Remittix (RTX) will truly earn that title remains uncertain, but the current trend in whale activity suggests one thing: major investors see something noteworthy in this up-and-coming cross-border payment platform.

Qubetics Presale Could Be Your Second Chance! Discover the Best Cryptos to Buy in January 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/bitcoin-created-millionaires-but-you-missed-it-qubetics-presale-could-be-your-second-chance-discover-the-best-cryptos-to-buy-in-january-2025/,"Remember when Bitcoin was dismissed as internet magic money? Back in 2010, Bitcoin was worth less than a penny, and by 2017, it skyrocketed to nearly $20,000. Fast forward to today, and Bitcoin is a household name, trading at levels that were once unimaginable. Early adopters who took a chance on Bitcoin are now living stories of wealth that most can only dream of. But let’s be honest—not everyone had the vision or the guts to invest back then. And now, with Bitcoin’s price soaring into the tens of thousands, jumping in feels like you’re already late to the party. But what if I told you there’s another shot at catching a crypto before it explodes? Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a rising star in the crypto space with the potential to reshape blockchain technology. Unlike Bitcoin, which is already well-established, Qubetics is in its early presale stages, giving investors a fresh opportunity to get in before the mainstream catches on. If you missed Bitcoin, this could be your second chance to be part of something massive. Let’s explore why Qubetics stands out as one of the Best Cryptos to Buy in January 2025. Qubetics Presale Is a Rare Opportunity You Can’t Afford to Miss Imagine being on the whitelist for Bitcoin back in the day. Now, think about what it feels like to miss Qubetics’ exclusive whitelist, where early supporters could secure tokens with zero upfront investment. The presale launched at just $0.01, but only those who signed up early got that sweet deal. Since then, Qubetics has powered through 15 sold-out presale stages, and now, during its 1 7th stage, the price sits at $0.0501 . And here’s the thing—each stage only lasts seven days, and with every new stage, the price rises by 10%. If you’re waiting for the perfect moment, it’s already passing you by. Qubetics isn’t just another token hyped by influencers. This project is solving a real issue in the blockchain world: interoperability . Right now, blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana operate in isolation, making it difficult for data and assets to move smoothly between networks. Qubetics is changing that by becoming the world’s first Web3 aggregator. It connects multiple blockchains into a single, streamlined network, unlocking seamless data sharing and cross-chain transactions. Picture this: a global e-commerce business that accepts payments in various cryptocurrencies. Without Qubetics, managing those payments across different blockchains is a nightmare. But with Qubetics’ seamless interoperability, that business can instantly process transactions across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and beyond—effortlessly and securely. This kind of innovation can revolutionize industries, making Qubetics far more than just another crypto token. Qubetics has already r aised over $9.9 million, with more than 15,000 holders and 425 million $TICS tokens sold. That’s serious traction, and it’s only gaining more momentum. The window to get in early is closing fast, and missing this could feel a lot like missing Bitcoin all over again. Bitcoin’s Early Days Were a Struggle, but Look at It Now Bitcoin wasn’t always the king of crypto. When it first launched in 2009, it struggled to gain attention. People laughed at the idea of digital money, and let’s not forget the infamous story of someone spending 10,000 BTC on two pizzas in 2010—worth billions today. Bitcoin didn’t just become valuable overnight. It was a slow grind of adoption, development, and a whole lot of skepticism. But for those who saw its potential and invested early, that patience paid off in ways most could never imagine. Fast forward to now, and Bitcoin is a global powerhouse. It’s not just a cryptocurrency; it’s a hedge against inflation, a store of value, and even legal tender in some countries. But let’s face it, buying Bitcoin today doesn’t feel the same as it did back then. It’s expensive, and while it’s still a solid investment, it doesn’t offer the same massive growth potential it once did. That’s where Qubetics comes in. It’s at the stage where Bitcoin was in its early days—undervalued, underestimated, and full of potential. The difference? You have the benefit of hindsight. You know what happens when innovative technology meets early investment. And this time, you don’t have to watch from the sidelines. Don’t Let Another Opportunity Slip Away Let’s be real—getting in on Bitcoin’s early days isn’t possible anymore. But that doesn’t mean your chance at massive crypto gains is gone. Qubetics ($TICS) is offering an opportunity that’s still within reach, but it won’t stay that way for long. The $TICS presale price is climbing, and with each 7-day stage bringing a 10% increase, waiting is a risk you don’t want to take. Qubetics is solving real problems in the blockchain world, breaking down barriers between networks and creating a more connected future. With millions raised and thousands of investors already on board, Qubetics is proving it’s more than just hype—it’s a movement. If you missed Bitcoin, this is your second chance. Don’t let it pass you by. Get in on one of the Best Cryptos to Buy in January 2025 and be part of the next big wave in crypto innovation.

Another project gaining momentum is Remittix (RTX) as it continues to see investment in its presale. With a unique value proposition in the financial sector, Remittix is rapidly establishing itself as a leading name in the PayFi sector. Engineered to disrupt the $190 trillion cross-border payments industry, Remittix (RTX) is attracting widespread interest from investors worldwide. So how are Ripple and Remittix likely to stack up against each other in 2025? Ripple Soars By 41.86% In 7 Day Window Ripple (XRP) is on a rampage, currently trading at $3.26, with a staggering intraday high of $3.39. Ripple (XRP) has spiked in the last week after fluctuations throughout December and January. Ripple has posted a 42% gain in the last 7 days ahead of the 20th January, which will see the arrival of Trump's administration. Particularly, search interest for Ripple (XRP) is at an all-time high, surpassing previous 2017 highs, according to Google Trends data. Such renewed interest has even seen Ripple (XRP) briefly pass Ethereum (ETH), though it still trails Bitcoin (BTC) globally in terms of its search volume. Setting a New Benchmark for Cross-Border Transactions At the heart of Remittix’s (RTX) appeal is its revolutionary approach to processing crypto-to-fiat transactions. This platform lets users exchange more than 40 cryptocurrencies for fiat and move funds to any worldwide bank account. In doing so, Remittix solves the problems that come with traditional payment systems, such as long processing times, hidden fees, and limited accessibility. For individuals who want to enjoy smoother international payment processes, or for businesses looking to simplify their operations, Remittix offers a transparent and affordable solution. Simplifying Crypto Adoption for Businesses Beyond individual users, Remittix Pay API is a game-changer for businesses. The API enables companies to accept cryptocurrency payments and settle them seamlessly in fiat, making it easier to manage digital assets without requiring in-depth market knowledge. Freelancers, merchants, and enterprises find particular value in this feature. By supporting over 30 fiat currencies and 50+ cryptocurrency pairs, Remittix gives businesses the flexibility to operate across multiple regions efficiently. Privacy and Security at the Core Privacy and security are paramount in today’s financial landscape, and Remittix (RTX) excels in both domains. Payments processed through the platform are delivered as standard bank transfers, ensuring no visible connection to cryptocurrency. This level of discretion appeals to users who want to leverage blockchain technology without compromising on privacy, whether for personal transactions or business operations. Pursuing Financial Inclusion A significant driver of Remittix’s popularity is its commitment to fostering financial inclusion. Some places in the world are not as fortunate as the West and much of Europe, lacking the same financial infrastructure, which is required for participation in the global economy. Remittix offers 24 / 7 access without the need for any traditional banking infrastructure, promoting access to the global economy among underbanked populations. This fits the platform's larger goal of democratizing cross-border payments and reducing financial inequality. The Remittix Presale Surpasses $3.5 Million Raised The $RTX token is the lifeblood of the Remittix ecosystem and fulfils several crucial functions such as in staking, rewards, and platform governance. Designed for resilience and growth, $RTX is currently up for grabs for just $0.0217. The presale is picking up steam with more than $3.5 million raised so far. By the presale close, analysts expect an 800% price surge and a further rally post launch. Remittix is aiming to become a disruptive force in PayFi by 2025 as it continues to tackle inefficiencies around cross-border payments. For visionary investors, Remittix (RTX) represents a once-in-an-era opportunity.

Another project on the rise is Remittix (RTX), which is seeing increased investment during its presale. With a distinct offering in the financial sector, Remittix is quickly becoming a prominent name in the PayFi industry. Designed to revolutionize the $190 trillion cross-border payments market, Remittix (RTX) is drawing significant interest from investors worldwide. How will Ripple and Remittix compare in 2025? Ripple Experiences a 41.86% Surge in a Week Ripple (XRP) is on a significant rise, currently trading at $3.26, with a notable intraday peak of $3.39. Over the past week, Ripple (XRP) has experienced a 42% increase, ahead of January 20th, the day Trump's administration is set to begin. Interest in Ripple (XRP) has reached unprecedented levels, surpassing its previous 2017 peak, according to Google Trends. This surge in interest briefly allowed Ripple (XRP) to surpass Ethereum (ETH), although it still lags behind Bitcoin (BTC) globally in search volume. Redefining Cross-Border Payment Standards The core appeal of Remittix’s (RTX) platform lies in its innovative method for handling crypto-to-fiat transactions. This service enables users to convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat money and transfer these funds to any bank account globally. By doing so, Remittix addresses the challenges of traditional payment systems, such as lengthy processing times, hidden charges, and limited access.

This level of privacy is attractive to users who wish to use blockchain technology without sacrificing confidentiality, whether for personal or business transactions.

Remittix provides 24/7 access without requiring traditional banking infrastructure, helping underbanked populations engage with the global economy. This aligns with the platform's broader mission to democratize cross-border payments and decrease financial inequality. Remittix Presale Exceeds $3.5 Million in Funding The $RTX token is the core of the Remittix ecosystem, serving key roles in staking, rewards, and platform governance. Built for durability and expansion, $RTX is currently available for $0.0217. The presale is gaining traction, having raised over $3.5 million to date. Analysts predict an 800% price increase by the end of the presale, with further growth anticipated post-launch.

With its innovative technology and strong presale momentum, Lightchain AI has already raised $11.3 million at $0.00525 per token, attracting attention as a potential game-changer in the crypto market. Dogecoin Beloved Pioneer in Meme Coins Dogecoin, introduced in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin, has become a prominent cryptocurrency, largely due to its vibrant community and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Recently, Dogecoin's value surged by 88% following Donald Trump's election victory, driven by expectations of lighter cryptocurrency regulation and Musk's appointment to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). This initiative, sharing its acronym with Dogecoin, further boosted investor interest. Despite reaching a three-year high of $0.47, the price has since stabilized around $0.37, maintaining a significant increase over the month. Dogecoin's enduring appeal is attributed to its active community, mainstream endorsements, and the playful nature of its origin, ensuring its continued relevance in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Why Lightchain AI Is Capturing Dogecoin Investors’ Attention Lightchain AI brings together the power of blockchain and artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems and open up exciting opportunities for decentralized technology. While Dogecoin thrives on its passionate community, Lightchain AI is all about practical use cases and long-term growth.

39184243,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/trump-likes-crypto-just-as-long-as-its-for-grifting,1737307392,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/6/39184243.jpeg,Trump Likes Crypto: Just As Long As It's For Grifting,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/trump-likes-crypto-just-as-long-as-its-for-grifting,"When the $TRUMP meme coin dropped Friday evening, no one was surprised. Or at least, they shouldn’t have been. He has a knack for jumping headfirst into endeavors he thinks he can make money on, in self-promoting fashion, that often end in disaster. Some of these ventures include Trump Airlines, Trump Vodka, Trump Steaks, Trump University, Trump Magazine, Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino, Trump Mortgage, Trump: The Game. Crypto is the next game in town he’s decided to throw his hat into. I’ve already written articles and talked at various lengths about Trump leaning into the crypto space to earn votes in this past election that in many ways was quite successful. At Bitcoin Nashville this past summer, in an effort to garner support for his presidential candidacy, Trump said some notable things including that America will become “t he crypto capital of the planet and bitcoin superpower of the world,” that he would fire Gary Gensler, and that he wants all remaining bitcoin to be made in America (concerning from a decentralized point of view, and highly implausible in reality). He also famously said that he would commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht on Day one, which if he does I will be the first to give credit where credit is due. (For more on this I recommend watching the recent Reason documentary on why Ross should be freed). Crypto is Donald Trump’s next frontier and combines several things he absolutely loves when it comes to business deals - Quick easy money, self-promotion, America first messaging, and little bureaucratic friction standing in his way. So, what is $TRUMP coin? It’s built on the Solana blockchain with a total supply of 1 billion tokens. Initially, 200 million tokens are available for circulation, while the remaining 800 million are held by CIC Digital, a Trump Organization affiliate, subject to a three-year lock-up period (which means the Trump family holds 80% of supply…). Following its launch, the $TRUMP coin's market cap surged, reaching approximately $6 billion. The coin's price peaked at $33.7. The $TRUMP coin was marketed as a means for supporters to express their alignment with Trump's ideals, rather than as an investment opportunity, which is hogwash for the pump and dump self-enrichment scheme that he is in my opinion immoral and unethical for creating, and investors (oops, guess we should say “fans”) are stupid for taking part in. With inauguration on Monday, we’re entering uncharted territory where it’s likely Trump will issue Executive Orders relating to bitcoin and crypto, and now emboldened by the presidency, lack of legal worries, and supporters that I truly believe would be fine with whatever he does. As he famously quoted, ""I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters, OK?” Some of these actions could be positive for the Bitcoin industry and advocates in the United States. But many of his actions could also equally benefit the broader crypto space that is rife with pump-and-dump scam coins and useless get rich quick schemes for wealthy insiders and people who have lobbied him throughout this last cycle. The pump and dump crypto landscape, his goofy coins and NFT’s, make sense to Trump. In fact, I’m betting he truly believes this is crypto’s purpose, while knowing little about Bitcoin. Trump has repeatedly said he has “ fun with crypto ” and ended his keynote address at the Bitcoin Conference this past summer by saying “have a good time with your bitcoin and your crypto and everything else that you're playing with.” Trump’s experience in and views of crypto and bitcoin are around fun and making easy money. But with Bitcoin, many of us in the space are fighting for much more, which includes Bitcoin’s many use-cases as censorship resistance digital currency, digital gold, a medium of exchange to use in self-custody and via privacy preserving tools, a powerful tool for human rights, and much more. This isn’t a gamble for us…it’s the future of money that challenges the dollar and central bank rule. If Trump really began to grasp this, based on his track record and previous statements on Bitcoin, he’d be quite against this use of Bitcoin. Or perhaps he knows what Bitcoin is at some level, and would rather promote the “fun” meme coins, and maybe Bitcoin as digital gold, but nothing more. He did after all say in 2021 , quite clearly, ""Bitcoin, it just seems like a scam. I don't like it because it's another currency competing against the dollar."" He added that he wanted the dollar to be ""the currency of the world.” (For more on this concept I’d highly recommend following Mark Goodwin and his work on the bitcoin dollar.) Trump wants you to keep playing with crypto, funneling money to his organizations, but it’s unlikely he’d be a fan of anyone using bitcoin as a competitor to the dollar, circumventing traditional finance or using privacy tools (particularly if you are an adversary or from what he deems a left/woke cause, which perhaps one day he’d classify our nonprofit The Progressive Bitcoiner as). I’ll keep promoting Bitcoin as resistance money, and hope you’ll join me, rather than endlessly gambling on crypto “and everything else you’re playing with.” This is a guest post by Trey Walsh.

In the last 24 hours, the token has dropped by 9.18% to trade at $0.00002095. The current SHIB token supply stands at 589.5T, mostly held in centralized exchanges and within DeFi staking protocols. Shiba Inu’s market cap dropped by 7.35% on the last day, settling at $12.67B. However, its trading volume has grown by almost 11% in the last 24 hours to $964.26M, according to CoinMarketCap . The SHIB community has been burning its tokens to reduce circulation and increase prices. In the past week, the community burned around 66.15 million SHIB tokens, yet the efforts are not positively influencing the market, as SHIB prices are still dropping. Shiba Inu trades below important resistance levels Due to volatility, the token is experiencing a steep decline in returns, as there are no new inflows and speculative interest. The SHIB market is unwilling to support recovery, as seen by its failure in its attempt to break above $0.000022. Due to its over-reliance on hype and speculative trading, Shiba Inu’s ecosystem is currently struggling to remain relevant in a competitive market. SHIB’s daily performance is discouraging; the meme coin trades below its critical resistance levels. Currently, its price fluctuations are at lows with less significance. The digital asset lacks momentum, indicating that the coin might maintain bearish or neutral sentiments on RSI . The trend has reduced investor interest, lowering its activities. TRUMP meme coin surpasses PEPE and SHIB TRUMP, a newly launched meme coin formed by President-elect Donald Trump, has reached a new milestone just over a day after launch. The trending crypto has flipped Pepe (PEPE) and SHIB to become the second-largest meme tokens in terms of market cap. With a current market cap of around $13.3 billion, TRUMP only trails Dogecoin (DOGE), the popular meme coin and a favorite of Elon Musk, co-leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) under the incoming Trump administration. According to the latest data, Dogecoin’s market value is around $57.1 billion. The general meme coin market was in sharp decline, with most tokens posting double-digit losses and wiping out their recent gains. Still, Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), a meme coin that trades exclusively on the Solana blockchain, continues to grow and maintain its gains at press time.

Table of Contents Ripple’s momentum plateaus after 7 day surge Remittix levels up the global payments game Tailored solutions for business operations Focusing on privacy and accessibility Presale momentum: $3.5 million raised and counting As we enter what may be a breakthrough year in the cryptocurrency market, investors in established tokens such as Ripple (XRP) are looking to maximize their returns. One emerging project gaining traction is Remittix (RTX) , a next-generation PayFi platform aiming to tackle inefficiencies in the $190 trillion cross-border payments industry. With its presale gathering momentum, Remittix is poised to shake up the financial landscape in 2025. So, what makes this project so compelling, and why are Ripple investors paying close attention? You might also like: Cryptos for 2025: Cardano, Solana, XRP, Dogecoin and Remittix Ripple’s momentum plateaus after 7 day surge Ripple ’s momentum seems to have plateaued after 7 days of strong growth. In total over the last week, Ripple posted a formidable 39.67% gain, landing at $3.27. Its $13.23 billion 24-hour trading volume suggests that many Ripple holders are now selling off as they anticipate a dip. Ripple’s market cap now sits at a mighty $188.37 billion though it’s unclear whether Ripple will now face a corrective action or stabilize at this level. Remittix levels up the global payments game Remittix is quietly transforming global financial transactions by removing the longstanding inefficiencies that have slowed people down while costing them a fortune. Its advanced PayFi solution enables users to exchange over 40 cryptocurrencies for fiat currencies while transferring funds to bank accounts anywhere across the globe. Unlike other expensive systems with hidden fees and charges, Remittix charges a flat rate so that recipients receive exactly what was sent. Its 24-hour transaction times are a key draw among traders, businesses, and individuals looking for fast and reliable cross-border payment solutions. Tailored solutions for business operations Businesses also stand to benefit from Remittix’s Pay API, which simplifies cryptocurrency payment acceptance and fiat settlement. Supporting over 30 fiat currencies and 50 cryptocurrency pairs, the platform offers unmatched flexibility. This is especially valuable for freelancers, online merchants and global service providers, who can now take the hassle out of managing digital assets, benefitting from simplified payment processes and lower costs. Focusing on privacy and accessibility Remittix prioritizes user privacy by processing payments as standard bank transfers, leaving no indication that funds originated from cryptocurrency. This approach safeguards user anonymity while alleviating concerns about the stigma often associated with blockchain-based transactions. Operating 24/7, Remittix removes barriers posed by traditional banking hours and geographical restrictions, making it a practical solution for users in underbanked regions. This ensures broader access to global financial systems and promotes financial inclusion. Presale momentum: $3.5 million raised and counting Remittix is on fire, having just soared past $3.5 million raised in its presale, as momentum continues to build. At the ecosystem’s center sits the native RTX token, which serves important functions but also acts as a means of investment in Remittix. The token is currently on offer to early project adopters for an alluring price of $0.0217, with analysts projecting an 800% price increase during the presale phase alone. As Remittix carves out a juicy share in the prosperous cross-border payments market, it is well on its way to disrupting the PayFi space in the coming months.

Recently, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Nova Labs, the creator of the open-source Helium Network. The lawsuit alleged the company sold unregistered products and misled investors about its technology. This comes just days before Gensler steps down on January 20. The case highlights his tough stance on crypto and questions the SEC’s future direction. Gensler’s Final Stand: Nova Labs in the Crosshairs The SEC’s case against Nova Labs focuses on two core allegations: selling unregistered securities and deceptive marketing practices. The Helium Network, known for its decentralized wireless infrastructure, incentivizes users with its native crypto asset, HNT. The SEC said Nova Labs’ “Hotspots” and “Discovery Mapping” program are unregistered investments. G However, it does not stop there. Nova Labs was accused of misleading investors by claiming that big companies like Lime, Nestlé, and Salesforce used Helium’s network. The SEC says these false claims made the network seem more legitimate. This tricked investors into buying products and tokens connected to the network. Ripple’s Ripple Effect: A Lingering Battle The SEC’s actions against Nova Labs are similar to its high-profile lawsuit against Ripple Labs. In July 2023, a court decided that XRP, Ripple’s token, was not a security in programmatic sales. This was seen as a partial win for the crypto industry. However, the SEC had filed an appeal , showing it was not ready to give up the case. The Nova Labs case stands out as Gensler gets ready to leave the office. It shows the tense relationship between the SEC and the crypto world during his time. This case highlights the ongoing battles over crypto rules. With new leadership coming, many speculate that the SEC may ease its approach to crypto enforcement. A recent report suggests it might pause cases without fraud claims and focus on securities law violations. This shift could change crypto regulation. Crypto’s 2024 Losses: A Year in Review The SEC’s strict actions come as the crypto industry struggles with hacks and fraud in 2024. Blockchain security firm Immunefi reported the industry suffered $1.49 billion in losses, down 17% from $1.8 billion in 2023. Notably, 98.1% of the losses stemmed from 192 hacking incidents, with fraud accounting for the remaining 1.9%, amounting to $28 million. CeFi platforms were hit hardest, with thefts rising 77.5% to $726 million. High-profile breaches included a $305 million breach at DMM Bitcoin and a $235 million hack on WazirX’s wallet. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) remained a prime target, making up 51.4% of the total, while CeFi accounted for 48.6%. Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain were the most attacked blockchain, with Ethereum causing 44% of all blockchain losses.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana and Shiba Inu fall short as Rollblock’s GambleFi model gains traction, with $1.75M wagered and massive growth. Table of Contents Network concerns overshadow Solana’s performance Shiba Inu’s ecosystem struggles to meet its ambitious goals Rollblock surpasses Solana and Shiba Inu with unique utility and community-driven features With high expectations set for the crypto market in 2025, Solana and Shiba Inu fall short in 2025 predictions compared to Rollblock’s ambitious growth targets. Solana’s speed and scalability and Shiba Inu’s growing ecosystem have kept them in the spotlight, but neither project matches Rollblock’ s innovation in merging gaming and decentralized finance. Rollblock’s GambleFi model has already achieved impressive results, with $1.75M wagered in December and a 600% increase in deposits and signups. At $0.046 during its presale, Rollblock provides a rare opportunity for investors to capitalize on its 2025 growth. Network concerns overshadow Solana’s performance It became known that Solana was able to process upwards of 65,000 transactions per second, becoming one of the fastest blockchains. Further, since the fees were so low, averaging about $0.00025 for the transaction fee, Solana became one of the most-used blockchains for developers looking to build applications about DeFi, gaming, and NFTs. There currently lie over 400 projects on Solana’s blockchain, with a market capitalization of $113.5 billion strong in the hearts of both developers and users. Despite its strong technical capabilities, Solana has faced several network outages and criticism about network reliability. There is much potential in the Solana ecosystem. Still, Solana’s limitation makes it difficult for them to outcompete Rollblock in crypto expectations — especially in terms of rewarding and unique solutions with consistency.

Although the SHIB team has made significant strides, such as the decentralized exchange ShibaSwap and the layer-2 scaling solution Shibarium, there still seems to be a huge gap in innovation in its ecosystem. Both these projects will contribute to increasing SHIB’s utility and attracting long-term investors. By market capitalization, Shiba Inu ranks in the top echelons of the leading cryptocurrencies, with its value exceeding $13 billion. However, SHIB’s vast token supply continues to hinder significant price appreciation. Despite efforts to burn tokens and expand its ecosystem, SHIB remains heavily dependent on speculative trading rather than delivering consistent value to its holders. Compared to Rollblock, Shiba Inu’s ecosystem lacks the direct financial incentives that Rollblock surpasses crypto expectations, such as revenue sharing and provably fair gaming systems. Rollblock surpasses Solana and Shiba Inu with unique utility and community-driven features While Solana and Shiba Inu fall short in 2025 predictions, Rollblock (RBLK) has emerged as a transformative player in the crypto space. It offers more than just promises of scalability or ecosystem growth. Its focus on direct user engagement, transparent operations, and dynamic rewards systems sets it apart, capturing attention from both retail and institutional investors. One of Rollblock’s most powerful points is the P2E program, which financially incentivizes gamers to engage with the platform in tokenized cashback form. Unlike Solana or Shiba Inu, Rollblock ensures that the users who are active within its ecosystem get rewarded for their gameplay. This dual role as a gaming platform and an income generator creates a tangible link between entertainment and financial benefits, further driving adoption. Another unique offering is its reward-sharing program. RBLK is one of the few tokens that shares profits from casino operations with token holders. To make this work, they take a fraction of the Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) and use 60% to buy RBLK tokens off the market for burning, so the token’s values are significantly increased due to scarcity. The rest is shared as rewards to all token holders. So, token holders can gain from their tokens increasing in value and by getting rewards. Rollblock’s platform is also designed for community-driven initiatives, empowering users to maximize their betting strategies. One can even follow and copy the bets of the best sports bettors on the platform, making the whole experience collaborative and educative. This goes well with Rollblock’s attitude toward an interactive and user-centric ecosystem that leads to loyalty and eventual growth. Given that its presale is only $0.046, Rollblock is an investment opportunity found nowhere else in a project aimed at disrupting the world of decentralized gaming and finance. Interested investors wouldnt want to miss the chance to be part of a platform that will take down its competitors in 2025.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst James Seyffart reports that a “flurry” of companies are filing for crypto ETFs, including Tidal Financial Group, ProShares, Coinshares and VanEck. Seyffart notes that Tidal is filing for its Oasis Capital Digital Asset Debt Strategy ETF (DADS), which plans to invest in the debt securities of crypto ecosystems. He also reports that ProShares has filed for a Solana ( SOL ) Futures ETF and several XRP -related ETFs while CoinShares has filed to launch the CoinShares Digital Assets ETF, which will be based on its CoinShares-Compass Crypto Market Index. Seyffart goes on to say that ETF provider VanEck has applied to launch its “Onchain Economy ETF,” which will not invest in digital assets themselves but instead will focus on digital asset instruments, such as futures contracts and digital transformation companies. According to previous reports, Gensler is stepping down from his position on January 20th before President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated for his second term. Under the helm of Gensler, the SEC filed numerous high-profile lawsuits against prominent crypto firms such as Coinbase, Kraken and Ripple Labs and didn’t approve the launch of the Bitcoin ( BTC )-based ETFs until compelled to do so by a court.

Notably, there is growing anticipation surrounding the potential executive order on digital assets that Donald Trump may issue once he assumes office—an action that could influence market movements. Trump’s pro-cryptocurrency stance and the controversial launch of the Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin will likely drive more capital into various assets, sustaining the bullish momentum. In this environment, several cryptocurrencies have the potential to attract increased buying pressure and possibly reach new market cap milestones. To this end, Finbold has identified two digital assets that could claim the $50 billion market cap spot in the first quarter of 2025. Cardano (ADA) Cardano ( ADA ) ranks among the standout performers of the recent market bull cycle, having broken out of a prolonged consolidation phase below the $1 mark. If the market sustains its current momentum, ADA, facing additional network-specific catalysts, will likely claim the $50 billion market cap milestone. It’s key to note that Cardano has a long history of continuous network development aimed at making the network more appealing to users as it competes with established entities such as Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ). As things stand, Cardano is progressing toward key targets as it seeks to become a fully decentralized governance platform. Notably, the network reached a critical milestone with the Plomin hard fork, as Input Output Global (IOG) approved its activation on the main network, confirming that all governance conditions set by the Interim Constitution were met. We’re happy to share that Input | Output has today voted “Yes” on the Plomin Hard Fork governance action. After a close review of network readiness by subject matter experts, all conditions in the Interim Constitution for a Hard Fork gov action have been met. See the text of… pic.twitter.com/a8gsUO2qtE — Input Output (@InputOutputHK) January 17, 2025 Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has also outlined three key goals for 2025: bringing Bitcoin ( BTC ) DeFi to Cardano, scaling with innovations like Leios, and driving interoperability through integrations with Chainlink and stablecoins. These initiatives aim to position Cardano as a central player in the crypto space. If successful, they could boost ADA adoption and demand. ADA is currently trading at $1.07 with a market cap of $37.59 billion. Therefore, the cryptocurrency needs to grow its market cap by approximately 33% to reach the $50 billion milestone, which would value the asset at almost $1.50. ADA YTD price chart. Source: Finbold Indeed, technical indicators support further upside for ADA. Prominent cryptocurrency trading expert Ali Martinez recently suggested that ADA could target $6 next. ADA price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts In a post on X on January 18, Martinez noted that after a 43% correction, ADA might be setting up for its next major rally, echoing its February 2021 performance when a 44% drop preceded a significant surge. He predicted the next leg up could arrive within weeks, potentially pushing ADA toward the $6 mark . Tron (TRX) Tron ( TRX ) could also be lining up for further upside momentum, potentially elevating the token’s market cap to $50 billion. TRX was trading at $0.24 at press time with a market capitalization of $20.77 billion. To reach $50 billion, TRX would need a 140% growth in its market cap, placing the token’s price at about $0.58. Regarding key possible price growth drivers, the Tron team is already anticipating positive outcomes from the upcoming administration. Through its non-profit “Digital Sovereignty Alliance” (DSA), Tron is sponsoring the Crypto Ball event celebrating Trump’s inauguration and will send a delegation to the ceremony on January 20. Tron founder Justin Sun has previously expressed optimism about the pro-crypto policies expected under President Trump, highlighting their potential to accelerate blockchain growth. At the same time, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto project linked to President-elect Trump, is reportedly planning to acquire TRX tokens for its treasury. While details on the purchase remain undisclosed, the move could strengthen WLFI’s ties to Tron, where founder Sun serves as an advisor and key investor. Meanwhile, Tron is positioning itself as a reliable player in the mainstream financial system after the blockchain achieved the largest drop in illicit crypto activity, which fell by 24% to $45 billion. These aspects are anchoring TRX for possible increased capital inflow. TRX YTD price chart. Source: Finbold While both ADA and TRX have the potential to reach the $50 billion market cap milestone in early 2025, their success heavily depends on the overall market momentum. Attaining these targets is not guaranteed; however, these milestones appear increasingly likely given the current bullish sentiment and ongoing developments in their ecosystems.

This is considered a step toward making Bitcoin an essential strategic asset in the country’s financial future. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot ETFs See $1.86 Billion Inflows, Extend 3-Week Positive Streak Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, has been very open about the need for stricter rules on cryptocurrencies. He has stressed that Bitcoin could be very important to the digital economy. Strategic Asset For A Competitive Edge Armstrong believes that Bitcoin can put the United States at an edge in the global stage. He suggests clear regulation, innovation fostering, and making Bitcoin a part of the national reserve. 🇺🇸 COINBASE ENDORSES US STRATEGIC #BITCOIN RESERVE 🤯 “Armstrong Had Private Meetings With Trump“ pic.twitter.com/FREoWwXzpl — Vivek⚡️ (@Vivek4real_) January 17, 2025 This, he believes, will not only boost the economy but also ensure that America remains ahead of the rest in the digital financial revolution. His statements clearly outline a long-term vision in which cryptocurrencies would be integrated into mainstream financial strategies. A Presidential Push For Crypto? Timing coincides with swelling speculation that the Donald Trump administration might make cryptocurrencies a priority area of adoption. Trump has already expressed a lot of interest in blockchain technology and, thus far, a national Bitcoin reserve falls well within the broader economic agendas he has envisioned. Support coming from such an influential administration would certainly provide enough impetus. Benefits Beyond Investment Advocates argue that such a reserve would stabilize the national economy by providing an alternative to traditional assets during global financial turbulence. Moreover, this could demonstrate commitment by the United States in being the leader in the crypto space. Coinbase’s endorsement indicates that major players in the industry see this as a viable and forward-thinking solution.

The US may be able to draw in more entrepreneurs and institutional investors if the crypto market is less unpredictable. These rules would guarantee that the reserve functions openly and in accordance with national interests. The concept of a Bitcoin reserve sparks intense discussion about cryptocurrencies’ role in the global economy.

Saylor reshared a screenshot of a website that tracks his company’s Bitcoin purchases, which usually ends up being posted the next day by his company announcing that it has purchased Bitcoin. Saylor, in his post with the note “tomorrow everything will be different”, also referred to the inauguration ceremony of Donald Trump, the first US President to support cryptocurrencies. Thanks to the active activities of the cryptocurrency lobby, it is thought that one of Trump’s first steps will be to ease the pressure on cryptocurrencies in the country and perhaps even introduce a Bitcoin strategic reserve.

Trump the Solana King (TRUMPKIN), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPKIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump the Solana King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Solana King could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Solana King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Solana King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Solana King by entering its contract address – 6oubDpkm3XF2x3r5vPZAhw2TABZgNrjmgwEqxUxLAYa – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPKIN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SOL|SHIB|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-19 18:08:00

DTX Exchange sparks buzz as the next big crypto, reminiscent of Dogecoin’s 300x surge and life-changing returns in 2021. Table of Contents DTX Exchange could become the next Dogecoin to deliver 300x gains Dogecoin historic price: A blueprint for success Final verdict The crypto world has its fair share of excitement, and everyone continues to play the game to win big. Remember the Dogecoin (DOGE) run of 2021? It started as a joke to many investors. But within months, many bold backers smiled their way to the bank with an incredible 300x surge. In fact, a $350 bet back then could have ballooned into over $100,000. This incredible feat has everyone wondering if such a price surge can strike twice. Well, it seems it can, thanks to DTX Exchange, an altcoin that’s got analysts and speculators buzzing with excitement. You might also like: Bridging TradFi and DeFi: DTX Exchange positions itself as the next big thing DTX Exchange could become the next Dogecoin to deliver 300x gains Dogecoin’s impressive rise was one that was unexpected in the crypto world. Social media hype, Elon Musk’s constant tweets, and a meme-powered community pushed DOGE from fractions of a cent to a jaw-dropping $0.74. And the best part about this surge was based on its hype rather than utility. It’s no wonder DTX Exchange is creating such a stir. It packs serious utility and unique features. Currently priced at just $0.14, DTX offers an opportunity for investors seeking DOGE-like gains this year. So far, it’s already climbed 600% in its ongoing presale, and with its solid foundation to back it up, more gains are expected. So, what makes DTX Exchange a potential game-changer? This viral altcoin is flipping the script and is gaining momentum. It’s not here for humor but to transform how we trade. As a hybrid platform, users can trade all kinds of cryptos, stocks, forex, and even tokenized ETFs. As such, DTX would become a one-stop trading hub that bridges traditional finance with the dazzling world of blockchain.

Thus, users can keep their various portfolios safe and completely control them. Interestingly, DTX has been certified by SolidProof and is now listed on CoinMarketCap. Over 300,000 users are already onboard, reaping perks like profit-sharing, discounted trading fees, and governance rights. With a launch price of $0.20, the window for early adoption is wide open. Market analysts point to similarities between Dogecoin’s historical chart patterns and DTX’s current trajectory. So, throwing $350 at DTX now could have your investment skyrocket to $100,000. While it might seem improbable, DOGE’s meteoric rise has laid the foundation for such gains. If history repeats itself, we could have another epic rally that could turn modest investments into life-changing fortunes. Dogecoin historic price: A blueprint for success Despite its lackluster utility, Dogecoin delivered top gains thanks to its community-driven hype, which sparked conversations. As it trades at $0.34, investors now realize that for the Dogecoin price to return to its highest price, it needs more utility and institutional backing. That’s why DTX Exchange offers the complete package for DOGE whales to leverage and enjoy nostalgic gains. It’s no surprise that analysts are predicting a 100x growth by 2025, which might just be the start. Final verdict The crypto universe rewards bold moves and early bets. With DTX Exchange , the stars are aligning for a new success story. It offers game-changing utility, is backed by a community, and has the momentum to deliver jaw-dropping returns. DTX is calling. The stage is set, the hype is real, and the opportunity might be too good to pass on. Someone could grab $350 and toss it into the DTX presale.

These changes mean that transactions conducted through custodial accounts on platforms like Coinbase and Gemini will now be subject to third-party reporting for the first time. New IRS Rules According to a CNN report , the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has specified that brokers, which include custodial trading platforms, certain wallet providers, digital asset kiosks, and some payment processors, must report these transactions. The information will be captured on a new form, the 1099-DA, which will detail all purchases and sales of digital assets. This form will be sent to both the taxpayer and the IRS by early 2026. Taxpayers will be required to include this information in their 2025 tax returns. Failure to do so could result in discrepancies, as the IRS will already have this data on file. Cost basis reporting, which refers to the original purchase price of a digital asset, will not be required from brokers until the 2026 tax year. Jessalyn Dean, vice president of tax information at Ledgible, explained that this delay may affect taxpayers’ ability to calculate taxable gains accurately. It is important to note that the cost basis is crucial for determining the gains or losses from asset sales. For those engaging in decentralized platform transactions, the timeline is different. Peer-to-peer transactions on platforms like Uniswap and Sushiswap will not be subject to third-party reporting until 2027. These platforms will report only the gross proceeds of transactions, as they do not have access to the original purchase price necessary to calculate the cost basis. Meanwhile, investors in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will also be affected by reporting requirements this year. ETF providers will issue forms such as the 1099-B or 1099-DA, which will include not only the proceeds from sales but also any taxable events that occur within the fund. Dean even advised Bitcoin ETF investors to seek guidance from tax advisers, as taxable gains or losses can arise from the fund’s internal management activities, even if the underlying assets are held long-term. IRS Relief Notice The latest development comes less than a month after the IRS introduced automatic relief for centralized finance users facing new crypto tax regulations in 2025, requiring no immediate action. This relief addresses complications from Section 6045 custodial broker rules, which required CeFi brokers to report transactions using specific accounting methods. Defaulting to FIFO could increase tax liabilities, but taxpayers can bypass this by using their own records or crypto tax software. Starting in 2026, users must select an accounting method with their brokers to avoid default FIFO treatment.

Crypto enthusiasts are largely sold on Trump’s image as the industry’s messiah, bolstered by his self-styled role as a champion of pro-crypto policies. But are these hopes grounded in reality, or is the market caught up in make-believe? During his rousing speech in Nashville last July, Trump made bold promises to transform the U.S. into the crypto capital of the world. To support this vision, he affirmed his intent to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) .

Now, as initial signs of rising inflation spark fears of an economic crisis, Trump is expected to issue several crypto-related executive orders upon his return to the White House. The incoming administration has already announced plans to loosen regulations, establish a Crypto Presidential Advisory Council—reportedly including around 20 CEOs and founders with strong ties to Trump—to give the industry a voice in government, revoke restrictive policies like SAB 121 , and position the U.S. as the global center of Bitcoin mining. Crypto cronies Trump appointed venture capitalist and podcast host David Sacks as the country’s first artificial intelligence and crypto czar. As part of the weekend inauguration celebration, Sacks hosted a crypto ball at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 17. The event was co-hosted by BTC Inc., Stand With Crypto, Exodus, Anchorage Digital, and Kraken. Sponsors included MicroStrategy, MetaMask, Coinbase, Solana, Galaxy Digital, Kraken, and others. https://twitter.com/beniaminmincu/status/1880264141501280509 According to the New York Post, the president-elect is reportedly considering an ‘America-first’ crypto reserve strategy that would include Bitcoin as well as U.S.-founded digital assets like XRP and Solana. Whether Trump’s own meme coin ( TRUMP ), now with a market cap of about $13 billion, would be included in that reserve. The Solana-based meme coin is currently $21, according to data from CoinGecko. The coin debuted with 200 million tokens in circulation out of a total supply of 1 billion, with the remaining supply set to be gradually released over the next three years. It reached a high of $73.43 and currently hovers at around $66 at the time of writing. Source: CoinGecko Based on data from analytics company Arkham, the U.S. government currently holds nearly $20 billion worth of Bitcoin, seized in various law enforcement actions. This portfolio includes 198,109 BTC, valued at approximately $20.63 billion, along with other digital assets such as 54,753 ETH ($189.03 million), 122.13 million USDT ($122.13 million), and 750.722 WBTC ($77.77 million). The government’s current holdings also feature Binance Coin ( BNB ), Aave ( AAVE ), USD Coin ( USDC ), and others. U.S. Government’s Crypto Portfolio. Source: Arkham Analyzing the potential impact of these developments on the cryptocurrency market, it’s reasonable to expect the market to continue to grow. The creation of a crypto reserve signals strong governmental support for Bitcoin as a store of value and a strategic asset. Similar to previous institutional adoption events, such a move could increase Bitcoin demand, and reduce market supply. As a result, it might start a global domino effect, with more governments adopting similar strategies and sending demand up. Speaking of exact price targets, Bitcoin’s price could experience a rally similar to previous institutional adoption events, with the potential to reach $120,000–$150,000 within six to 12 months, depending on market sentiment and macroeconomic factors. Prioritizing U.S.-founded assets like XRP and Solana could enhance the adoption of these crypto projects on a global scale. XRP and Solana could rally by 30–50% in the short term, depending on the specifics of the strategy. Regarding the decision to launch the TRUMP meme coin just days before the inauguration, it appears to be a strategic move aimed at reinforcing Trump’s pro-crypto stance and arousing a sense of excitement among his supporters. An overlooked consequence might be the government stepping into areas traditionally outside its purview. Although framed as deregulation, top-down crypto policies are inherently regulated, which contrasts with the crypto community’s core values of decentralization. Also, if deregulation is indeed the goal, how will consumer protections be ensured? Striking this balance is a Herculean task . From my experience leading Outset PR, I’ve seen firsthand how even well-intentioned policies can create friction between innovation and oversight. Moreover, political promises often stall or face roadblocks before becoming a reality. If these initiatives are not executed efficiently, the market’s response may be lukewarm. Closing Thoughts Crypto market enthusiasts have reason to be excited—the proposed policies could significantly boost adoption and valuation. Crypto’s biggest stumbling block has long been the government, but if alignment between policymakers and the industry can be achieved, the potential for growth is very promising. However, as is always the case in the crypto market, execution and external factors will ultimately determine the scale and sustainability of this growth.

This platform aims to elevate Toncoin ($TON), already the fastest-growing blockchain in the DeFi space, by establishing a fully-fledged DeFi hub. Elluminex plans to transform the DeFi landscape of TON, leveraging the massive 1 billion user base from Telegram's integration with Toncoin. Industry insiders speculate that ELX might soon become the next breakout star, with $TON possibly climbing to $7.5. Toncoin (TON) Still In Its Early Stages Right now, the TON blockchain is among the fastest-expanding networks within the DeFi market, significantly boosted by its link to Telegram. This growth has been particularly noticeable following the introduction of Telegram mini apps like DOGs, Hamster Kombat, and Catizen in August and September. Despite its rapid advancement, TON remains in its nascent phase in the DeFi sphere. This stage offers an open field for new players like Elluminex to enter and dominate with minimal competition. Currently, Toncoin serves as the native crypto of this ecosystem, ranking within the top 15 cryptocurrencies.

At present, the altcoin's weekly trading range is between $5.53 and $6.92, as per CoinMarketCap . Initially, in September, it was consolidating around $5 before beginning an upward trend in November. AlparslanAntpgl predicted that Toncoin's price might rally to $7.5 soon. The analyst pointed out a robust demand zone around $6.6-$6.7, which could provide support. Another analyst, known as the Moon Show, noted that the token has formed an asymmetrical triangle, forecasting a future price increase to $7.55.

Donald Trump the Bull (DONBULL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONBULL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Trump the Bull can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Trump the Bull could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Trump the Bull launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Trump the Bull on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Donald Trump the Bull by entering its contract address – AmgaL1uuQ97qJoXfUUxdHipLJmVd3toChivEBiSFn7MW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONBULL.

This surprising move by Trump sparked a wave of trading, with investors eager to capitalize on the excitement surrounding Trump’s latest venture. As a result, Solana’s native token, SOL, reached new highs, and many other Solana-based large-cap tokens also saw big gains. TRUMP Token Sparks a New Dawn for Solana The introduction of Trump’s new memecoin brought a surge of demand for Solana’s blockchain, instantly boosting both sentiment and the value of SOL tokens. The price of SOL hit over $275 , and trading volumes surged from $3 billion to more than $26 billion in just one day. This surge represents a 46% weekly gain, a huge rebound for Solana, which had fallen to lows of $9 in December 2022. The decision to use Solana as the network for TRUMP played a key role in driving up the demand for SOL. Investors quickly took notice, pushing the token’s value higher and helping to revive the blockchain’s overall market sentiment. TRUMP Token Saw Impressive Surge TRUMP’s meteoric rise quickly caught attention. The token’s price surged from a few cents to $14 in just six hours. This sparked rumors across the industry, with many wondering if the token was truly linked to Trump or if it was a scam. The uncertainty only fueled the excitement, leading more people to invest. By Sunday, TRUMP had climbed to over $44, making it one of the top three memecoins by market value, The token trails behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). It even overtook Pepecoin (PEPE) in the rankings, attracting attention from major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. Who’s Behind the TRUMP Token? The TRUMP token was not launched by the incoming president alone. It was created by a team that included key figures from the Solana ecosystem, such as Jupiter and Meteora. Their involvement helped ensure that the token was launched successfully on Solana’s blockchain, adding legitimacy to the project. The digital asset launch was managed by CIC Digital LLC, which is affiliated to the Trump Organization, and Fight Fight Fight LLC. Together, they hold 80% of the TRUMP tokens, with a lock-up period of over three years. While it is unclear how much Trump will earn from this venture, it is evident that the partnership has given Solana a big boost. Trump’s memecoin has had more impact than just boosting prices. The rapid rise in SOL trading volumes and the strong start of the TRUMP token show that the Solana ecosystem is more alive than ever. This new initiative has brought fresh interest to the blockchain.

They have sold their Solana holdings and moved 65% of their investments into XYZVerse. This unexpected shift has caught the attention of many. What could XYZVerse offer to prompt such a move? The crypto world watches closely for what unfolds next. XYZ: The Next Meme Coin Champion Ready to Dominate 2025 The game is on, and XYZ is here to generate record profits with unstoppable momentum! This sensational all-sports meme token is poised to become the next big thing in 2025, capturing the attention of both crypto enthusiasts and sports fans worldwide. As it charges ahead, XYZ is set to deliver jaw-dropping gains, leaving the likes of BOME and WIF far behind. With eyes on a staggering 7,400% growth, XYZ is ready to claim the meme coin crown in the 2025 crypto bull marathon! Rule the game, cash in as the bets roll in XYZ is the star player in XYZVerse – an award-winning meme coin project that blends the sports thrill and meme culture.

With millions of sport bettors getting ready to jump in the action, opportunities for early investors in XYZ are really huge! XYZ is currently undervalued, and with major listings on the way, presale participants stand to secure life-changing gains. >>>Be Part of the 2025 Breakout Story—XYZ Is Waiting for You! Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Meme Token with Big Ambitions Shiba Inu, or SHIB, began as a playful nod to Dogecoin but has quickly made a name for itself. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous Ryoshi, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain, joining one of the largest crypto ecosystems. From an initial supply of one quadrillion tokens, half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. His donation to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and the “burning” of 40% of SHIB’s supply boosted the token’s global profile. What sets SHIB apart is its Ethereum integration, allowing for more than meme status. The creation of ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, shows SHIB’s move towards real utility. Plans for an NFT platform and a DAO-based governance system point to a roadmap for growth. In today’s market, where utility and community matter, SHIB’s place in Ethereum’s ecosystem could make it appealing to those interested in emerging crypto projects. Compared to other memecoins, SHIB’s technological goals and active development might give it an edge in the evolving crypto space. Solana’s SOL: A Fast Lane for Decentralized Applications Solana is a blockchain platform designed for speed and scalability. It offers a solid foundation for decentralized applications, known as dapps. Competing with platforms like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana aims to provide faster transactions and flexible development options across multiple programming languages. At the heart of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana’s native cryptocurrency. SOL facilitates transactions, powers custom programs, and rewards those who support the network. Solana’s technology has the potential to handle high volumes of activity without relying on sharding or second-layer solutions. This makes it appealing to developers and investors seeking a high-capacity network. In the current market, where speed and scalability are crucial, SOL stands out. Its ability to host products and services with high activity may give it an edge over other coins. As the crypto market evolves, Solana’s focus on scalability could position it well amid growing demand for efficient blockchain solutions. Conclusion SHIB and SOL are strong, but investing in XYZVerse signals belief in $XYZ’s potential as a sports memecoin blending meme culture and sports, targeting 20,000% growth and community-driven success.

Aave: Decentralized lending and borrowing on Ethereum Aave is a cryptocurrency in the DeFi space that offers decentralized lending on the Ethereum blockchain. It lets users lend, borrow, and earn interest on crypto assets without banks or intermediaries. Aave uses smart contracts to manage assets securely through code. It supports lending and borrowing of 17 cryptocurrencies. When you borrow, you receive aTokens that represent your loan and earn interest. Aave also offers flash loans, which are instant and need no collateral but must be repaid within the same blockchain block. The AAVE token is key to the system. It provides benefits like fee reductions and voting rights on protocol changes. It can also be used as collateral with added perks. The platform’s Safety Module allows staking to reduce risks, enhancing AAVE’s value with its limited supply and deflationary measures. Kaspa: A new cryptocurrency with faster transactions and secure technology Kaspa is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that uses the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains, Kaspa lets blocks created at the same time exist together and orders them in consensus. This approach allows for very high block rates — currently, 1 block per second, aiming for 10 per second, and dreaming of 100 per second. Transactions are confirmed quickly, mainly affected by internet speed. Kaspa includes features like Reachability to explore the network’s structure, data pruning to save space, and support for future upgrades. Its design could make building faster and more scalable solutions easier. Exploring JasmyCoin: A fusion of IoT and blockchain technology JasmyCoin (JASMY) is a cryptocurrency developed by Japan-based Jasmy Corporation, an Internet of Things (IoT) provider. The platform combines IoT and blockchain technology to give users full control over their personal data. By connecting service providers and data users, Jasmy enables secure data exchange between IoT devices like computers, cars, and phones. The project aims to create an environment where data is securely protected and owned by individuals. Jasmy uses edge computing and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to decentralize data storage. In this space, information can become personal assets. Service providers can promote their services using data owned by users, fostering a democratized data model. Ondo Finance bridges traditional finance with blockchain technology Ondo Finance connects traditional finance with blockchain. It turns stable, income-generating real-world assets into tokens on the blockchain. This makes high-quality financial products more accessible to many people. Ondo has two main parts: an asset management team that creates tokenized financial products, and a technology team that builds decentralized finance protocols. They work with trusted partners like BlackRock and use Coinbase for secure asset custody. Ondo focuses on transparency and follows legal rules. One of their products, USDY, is backed by US Treasuries and bank deposits. This gives non-US investors a stablecoin that offers yield. Ondo’s approach could change how people access financial products. Conclusion While AAVE, KAS, JASMY, and ONDO show less immediate potential, the spotlight is on CYBRO. This advanced DeFi platform offers investors exceptional opportunities to boost their earnings. By leveraging AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain, CYBRO provides lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. The platform ensures a superior user experience with seamless deposits and withdrawals. Emphasizing transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO stands out as a promising project.

However, so close to his inauguration, industry leads are expressing their worries over the risks involved with his return, citing that his administration’s policy changes may affect the US economy. Some markets already see their stocks plummeting, evoking more uncertainty about their future. Industry leads are concerned over Trump’s planned tariffs and immigration policies The Russell 2000 index soared by almost 6% the day after Trump’s win and continued to rise for more than two weeks before giving back much of that gain after Nov. 25. Bank stocks experienced the same rise-and-fall frenzy. For starters, the KBW Bank Index jumped by nearly 14% from Nov. 5 to Nov. 25; however, its price rally quickly faltered. Similarly, the S&P 500 Energy Index rose by 6.5% from Election Day through Nov. 22, but it dwindled by over 3.2%. Most of these markets began slumping after concerns of oversupply, tariffs, and economic growth started rising. Trump’s proposed tariffs are still the biggest fear for multiple industry leads. Some have even predicted that his tariff plans could contribute to long, unpredictable wars even worse than those experienced during his first presidency. Trump’s vision for new immigration policies is also scaring some investors. Some believe his action could impact the country’s economy and aggravate geopolitical tensions. Donald Trump has already started to take shots at state allies like Canada, Mexico, and Europe, increasing investors’ concerns. Citigroup’s chief US economist, Andrew Hollenhorst, even remarked: Forecast is the polite way to say guess, but we have to make assumptions about these policies because they will affect the economic outlook. Andrew Hollenhorst The crypto community is heavily anticipating Trump to deliver on his promises The crypto community waits for Trump to help institute pro-crypto policies once he takes office. During his campaign, he painted himself as the crypto president and even proposed the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve, which worked well to pull pro-crypto supporters. According to sources, Donald Trump plans to issue a flurry of executive orders favoring the crypto industry, making investors optimistic about the industry’s future. Bitcoin reached record prices after Trump’s win, gaining over 50% in just a few weeks. Now, Bitcoin is trading at $104,956 , a price rally partially contributed by the new token the president-elect launched. However, crypto analysts and investors are bracing themselves for further volatility in the markets.

Key takeaways AAVE is up 11% in the last 24 hours. The coin is trading well above support at $305. A breakout above $361 could take the coin to $391. Aave (AAVE) price analysis for January 19 shows an uptrend. AAVE is currently up by 11% in the past 24 hours and 17% over the last 7 days. Indicators point to bullish momentum, signalling a possible breakout above psychological resistance levels. Aave 1-day price chart: AAVE breaks to the upside; resistance awaits at $361 The AAVE/USDT daily price chart shows that the coin is experiencing an uptrend after breaking out of a rangebound price movement ($272-$305). AAVE’s support is present at $305.61, and the coin is trading significantly above this level, sitting at $345.74 – an indication of a bull market. Resistance awaits the coin at $361.43, a level it last surpassed in December 2024. A break above the resistance level could push AAVE towards $391.05. AAVE If the bears recapture the market, AAVE could reverse to $305 or even lower if selling pressure intensifies. The MACD confirms the current momentum as a slight bullish crossover, which can be seen on the chart. Similarly, the Chaikin Money Flow indicator shows that demand slightly outweighs the selling pressure. Aave 4-hour price chart: AAVE is approaching an oversold region The 4-hour indicator also corroborates the price movement observed in the longer timeframe. AAVE is trading above the upper Bollinger Band, indicating an ongoing bull market. The RSI is currently above 64, which means that AAVE is approaching an oversold region, and selloffs could be in the offing. Aave 4-hour price chart Sustained buyer interest could mean even higher prices, but a bearish turnaround could result in a price decline towards $320 or even lower at $299. Aave technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 308.72 BUY SMA 5 $ 308.08 BUY SMA 10 $ 308.91 BUY SMA 21 $ 320.11 BUY SMA 50 $ 308.67 BUY SMA 100 $ 235.49 BUY SMA 200 $ 177.23 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 290.11 BUY EMA 5 $ 292.15 BUY EMA 10 $ 301.56 BUY EMA 21 $ 311.14 BUY EMA 50 $ 291.91 BUY EMA 100 $ 249.34 BUY EMA 200 $ 200.06 BUY What to expect from AAVE price analysis? AAVE’s price analysis shows a growing uptrend, with the coin looking to retest resistance at $361. A sustained cash inflow could ensure that AAVE scales this resistance level. However, since the $361 price mark is psychological resistance for the coin, it could face corrections, as traders could take profit at that level. Hence, a clear breakout above $361 could set the tone for a move towards higher highs. With the coin approaching an oversold region, traders might want to watch out for a potential price reversal. Is AAVE a good investment? Aave provides the essential infrastructure for lending and borrowing within DeFi, expanding beyond traditional applications into gaming, NFTs, and dApps.

As is known, the new President of the United States, Donald Trump, launched his own memecoin and this altcoin took the market by storm. TRUMP, which is the 16th largest cryptocurrency in the world at the time of writing, is accused of diluting the market by other altcoin owners. However, cryptocurrency analyst il Capo released a statement on the subject. The analyst, who reported that many people complained about the issue, said that he thinks differently. According to the analyst, such big moves bring fresh money and interest to the market, and this cash usually flows into other ecosystems and trends in the cryptocurrency market. il Capo claimed that the recent Trump incident could trigger a solid altcoin season.

The rapid ascent fueled speculation about whether Dogecoin (DOGE), the reigning meme coin, could be next on TRUMP ’s target list. Notably, in just 36 hours after its launch, the token’s market capitalization surged to an astounding $15 billion, catapulting it to the 14th spot in global crypto rankings on Sunday. At its peak, TRUMP’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) exceeded $70 billion, momentarily surpassing DOGE and established giants like USDC and BNB, making it the sixth-largest FDV in the crypto market. However, this explosive rally was short-lived, as TRUMP slipped back to the 18th position following mass profit-taking, trailing just behind SHIB, which reclaimed 17th place at press time. That said, the SHIB community did not take TRUMP’s brief dominance lightly. Earlier on Sunday, Shytoshi Kusama, the lead developer of Shiba Inu, acknowledged the milestone, calling it a “temporary achievement” in a comment responding to a community member’s screenshot showing TRUMP’s rise over SHIB. “Wow, indeed. Congrats to the President of the United States for this temporary achievement.” he tweeted. Earlier on Saturday, Kusama had tweeted, “We bow to no meme,” in response to a viral meme depicting various memecoins bowing to TRUMP. LUCIE, the Shiba Inu ecosystem’s lead marketer, also weighed in, tweeting , “No, I don’t buy any Trump coin. I’m down bad, just like the rest of the SHIB Army, holding the same coins. But I believe things will go well for crypto. Some will run first, some later—what’s important is not giving up.” That said, with TRUMP briefly solidifying its position as the second-largest meme coin, the crypto community is buzzing with speculation about whether it can dethrone Dogecoin. Analysts at CoinGecko estimated that TRUMP would need to hit $300 per token to surpass DOGE’s current market cap of $58 billion. Remarkably, with TRUMP achieving an impressive market cap and FDV, some observers believe such a milestone may not be far-fetched. “There’s a decent argument for $TRUMP to go absolutely ballistic to $100B circulating market cap/$500M FDV and flip DOGE. Trump’s brand is far more attractive than a random dog coin.” Tweeted Mechanism Capital co-founder Andrew Kang. Popular crypto analyst Dr. Profit echoed this sentiment, comparing TRUMP’s trajectory to DOGE’s meteoric rise in 2021. “ If $TRUMP follows the same path, its price could hit between $350 and $500 in the coming months,” he predicted. As TRUMP continues its climb, outperforming prominent tokens like PEPE, UNI, and TON, it appears poised to keep drawing liquidity from across the market. However, whether TRUMP can surpass DOGE remains uncertain. TRUMP was trading at $67.66 at press time, reflecting an impressive 100% surge over the past 24 hours. In contrast, DOGE was priced at $0.39, experiencing a 3.50% decline during the same period.",Cryptocurrency|News|Doge|Dogecoin|Donald Trump|SHIB|SHIBA INU|trump,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-19 19:30:42

Despite the scare, SOL has proven its resilience, surging over 62% since Monday in a rally that has captivated investors. The price action reflects Solana’s strength as it continues to outperform, with bullish momentum showing no signs of slowing down. Related Reading: Raydium Breaks Key Level Showing Relative Strength – New Highs Next? Top analyst Jelle provided key insights into Solana’s current market dynamics, highlighting the psychological impact of the recent sweep. According to Jelle, the sharp dip instilled fear among traders, much like the pattern observed in last month’s volatile candle. However, the technical outlook remains firmly bullish, with Jelle reiterating that Solana’s target remains highly optimistic. This price action has solidified Solana’s position as one of the most exciting assets in the crypto market. With its ability to recover quickly from sharp corrections and continue pushing higher, investors are increasingly confident in its long-term potential. As Solana trades at new highs, market participants are closely monitoring its next moves, eager to see whether the asset can sustain its momentum and reach even loftier price targets in the days ahead. Solana Prepares For A Massive Rally Solana is entering what many analysts believe will be a transformative bullish phase, with the potential to deliver massive gains for investors. As the central hub for some of the hottest meme coins, including the explosive TRUMP meme coin, Solana is rapidly positioning itself as a giant market leader in the cryptocurrency space. Its robust ecosystem, fast transaction speeds, and low costs have made it the go-to platform for innovative projects, cementing its reputation as a powerhouse in the industry. Jelle recently shared a compelling technical analysis on X, shedding light on Solana’s current price dynamics. Jelle noted the recent sharp price dip, calling it a “scary sweep” designed to instill fear among traders. Comparing it to the pattern seen in the last monthly candle, he confidently stated, “They ain’t fooling me,” reaffirming his bullish outlook. According to Jelle, Solana’s momentum is building toward a price target of $600, a level that would solidify its dominance and mark a monumental achievement. The coming week will be pivotal for Solana’s trajectory, coinciding with President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. With expectations of a pro-crypto administration, market sentiment around Solana and the broader crypto market is overwhelmingly positive.

As Solana continues to attract attention as the backbone for thriving meme coin projects and innovative decentralized applications, its role as a market leader becomes more evident. If SOL maintains its bullish momentum, the combination of strong fundamentals, technical support, and a favorable macroeconomic environment could propel it to unprecedented highs, fulfilling the expectations of analysts and investors alike. Price Action: SOL Enters Uncharted Territory Solana is currently trading at $274, just shy of its newly set all-time high (ATH) of $275. The price action remains extremely bullish, with strong momentum suggesting further upside as SOL enters price discovery. This phase, where the asset explores uncharted territory with no historical resistance, often leads to accelerated gains as demand grows and market participants chase the trend. Bulls are firmly in control of the market, driving Solana’s impressive rally. The key level to watch now is $255, which has become a critical support zone. Holding this level would reinforce bullish sentiment and provide a solid foundation for the next leg up. Analysts agree that if bulls maintain support at $255, the rally will likely continue, with the potential to set even higher ATHs in the near future. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reclaims Crucial Liquidity Level – No Resistance Left Below ATH With Solana’s fundamentals and technical outlook aligning, the market sentiment is overwhelmingly optimistic.

A successful hold could pave the way for even more significant gains in the coming days and weeks.

These price points highlight the huge returns early investors gained from participating in their ICOs. Ethereum's journey from a $0.311 ICO price represents a staggering 1,043,833% return, while TON's growth established it as a top 20 cryptocurrency. Now, a new presale token, Remittix, priced at $0.0217, rises as a potential successor to these crypto giants. Ethereum (ETH): The Smart Contract Pioneer The Ethereum price journey from $0.311 to over $3,000+ represents a massive 1,043,833% return for early investors. Recent market data shows whales accumulating over 330,000 ETH worth more than $1 billion in just one week. According to analyst Ali Martinez , the Ethereum price displays consolidation patterns suggesting a potential surge to $7,000. While Ethereum dominates smart contracts, its high gas fees and scalability issues create opportunities for new platforms offering enhanced payment solutions like the presale token, Remittix. TON: Telegram's Blockchain Vision The Toncoin price reached new heights in 2024, but recent revelations of 91% token concentration in select wallets triggered a Toncoin price drop from $5.20 to $4.80. Despite this volatility, TON's integration with Telegram and its scalable architecture demonstrates the value of user focused blockchain solutions. Yet, TON's focus on messaging infrastructure leaves room for specialized payment platforms. Remittix fills this gap by enabling seamless crypto-to-fiat transfers across global banking networks. Remittix: The Presale Token Transforming The DeFi Space Positioned as a force in the DeFi sector, Remittix combines the speed and efficiency of blockchain with the accessibility of traditional payment systems. Its unique PayFi model enables users to convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies for seamless transfers to any global bank account.

For crypto holders, businesses and freelancers, Remittix offers a flexible, transparent and privacy focused solution that outshines traditional competitors. The Remittix presale is a standout opportunity in the crypto space. With its presale token price now at $0.0217, the project aims to raise $36 million through its 750 million RTX tokens. Notably, the liquidity pool and team tokens will be locked for three years, ensuring long term stability. A full smart contract audit has already been completed, with zero issues found, reflecting the project's commitment to safety and transparency. Once launched on top centralized exchanges and Uniswap, $RTX will fully transition governance to the community, empowering token holders to steer its future. Beyond its presale token, Remittix is carving a niche as a critical player in the $183 trillion global banking industry by addressing inefficiencies in cross border payments.

These figures underscore the significant profits early investors made by joining their ICOs. Ethereum's rise from an initial price of $0.311 translates to an astonishing 1,043,833% return, while TON's ascent has secured its place among the top 20 cryptocurrencies. Now, a fresh presale token, Remittix, with a price of $0.0217, emerges as a potential successor to these crypto powerhouses. Ethereum (ETH): The Smart Contract Trailblazer Ethereum's price evolution from $0.311 to over $3,000+ marks a remarkable 1,043,833% gain for its early backers. Recent data indicates that whales have acquired more than 330,000 ETH, valued at over $1 billion, within a week. Analyst Ali Martinez notes that Ethereum's price is showing consolidation signs, possibly leading to a climb to $7,000. While Ethereum remains a leader in smart contracts, its high gas fees and scaling challenges open the door for new platforms with better payment solutions like the presale token, Remittix. TON: Blockchain Aspirations from Telegram Toncoin reached impressive heights in 2024, though recent news of 91% token concentration in a few wallets led to a price dip from $5.20 to $4.80. Despite this fluctuation, TON's integration with Telegram and its scalable design highlight the importance of user-centric blockchain solutions. However, TON's focus on messaging leaves a gap for dedicated payment platforms. Remittix steps in to bridge this gap by facilitating easy crypto-to-fiat transactions across international banking systems. Remittix: A Game Changer in the DeFi World Emerging as a key player in DeFi, Remittix marries the speed and efficacy of blockchain with the reach of traditional payment networks. Its innovative PayFi model allows users to convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat for seamless transfers to any bank worldwide. The straightforward four-step process—from entering recipient details to finalizing the transfer—ensures user-friendliness while avoiding hidden costs and steep exchange rates. Catering to crypto users, businesses, and freelancers, Remittix provides a flexible, transparent, and privacy-focused alternative to conventional methods. The Remittix presale presents a unique opportunity in the crypto world. With a current presale token price of $0.0217, the project targets raising $36 million through its 750 million RTX tokens. Importantly, liquidity pool and team tokens will be secured for three years, ensuring long-term stability. A comprehensive smart contract audit has been conducted with no issues, demonstrating the project's dedication to security and openness. Once listed on major centralized exchanges and Uniswap, $RTX will transition governance to the community, giving token holders the power to shape its future. Beyond its presale token, Remittix is establishing itself as a pivotal entity in the $183 trillion global banking industry by tackling inefficiencies in cross-border transactions. While Ethereum and Toncoin have excelled with smart contracts and scalable frameworks, Remittix distinguishes itself with a focus on practical application. By enabling freelancers to receive crypto payments via its Remittix Pay API and supporting businesses with customizable merchant accounts, the project promotes financial inclusion and operational ease. Seize the Opportunity The figures speak volumes. Early buyers of Ethereum saw their $0.311 investment soar to $3,296, while the TON price grew from its initial value to $5.32.

The price has been largely sideways since re-testing major support at $0.80 last month, despite impressive surges from other cryptocurrencies like SOL and BTC. Despite this quiet phase in price movement, significant activity is unfolding behind the scenes, potentially signaling a major surge ahead. On-chain data from crypto analytics platform CoinGlass reveals that Cardano’s open futures interest has surged to an all-time high of $1.42 billion across exchanges. Open interest is often seen as a bullish sign, with the high levels suggesting confidence in the asset’s future potential. Furthermore, Cardano’s Total Value Locked (TVL) in ADA has resumed its surge despite a slight recoiling after reaching a new all-time high of $701 million earlier this month. Beyond the on-chain data, Cardano’s fundamentals continue to strengthen, adding to the optimism around ADA’s price. Notably, the network is gearing up for its highly anticipated Plomin Hard Fork, set to occur between January 14 and January 29, 2025. This upgrade will mark a pivotal shift to decentralized governance under CIP-1694. On Saturday, both stake pool operators and the Intersect Constitutional Committee gave their approval for the hard fork, marking a significant milestone for Cardano. Looking ahead, Cardano’s 2025 roadmap looks promising. In a Saturday tweet , founder Charles Hoskinson outlined his strategic focus for the year. Key priorities include bringing Bitcoin DeFi to Cardano, targeting a market four times larger than Ethereum and Solana combined, advancing scalability with Leios, and expanding the ecosystem through more partnerships. Hoskinson also stressed the importance of stablecoins in growing Cardano’s financial ecosystem. Cardano’s growing momentum has also caught the eye of larger institutional players. Cardano’s recent addition to the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) further validates its long-term potential. Additionally, continued accumulation by whales has raised expectations that a spot Bitcoin ETF approval under the Trump administration could push ADA’s price even higher. Meanwhile, analysts have also expressed optimism on ADA’s future, with veteran analyst Peter Brandt stating on Jan. 16 , “Cardano $ADA has bottomed for a grand bull market ,” suggesting the recent retest of $0.80 support could be the catalyst for a major rally. Other analysts, such as Ali Martinez, have pointed to a potential surge in ADA’s price based on historical data. “After a 44% correction, ADA began its second leg up during the week of February 1, 2021. Now, ADA has already undergone a 43% correction, suggesting the next leg up could be just two to three weeks away. $6 next,” tweeted Martinez. Analyst “World of Chart” also predicted a bullish breakout of a pennant pattern, with a target of $2 in the near future. At press time, ADA was trading at $1.09, reflecting a 1.62% surge in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|TRADING|FORKS|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-19 19:35:59

Unlike traditional staking services, Rocket Pool allows users to pool their Ethereum (ETH) to run validator nodes on the Ethereum network. Thus, participants can participate in the staking process without requiring the full 32 ETH to run a validator node. Furthermore, Rocket Pool introduces the concept of “rETH” tokens, issued to users who stake ETH in the Rocket Pool network. These rETH tokens represent users’ stake in the pool and can be traded or transferred independently of the underlying ETH, providing liquidity and flexibility to participants. Overall, Rocket Pool aims to democratize Ethereum staking and contribute to the decentralization of the Ethereum network by providing a secure, efficient, and accessible platform for staking participation. As DeFi continues to gain traction, Rocket Pool stands out as a pioneering project at the forefront of innovation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Also, Nova Labs finds itself in the SEC’s crosshairs. Trump meme coin sets new records Official Trump ( TRUMP ), Donald Trump’s official Solana-based meme coin, surged in value from Saturday to Sunday, reaching a peak of $73.43 before settling at $60. Stephen Findeisen, also known as Coffeezilla on YouTube, called the coin’s debut “a historic grift .” The launch comes as Trump prepares to establish cryptocurrency as a national policy priority through an executive order once he’s inaugurated on Monday, Jan. 20. Solana’s record-breaking performance The blockchain hosting the Trump meme coin experienced its own success, with Solana ( SOL ) reaching an all-time high near $293. SOL showed DEX protocols handled $19.47 billion in volume, up from $19.37 billion the previous day. The previous daily record was $7.5 billion in November last year. The coin is $271.40 at the time of writing, with a 24-hour trading volume of $29 billion. This represents a 7.21% price increase in the last 24 hours and a 44% price increase in the past seven days. SEC vs. Nova Labs The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Helium creator Nova Labs with unregistered securities offerings and fraud, alleging the company sold investment contracts through Hotspots and a Discovery Mapping Program, promising returns from building a wireless network.

The resurgence in whale numbers and macro factors sparked bullish interest amid rising projections. Altcoins surged alongside Bitcoin (BTC), leading to a slight drop in the latter’s market dominance. XRP, Solana, Cardano Record Massive Gains XRP and other altcoins pulled sharp inflows, igniting bullish projections to possible all-time highs. Digital assets have picked up billions following the last dip, taking the total market cap above $3.7 trillion, while its trading volume spiked over 20% in the last seven days. Solana (SOL) tops the charts among gainers with 50.5% weekly flows. Today, traders pushed it 15% higher, slightly above the $290 mark. Solana also recorded growth in its institutional numbers as investors look toward spot ETF approvals. With rising demand, several bulls tip the asset above the $300 mark. XRP has dominated altcoin charts this year after reclaiming its spot as the third-largest crypto by market cap. The asset trades at $3.19, up 26% last week, attracting billions to its market cap. Daily volumes fluctuate around $12 billion, spurring investors to project a higher price in the altcoin season . After tapping $3 for the first time in six years, bulls have set a massive $400- 450 range due to several factors. Firstly investors’ appetite for spot XRP ETFs is climbing through the roof after the success notched by Bitcoin products. This gateway can pull another string of institutional demand to the asset. Furthermore, Donald Trump’s second term resonates with market participants after promises concerning the industry. Favorable crypto rules are expected to boost confidence, attracting growth to the US market. Cardano’s Roadmap Inspires Upswing Cardano (ADA) rose in line with other crypto assets in the same time frame. ADA price is up 8% and trades at $1.09, with bulls pushing for a higher figure, citing network developments. Notably, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson revealed three themes for the network in 2025. “ Now that we have governance moving along really well, this year I’m going to focus deeply on three big themes for Cardano: 1) Bitcoin DeFi on Cardano (Market is 4 times the size of Ethereum and Solana combined) 2) 24/7 work on scalability, including Leios 3) Making Cardano a peninsula, not an island.

Politico reports that Ripple, Coinbase, Kraken, Robinhood and Circle shelled out at least $10 million for Trump’s inauguration and related events. Blockchain payments firm Ripple, which faced enforcement action from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the sale of the XRP tokens, made the biggest donation among crypto firms. A Ripple spokesperson says the San Francisco-based firm doled out $5 million in digital tokens to Trump’s inaugural fund. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty also plan to attend the inauguration on Monday, January 20th. Meanwhile, retail trading giant Robinhood, which supports cryptocurrencies in its platform, donated $2 million. US-based crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken along with USDC stablecoin issuer Circle contributed $1 million each. Says Coinbase vice president for US policy Kara Calvert, “I think it’s important to ensure that [the] industry… can engage with this administration and engage in a meaningful way during the transition period.

Notably, the meme token, launched by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday, has captured the cryptocurrency world’s attention, surging by an astounding 223% within 24 hours of its debut. At press time, the token was trading at $64.6 after climbing to the 14th spot among the largest cryptocurrencies, surpassing prominent tokens like SHIB and TON. The TRUMP token launched with an initial supply of 200 million coins, while the total emission is capped at 1 billion. According to the project’s roadmap, tokens will be unlocked incrementally over three years. Notably, 800 million tokens (80% of the total tokens) are reserved for creators and CIC Digital, a company tied to Trump’s NFT ventures, raising concerns about centralization. That said, the launch of TRUMP has not only energized its ecosystem but also fueled remarkable growth for Solana (SOL), the blockchain hosting the token. At press time on Sunday, Solana was trading at an all-time high (ATH) of $285.76, reflecting a 19% surge in the past 24 hours, buoyed by a surge in network activity and trading volumes. On-chain data from analytics platform DefiLlama revealed that Solana’s decentralized exchanges (DEXs) experienced a staggering $21 billion in daily trading volume for two consecutive days, solidifying the network’s dominance in the DEX segment with 52% market share. Beyond the hype surrounding TRUMP, Solana’s surge can be attributed to investors rotating funds back into SOL after cashing out of meme coins. On-chain data from Solana Floor shows that the TRUMP team wallet, which deploys liquidity on Meteora’s pools, has been using fees collected to purchase SOL, acquiring over $7 million worth since launch. Lookonchain also rep orted several such instances with one whale who bought 1M TRUMP for 11.5M USDC, selling the meme tokens for 312,571 SOL, netting an unrealized profit of $9.8M. That said, Solana’s seamless handling of a recent surge in transaction volumes has earned widespread praise, highlighting its significant progress since facing network outages in 2023 and early 2024. “ Make no mistake, the Solana of the pre-era (March 2024) could not have handled this launch gracefully. The degree to which Solana knocked it out of the park on a technical level last night is astonishing. So much progress in just 9 months, and we are just getting started.” Max Resnick, lead economist at Solana-focused firm Anza, noted . Arthur Cheong, founder and CEO of Defiance Capital, also lauded Solana’s resilience, saying, “Solana really passed this $TRUMP TGE network resiliency test with an A+ score. The chain would have been unusable a year ago with such levels of traffic and transactions.”",Cryptocurrency|News|Donald Trump|SOL|Solana|trump,EN,0,0,SOL|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-19 19:47:34

Table of Contents IntelMarkets surges 811%, seen as hottest new ICO The Shiba Inu price could skyrocket soon, expert predicts Wizz: The price of Dogecoin may reach a new ATH IntelMarkets vs. Shiba Inu vs. Dogecoin – which crypto coin differentiates from the rest? Two frontrunners in the crypto space garnered much attention: IntelMarkets (INTL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Even though crypto coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) have recently seen some major price surges, these two tokens are set to outpace it in Q1 of 2025. Among them, one may stand out – IntelMarkets. While market analysts like Crypto Crew University and Wizz have made bold price predictions for SHIB and DOGE, this presale star has soared 811%. This project will also tap into the growing AI market, which Statista predicts could be worth $826B by 2030. Therefore, some experts foresee a surge of $1 for INTL in 2025. You might also like: Solana could reach $500 before Christmas: Analyzing BONK and IntelMarkets IntelMarkets surges 811%, seen as hottest new ICO As Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are riding a bullish wave right now, IntelMarkets is making a name for itself. It has already surged 811% while raising over $6M in its ongoing crypto ICO event. This percentage will continue rising since the presale is in phase nine, and more stages are ahead. The community is excited about IntelMarkets’s long-term vision. It aims to combine AI technology and blockchain, launching the first AI-powered smart trading platform. On it, users will get access to self-learning trading robots that improve their performance over time. Additionally, the Intell-Array™ system will bring one holistic signal backed by 100K data points to the trader’s interfaces. This is a big advantage over platforms that provide mixed signals. Those interested in this project are now buying its native token, INTL. One INTL costs just $0.082, which is a 811% rise from its starting price of $0.009. However, this altcoin price will jump to $0.091 after phase ten begins. A Tier-1 CEX listing is projected to bring this value to $0.11. Traders who want to capitalize on this growth and get governance voting rights are now rushing to buy INTL. The Shiba Inu price could skyrocket soon, expert predicts Shiba Inu is one of the meme coin titans rising on the price charts. CoinMarketCap shows that its value has jumped over 5% on the weekly chart. During that time, the price of Shiba Inu fluctuated from $0.000021 to over $0.000022. Market expert Crypto Crew University remains optimistic for Shiba Inu, too. In his X post, he stated that the RSI for this meme coin is climbing past 65 while its SRSI mirrors its last pump. As a Shiba Inu price prediction, he forecasts a surge to $0.78 or even $1 soon. However, the Shiba Inu market cap now sits at $13B, which means it needs a lot of new money for its price to rise. As a result, many investors are putting this meme coin on the back burner for tokens like INTL. Wizz: The price of Dogecoin may reach a new ATH Dogecoin is another meme coin showing some bullish signs. On the one-week chart, the Dogecoin price moved from around $0.30 to nearly $0.40. In other words, over a 15% increase in its value as per CoinMarketCap. The community is also keeping an eye on Dogecoin thanks to bullish statements from analysts like Wizz. For instance, Wizz made an X post saying that this meme coin will soon reach a new ATH. Although this Dogecoin price prediction has turned some heads, many eyes are turning to INTL instead. This is because this meme coin has already soared over 350% on the YTD chart, suggesting its highest upswings have passed. IntelMarkets vs. Shiba Inu vs. Dogecoin – which crypto coin differentiates from the rest? IntelMarkets , Shiba Inu, and Dogecoin could all see big price gains soon. For people looking for the next great opportunity, there is a clear window with INTL. Unlike SHIB and DOGE, meme coins, INTL will have real utility, meaning its adoption could be more significant. Also, its smaller market cap suggests faster price growth with less money needed. Because of this, market analysts think this altcoin could soar to $1 first in 2025.

Memecoin sector performance trends suggest SHIB price could be at risk of further downside. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Market Cap Declines $700m as traders react to Trump Token Launch Shiba Inu (SHIB) faced intense selling pressure on January 19, dropping 5% to $0.000022 as its market cap shed over $700 million. This decline coincided with Donald Trump’s memecoin debut, with the $TRUMP token surging 131% in 24 hours and claiming a $12.5 billion valuation. The sudden interest in Trump-linked tokens has disrupted the memecoin sector, prompting traders to pivot from established assets to trendier entrants. Memecoin Sector Performance | Source: Coingecko According to Coingecko data, memecoin market grew by 1.4% overall, reaching $130 billion in total capitalization, but legacy tokens such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), and SHIB all posted losses. This divergence signals a shift in market dynamics, as investors favor new, narrative-driven tokens. While DOGE fell 0.5% and PEPE dropped 5.8%, the $TRUMP token saw unprecedented transaction volumes, attracting millions of dollars in speculative capital within hours. Trump-linked tokens, including $MAGA and $TRUMP , now dominate market discussions, leading gainers by triple-digit percentages. This shift has introduced volatility across legacy tokens, with SHIB bearing the brunt of the sell-off. Despite broader market growth, the current SHIB price decline reflects waning trader confidence, as funds flow to newer assets promising quicker returns. If this trend persists, legacy memecoins such as SHIB, DOGE and PEPE remain at risk of losing more market share. Shiba Inu price forecast: Bears in Control as $0.000020 Support Wobbles Shiba Inu price forecast chart currently paints a neutral outlook, with bulls struggling to hold the $0.000021 support level after an 11% pullback. As the daily time frame candlestick breaches the midline of the Bollinger Bands (BB) at $0.00002242, this position signals that bears are testing a critical support zone. If this level fails to hold, SHIB risks accelerating losses toward the psychological support at $0.00001800. More so, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 45.52 trends below the neutral 50 mark, signaling weakened bullish momentum. A further decline in RSI could confirm continuation of the bearish trend. However, the narrowing BB bands hint at reduced volatility, suggesting potential stabilization near current levels. Shiba Inu Price Forecast | SHIB For a bullish scenario, a decisive reclaim of the $0.00002242 midline could pivot sentiment, targeting $0.00002470, the upper BB. This move requires increased trading volume and a positive RSI divergence. Until decisive signals emerge, SHIB’s short-term trajectory leans cautiously bearish.

While SHIB’s burn strategy and DOGE’s whale activities stir market excitement, Web3Bay (3BAY) distinguishes itself by providing practical benefits and substantial growth opportunities. Contrasting with SHIB and DOGE, which are primarily propelled by buzz, Web3Bay (3BAY) is laying down the infrastructure for a decentralized commerce network. It offers a 5% rebate for its token holders, decentralized control, and forthcoming plans for an NFT marketplace, positioning itself as a viable answer to worldwide e-commerce hurdles like excessive fees and concerns over data security. As SHIB and DOGE navigate varying market sentiments, Web3Bay’s innovative payment solutions and community-led expansion secure its role as a groundbreaking disruptor. Massive Rush To Web3Bay Presale As It Enters Stage 4 Web3Bay is redefining the e-commerce sphere by establishing a secure, inclusive marketplace enhanced by blockchain. By removing the inefficiencies of conventional platforms, Web3Bay allows direct interactions within its decentralized ecosystem, promoting fairness and ease of access, thus overcoming longstanding barriers in online trade. Web3Bay focuses on cost-effectiveness and efficiency, facilitating minimal transaction fees. Sellers preserve a greater share of their earnings, while buyers benefit from lower expenses. Moreover, the platform employs Layer-2 scaling solutions to ensure rapid, fluid transactions, even at high traffic times, making it a prime choice for both regular consumers and high-volume merchants. At the core of this ecosystem lies the 3BAY token, which offers fee reductions and governance participation to its holders. Currently, during its third presale phase, priced at $0.0045626, the token has amassed over $830,000, indicating robust initial interest. With progressive price increments at each stage, the token is set to debut at $0.1959, suggesting a potential 6,430% ROI for initial backers. As Web3Bay’s footprint widens and its adoption increases, the demand for 3BAY is anticipated to spike. Acquiring tokens now secures a purchase at the lowest rate, far ahead of wider market realization of its significant potential. Shiba Burn Rate Up 2200% Recent metrics reveal a sharp increase in SHIB’s burn rate , which has soared by over 2,200% in just a day. This boost has resulted in over 21 million SHIB tokens being destroyed, reducing their total circulation, which could push the Shiba Inu price upwards. Despite this encouraging trend, Shiba Inu’s Layer 2 solution, Shibarium, has seen its Total Value Locked (TVL) decrease from $6.27 million in December to $3.65 million as of January 16. This drop could sway investor sentiment and potentially affect Shiba Inu’s price briefly. Market watchers suggest that if SHIB can hold above the $0.000019 mark, it might rebound and challenge the $0.00003330 resistance level, about 50% higher than its current valuation. Conversely, a close below $0.000019 could negate this optimistic scenario, potentially leading to further price drops. Dogecoin Price Prediction Dogecoin’s valuation has shown significant movements of late. As of January 17, 2025, DOGE trades around $0.414192, marking a 10.99% rise from its last closing. The intraday peak was also $0.414192, with a low at $0.368838. This uptrend coincides with notable whale transactions; analysts note that major players have scooped up 200 million DOGE in two days, suggesting a robust bullish outlook. Such acquisitions often herald forthcoming price surges, with some experts envisioning a climb towards $3. Yet, the wider crypto market is encountering hurdles. Bitcoin’s value has slipped under $90,000 for the first time in two months, casting a shadow over general market sentiment. Despite these challenges, Dogecoin’s persistent performance hints at possible sustained growth. Concluding Thoughts Shiba Inu’s 2,200% burn rate escalation showcases its deflationary thrust, while Dogecoin gains from substantial whale buying and renewed positive sentiment. Nonetheless, both remain largely speculative without tangible applications. In contrast, Web3Bay combines blockchain innovation with practical retail applications, positioning itself as a key competitor for 2025 and beyond. Web3Bay’s hybrid model, supporting both crypto and traditional currency transactions, provides a practical alternative to standard e-commerce setups. Its impressive presale achievement of $830,000 with 220 million tokens sold, and an introductory price of $0.0045626 shows great potential as the token gears up to launch at $0.1959. Its upcoming NFT marketplace and decentralized governance structure ensure scalability and community involvement, promising enduring relevance.

However, despite a brief recovery that saw the Solana price rise to $206, it has dipped to $201 at press time. While some investors hold on to hope for a rebound, savvy investors are shifting focus to an AI altcoin, RCO Finance (RCOF), priced at $0.07. RCO Finance is poised for massive growth, backed by AI and blockchain technology to redefine DeFi. Analysts predict that the AI altcoin will deliver a staggering 43,209% ROI to outperform the Solana price, making RCO Finance a top pick for investors. Solana Price Volatile Recovery Shows Weakness The Solana price has faced continued volatility today after dipping from a high of $206 to $201.82 at press time. Despite the Solana price recovery above the $200 mark, the token remains under pressure. Analysts have pointed out that liquidations in the broader market have hit an alarming $528 million, while the Solana derivatives market reflects a bearish sentiment as open interest future contracts drip by 6.07%. From the daily charts, the Solana price has struggled to maintain its upward trajectory. Short-term rallies may provide some hope for investors, but the recent bearish crossover between the 20-day and 50-day EMAs shows downward pressure looming for the Solana price. Should Solana fail to hold above $200 and maintain buying pressure, the price could drop to $175. As the crypto market wrestles with uncertainty, investors are shifting focus to other tokens with promising opportunities compared to the Solana price. RCO Finance, an AI altcoin emerges as the top player offering investors high growth potential and utility. RCO Finance: Emerging AI Altcoin Redefining Investment Opportunities As the Solana price battles market volatility, RCO Finance has caught investor attention with its cutting edge AI powered features. The under $1 AI altcoin is in its presale stage with a high growth potential that could deliver 43,209% ROI. At the core of the RCOF AI altcoin’s appeal is its AI-powered Robo-advisor , which first seeks to understand investor financial goals, risk appetite, and market preferences. The tool crafts personalized investment strategies using this information, making the AI altcoin ideal for users of all experience levels. The Robo-advisor is like a personal financial advisor, available 24/7 to trade on your behalf and adjust your investment portfolio when necessary. Again, the Robo-advisor charges lower transaction fees than traditional financial advisors, making professional investment advice available to a broad audience. Again, the Robo-advisor analyses real-time market data to keep you ahead of other investors in the competitive crypto market. With real-time analytics, investors can make data-driven decisions that reduce human error and eliminate emotional bias. Unlike Solana, the RCOF AI altcoin’s unique approach includes access to over 120,000 financial instruments, such as crypto, stocks, bonds, ETFs, and tokenized real-world assets. This diversity is crucial in guaranteeing that investors hedge against market volatility, making the AI altcoin an attractive alternative for investors seeking growth and stability.

Through its cutting-edge applications and sophisticated instruments, RCO Finance is attracting interest for its ability to surpass the year-to-date increases of SHIB and SOL, which have experienced notable growths of 130% and 118%, respectively. From Shiba Inu To Solana: Why Investors Are Turning To RCO Finance RCO Finance aims to transform the investment arena by democratizing access to advanced strategies via its creative application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. This innovative platform streamlines financial management, offering advanced investment tools to all—from experienced traders to interested novices. Although Shiba Inu is mainly recognized as a memecoin with little utility, RCO Finance provides an extensive range of features that aim to enhance users’ investment experiences significantly. Shiba Inu, an Ethereum token born from meme culture, mainly serves as a means of payment within its ecosystem. While Shiba Inu is popular, it lacks substantial competitive advantages and isn’t widely accepted, which restricts its growth potential. In contrast, Solana distinguishes itself with its proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism and fast transaction rates, positioning itself as a favored platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. Introducing RCO Finance—a real revolutionary! This platform distinguishes itself by offering a completely automated, no-code solution that removes the necessity for specialized knowledge or middlemen. The Smart Choice For Investors Looking To Move Beyond Established Cryptos Envision the possibility of utilizing cutting-edge investment tools without the stress associated with conventional financial management. The platform’s AI-driven Robo Advisor personalizes plans suited to your specific financial objectives and risk appetite. The Robo Advisor constantly evaluates large volumes of market data, modifying your investment strategies on the fly. This flexibility enables users to capture market trends and chances that were once exclusive to institutional investors. However, that’s not everything! RCOF token holders receive access to advanced analytical tools that include more than 120,000 assets spanning 12,500 asset classes. This wealth of information enables both new and experienced investors to make well-informed, strategic choices—greatly exceeding what Shiba Inu and Solana presently provide. RCO Finance utilizes advanced machine learning models that gather real-time financial information from reliable sources such as Bloomberg and Reuters. These models produce accurate market predictions, allowing users to foresee changes and implement prompt modifications to their portfolios. By recognizing both immediate opportunities and long-term plans, RCO Finance prepares its users for ongoing success in a constantly changing market. A Once-In-A-Lifetime Opportunity The RCOF token isn’t merely another token; it serves as the essential foundation of the RCO Finance ecosystem. Engaged traders, stakers, and liquidity providers can obtain RCOF tokens by participating in diverse loyalty programs, promoting a lively community of active investors. Currently available at a limited-time presale price of just $0.077 per token, RCOF represents an incredible opportunity for early investors. Projections indicate that RCOF could soar to values between $0.214 and $0.60 within the year, offering potential gains of nearly 500%! This anticipated growth positions RCO Finance as a more stable and practical investment option compared to Shiba Inu and Solana. Conclusion Although Shiba Inu and Solana have their advantages, RCO Finance is positioned to emerge as a powerful player in the market, offering a combination of security and innovation that might transform how people interact with digital assets. As traders shift their attention to RCO Finance, the platform’s distinctive characteristics and emphasis on user empowerment indicate that it might not only surpass Shiba Inu and Solana but also herald a new phase of accessible and advanced investing.

In a recent X post , Hoskinson shared his vision for making Cardano a major player in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and improving the blockchain’s speed and connections with other platforms This upgrade will help the chain handle more transactions and be more efficient and competitive in blockchain. Cardano Aims to Bring Bitcoin’s DeFi to Cardano One of the central themes in Cardano’s future vision is introducing Bitcoin-like decentralized finance (DeFi) to its ecosystem. Now that we have governance moving along really well, this year I’m going to focus deeply on three big themes for Cardano: 1) Bitcoin DeFi on Cardano (Market is 4 times the size of Ethereum and Solana combined) 2) 24/7 work on scalability, including Leios 3) Making Cardano a… — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) January 18, 2025 Cardano wants to improve this process by using its technology to create a secure and decentralized way for users to handle their finances. By doing so, the protocol plans to create a system where people can use financial services without needing a bank or middleman, just like Bitcoin does. Cardano Speed and Integration Push Scalability remains a crucial challenge for many blockchain projects. However, Cardano is also working on improving its blockchain’s speed. The new update, called Ouroboros Leios, will allow the blockchain to handle many more transactions per second. This is important because a faster blockchain can support more users and applications. With Leios, Cardano could compete with other fast blockchains like Solana. This could make it a better option for developers and users looking for speed and efficiency. Hoskinson has said that the blockchain is not an “island” but a “peninsula.” Cardano wants to connect with other blockchain projects and services, not stay separate. Cardano is already planning meetings with Chainlink, which provides vital data for blockchains. Hoskinson has also talked with Ripple Labs about bringing Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoins to Cardano. These connections would help Cardano’s ecosystem grow and become more useful for users and developers. Cardano’s Focus on Community Although the blockchain is growing, Hoskinson clarified that the profits from his company, IOG, will not be used to fund new projects on the platform. He believes that using funds generated by the company would not be the right approach, as it is not “people’s money.” Instead, Cardano focuses on ensuring the platform grows with the support of its community, with developers and users leading the way. Despite these exciting developments, the protocol’s associated token, ADA, has been on a bearish trajectory in the last day. As per market data, the digital token is trading at $1.08, down by nearly 2% in the last 24 hours. However, ADA continues to maintain a position in the CoinMarketCap top 10, thanks to a recent price rally. This shows that investors remain optimistic about Cardano’s long-term potential, even though there may be short-term fluctuations.

While SUI shows promise and SHIB remains bullish, Web3Bay stands out by tackling e-commerce issues through blockchain advancements. Rather than being just a speculative venture, Web3Bay provides a decentralized platform addressing real-world problems like hefty fees and centralized governance. Having raised $830,000 and sold over 215 million tokens at $0.004562625, Web3Bay presents an unmatched ROI potential of 6,430%. This blend of practicality and profitability places Web3Bay at the forefront of blockchain progress. SUI Crypto Attracts Whale Interest Amid Market Positivity Sui (SUI) has caught the attention of major investors, often dubbed ""whales."" Recent reports highlight a surge in large-scale purchases of SUI, implying increased confidence in its potential. This growing interest aligns with broader market patterns, as other cryptocurrencies like Solana and XYZVerse also see increased whale activity. Such trends typically signal bullish phases, suggesting influential investors expect positive outcomes for these assets. As of January 18, 2025, SUI is priced at $4.66, marking a slight dip of 0.05477% from the previous day. The day's high was $4.96, with a low of $4.61. The increasing interest from significant investors in SUI suggests a positive sentiment, potentially hinting at an upward trajectory for the asset. Shiba Inu's Price Rally Amid 883% Outflow Surge: What's Fueling It? Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced an 883% increase in outflows this week, with large-scale transactions jumping from 647 billion SHIB to 1.11 trillion SHIB in a day, as per IntoTheBlock. While this often indicates profit-taking, SHIB's price surged nearly 10% within 24 hours, showing strong demand countering these sell-offs. The SHIB price climbed from $0.000022 to $0.0000246, reflecting the wider crypto market's recovery. Important indicators like trading volume and whale activity have also increased, sustaining this upward trend. SHIB has risen 14% over the week and might continue to climb if it surpasses the 50-day SMA at $0.00002482, aiming for $0.00003 and higher. On the downside, strong support at the 200-day SMA around $0.000019 provides a safety net for the bulls. With the RSI above the midpoint, Shiba Inu maintains a bullish outlook. Web3Bay: Transforming E-Commerce Through Crypto Innovation Web3Bay is revolutionizing e-commerce by merging blockchain technology with practical, user-centric solutions. Traditional platforms often come with high fees and centralized oversight, but Web3Bay offers a decentralized model that prioritizes security, transparency, and cost-efficiency. Its 3BAY token is central to the ecosystem, providing benefits like staking rewards, governance rights, and a 5% discount on marketplace transactions. The ongoing presale has reached its fourth stage, raising over $830,000 and selling more than 215 million tokens at a price of $0.004562625. With each stage, the token price increases by 15%, culminating in a launch price of $0.1959. This structured approach offers early investors a rare chance for a 6,430% return, making Web3Bay one of the most exciting investment opportunities in crypto today. Web3Bay's roadmap is equally impressive. From decentralized governance through a DAO to plans for cross-chain compatibility and NFT integration, the platform is geared for long-term growth. Its scalability is powered by Layer-2 solutions, ensuring fast and seamless transactions even during high demand. Web3Bay isn’t just a marketplace; it’s a glimpse into the future of decentralized, borderless e-commerce. Conclusion While SUI’s whale-driven momentum and Shiba Inu’s enduring appeal capture attention, both rely heavily on market sentiment. Web3Bay, by contrast, combines blockchain innovation with tangible utility, creating a decentralized e-commerce ecosystem that redefines global commerce. From staking rewards to NFT integration and DAO-driven governance, Web3Bay’s roadmap promises scalability and long-term growth. Investors who act now can secure 3BAY tokens at their lowest presale price before the $0.1959 launch. For those seeking a high-growth investment that goes beyond hype, Web3Bay is the ultimate choice to align profitability with purpose. The future of decentralized commerce is here—don’t miss out.

Elon Manipulates Trump (ELTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Manipulates Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Manipulates Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Manipulates Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Manipulates Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Manipulates Trump by entering its contract address – HbYCEX5o56wcb5u6M8T3fkiaeFYgvQtxqBwt9yDoBoAV – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Some coins are lower than $0.25, which creates a chance for these investors to make a fortune by 2025. Among several coins in this category, the top 3 include Rexas Finance (RXS), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Polkadot (DOT). Here’s some insight into why these projects attract attention and how they could boost small investments into profitable ventures. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Community-Driven Gamechanger RXS continues to prove to the crypto community that it offers a novel approach to scaling alongside user-private governance. It also features a powerful technological base. Its unique consensus algorithm attempts to enhance blockchain efficiency. The project's architecture allows the use of various dApps from the finance, gaming, and supply chain industries. Such flexibility increases RXS's marketability and ensures the platform will remain operational. In addition, the same people venturing behind RXS have shown sheer determination in their desire for innovation and transparency. Thanks to active engagement, real uses of the token, and constant newsletters with updates, the community has established a fanbase. The project’s tokenomics structures support short—and long-term holding options, making them less volatile while attracting early adopters. Recently, the team behind RXS polled the community to determine the direction of the presale. The results were clear and convincing: The holders voted to hold an extra round of the presale. Consequently, the team raised their listing price to $0.25, confirming their faith in the project and its indulgence. This movement was the icing on the cake as the team announced the official launch date of June 19th, 2025. With its transparent roadmap and community initiatives ready for massive advancement, early investors who take advantage of this opportunity can gain heavily as the token grows in popularity. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Internet Funny Image That Became A Phenomenon Initially introduced as a joke, Dogecoin has carved a niche and is potentially the most used cryptocurrency. Its lively community and relentless promotion by celebrities like Elon Musk make it even more popular.Even though memes are most people's primary association with DOGE, it’s worth noting that investors are increasingly adopting them for real transactions. DOGE is inexpensive and has low transaction fees, making conducting online tips and micropayments easy. With a price below $0.25, DOGE will benefit even more in the coming years, especially with an evolving ecosystem and greater visibility. Investors are naturally interested in DOGE due to the prominent influencers mentioned and their close ties with the meme-coin. Furthermore, the value of DOGE has a promising opportunity to grow over the next few years since the stakeholders intend to integrate DOGE into more services and platforms. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Coin: Cryptocurrency Disrupting Dogecoin Monopoly Shiba Inu (SHIB) is well-established in the crypto world competition. Initially introduced as a meme token, the coin has gained such popularity that it has evolved into a comprehensive system with several functionalities, including ShibaSwapDAO enterprise, SHIB staking, and metaverse development. Due to its market capitalization, SHIB is one of the most traded cryptocurrency assets. This market position only increases its chances of being adopted widely because of the strong community support. The affordable price of Shiba Inu coins enables users to buy millions without even noticing. With the expansion of Shiba Inu, there is a high opportunity of getting returned profit. The project's success can be attributed to the attentive and persistent team working alongside the actively developed roadmap. The SHIB token’s focus on real-life applications alongside different innovations has helped attract several investors. The growing SHIB ecosystem and community support enable the token to aim for further growth in 2025. Conclusion Most investors find interest in the low-cost coins because they open the door to great returns. A mere $500 investment divided in RXS, DOGE, and DOT has the potential for tremendous returns if these projects achieve their goals in 2025. For instance, if RXS can climb from $0.25 to $5, it would represent a 20x return. If similar results were to happen to DOGE and DOT, then the overall ROI would be transformative. Even though the cryptocurrency market faces challenges with its volatility, RXS, DOGE, and SHIB present interesting opportunities boasting potential greater than $0.25.

Some coins are priced below $0.25, offering investors a chance to potentially amass wealth by 2025. Among these affordable options, the top three are Rexas Finance (RXS), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Polkadot (DOT). Let's delve into why these projects are capturing attention and how they might turn modest investments into lucrative opportunities. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Community-Driven Innovator RXS consistently demonstrates to the crypto community its innovative approach to scalability and user-centric governance, underpinned by a robust technological foundation. Its distinctive consensus algorithm is designed to boost blockchain efficiency. The project's structure supports various dApps spanning finance, gaming, and supply chain sectors, enhancing RXS's appeal and ensuring ongoing functionality. The team behind RXS is known for their dedication to innovation and transparency. Through active engagement, practical applications of the token, and regular updates, they have cultivated a dedicated community. The project's tokenomics cater to both short and long-term holders, making them less volatile and appealing to early investors. Recently, the RXS team conducted a community poll to gauge interest in the presale's direction. The outcome was decisive: holders voted for an additional presale round. As a result, the team raised the listing price to $0.25, demonstrating their confidence in the project's vision. This development marked a significant milestone as the team announced the official launch date of June 19th, 2025. With a clear roadmap and community-focused initiatives poised for significant progress, early investors could reap substantial rewards as the token gains traction. Dogecoin (DOGE): From Meme to Major Cryptocurrency Originally launched as a parody, Dogecoin has evolved into a notable player in the crypto space, potentially being the most widely used cryptocurrency. Its vibrant community and continuous endorsements from figures like Elon Musk have only fueled its popularity. While many associate DOGE with memes, it's increasingly being used for real transactions. DOGE's affordability and minimal transaction costs make it ideal for online tipping and micropayments. With its price below $0.25, DOGE is poised for further growth in the coming years, aided by a dynamic ecosystem and increased visibility. The backing of prominent influencers and the potential integration of DOGE into more platforms and services signal promising growth prospects. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Coin: Challenging Dogecoin's Dominance Shiba Inu (SHIB) has firmly established itself in the competitive crypto market. Although it started as a meme token, it has grown into a comprehensive platform with features like ShibaSwapDAO, SHIB staking, and metaverse development. Its significant market capitalization makes SHIB one of the most traded cryptocurrencies, enhancing its adoption potential due to strong community backing. The low cost of Shiba Inu coins allows users to purchase millions without significant financial impact. As Shiba Inu expands, there is a substantial potential for profitable returns. The project's success is driven by a committed team and a well-developed roadmap. The SHIB token’s real-world applications and various innovations have attracted numerous investors, with the expanding SHIB ecosystem and community support setting the stage for further growth in 2025. Wrapping Up Many investors are drawn to low-cost coins because they offer the possibility of substantial returns. A $500 investment split between RXS, DOGE, and DOT could yield significant returns if these projects meet their 2025 targets. For example, if RXS rises from $0.25 to $5, that would represent a 20-fold increase. If DOGE and DOT achieve similar success, the overall return on investment would be transformative. While the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, RXS, DOGE, and SHIB offer intriguing opportunities with the potential to exceed their current value of $0.25.

On Jan. 18, onchain analytics firm Bubblemaps investigated a crypto wallet that received $1 million just hours before TRUMP’s launch. Blockchain data shows the wallet purchased $5.9 million worth of TRUMP tokens in the first minute of trading, later selling $20 million while retaining $96 million in tokens. These tokens were then transferred to another wallet and distributed across 10 wallets, all now actively selling on Solana decentralized exchanges (DEXs). The trading activity has raised concerns over potential market manipulation as the TRUMP token continues to dominate headlines. Preetam Rao, CEO of Web3 security firm QuillAudits, highlighted issues with TRUMP’s token structure and intentions. “Eighty percent of the supply is locked for CIC Digital, owned by the Donald Trump Revocable Trust. The same entity launched Trump NFT Trading Cards three years ago. The website says it’s ‘not an investment but a show of support,’” Rao explained. He added that the top 10 holders control 89.06% of the supply, with no clarity on the liquidity pool’s burn status. “The token’s launch in an Asian morning time zone suggests it’s more about profit-making,” he noted. Rao speculated, “We see insider trading involved, but if the US government is supporting innovation, maybe it’s a rug pull that also sets a foundation for innovation.” TRUMP Memecoin Gains Mainstream Momentum TRUMP’s popularity surged as major exchanges Coinbase and Binance listed the token. According to CoinGecko, TRUMP trading volumes soared, with Bitget, MEXC, and KuCoin leading the activity. At the time of writing, TRUMP is up 194% in 24 hours, trading at $54.62. Meanwhile, Solana’s ecosystem saw record highs, with Raydium, GMGN, and Moonshot processing millions in fees and transactions, attracting over 200,000 new users onchain.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-19 20:50:00

Many traders have shown renewed interest in Litecoin and VeChain thanks to rumors of regulatory breakthroughs and key partnerships. However, a growing number of experts now suggest that Rollblock may become the ultimate game-changer in this space. Enthusiasts point to Litecoin’s recent rally and VeChain’s broad adoption as strong signs of a thriving market. Still, some analysts argue that Rollblock could eclipse these two projects in 2024. By combining online gaming with fair and transparent rewards, Rollblock offers a thrilling approach that both gamers and investors are talking about. As cryptocurrency investing expands, all eyes are on which of these tokens can truly deliver unstoppable growth. Litecoin rides a 20% wave as ETF hopes grow Litecoin has been around for a while, but it still surprises traders with its strong performance. Last week, LTC jumped by 20%, trading close to $126.06. This rise has made some people think that a U.S.-based exchange-traded fund for Litecoin could get approved soon. Along with that, trading volume shot up by 250%, and big investors (whales) bought large amounts of LTC. Technical analysts also note that LTC is above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which could mean more gains ahead. Some market watchers believe the next resistance levels are at $125 and $135, which could send Litecoin even higher if the bulls maintain momentum. Technical analysts note that LTC remains above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, suggesting room for further gains. Canary Capital’s amended filing with the SEC has fueled speculation that Litecoin will follow Bitcoin and Ethereum in obtaining regulatory support for a spot ETF. LTC’s resilience was recently highlighted by its successful bounce off the $98 support mark, reinforcing bullish sentiment. While some observers expect Litecoin price to stay on a positive track, others hint that the real opportunity may lie in up-and-coming coins with fresh use cases. VeChain takes supply chain management to the next level Across the market, VeChain is drawing attention for its mission to transform supply chain management using blockchain and IoT technology. The VeChain blockchain has attracted major partners like Walmart China and BMW, boosting trust and efficiency for global enterprises. With VET trading at $0.05186 after a 16% weekly rise, interest in this project continues to surge. Many see it as a shining example of how blockchain can tackle real business challenges, from product authentication to data tracking. A standout feature of VeChain is its dual-token setup, where VET stores value and VTHO powers transactions. This design helps keep operating costs stable—an attractive point for corporate partners. Meanwhile, the VeChain blockchain is also making waves in green energy, with Brazilian solar firm SolarWise tapping VET to track power generation. Even though many fans believe VET remains undervalued, talk is growing that Rollblock (RBLK) could deliver faster returns in the near future. Rollblock’s revenue-sharing model sparks investor excitement Rollblock is capturing investor interest by fusing crypto gaming with real financial rewards. Unlike many projects that rely solely on token speculation, Rollblock invites people to benefit from its on-chain casino model. Holders of Rollblock’s native RBLK token can share in a portion of the casino’s weekly revenue, adding a unique hold-and-earn twist. This approach, backed by a token burn mechanism that permanently reduces circulating supply, signals a fierce commitment to value growth. Analysts note that such a structure may give Rollblock an edge over more established tokens, thanks to its potential for both gaming fun and steady gains. Beyond the revenue share, the RBLK tokenomics reveals a balanced plan for long-term success. With 60% allocated to presale and a fixed total supply of one billion, Rollblock aims to protect the value of RBLK while rewarding loyal backers. Experts tracking the online gambling market—worth around $540 billion in 2023—predict that platforms offering transparent and fair services will dominate in the coming years. Rollblock stands ready to lead that pack, showing how a thoughtful ecosystem can satisfy both players seeking a fun experience and investors hunting for sustainable returns. Conclusion All three tokens—Litecoin (LTC), VeChain (VET), and Rollblock (RBLK)—are stirring up excitement with their latest news. Litecoin is riding high on potential ETF approval, while VeChain captures headlines with real-world enterprise solutions. Yet, numerous crypto analysts believe Rollblock could be the real superstar, thanks to its thrilling revenue-sharing model and dedicated approach to fair gaming. If momentum holds, Rollblock may well outshine both Litecoin and VeChain as 2025’s most promising investment. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

Top projects like Avalanche and Polygon have been involved in huge blockchain upgrades in the past few months. With popular adoption, the AVAX and MATIC tokens will soon be hotspots for profits. There’s also a new token making its way into the DeFi sector, even though it offers gambling utility. Rollblock is about to be the face of crypto gambling, and its presale is proof of the potential locked in the project and its tokens. With almost $9 million generated, the RLBK presale is gaining ground fast among crypto users. We have more on the new crypto here. Avalanche crypto blockchain upgrade finally impacting AVAX price? The Avalanche crypto price is trading on 8.8% weekly profits, as the token managed to cancel the worst of its losses from last week. A buying spree at the start of the year urged Avalanche to new heights, and even though trading volume is tanking, the Avalanche crypto price is still trading up. Some traders think the AVAX spike is down to the upcoming US Presidential inauguration. While there’s the sentiment from Donald Trump’s upcoming inauguration, the recent Avalanche 9000 upgrade has played its role in ensuring that AVAX is in constant demand. The new blockchain protocol allows developers to deploy their products on Avalanche on a subscription basis. This eliminates the previous need for a 2000 AVAX down payment, while ensuring that developers have to spend AVAX coins every month to keep their products live. Polygon adds JioCoin to its network Famous Indian telecom operator Reliance Jio, has launched its token, JioCoin, on the Polygon network in a bid to extend Web3 functionalities to its users. Reliance Jio serves over 450 million Indians, and the market potential for Polygon is very extensive. Coupled with the current bullish hype in the crypto-verse, the Polygon price is set for a boom in the short-term. Sentiments are supporting a bullish uptrend, and the JioCoin Wallet use case will contribute to the Polygon price surge. The MATIC token sells for $0.47 on CoinMarketCap, with a 5.17% increase in the past week. The spike might not be as much, but the Polygon price boom is on the way. Get ready for profits with Rollblock! Online casinos have taken gambling to the next level of convenience, as betters don’t even have to queue to place their wagers anymore.

Top altcoins like Aave and trendy DeFi coin Ethena have set their tokens up for bullish returns, but neither is on the same level as the new crypto, Rollblock. It’s a new dawn for crypto DeFi coins, as Rollblock is rolling out a solid gambling protocol to usher online casinos and live sports gambling into the crypto-verse. With features and profit potential like Rollblock’s, the new crypto is offering quite the package. The RLBK presale is on stage 9 already; don’t miss out on the details below. The Aave community incorporates Bitcoin mining for stability The one good thing about DeFi coins is that they never stop developing. The Aave platform just rolled out a plan for a Bitcoin treasury, where its users will be able to mine BTC with less effort. The Aave proposal unlocks a portal of opportunities already, as extra-blockchain mining will see more BTC tokens entering circulation. For Aave, the network intends to secure its stablecoin while offering its users a chance to accumulate BTC tokens too. The AAVE token is trading at $315.6, some 10% over what it exchanged for last week. With a surge like that, Aave investors believe the DeFi coin is off to major gains in 2025. Ethena makes for its old support levels as ENA recovers. Volatility was the major phenomenon in the crypto-verse for December and January, as all tokens shed profits and embarked on token surges. Ethena was among the tokens that got hit severely, but the token has only started recovering. Like some other top altcoins, Ethena’s ENA only just broke out of a parallel chain pattern, a notably bearish indicator, to its old support levels. The first test was at $0.86, and Ethena did well enough, apparently. The Ethena price has dusted off obstacles leading to its $0.97 support now. ENA needs to break the dollar sign and soon, before correction waves have it stuck below the dollar. It’s time for new crypto to take the wheels of DeFi revival. And there’s none better than the Rollblock project. Rollblock, home to crypto gambling The Rollblock (RLBK) project is focused on recreating a fully functional online casino, but this time, on a blockchain. There’s the full package of a standard casino; over 7,000 casino games to go with live sports betting options, ranging from American football to basketball, football, and even MMA. Rollblock also understands the pain points of every gambler, and one is the frustration with deposit and withdrawal methods. The ecosystem on Rollblock is designed to enable fast payout and optimized for several deposit methods, including crypto assets and fiat currencies. The platform also allows for staking, as every investor automatically becomes an owner on Rollblock. Staking your tokens will improve the economic security of the network, and for that, you get a share of the daily revenue. The RBLK protocol ensures that users get a cut from the daily revenue based on how many RLBK tokens they staked. With its staking APY set at 20%, Rollblock will be one of the highest-paying stake platforms in the crypto-verse. You’d need some RBLK for staking or gambling–and we know just where to look. The RLBK presale for 2025 gains Get Rollblock coins now that they only cost about $0.046 each. The presale profits are set at 880% already, and a bullish analysis on Rollblock has set the RLBK tokens on to 100x returns. It’s a call to every crypto user, gambler or not.

Donald Trump’s choice of issuing the memecoin on Solana helped SOL rise more than 23% since its announcement, moving the cryptocurrency’s price to a new all-time high and boosting the dollar value locked on its smart contracts. Data from DeFiLlama shows TVL on Solana is now at $12 billion, a new all-time high. Measured in SOL, the value locked on the network has been steadily growing since the beginning of last year and recently topped 45 million SOL. This level hasn’t been seen since August 2022, ahead of the collapse of FTX, whose co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried was a major Solana proponent. The launch of Donald Trump’s official memecoin, $TRUMP, was co-ordinated by CIC Digital LLC, a Trump-affiliated organization, the BBC reported . Together with Fight Fight Fight LLC, they own 80% of the memecoin’s supply set to be released over the next three years. The memecoin, which has been dominating headlines in the space and is set to be listed on major cryptocurrency exchanges including Binance and Coinbase, is currently the third-largest across all blockchains behind Shiba Inu and Dogecoin in terms of market capitalization. The token was launched by a team including Solana ecosystem protocols Jupiter and Meteora and led to a trading frenzy on the network’s decentralized exchanges, with DeFiLlama showing Raydium surpassed Tether in 24-hour fee generation. Moonshot, the memecoin trading platform featured on the memecoin’s website posted on social media by President-elect Donald Trump, reported a 12-hour trading volume of nearly $400 million after the memecoin launched, adding it onboarded over 200,000 users onto the network in the process. https://x.com/moonshot/status/1880659326395666759 The network choice also helped boost the perceived odds of a spot Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) being launched in the first half of the year. Polymarket traders went from weighing a 43% chance such a product would be launched by July 31, to 61%. The trading frenzy came during the weekend, when trading volumes are typically muted as many institutional investors and professional traders are less active. This means that speculative activity on the network could well continue during the week. Beyond that, the memecoin’s launch is bringing Solana an influx of new users and presents the network, which has suffered multiple major outages , with an opportunity to showcase its robustness. If it withstands the test, the Solana ecosystem could keep on seeing significant inflows. The introduction of Trump's token also signals the U.S. government's change in stance toward the cryptocurrency sector and offers it increased legitimacy, as the President of the world’s largest economy has quite literally launched a Solana-based memecoin. The memecoin’s rollout signals a “change in US fintech policy towards much more permissive innovation,” crypto OG and Shapeshifter founder Erik Voorhees commented .",Markets|Donald Trump|Solana|meme coins,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|MARKET|SHIB|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-19 20:54:31

Chainlink & Litecoin Prices Shows Rapid Surge,https://thecoinrise.com/web3bays-seed-round-hits-830k-in-weeks-chainlink-litecoin-prices-shows-rapid-surge/,"The cryptocurrency market is driven by new developments, with recent movements focusing on both speculation and practical use. The increase in Litecoin’s price is spurred by rumors of an ETF and significant buying by large-scale holders, demonstrating its consistent attraction yet dependent on speculative news. Chainlink’s gradual increase shows a rising need for its oracle services in decentralized finance, although it still trails behind its highest value. Among these changes, Web3Bay (3BAY) stands out significantly, merging blockchain technology with real-world e-commerce applications. Unlike Litecoin and Chainlink, which serve more specific purposes, Web3Bay tackles broader issues facing online retail, such as excessive fees and data security concerns. Web3Bay: Revolutionizing E-Commerce with Blockchain Web3Bay is transforming the e-commerce landscape by addressing inefficiencies prevalent in traditional platforms. Issues like high fees, lack of transparency, and security risks are common in centralized markets, yet Web3Bay eradicates these through blockchain technology. This shift results in a decentralized platform that offers secure, affordable, and open shopping experiences. Web3Bay is distinguished by its 3BAY token, which fuels its ecosystem and provides significant advantages to its users. Token holders benefit from a 5% discount on purchases, participate in governance, and enjoy the quickness of crypto transactions. Unlike standard platforms, Web3Bay promotes a community-led marketplace where user involvement and innovation are prioritized. By merging blockchain’s transparency with modern shopping convenience, Web3Bay sets a new standard for global commerce. It focuses on cutting costs and building trust, delivering a revolutionary solution for both buyers and sellers, thus making e-commerce smarter and more equitable for all. Now in its fourth presale phase, the 3BAY token is priced at $0.0045626 and has attracted over $830,000 in investments. With each presale round, the price gradually increases, aiming for a final launch price of $0.1959—a potential 6,430% return for early backers. Litecoin Price Surges Amid ETF Speculation and Whale Accumulation Currently, Litecoin (LTC) is trading at $138.58, a 15.54% increase from its previous price, driven by expectations of a Litecoin ETF and heavy buying by prominent investors. On-chain data reveals active purchasing by LTC whales, enhancing its market momentum. Bloomberg analysts speculate that an ETF approval could further escalate LTC’s value, potentially reaching $150. Technical analysis indicates that Litecoin has surpassed the $130 resistance level, suggesting possible continued growth. The combination of institutional interest, significant buyer activity, and positive technical indicators points to a sustained upward trend for Litecoin. Chainlink Price Advances with Market Optimism Chainlink (LINK) sees its price climb to $24.17, a slight 0.11% increase, in line with the general positive market sentiment. With a market cap of $13.72 billion, Chainlink secures its place as the 14th largest cryptocurrency. Its growth is partly due to its increasing integration into decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, where its oracle services are essential. Though Chainlink’s current price is about 55% below its peak in May 2021, the ongoing positive trend hints at more growth, particularly as the need for reliable Oracle services in blockchain platforms grows. Final Thoughts While the potential for a Litecoin ETF and Chainlink’s role in DeFi stirs the market, Web3Bay distinguishes itself by addressing real issues. Its decentralized marketplace not only introduces innovation but is vital, offering lower costs and more transparency. With a final projected launch price of $0.1959 for the 3BAY token, Web3Bay offers a practical and profitable investment opportunity, laying the groundwork for the future of commerce . For those considering an investment with real impact and growth potential, Web3Bay is the standout choice.

According to a new report by The Financial Times, people familiar with the matter say that the crypto-friendly trading platform has made confidential filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) even though its largest market is the United Kingdom. Confidential filings allow firms to pursue their plans without revealing them to the public until they are ready. The report also says that eToro is seeking a $5 billion evaluation and could be live in the New York markets as soon as Q2 of this year. Last year, eToro chief executive and founder Yoni Assia told The Financial Times that being listed in the US instead of in the UK could give the company access to more investors. “Very few of our global clients would trade UK shares. Something in the US market creates a pool of both deep liquidity and deep awareness for those assets that are trading in the US.” eToro, which launched in 2007, had tried to go public in 2021 through a $10.4 billion deal with a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) but eventually canceled the plans after the implosion of SPACs. In 2023, eToro was valued at $3.5 billion after a funding round where the firm raised $250 million from investors such as the Tokyo-based asset management firm SoftBank and market data company Ion Group.

Intrestingly, technical analysis of the Dogecoin price chart shows that this greed sentiment is about to push the meme coin into a parabolic rally that would send it to new all-time highs. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bulls Eye $3 As Whales Scoop 200 Million DOGE In The Last 2 Days This rally is from a projection of the “Power of 3” concept, with recent price action pushing Dogecoin into the distribution phase. Power Of 3 Patterns Point To Bullish Momentum For Dogecoin The Power of 3 pattern is a technical analysis concept that divides the price cycle into three distinct phases of accumulation, manipulation, and distribution. These phases are each distinct in their price performance. The accumulation phase, which is the first phase of the pattern, is characterized by a consolidation around a recent high after a strong upwards price action. Next is the manipulation phase, where price action breaks below the support of the accumulation phase and starts to trade within a range just below this support. The distribution phase is the last phase, which is characterized by a strong price breakout in the upward direction as momentum builds and a large number of participants enter the market. According to technical analysis of the Dogecoin price action by crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade, two consecutive Power of 3 patterns have appeared on the DOGE daily chart. The first pattern has been fully completed and played out during the months of March to November 2024, with the ensuing distribution phase pushing Dogecoin to multi-year highs. The second pattern began shortly after the first one concluded and is now nearing its final stage. The accumulation phase for this pattern lasted from early November to mid-December, during which Dogecoin rejected at $0.48 and began consolidating around $0.48 to $0.4. This was followed by the manipulation phase, which persisted from mid-December through the first weeks of January after Dogecoin broke below $0.4 Recent positive price movements show that Dogecoin has now exited the manipulation phase and is now in the distribution phase. If history were to repeat itself, Dogecoin could experience another parabolic rally from here, driven by increased market participation and growing bullish sentiment. Breaking Out Of Consolidation: The 2017 Parallel Trader Tardigrade projected that the distribution phase will send the Dogecoin price above its current all-time high of $0.7316 and finally above the $1 mark. The final price target is around $1.3, which represents a 225% increase from the current price. Tardigrade also drew parallels between Dogecoin’s current movement and its price action from 2017. He noted that Dogecoin has broken out from a consolidation trendline in a manner similar to a breakout before its rally in 2017. If history repeats itself, Dogecoin could reach a local peak above $3 in 2025.

The statement comes on the heels of MicroStrategy upping its Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings to 450,000. Things will be different tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/8Rmn1Jjgdr — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) January 19, 2025 Fred Thiel, CEO of Bitcoin mining company MARA Holdings, and his Vice President of Investor Relations Robert Samuels share a similar sentiment. The pair posed for a picture with Saylor at the so-called “Crypto Ball” on Jan. 17, an event meant to commemorate the return of Trump, now a crypto convert , to the White House. “Our team in partnership with [Saylor] met with the entire incoming cabinet of the Trump Administration. We are excited about the future of mining in the US,” Samuels said. Will MicroStrategy add to its coffers? The tweet, accompanied by a screenshot from Saylortracker , a platform that monitors MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin purchases, carries particular weight given Saylor’s recent pattern. His last such hint on Jan. 12 was followed by a purchase the next day of 2,530 BTC at an average price of $95,972 for $243 million. You might also like: US will not approve strategic Bitcoin reserve: CryptoQuant CEO And with Trump expected to make crypto-friendly executive orders , MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin purchase strategy will likely bode well for the software strategy firm. So far, the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based firm inked several purchases since December 2024: January 13: 2,530 BTC at $95,972 ($243 million) January 6: 1,070 BTC at $94,004 ($101 million) December 30: 2,138 BTC at $97,837 ($209 million) December 23: 5,262 BTC at $106,662 ($561 million) December 16: 15,350 BTC at $100,386 ($1.5 billion) December 9: 21,550 BTC at $98,783 ($2.1 billion) December 2: 15,400 BTC at $95,976 ($1.5 billion) The company’s Bitcoin portfolio has generated an unrealized 67.7% return on investment, representing paper profits of $19.09 billion. At last check on Sunday, Bitcoin is currently trading at over $106,000. See below. Source: CoinGecko If Saylor’s hint turns into another purchase, it would further strengthen MicroStrategy’s position as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. The company’s aggressive acquisition strategy has proven particularly profitable in recent months, with most purchases since December showing positive returns ranging from 7.35% to 11.18%. This potential new purchase would follow MicroStrategy’s stated goal of continuing to acquire Bitcoin as part of its corporate treasury strategy.

The network’s robust growth and expanding ecosystem make it a noteworthy player in the blockchain space. DeFi Llama ’s recent report shows that the L2 network has made significant achievements across multiple sectors. Base, A Rising Star in DeFi Space The DeFi space is growing fast, and Base has become the largest layer-2 network in the crypto world. It now hosts over 410 decentralized apps (dApps), revolutionizing how people use financial systems without relying on traditional banks. Key players in this thriving ecosystem include Aerodrome, Uniswap, Morpho Blue, and Moonwell. One of the standout protocols in the Base DeFi space is Morpho, a competitor to AAVE, which shows promise in decentralized lending and borrowing. Base’s activity is impressive, handling over $264 billion in transactions since its inception. More recently, transaction volume reached $12.2 billion in just one week, showcasing the high demand and utility of the network’s offerings. Speculatively, introducing Bitcoin-backed loans on Coinbase could further boost Base’s growth, pushing Morpho and other DeFi projects to new heights. Memecoins and NFTs Fuel Base’s Continued Success Base’s growth is not just about DeFi; its booming memecoin ecosystem also drives it . The memecoins are now worth over $2.6 billion, with tokens like Brett and Akuma Inu leading. NFTs are another highlight, with sales up 45% last week to $8.3 million and over 15,000 unique buyers. Cumulative NFT sales have exceeded $62 million, and the network handles over 40 million monthly transactions. These numbers place Base ahead of rivals like Arbitrum and Polygon. Base Expands Into AI and Gaming Sector In addition to its success in DeFi and NFTs, Base is expanding into emerging sectors such as artificial intelligence (AI) and gaming. This expansion is expected to open up new opportunities for developers and users, making Base an even more attractive platform for growth and innovation. Due to Base’s impressive expansion and strong user engagement, the network will likely achieve a substantial valuation. This is especially true if Coinbase rolls out the much-anticipated airdrop as part of its roadmap for 2025. The L2 scaling solution is set to become a major player in the layer-2 crypto space with an estimated fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $7 billion. This would place it ahead of competitors like Arbitrum, valued at $3.2 billion, and Optimism, at $2.47 billion. Such a valuation highlights its rapid growth and increasing importance in the DeFi ecosystem. If the trend continues, Base could solidify its position as a leader among layer-2 networks.

BONK’s appeal lies in its unique positioning within the Solana ecosystem, offering lightning-fast transaction speeds and low fees. Since its debut, BONK has seen consistent community support, helping it maintain its position as a top-performing meme coin. Its ecosystem is expanding rapidly, with plans to integrate BONK into more DeFi applications, solidifying its place in the market. While BONK’s initial surge was monumental, its long-term potential lies in its ability to sustain growth through innovation and adoption. PEPE: A Meme Coin That Made Headlines PEPE, inspired by the iconic internet meme, has captured the imagination of crypto investors worldwide. Its Binance listing was a game-changer, pushing its market cap higher within weeks. Unlike many meme coins, PEPE has focused on creating an ecosystem that blends humor with utility, including NFTs and community-driven projects. PEPE’s strength lies in its viral appeal and loyal community. The token’s ability to attract attention on social media platforms has kept it in the spotlight, and its listing on Binance only amplified its reach. For investors, PEPE represents the perfect blend of meme culture and real-world utility, making it a standout choice in the crypto world. The Final Words Based on our research and market trends, meme coins continue to dominate the crypto landscape, offering incredible opportunities for early investors.

TRUMP Memecoin Plummets – What’s the Reason for the Decline?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/very-hot-moments-trump-memecoin-plummets-whats-the-reason-for-the-decline/,"The Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin, which has been the most talked about topic of the last two days, experienced a sudden drop with the new development tonight. The altcoin, which rose above $70 during the day, fell to $40 with the latest decline. So what was the reason for this decline? As is known, TRUMP was officially launched yesterday morning by Donald Trump. The altcoin, which enabled Trump's wealth to increase fivefold at its peak, lost significant value minutes ago after Donald Trump's wife Melania Trump launched a memecoin called MELANIA. Chart showing the fluctuation in the price of TRUMP. At first, it was thought that Melania Trump's X and Truth Social accounts were hacked, but the tweets in question were also retweeted by Donald Trump's official X account. MELANIA was also launched on the Solana network, similar to TRUMP. However, traders probably thought the seriousness of the situation was lost and dumped the TRUMP token.

This reform has been in progress for nearly a year and aims to align the foundation’s goals with the evolving needs of the Ethereum ecosystem. Vitalik Buterin shared on X that the changes are intended to fill gaps in technical expertise and improve the foundation’s collaboration with key ecosystem players, including developers, wallet providers, Layer-2 networks, and users. The updates also focus on enhancing decentralization, privacy, and open-source principles while advancing Ethereum’s role as a robust, censorship-resistant platform for decentralized applications. The foundation is also planning to integrate more decentralized technologies into its internal processes, such as payments and treasury management. Over the past year, the Ethereum Foundation has faced criticism for being too passive and concerns about its spending and operational priorities. These reforms aim to rebuild trust and strengthen relationships within the ecosystem. Buterin emphasized that the foundation will remain neutral and avoid political lobbying or catering to specific interests, preserving Ethereum’s position as a global platform. He reaffirmed EF’s dedication to empowering developers and fostering innovation rather than engaging in political influence. “The Ethereum Foundation will not aggressively lobby regulators or political figures, especially in powerful countries like the USA. We must maintain Ethereum as a neutral global platform,” Buterin stated. In addition to Buterin’s remarks, co-founder Joseph Lubin proposed a dual-leadership model for guiding the foundation into its next phase. Lubin suggested that Ethereum developer Danny Ryan and Ethereum France President Jérôme de Tychey take on leadership roles to balance technical and business strategies. Lubin highlighted their ability to navigate the challenges of the fast-changing blockchain industry while upholding Ethereum’s core principles. Lubin also stressed the importance of maintaining neutrality, likening Ethereum to Switzerland . Switzerland is a neutral nation that actively promotes its values and fosters international relationships . Lubin argued Ethereum could adopt a similar approach, championing its technological advancements while remaining impartial. He encouraged the community to advocate for Ethereum’s role in building a better future. Lubin concluded by emphasizing the need for energy, creativity, and determination in Ethereum’s leadership to ensure it continues to be the most trusted and versatile blockchain ecosystem. The proposed changes reflect a commitment to innovation, decentralization, and collaboration to better serve the Ethereum community and ecosystem.",,EN,0,0,ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-19 22:08:49
