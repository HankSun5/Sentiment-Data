Bitcoin Price Briefly Tops $105K After the latest market meltdown, the Bitcoin price has breached the six-figure realm, signaling that the bulls are now in command. The largest and oldest crypto asset gained over 4% in the last 24 hours, rising from just under $90,000 on Jan. 13 to a price of $105,850, according to CoinGecko data. BTC has since cooled to $104,114 as of publication time. Nevertheless, the asset is just 3.5% away from its current all-time high price of $108,135, set in December 2024. Trump’s Swearing-In Is Only Days Away Expectations among crypto market observers are increasing as Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 47th president of the United States on Jan. 20 draws closer. Many anticipate that Trump will implement plans for crypto right from day one in office. The incoming president pledged pre-election to position the US as a leader in the crypto sector, including establishing a national strategic Bitcoin stockpile similar to gold. This is in stark contrast to the Joe Biden administration’s regulatory crackdowns and regulatory enforcement actions. If this were to be executed, the US Treasury would have to purchase one million BTC over five years, resulting in a supply crunch. Although direct government BTC buys remain uncertain, prohibiting sales of the US government’s current stash could reduce selling pressure and fortify the top crypto’s position as a legitimate asset class, further incorporating it into global financial markets. According to a Thursday Bloomberg report, Trump is looking to issue a pro-crypto executive order to elevate digital assets to a “national priority” shortly after his inauguration. Sources claim that this could include setting up a new crypto advisory council of industry leaders for policy recommendations. Trump is also expected to address crypto-debanking and repeal a bank accounting policy that compels banks to list crypto assets as liabilities. It’s worth mentioning that the New York Post recently reported that Trump is open to expanding a possible strategic reserve to include a basket of cryptos founded in the U.S., such as USD Coin (USDC), Solana (SOL), and Ripple’s XRP.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|BTCUSD|BTCUSDC|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency News|XBTUSD,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-18 21:35:51

Over the past few months, Selkis’ scorn for the San Francisco-based company and its cross-border payments token XRP seems to have taken a darker turn. The pundit slammed Ripple’s attempts to create ties with the forthcoming Donald Trump government. Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty dined with President-elect Trump earlier this month. Selkis Takes A Swipe At Ripple And XRP Messari’s Ryan Selkis has once again taken aim at Ripple and XRP. In a recent post on the X platform, Selkis described Ripple as a threat to the Trump administration’s cryptocurrency agenda, cautioning that XRP’s recent market strides are generally detrimental. The industry expert noted that XRP has surpassed Salesforce in market cap and is nearing the market capitalization of Bank of America. Moreover, XRP is now bigger than ride-hailing giant Uber, Spotify, PayPal, and MicroStrategy combined. In addition, the third-largest crypto is basically 5X the size of America’s biggest crypto exchange, Coinbase. “Ripple’s crash and scandals will take down the entire crypto agenda in DC,” Selkis wrote. XRP is now bigger than Salesforce and approaching BofA in market cap. + Top 30 US company. + Twice the value of Uber. + Bigger than Shopify, PayPal, and Microstrategy combined. + 5x the size of Coinbase. Ripple’s crash and scandals will take down the entire crypto agenda in DC. — Ryan Selkis (d/acc) (@twobitidiot) January 16, 2025 It’s worth mentioning that XRP currently commands a $178 billion market cap following its recent rally, while Salesforce is valued at $310 billion. But for Selkis and other Ripple critics, this does little to detract from the fact that Ripple’s parabolic growth is a potential threat to crypto. Selkis, meanwhile, claims that Ripple will unleash doom for crypto. In a follow-up post intended to explain his aversion to Ripple, he posited that the company’s executives were not good people, possibly referencing co-founder Chris Larsen and CEO Bradley Garlinghouse. “The reason I’m a dick about Ripple isn’t because I care about XRP or its memecoin rally. I’m happy for all of the retail holders who have made bank. My issue with them is that they aren’t content with just being billionaires, they lust for power,” Selkis asserted. Ripple And The Trump Administration As ZyCrypto reported previously, Ripple donated $5 million worth of XRP to Trump’s presidential inaugural fund. Reports say that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Trump could review its crypto-related cases and pause any that don’t have fraud allegations. Industry lawyers also bet that the SEC will soon abandon its crypto cases . Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty said on Jan. 15 that the regulator’s long-running enforcement case against the firm was “likely to be abandoned” by the incoming Trump administration after the agency filed an appeal challenging a July 2023 ruling that partially dismissed claims against the company. More interestingly, Trump is reportedly open to creating a wider national strategic reserve — prioritizing U.S.-founded cryptocurrencies such as XRP. The news was enough to send XRP to a price not seen since 2018. The crypto peaked at $3.38 — just two cents from its all-time high price mark.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-18 21:42:08

The surge in BTC price to an all-time high above $107K and on-chain factors led to most analysts gauging a bull peak around $150K. However, massive demand from institutional players and governments has fueled a much higher sentiment in 2025. $150K Is Too Low, Bitcoin Enthusiast Opines A crypto trader, Alex Becker, wrote on X that a $150K price target for this bull cycle is low compared to the level of institutional interest recorded. He noted that the price can easily be broken and way too short. Bitcoin price at $150K is 1/6th the gold market cap. For years, Bitcoin and gold backers have debated which asset is most valuable in light of present macro conditions. According to Becker, there is no reason for industry bulls to stop at 1/6th of an asset that is harder to hold, manage, access, and store. Bitcoin is termed the digital gold and unlike the yellow metal, it is easier for investors to hold and transfer. Market participants also point to Bitcoin’s supply and scarcity against gold making it a better asset. Bitcoin has also recorded rising institutional demand due to spot ETFs and other macro factors. Donald Trump’s election win also ushered in a new wave of inflows. With all factors considered, Becker expects a target between $250K and $400K. “ But these make absolutely no damn sense in the current environment. In the case of the biggest countries, funds and corporations are all using it to store value…A market cap that is 1/6th that of good is absolutely silly low. There is absolutely no reason for us to stop or cap at $150k. If we reach that there’s only more of a reason for us to go to 250k-400k,” he wrote. Impact on Wider Market Bitcoin price tapped a new all-time high above $107K, fueling optimism for a higher target. As bulls ramp up accumulations, altcoins whales are also prepping for a massive shift to their favorite assets. Several investors opine an altcoin season may be on the horizon after Bitcoin hits its cycle peak. At the moment, several altcoins like XRP and Cardano have shown signs of huge inflows. Ethereum whales also picked up huge holdings alongside transfers out of centralized exchanges.",Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|FIAT|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-18 21:45:44

Simultaneously, buzz is building around the latest Internet Computer news, featuring an upcoming YouTube livestream where innovators will explore the impacts of SNS on their projects. In this dynamic environment, BlockDAG (BDAG) is securing its position as a top crypto coin to watch with the recruitment of Marius Bock, previously a prominent figure at Cardano, now stepping in as the Lead Project Manager at BlockDAG. With Marius Bock’s leadership and strategic vision, BlockDAG is preparing for its eagerly awaited mainnet launch this year. Amidst the uncertainty faced by other cryptos, BlockDAG stands out as a top crypto of advancement. Explore Latest Movements by PEPE Coin Whales Recent movements by PEPE coin whales have once again highlighted them, generating both interest and discussion. A new wallet, “0x8f5,” has caused a stir by moving 280 billion PEPE tokens, valued at $5 million, out of Binance. This move follows the wallet’s previous acquisition of 47.4 million JASMY tokens, suggesting a deliberate diversification strategy. At the same time, another whale, “0xb1a,” has made a substantial purchase, securing 200.4 billion PEPE tokens for $3.72 million shortly before this report. These transactions might indicate a bullish outlook on PEPE’s future but also emphasize the meme coin market’s inherent instability. Such significant trades often prompt speculations about potential price changes or increased market action.

This follows reports of a whale trader profiting nearly $12 million from trading the token shortly after its release. The launch, which has triggered significant controversy, has drawn responses from financial experts, crypto enthusiasts, and ethics watchdogs. Eric Trump’s Take on $TRUMP Memecoin Eric Trump, the son of President-elect Donald Trump, commented on the $TRUMP memecoin’s rapid rise, calling it the “hottest digital meme on earth.” The $TRUMP token , launched late Friday, surged in value within hours, becoming a top trending topic in the cryptocurrency space. According to CoinGecko, its market capitalization exceeded $5 billion by Saturday afternoon, with trading volumes surpassing $11 billion. The token’s price more than doubled, reaching over $27 within 24 hours of its launch. The memecoin is owned primarily by CIC Digital LLC, a company tied to Donald Trump, which holds 80% of the token’s supply. With an estimated $20 billion in assets on paper under the current market price, the launch has raised questions about the intersection of Trump’s financial interests and his upcoming presidency. Peter Schiff, an economist and Bitcoin skeptic, weighed in on the rapid rise of the $TRUMP token. “It took Bitcoin four years to reach a $5 billion market cap. $TRUMP did it in one day,” he wrote on X. Schiff sarcastically suggested creating a strategic reserve for the memecoin and requiring its inclusion in retirement accounts. However, the comments drew mixed reactions, with some dismissing the comparison between Bitcoin and a newly launched meme-based cryptocurrency. Whale Trader Profits $11.8 Million Amid Market Activity A significant transaction involving the $TRUMP memecoin occurred hours after its launch, catching the attention of blockchain analysts. A whale trader, who reportedly spent $12 million purchasing 860,895 tokens at $13.94, sold the holdings at $27.67. The transaction resulted in an $11.8 million profit, showcasing the high volatility of the token in its early trading hours. This development has sparked concerns over the stability of the memecoin and the potential for market manipulation. Critics argue that speculative trading could harm smaller investors entering the market at inflated prices. Prominent figures, including former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, criticized the event. Scaramucci called the launch “an alarming level of corruption,” suggesting it reflects poorly on the broader cryptocurrency industry. Ethical Concerns Over Presidential Financial Ties The timing of the $TRUMP memecoin launch has led to ethical questions, as it occurred just days before Donald Trump’s inauguration as president. Historically, presidents-elect have made efforts to distance themselves from business ventures to avoid perceived conflicts of interest. The Trump administration’s direct ties to the cryptocurrency have drawn scrutiny from ethics watchdogs. Jordan Libowitz of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington commented on the situation, stating, “This is a president-elect launching businesses alongside promises to deregulate industries where he stands to profit.” Trump has also faced criticism for promoting cryptocurrency-friendly policies during his campaign, including proposals to overhaul crypto regulations and have the federal government stockpile Bitcoin.

Whale Sells $23.82 Million in Holdings appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Today, January 19, 2024, while major cryptocurrencies seem to be struggling, Donald Trump’s newly launched meme coin, Official Trump (TRUMP), is making waves and gaining significant attention from crypto enthusiasts. The potential reason behind this attention is the TRUMP coin’s over 300% upside momentum and a post made by President-elect Trump. Crypto Whale Sold Entire TRUMP Meme Coin On January 18, 2024, following a post on X (formerly Twitter), the price of TRUMP began soaring. Noticing its potential for upside momentum, a crypto whale spent a significant 12 million USDC to purchase 860,895 TRUMP meme coins at an average price of $13.94. However, as the price continued to rise significantly, the same whale dumped their entire TRUMP holding at an average price of $27.67, making a profit of $11.8 million. A whale dumped 860,895 $TRUMP for 23.8M $USDC just now. This whale spent 12M $USDC to buy 860,895 $TRUMP at $13.94, then sold it at $27.67, making a profit of $11.8M! https://t.co/1f98ch5Pi4 pic.twitter.com/nfuYYShyij — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 18, 2025 Adding to this massive sell-off, a crypto expert revealed on X that Trump’s team has allegedly sold $500 million worth of TRUMP tokens while retaining 85% of the total supply. TRUMP Price Momentum Despite this substantial dumping, TRUMP reached a high of $35. However, due to some profit-taking, the price now appears to be correcting. At the time of writing, the meme coin trades at $27.75, maintaining a significant 330% gain in the past 24 hours. This significant price surge in the past 24 hours has consistently attracted new investors and crypto giants, contributing to the continuous price increases the meme coin is experiencing. With only 200 million TRUMP of the total 1 billion supply currently in circulation, concerns are rising over the potential impact of future token releases.

Trump Buys Solana (TRUMPSOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Buys Solana launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Buys Solana by entering its contract address – 8Ruz6rzYPpKHActX3jo49v8WBhiJ5KsGM6dyCghQj3i – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SOL|SHIB|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-18 22:20:00

Input Output Global (IOG), the main firm behind Cardano, confirmed that it will be supporting the Plomin hard fork on the mainnet as of January 18, 2025. According to a tweet , “We’re happy to share that Input | Output has today voted “Yes” on the Plomin Hard Fork governance action.” This means that all the conditions which are stated in the Interim Constitution have been fulfilled to the letter. IOG representatives emphasized that there was internal and independent technical assessment before this milestone. Moreover, more than 85% of the active stake pools have been updated to the required client node versions of 10.1.3 or 10.1.4 to meet the consensus rules of the guardrail HARDFORK-04. The Intersect’s Hard Fork Working Group has also submitted readiness reports that only serves as a testament of the readiness of the network to this upgrade. The Plomin activation is a constitutional milestone for Cardano according to its decentralized governance plan. Is a 400% rally on the cards for ADA? With the bearish pressure in the cryptocurrency market being less severe, large-cap altcoins are displaying early indications of a comeback. Cardano has quickly become one of the best-performing assets in the cryptocurrency market by the year 2025. After weeks of downward movement, ADA has managed to regain and trade above the $1 level. Crypto analysts are now speculating about the next move for the price of Cardano. Prominent analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted fractals—which are patterns in the price, to indicate that Cardano is about to experience a significant price action. Martinez likened the current trend to the late 2020 rise of ADA, which jumped from $0.4 to above $3, this being its peak. Source: X In his analysis, he argued that Cardano could follow a similar trend, and it might hit $6 within two to three weeks. This would mean a 400% increase from the price at which it currently trades. At the time of writing this, ADA is selling at $1.15, which is about 5% higher than its value on the previous day and 20% higher than a week ago. Surging ADA TVL Aside from price recovery, Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem is also growing. The total value locked (TVL) in Cardano protocols has risen by 25% in the year so far, increasing from $430 million to $538 million. The institutional and large-scale investors have greatly contributed to the appreciation of the price of Cardano. According to blockchain analytics firm Santiment, whale transactions worth more than $100k have picked up as Ada’s price has risen. This increased activity is attributed to the increased confidence of institutional investors, increased trading and supporting the bullish outlook. Source: Santiment Cardano’s connection to the new US administration is another factor that makes it attractive to the market. The company’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, is said to be among the potential members of President-elect Donald Trump’s crypto council which will advise the new administration on digital currency laws.

Recently, the community started discussing a new plan to reduce inflation, aiming at the network’s long-term stability. The proposal suggests lowering the annual inflation rate from 5.7% to 1.5%. While this plan seeks to reduce inflation and enhance stability, it has led to mixed reactions, especially from stakers who worry about how it will affect their rewards. Solana Community Proposal Sparks Mixed Reactions From Stakers The Solana blockchain is known for processing many transactions quickly and at low costs. It uses an inflationary model, creating new tokens yearly to reward stakers who help secure the network. This encourages more people to stake their tokens, which improves the network’s decentralization and security. However, as the network grows, the increasing number of tokens raises concerns about inflation. This could reduce the value of Solana (SOL) tokens over time. Meanwhile, the proposal has received mixed reactions from the Solana staking community. Some stakers believe that reducing inflation is necessary to protect the value of their assets. Many stakers are worried that the proposed reduction could lower staking rewards. As the community discusses and improves the proposal, it’s clear that Solana is trying to find a balance between controlling inflation and keeping strong incentives for its growing network of participants. The final decision will likely affect the blockchain’s economic model for many years. IMF Predicts Global Inflation Drop to 3.5% As reported by TheCoinRise, the International Monetary Fund projects that inflation will fall to 3.5% by the end of 2025 , down from a peak of 9.4% in 2022. “The battle against inflation is almost won,” Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, IMF’s Chief Economist, stated last year. “The global economy has shown resilience, and we expect growth to hold steady at 3.2% for the next two years.” This stabilization in inflation would bring potential benefits such as reduced living costs and lower interest rates. Notably, the benefits could positively impact cryptocurrencies and tech stocks. Despite the encouraging inflation outlook, Gourinchas warned that geopolitical tensions and other global uncertainties could pose economic risks . However, the IMF called for a policy triple pivot to stabilize interest rates, reduce government spending, and implement reforms to boost productivity. Solana Becomes a Leading Blockchain for New Developers Due to its excellent performance, Solana has recently become the talk of the DeFi market . Since 2016, Ethereum has been the best DeFi development network for new developers, but Solana’s recent network reports have hijacked the mantle. While Solana now holds over 7,625 new developers, surpassing Ethereum, analysts are positive that this could further brighten its price sentiment.

Unveiled on Jan. 17, just before Trump’s inauguration as the 47th president, TRUMP reached a market cap of nearly $9 billion within hours, surpassing popular memecoins like Pepe and Bonk. “My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING! Join my very special Trump Community. GET YOUR TRUMP NOW,” Trump announced on Truth Social and X. While some in the crypto community questioned the authenticity of the project, a source close to Trump’s family confirmed to Cointelegraph that the initiative is legitimate and ties into his existing NFT ventures. A surge of trades underscored the token’s rapid rise. Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that a wallet named “LeBron” turned a $1 million investment into over $2 million by acquiring 4.52 million TRUMP tokens shortly after launch. Another trader made $70 million in under four hours, converting an initial $1.1 million investment into significant profits by selling 1.35 million TRUMP for 3.65 million USDC while keeping additional tokens valued at $67.5 million. Pseudonymous trader 0xsun also saw substantial gains, purchasing nearly 1 million TRUMP tokens with 3,000 Solana (worth $653,000) and later selling part of their holdings for $812,000, netting over $3.7 million in profit. Whales joined the frenzy as well, with one withdrawing 61,205 SOL, valued at $14.3 million, to purchase 1.27 million TRUMP tokens. Another whale spent 8.5 million USDC to acquire 1.03 million tokens at an average price of $8.28. At the time of writing, TRUMP traded at $18.82 with a market cap of $4.28 billion, a 10,222% increase since launch.

One trend shaking things up lately is the rise of Bulls Squad—projects that rally communities and drive utility in ways that traditional coins simply can’t. These squads bring together loyal holders and inject new energy into the ecosystem, particularly with projects tied to gaming, rewards, and meme culture. If you’re after a coin with serious staying power, you’ve got to consider how its squad delivers on both innovation and engagement. Now, who doesn’t love a good underdog story? Meme coins have been the heart and soul of crypto’s most unexpected successes, with coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu making waves over the years. They’ve proven that a dash of humor, mixed with a strong community, can translate into big gains. But the meme game is changing. New players like BTFD Coin (BTFD), Mog Coin (MOG), and Apu Apustaja (APU) are rewriting the rulebook with bold utilities and killer presales. BTFD Coin, in particular, is catching everyone’s eye. Not just for its presale buzz (more on that later), but for its Bulls Squad—a unique initiative blending staking, P2E gaming, and community-driven rewards. If you think meme coins can’t innovate, BTFD is here to prove you wrong. Ready to dive in? Let’s break it all down. BTFD Coin: Bulls Squad, Presale Perks, and Beyond BTFD Coin has smashed onto the scene like a bull in a china shop—unstoppable and ready to charge. With over $5.1 million raised so far and more than 64 billion coins sold across 8,600 holders, its presale is dominating headlines. Starting at just $0.000004, the coin’s price has climbed to $0.000142 in Stage 13, with a post-presale listing set at $0.0006. This isn’t just a hype train—it’s a freight train of value. What sets BTFD apart? It’s all about the Bulls Squad , a community-first initiative combining staking rewards and P2E gaming. Picture this: you’re not just holding your coins—you’re putting them to work in a gamified ecosystem where strategy and loyalty pay off big time. Whether you’re a hardcore gamer or a casual crypto enthusiast, the Bulls Squad has something for you. And let’s not ignore the presale perks. Early buyers snag more BTFD for less, setting them up for significant profits when the coin hits exchanges. Let’s crunch the numbers: if you drop $35,000 on BTFD at $0.000142 in Stage 13, you’ll bag roughly 246 million coins. When the price hits $0.0006 post-presale, that’s a whopping $147,600.

The recent Celestia upgrade has drastically reduced block times, effectively doubling the network’s efficiency and data handling capabilities. Concurrently, bullish trends in Render’s pricing emerge as its transition to Solana introduces enhanced functionalities. Amidst these developments, BlockDAG is making waves with a revolutionary approach. Through its collaboration with HackerEarth, BlockDAG (BDAG) is set to mobilize more than 10,000 developers and launch over 200 projects aimed at tackling blockchain scalability issues. This movement marks a shift towards practical, real-world applications and establishes BlockDAG as a formidable force in defining the future of blockchain technology. As new major players in the crypto market take the stage, don’t miss your chance to engage with innovations that could echo the early triumphs of Ethereum. BlockDAG’s Hackathons Pave the Way for Scalable Blockchain Solutions BlockDAG is stepping up like major crypto players such as Ethereum and Solana by partnering with HackerEarth. This collaboration is poised to revolutionize blockchain scalability by drawing over 10,000 developers into a series of global hackathons. The goal is to deploy over 200 projects within the BlockDAG network, offering viable solutions for decentralized finance, infrastructure, and governance challenges. The scope and concentration of these hackathons underline BlockDAG’s dedication to cultivating a robust crypto ecosystem. Central to these initiatives is the adoption of advanced technologies like the Phantom and GhostDAG protocols, which are set to enhance transaction speed and efficiency significantly. These hackathons will bring BlockDAG into collaboration with gifted developers worldwide, promoting breakthroughs that might parallel Ethereum’s formative growth. Smaller, specialized hackathons further showcase BlockDAG’s adaptability and commitment to meeting niche industry demands. BlockDAG’s presale figures underscore its burgeoning potential. Having raised over $182 million and sold 17.9 billion units, early participants have witnessed a staggering 2380% increase in value, with each unit currently priced at $0.0248. This offers a thrilling opportunity for newcomers to join a rapidly growing ecosystem that’s quickly gaining recognition as a major upcoming crypto force.

By fostering applications and decentralized projects that address real-world needs, BlockDAG is positioning itself as a leader in the blockchain arena. The forthcoming opportunities could profoundly influence the future of Web3 technologies. Celestia’s Speed Boost Unleashes New Capabilities The latest update to Celestia has dramatically reduced block times from 30 to 15 seconds, doubling the network’s capacity for handling data. This significant enhancement boosts transaction efficiency, making Celestia an even more attractive platform for developers in search of scalable solutions. Furthermore, this upgrade prepares the ground for future enhancements, such as expanding block sizes to 1 gigabyte, a move that could place it in competition with major transaction processors like Visa in terms of capacity. As of January 2025, Celestia’s native asset, TIA, is valued at $5.07, holding a market capitalization of $715.75 million. Despite a recent 7-day decrease of 6.69% in value, TIA’s trading volume of $149.39 million suggests sustained interest. With the upgrade unlocking numerous possibilities, Celestia is on a trajectory for significant growth, especially as the adoption of modular blockchain solutions continues to spread across various sectors. Render’s Price Outlook and Solana Switch Fuel Momentum Recent forecasts for Render indicate a promising growth outlook, propelled by its transition to the Solana network. This strategic shift drastically cuts transaction costs and boosts overall network performance, positioning Render as a scalable solution for intensive rendering demands. Integration with AI tools and services like Cinema 4D and Redshift expands its allure, particularly within the creative sectors. As of January 2025, Render’s currency, RNDR, is priced at $6.82, with analysts predicting potential peaks between $14.32 and $20.25 during this cycle. Longer-term forecasts suggest a price range of $50 to $80, buoyed by recent technological advancements and strategic alliances.

The Bottom Line The recent Celestia update has halved block times and doubled the network’s data capacity, positioning TIA as a strong contender in the market, currently priced at $5.07 with a market cap of $715.75 million. Likewise, optimism surrounds Render, with RNDR trading at $6.82 and price targets ranging from $14.32 to $20.25 for this cycle. Yet, it’s BlockDAG that’s taking the most ambitious strides.

Meanwhile, Arbitrum price shows modest gains, reflecting its steady role in Ethereum scaling. However, a lesser-known contender, Web3Bay (3BAY), is quietly stealing the spotlight with a practical approach that transcends speculation. While Solana benefits from ETF optimism and Arbitrum refines layer-2 scaling, Web3Bay focuses on reshaping e-commerce with blockchain-powered solutions. In a market crowded with speculative tokens, Web3Bay(3BAY) delivers a tangible use case: transforming global e-commerce. It’s not just another blockchain project; it’s a solution for businesses and consumers alike, bridging traditional finance and cryptocurrency. Investors searching for meaningful growth opportunities in 2025 might find Web3Bay more compelling than both Solana and Arbitrum. Web3Bay: Transforming E-Commerce with Blockchain Web3Bay is making headlines as the next big disruptor in the e-commerce industry. By integrating blockchain technology into its core operations, Web3Bay is eliminating the inefficiencies of traditional platforms, including high fees and lack of transparency. Instead, it offers users a decentralized, secure, and cost-effective way to engage in online shopping. Central to its ecosystem is the 3BAY token, which enables crypto payments and grants users perks like a 5% discount on purchases and community-driven governance. The presale for Web3Bay has already garnered immense attention, raising over $830,000 and selling more than 220 million tokens. Currently priced at just $0.0045626, the token’s affordability and projected launch price of $0.1959 make it a lucrative opportunity for early investors. With plans to expand into decentralized storage, multi-chain compatibility, and Layer-2 scaling for fast transactions, Web3Bay is well on its way to reshaping global commerce. As Web3Bay expands and adoption increases, the demand for 3BAY is set to skyrocket. By acting now, investors can lock in tokens at their lowest price, well ahead of the next price jump and the growing attention of the broader market. Solana Price Crosses $200 Mark Again As of January 17, 2025, Solana (SOL) is trading at $213.40, reflecting a 5.10% increase from the previous close. The intraday high reached $216.36, with a low of $198.74. The Solana price has been positively influenced by the anticipation of regulatory approval for Solana-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Industry experts suggest that the pro-crypto stance of the current U.S. administration may facilitate the approval of these ETFs, potentially attracting significant institutional investments. Analysts project that, upon approval, Solana ETFs could draw substantial investments, further boosting the Solana price.This development underscores the growing confidence in Solana’s ecosystem and its potential for mainstream adoption. Arbitrum Price Sees Modest Uptick Amid Market Fluctuations Arbitrum, an Ethereum layer-two scaling solution, utilizes optimistic rollups to enhance transaction speed and reduce costs. Arbitrum’s native token, ARB, is trading at approximately $0.7820, reflecting a 1.31% increase from the previous close. The token’s intraday performance has seen highs of $0.7871 and lows of $0.7499, indicating moderate volatility. Over the past week, ARB has experienced a 9.32% decline, aligning with broader market trends. Despite this downturn, the 24-hour trading volume has reached $235.32 million, suggesting sustained investor interest. The current market capitalization stands at approximately $3.11 billion, with a circulating supply of 4.21 billion ARB tokens. Takeaway While Solana price climbs on ETF optimism and Arbitrum price steadies amid market fluctuations, Web3Bay (3BAY) is building a foundation for lasting impact. Solana benefits from its thriving ecosystem, and Arbitrum enhances Ethereum’s scalability, but Web3Bay addresses everyday challenges in global commerce—fees, speed, and transparency. This focus on utility positions Web3Bay as more than just an investment; it’s a bridge between blockchain and real-world applications. The platform’s presale performance speaks volumes, with $830,000 raised , over 220 million tokens sold , and an attractive price of $0.004562625 . A projected launch price of $0.1959 signals significant upside for early investors. Features like NFT integration, decentralized governance, and seamless multi-chain functionality make Web3Bay a standout.

The announcement on January 17 through Trump’s Truth Social account stated that the token was for him and his “winning.” The initial speculation pointed towards a possible hack, but the confirmation came shortly after, with Trump becoming the first U.S. president to endorse a meme coin. Critics raise ethical concerns Like others, the TRUMP meme coin has been criticized for having no real-world application. Critics and analysts have pointed out that using the Trump administration’s position to endorse cryptocurrency is questionable. YouTuber Stephen Findeisen, also known as Coffeezilla, criticized the timings of the project. In a Jan. 18 post, he called the launch of the coin ‘unethical’ and raised concerns with the reported 80% of the coins being distributed to Trump’s inner circle. Findeisen described the situation as ‘nasty work’ due to the risks of large losses for inexperienced investors. > dropping TRUMP memecoin 2 days before becoming president is nasty work > new SEC/DOJ guarantees no prosecution > 80% of tokens vest to insiders DURING the presidency > most ppl losing money will be MAGA who aren't crypto native > *should* be a crime but crime is legal now ig? — Coffeezilla (@coffeebreak_YT) January 18, 2025 Peter Schiff, an economist who has consistently dismissed cryptos, likened the coin to Bitcoin in sarcasm while making fun of it. Former Trump aide Anthony Scaramucci called it “corruption” and warned it may negatively impact the broader crypto market. Crypto-influencer Max Schwartzman said that it is possible that Trump’s account was hacked, as the TRUMP COIN website has the same design as Trump’s previous NFT project. Others, like 0xCygaar, pointed out that the two have similar technical structures, which only added to the hype. Ok yeah the new Trump memecoin website is deployed almost identically to his previous NFT website. Same cloudflare setup, same deployment with Heroku, same SSL certificate issuer. Very similar HTML structure as before. pic.twitter.com/u1zLD7Vcv7 — cygaar (@0xCygaar) January 18, 2025 Explosive growth amid controversy After the launch, the token only took 15 minutes to reach a market cap of $400 million. The launch also saw SOL, Solana’s native token, rise to an all-time high of $267 due to the buzz around the TRUMP token. However, the TRUMP coin has soared and has recorded more than 12,000% adoption after its launch despite the backlash it has received. The token’s value reached close to $35 and then hovered around $29, taking the market capitalization to $5.98 billion. Successful traders have made a lot of money, with one of them reportedly making $50,000 to $1.1 million within a few hours. However, doubts remain about the prospects of the token in the future. Currently, only 20% of the 1 billion TRUMP coins are in circulation with the remaining 80% to be released over the next 36 months. At the moment, the first twenty holders possess 87.02% of the total token supply, which means only 12.97% remains for all other investors and traders. The developer wallet alone is estimated at about $15.5 billion, which raises questions about developers controlling and manipulating the market. Some critics have claimed that this sort of ownership control weakens the token in question. Crypto analyst JRNY Crypto raised concerns about the lack of concrete information coming from Trump’s advisors to support the project. The FOMO on the TRUMP token pushed many traders into action, causing a rise in the Solana price and an increase in its on-chain activity. Analyst Will Clemente pointed to the chaos, stating that traders have been dumping other assets to buy into the TRUMP phenomenon. However, some analysts have expressed concern that the fast pace may result in a quick drop. Never seen anything like this, SOL ripping and everything on chain nuking as people panic sell to fomo into Trump’s memecoin.

According to the company’s official announcement , trading for the controversial token began at 20:15 PM UTC on January 18. But as the token hits Kraken, it also saw a 35% decline in value. The token, which celebrates Trump’s leadership and his campaign slogan “Fight, Fight, Fight,” debuted only a few hours ago but has since seen an over 120,000 surge. TRUMP has now surpassed retail sensation stock GameStop (GME), which made history in 2021 and was thought to be the biggest market mania of the 2020s. The initial market frenzy sent TRUMP’s market cap soaring to nearly $6 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Trump launched the meme coin on January 17 through a post on Truth Social and X (formerly Twitter). In his signature style, Trump hyped the token as a rallying point for his movement, declaring, “My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!” The coin’s official website described TRUMP as a token for those who “don’t back down, no matter the odds.” And Trump’s highly-anticipated inauguration is less than 48 hours away. Behind the scenes, the token is managed by Fight Fight Fight LLC, a company promising to release an additional 800 million TRUMP tokens over the next three years. A first batch of 200 million coins hit the market during the launch. Exchanges pile on Other major centralized exchanges (CEXs) were ahead of Kraken. Singapore-based Crypto.com added trading pairs, allowing users to purchase TRUMP using USD, EUR, and 20 other fiat currencies. Meanwhile, Bybit opened pre-market trading for TRUMP/USDT with a call auction on January 18 at 9:35 AM UTC. On decentralized exchanges (DEXs), the token gained traction too. Platforms like Raydium, Orca, and Meteora listed TRUMP. In total, more than ten exchanges, including MEXC, HTX, and CoinW, now support TRUMP trading pairs. But this whole thing is just Trump putting his money where his mouth is. Last summer, he spoke at a Bitcoin conference in Nashville, promising to make America the “crypto capital of the planet.” His sons, Donald Jr. and Eric founded World Liberty Financial, a family-run venture focused on decentralized and centralized finance (DeFi and CeFi). Eric has called TRUMP “the hottest digital meme on earth.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",News|Kraken,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-18 23:33:39

Donald Trump the Bull (DONBULL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONBULL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Trump the Bull can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Trump the Bull could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Trump the Bull launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Trump the Bull on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Donald Trump the Bull by entering its contract address – AmgaL1uuQ97qJoXfUUxdHipLJmVd3toChivEBiSFn7MW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONBULL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|TRADING|DOGE|SOL|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-18 23:39:00

Despite seeing a 34% price drop, the Litecoin analysis suggests a potential recovery for LTC if it can break through resistance at $100. Likewise, Hyperliquid’s price has risen by 18%, showing signs of a possible recovery if it surpasses $24.62. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) has announced an exciting partnership with global hackathon leader HackerEarth. Through this collaboration, BlockDAG aims to build over 200 Web3 projects and engage 10,000 to 15,000 developers through four global hackathons. This exciting development comes as analysts predict major growth for BlockDAG, expecting BDAG to reach $1 this year, as its presale quickly moves toward its $600 million target. Litecoin (LTC) Analysis: What’s Next After the 34% Drop? Litecoin (LTC) analysis shows LTC had a strong run in late 2024, breaking key resistance levels and reaching a three-year high. However, the price has since dropped 34%, though it found support around $100, creating a higher low. If Litecoin continues its upward movement, it could break through its resistance and signal the end of the correction. Current Litecoin analysis shows that LTC is still in a bullish trend, with key indicators suggesting potential for further growth. A breakout above resistance at $95 could push Litecoin toward $184, marking a major price gain. Recovery Signs Appear as Hyperliquid Price Rises Hyperliquid’s price has seen an 18% increase, bouncing back from a recent low. After experiencing a bearish trend with a death cross earlier, Hyperliquid’s price now shows signs of recovery. The 9-period EMA has risen above the 20-period EMA, signaling a potential reversal. If HYPE breaks above key levels like $24.62, it could target $28.42, with further upside potential towards $40. However, if it faces resistance, the price could drop to as low as $15.11. The next few days will be crucial for determining the token’s direction. 200+ New Web3 Projects Coming to BlockDAG Network! BlockDAG is becoming a key player in Web3 innovation through its latest partnership with HackerEarth, a global leader in hosting online hackathons. Through this collaboration, BlockDAG plans to launch over 200 new projects on its network, helping teams create decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain solutions. With HackerEarth’s huge community of 7.6 million developers, BlockDAG will gain access to a large pool of talent, speeding up the growth of its ecosystem. To reach its goal, the network will host four global hackathons, involving 10,000 to 15,000 developers. These hackathons will offer developers a chance to showcase their work and gain exposure while also pushing the adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi), infrastructure, and governance solutions. Overall, this partnership goes a long way in boosting BlockDAG’s visibility and strengthening its position as a go-to network for developers aiming to make an impact in Web3. This surge in developer activity will likely lead to significant growth in BlockDAG’s ecosystem, potentially boosting the value of the BDAG coin. Analysts predict that as the mainnet launch gets closer and BlockDAG’s crypto presale —currently at $181.5 million—moves toward its $600 million target, BDAG could reach $1 in 2025. Currently priced at $0.0248 in batch 27 and having delivered a 2,380% ROI to early holders, BlockDAG remains one of the best crypto coins to buy now. Insider Pick: The Best Crypto Coin To Buy Now! The Litecoin (LTC) analysis shows strong potential for further growth, with a breakout above $95 possibly pushing its price toward $184. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid’s price shows signs of recovery, with potential upside if it breaks key resistance at $24.62, targeting $28.42 and beyond. However, BlockDAG remains the best crypto coin to buy today, offering impressive $1 growth potential alongside innovative partnerships. Its presale has already reached $181.5 million, and the partnership with HackerEarth is driving massive developer activity. In essence, BlockDAG’s ambitious goal of over 200 Web3 projects and four global hackathons this year make it a key player in Web3 innovation—and one of the top cryptos to buy in 2025.

Crypto stakeholders were expecting regulatory clarity and more friendliness toward the industry. Nobody saw him launching a memecoin days before his inauguration. According to reports, the incoming POTUS did not inform those in his circle of his plans to launch a memecoin. The token launch went live hours before the inaugural crypto ball hosted by Trump’s White House Czar, David Sacks. Analysts calm talks of reward for NFT holders Growing speculation that holders of Trump’s NFT cards could get allocations of the memecoin caused the collection’s floor price to surge over 400% today. The floor price surged as high as $1,000, making the trading cards one of the best-performing NFT projects in recent times. Trading activity of Trump NFT trading cards surged along with the memecoins. Source: MagicEden The NFTs were sold in multiple issues, with an average price of $99 per card. With today’s rally, some holders are up by as much as 13x their buying price on the NFTs. Investors active in the space quickly highlighted that the same company that helped launch the NFT collections, CIC Digital, is also involved with the TRUMP memecoin. However, it appears that NFT holders will not receive any automatic allocations or airdrops as outlined on the gettrumpmemes.com website. The “meme cards” term that led holders to speculate about a potential allocation appears to be another term the project used to describe its tokens, not the previously held NFT cards. UPDATE: Apparently they call the $TRUMP itself ""meme cards"" which is also in their terms & conditions. This makes an airdrop highly unlikely, since ""card allocation"" in this context means basically ""tokenomics"", not ""allocation for trading cards NFTs"" pic.twitter.com/B2rQmIYSWD — wale.moca 🐳 (@waleswoosh) January 18, 2025 The collection trades on Polygon and has seen a 24-hour trading volume of 2,380,000 $POL ($1.1 million). The project has yet to make any announcements or acknowledge any chatter about NFT holders receiving token allocations or airdrops. TRUMP token continues to divide opinions Like Donald Trump, his memecoin evokes mixed reactions on opposite ends of the spectrum. On one hand, some crypto citizens are excited by the POTUS interacting with crypto at this level. However, the other camp is skeptical about the long-term effect of involvement with the crypto community. Already, many in his circle have made bank thanks to the series of launches linked to his name. World Liberty Finance , the DeFi project linked to the Trump family is also closely tracked as some in the crypto space consider its transactions with projects as endorsements . Another issue investors have noted is that Trump Group affiliates CIC Digital LLC and Fighter Fight LLC hold 80% of the token’s total supply. However, those tokens are subject to a 3-year unlocking plan, which helps to allay fears of a sudden dump on the market. However, there are now claims the launch team has sold up to $500 million worth of the memecoin already. Still, the memecoin continues to soar to new levels. It has already gained over $5 billion in market cap and almost $13 billion in trading volume to trade for about $29.

The native token of the XRPLedger is rallying alongside the top crypto. Trump’s upcoming inauguration is one of the leading catalysts, alongside optimism on crypto regulation, pro-crypto policy and a new approach by financial regulatory agencies in the U.S. XRP could gain further, entering price discovery next week.

XRP supply distribution | Source: Santiment Market movers and Ripple lawsuit Monday’s inauguration is the largest market mover in crypto. But RippleNet’s rising adoption among institutions, the developments in RLUSD stablecoin and the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple are the three key market movers influencing the altcoin’s price. Even as the U.S. financial regulator filed an appeal against Ripple on Jan. 15, the altcoin continued its rally undeterred. The July 2023 ruling by Judge Analisa Torres that classified secondary sales of XRP as non-securities is being challenged and the SEC is seeking to have those retail sales classified as unregistered securities sales. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, told crypto.news in an exclusive interview: “XRP’s surge can be attributed to favorable outcomes in Ripple’s SEC lawsuit and a more crypto-friendly political climate in the US. If regulatory uncertainties are resolved, the influx of institutional investors could further solidify XRP’s position in the crypto market.” It remains to be seen whether the Trump administration will support pro-crypto regulation and whether it influences the outcome of lawsuits against firms like Ripple Labs.

XRP/USDT weekly price chart | Source: Crypto.news Expert commentary on XRP James Toledano, COO at Unity Wallet, told crypto.news in an exclusive interview: “Given that XRP was stuck at around $0.50 for literally 3 years, its recent breakout momentum reflects new levels of investor optimism around regulatory clarity and the potential approval of an XRP ETF in the following months. If the XRP ETF gets approved, it will have the potential to open the floodgates of capital inflow, meaning it could reach new heights in 2025.” Toledano warns XRP holders to be wary as altcoins take volatility to the next level in the current market cycle. He said: “Altcoin ETFs have genuine potential to attract capital, especially if supported by innovation-friendly policies with the new incoming U.S. administration. But, their success may be less consistent compared to Bitcoin ETFs due to the seemingly episodic nature of interest in altcoins. Just take a look at fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price this week. The factors are multifaceted; we could say it’s Trump, seasonality, geopolitics, macroeconomics and sentiment all blended together. To play devil’s advocate, we humans are pattern seekers but sometimes there are hidden drivers and the cause and effects are not always linked.” Read more: TRUMP surpasses $10B market cap in a day, listed on ChangeNOW and other exchanges for instant swap Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

From Dogecoin to Shiba Inu, and more recently Dogwifhat (WIF), these projects have proven that humor, community, and the power of the internet can turn even the quirkiest coins into success stories. Dogwifhat joined the ranks in December 2023, riding the wave of meme coin hype and delivering consistent market value despite limited utility. But as the crypto market evolves, so does the competition. Enter BTFD Coin, a meme coin designed not just to generate buzz but to create tangible value for its holders. With a 90% APY staking program, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, and an innovative presale model, BTFD Coin isn’t just here to follow the trend—it’s here to set the standard for the best coin presales to buy in 2025 . BTFD Coin: 90% APY Staking Rewards and Bulls Squad Power BTFD Coin is more than just a meme; it’s a full-fledged investment opportunity built on community strength and impressive tokenomics. At the heart of its appeal is the jaw-dropping 90% APY staking program , which offers investors a way to earn consistent, high rewards by simply holding and staking their tokens. This feature is a game-changer for those looking to maximize passive income from their crypto portfolio. Let’s break it down: Suppose you invest $6,000 during the presale at the current price of $0.000142 per coin. That nets you over 42 million BTFD tokens. When BTFD hits its projected listing price of $0.0006, your investment would already quadruple to $18,000. Add staking into the mix, and the potential compounding returns become even more attractive. Imagine using those rewards to fund a dream vacation, pay off debt, or reinvest in other crypto projects. The staking program isn’t the only reason to get excited. BTFD Coin launched its P2E game on January 1, 2025, blending entertainment with earning potential. Players can earn $BTFD tokens while enjoying a dynamic and engaging game, further integrating the coin into everyday use. BTFD’s presale performance has been nothing short of stellar. Stage 13 is already 97% complete, with over $5.2 million raised and more than 64 billion coins sold. With the price set to increase soon, now is the perfect time to join the 8,600+ investors already backing this project. Analysts predict a post-listing price of $0.006, which translates to a staggering 4000% ROI for early adopters. This is your chance to be part of one of the best coin presales to buy before it’s too late. How to Buy BTFD Coins: Getting started is simple. Set up your MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB or ETH, and connect it to the presale page . Once connected, select the amount you want to purchase, confirm the transaction, and you’re in. Dogwifhat: A Meme Coin That Made Its Mark Dogwifhat entered the scene as a playful addition to the meme coin family, featuring a dog wearing a quirky hat as its mascot. Despite lacking real-world utility, it gained traction thanks to its lighthearted branding and strong community support. Its value has remained relatively stable, making it a notable success in the meme coin space. Investors who got in early on Dogwifhat reaped substantial rewards. The coin quickly climbed from obscurity to prominence, proving once again that community-driven projects can thrive in the crypto world. However, like many meme coins, its success depended largely on its ability to generate hype and maintain interest over time. For those who missed out on Dogwifhat’s early days, BTFD Coin offers a fresh opportunity. Unlike Dogwifhat, BTFD brings tangible utility to the table with its staking rewards, P2E game, and referral program. These features make it one of the best coin presales to buy in 2025, providing a unique combination of fun and financial growth. The Final Thoughts Dogwifhat may have made its mark, but BTFD Coin is rewriting the rules of meme coin investing. With its 90% APY staking program, innovative P2E game, and record-breaking presale performance, BTFD is more than just another meme coin—it’s a movement. Don’t let this opportunity slip away. With Stage 13 nearly complete and the potential for 4000% ROI , now is the time to invest in one of the best coin presales to buy this year. Secure your spot in the Bulls Squad today and watch your crypto portfolio take off. The future of meme coins is here, and it’s called BTFD Coin.

At $28 per token, and with Trump-affiliated companies CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC controlling 80% of the supply, the value of his crypto holdings alone has soared to $22.4 billion. For context, Forbes last valued Trump at $5.6 billion last November. TRUMP traded at just $7 per token at launch but skyrocketed within hours, achieving a fully diluted valuation of $27 billion. This all comes less than 48 hours before Trump’s inauguration. Only 200 million tokens are currently circulating, but there’s a plan to expand this to 1 billion over the next three years, as per the token’s official website . The timing of the launch has drawn intense scrutiny. A US president-elect releasing a business product days before taking office is quite literally unheard of. At an unofficial crypto inaugural ball Friday night, Trump’s crypto and AI czar, David Sacks, promised that: “The reign of terror against crypto is over. Innovation in America for crypto has just begun.” Meanwhile, crypto companies have donated over $10 million to Trump’s inauguration, after donating over $300 million to him during the campaign. What critics are worried about But of course some people are not happy about any of this. Admittedly, TRUMP does blur the lines between his presidency and personal profit. But hey, this is Donald Trump. When has he ever followed rules? “It’s absolutely wild,” said Jordan Libowitz, vice president for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “Presidents-elect usually spend this time separating themselves from their finances. Trump is doing the opposite—launching a business and promising deregulation in ways that blatantly benefit him.” Anthony Scaramucci, once Trump’s communications director and now a crypto investor, slammed the launch on X, calling it “Idi Amin-level corruption.” He added, “Don’t delude yourself. This is bad for the industry.” Nick Tomaino, a venture capitalist and former Coinbase executive, warned that the level of ownership in TRUMP could harm smaller investors. “Trump owning 80% and timing the launch hours before inauguration is predatory, and many will likely get hurt by it,” he posted on social media. Blockchain data backs up these concerns. As was reported by Cryptopolitan, analyst Conor has revealed that Trump’s team has already offloaded $500 million worth of tokens. Transactions show $20 million worth of TRUMP tokens being sent to Bybit within seven hours of the launch. Most of the USDC reserves tied to these transactions were funneled into liquidity pools on Meteora, consolidating Trump’s position even more. The official TRUMP website has a disclaimer that the token is “not an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security.” Meanwhile, Solana saw a 16% price surge in the 24 hours following the TRUMP launch on its network, hitting an intraday high of 23%. According to CoinGecko data, this is Solana’s most profitable day of the year so far, despite Ethereum taking a 7% hit during the same period. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson said, “Apparently, 78.5 percent of Trump’s net wealth of 29.6 billion is in crypto, making him one of the richest cryptocurrency entrepreneurs.” Meanwhile, Solana has always been pitched as a “faster, cheaper,” alternative to Ethereum. The blockchain hosts a wide range of DeFi projects, and since last year, it has become the meme coin capital of the world. PEPE, WIF, PENGU, and MOTHER are just a few of the meme coins that have now made Solana invaluable to the industry. But TRUMP is different. See, just twelve hours after launch, it became the largest meme coin on Solana. SOL has already risen 25% this year, after posting an 85% gain in 2024. Bitwise, VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary have all submitted applications to launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on SOL, with a decision deadline set for January 25. And ProShares filed late Friday for four different ETFs tied to Solana.

Musk Kills Bears (MUSKBEAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBEAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Kills Bears can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Kills Bears could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Kills Bears launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Kills Bears on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Kills Bears by entering its contract address – 9yoxPCyAdEVRfAtkztzC7yKuhy7vEEEjXm3Ym8ajJEww – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBEAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-19 00:56:30

STRK is trading at $0.455 at time of writing. The 119th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 7% in the past 24 hours. Starknet surged past last month’s most-developed project, the decentralized oracle network Chainlink ( LINK ), which registered 311.57 notable GitHub events. Ethereum itself was third, with 219.13 events. An ERC-20 project is a standard that developers use to issue tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Santiment notes that it doesn’t count routine updates and utilizes a “better methodology” to collect data for GitHub events based on a “backtested process.” The analytics firm has previously said that heavy development activity centered around a crypto project indicates developers believe in the protocol. Development activity also suggests a given project is less likely to be an exit scam.

Stellar’s near-breakthrough to $0.50 signals optimism among institutional investors, while Dogecoin’s potential to reach $3 has speculators buzzing. Yet, amidst the excitement of short-term gains, Web3Bay (3BAY) offers something far more transformative—a tangible solution to real-world problems in global e-commerce. By integrating blockchain technology with decentralized governance, Web3Bay is creating a marketplace that reduces costs, enhances transparency, and empowers users. With over $830,000 raised and a projected 6,430% ROI for early adopters, Web3Bay isn’t just riding market trends; it’s building the foundation for the future of commerce. Web3Bay’s Vision: The Future of Global Commerce Web3Bay is not just a marketplace; it’s a vision for the future of commerce. Traditional platforms have long prioritized profits over user experience, but Web3Bay is changing that narrative. By integrating decentralized storage, multi-chain compatibility, and Layer-2 scaling solutions, the platform is building an infrastructure designed to last. Its hybrid payment model, combining cryptocurrency with traditional options like PayPal and Apple Pay, ensures inclusivity and ease of use for a global audience. Priced at just $0.0045626 in its fourth presale phase, the 3BAY token has already secured over $830,000 in funding. With every stage, the cost of the token rises, culminating in a launch price of $0.1959—a return of over 6,430% for those who buy early. The roadmap includes exciting developments such as the launch of an NFT marketplace and staking options for 3BAY holders, promising additional ways to engage with the ecosystem. As the presale continues to gain traction, Web3Bay is proving to be more than just an idea; it’s a tangible solution to the flaws of traditional e-commerce. Early adopters are not just investors; they’re pioneers in a movement that prioritizes transparency, security, and user empowerment. The Web3Bay revolution is here, and now is the time to join. Stellar Price Surges Amid Market Optimism As of January 16, 2025, Stellar price is trading at $0.482793, reflecting a 1.08% increase from the previous close. citeturn0finance0 The cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $0.514258 and a low of $0.4715, indicating notable volatility. The recent price uptick aligns with a broader positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, as investors anticipate favorable regulatory developments and increased institutional adoption. Stellar’s unique capability to facilitate cross-border transactions efficiently continues to attract attention from financial institutions and fintech companies. Analysts suggest that if the current momentum persists, Stellar could test the $0.50 resistance level in the near future. However, they caution that market dynamics remain unpredictable, and potential investors should conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. Dogecoin Price May Hit $3 Soon Dogecoin price has experienced notable price movements recently. As of January 17, 2025, DOGE is trading at approximately $0.4061, reflecting a 7.78% increase from the previous close. The intraday high reached $0.4061, with a low of $0.3688. This upward trend aligns with broader market dynamics, including Bitcoin’s recent surge past $107,000. Additionally, significant whale activity has been observed; large holders accumulated 200 million DOGE over 48 hours, indicating strong bullish sentiment. Analysts suggest that if Dogecoin price maintains momentum and surpasses the $0.40 resistance level, it could pave the way for a rally towards $3. However, investors should remain cautious, as the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. What’s Next In 2025 Stellar’s price resilience and Dogecoin’s whale-driven rally highlight the market’s speculative opportunities, but neither offers the comprehensive utility that Web3Bay delivers. The 3BAY token is more than a cryptocurrency—it’s the backbone of a decentralized marketplace designed to disrupt traditional e-commerce. Currently priced at $0.0045626 in its fourth presale stage, 3BAY offers investors unmatched growth potential, with a launch price of $0.1959 on the horizon.

39156253,https://timestabloid.com/?p=54930,1737248445,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Ripple CTO Warns XRP Holders While PropiChain Surges With a Predicted 43,000% ROI in 2025",https://timestabloid.com/ripple-cto-warns-xrp-holders-while-propichain-surges-with/,"Ripple CTO David Schwartz recently took to social media to warn XRP holders of a phishing operation targeting users of the popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. He indicated that the digital attack would come in the form of an email urging XRP holders to click a link to update certain information on their Coinbase accounts. Clicking this link could redirect the user to a malicious website where sensitive information could be stolen. Amid uncertainty about the security of Ripple’s XRP, investors are turning their attention to PropiChain (PCHAIN), a promising platform in the Crypto AI space. Following predictions of a 43,000% ROI in 2025, industry leaders believe PropiChain could be the next big thing in the real estate crypto market. Consequently, with PropiChain in the presale stage, the time to jump on the bandwagon is now. Ripple Left Reeling Amidst Phishing Warning Ripple recently enjoyed a surge, with the XRP token rising 12.75% to $2.97 . This surge pushes XRP within touching distance of reclaiming the $3 mark . Ripple’s anticipated legal victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and recent ETF buzz attracting large-scale investment have most likely aided its resurgence. However, fresh concerns over security integrity might throw a spanner in the works for XRP’s growth. As a result, eyes are beginning to turn toward PropiChain as investors search for the next big market player in crypto AI. With a revolutionary approach to real estate tokenization, AI integration, and Metaverse compatibility, PropiChain is seen as a viable long-term crypto investment. PropiChain Set to Revolutionize the Real Estate Market While Ripple’s XRP attempts to steady its ship, PropiChain continues to make waves in the real estate market with groundbreaking innovations in integrated AI and Metaverse technology. Redefining Real Estate With AI AI technology is the heart of the PropiChain platform. The asset is poised to change the real estate market as we know it by automating complex processes, predicting market developments, and optimizing decision-making. By leveraging AI, the platform can analyze vast amounts of data from multiple sources to provide live market evaluations, trends, and property valuations with incredible accuracy. Through the power of Automated Valuation Models (AVMs), investors can get a real-time look at property valuations and make educated decisions about their next investment. Additionally, 24/7 AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants are available to ensure that every issue is addressed promptly and satisfactorily. For example, new users can rely on these technologies to explain complex legal contracts and financial terms in simpler terms that they can easily understand. Promoting Equity in Real Estate With RWA Tokenization Through the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) using innovative blockchain technology, investors can own a fraction of real estate properties. This makes it possible for small-scale investors to own a fraction of a property they otherwise would not be able to. In addition, through the representation of property ownership on the blockchain, PropiChain facilitates more transparent, secure, and efficient property transfers without physical interaction. By leveraging blockchain technology and tokenization, PropiChain encourages simplified trading and transparent ownership to facilitate liquidity in the real estate market. Creating Immersion With Metaverse Integration PropiChain’s Metaverse integration has redefined the meaning of property exploration in real estate. By utilizing 3D technology, PropiChain has created an immersive virtual experience far superior to anything the sector has ever seen. For example, an investor in China can partake in virtual property tours of homes, offices, or commercial spaces in the U.S., saving time and money on travel expenses. Furthermore, virtual meetings can be held with all parties involved in transactions, further reducing the need for physical interaction on any level. PropiChain Delivering Massive Benefits for Investors With Ripple addressing security threats, PropiChain continues to gain momentum in its second stage of token presale. Early investors will reap major benefits such as property discounts, community rewards, zero-fee transactions, and more, making PropiChain among the most attractive tokens available. Having surpassed the $2 million mark in its token presale, PCHAIN is proving to have the attention of investors looking for a stable long-term investment while Ripple’s XRP altcoin tries to find its footing. Additionally, PropiChain has undergone a rigorous auditing process, with the leading security firm BlockAudit confirming the legitimacy of the platform. PCHAIN’s listing on CoinMarketCap also lends to its credibility and reliability while providing an interesting indication of future listings on other crypto exchanges. As investors begin to consider alternatives to Ripple, PropiChain continues to rise up the ranks as an innovative and exciting real estate investment opportunity. With Ripple’s XRP surge directly linked to external unpredictable factors, the growth stability offered by PCHAIN is an attractive prospect for long-term investors. Join the PropiChain Token Presale for Massive ROI PropiChain is currently valued at $0.011 per token with a view to a final listing of $0.032. This means that for those who missed out on the first stage of the token presale, this is the best time to seize this investment opportunity. Moreover, a post-listing profit of 800%+ means that an investment of $1,000 stands to return $80,000 or more by the end of the presale, with a predicted 43,000% ROI in 2025. This early prediction showcases confidence in PropiChain’s ability to lead the real estate market into the future. While Ripple’s XRP regains its footing, PropiChain investors are set to take over the $300-trillion-plus real estate market. Visit the PropiChain (PCHAIN) website today to join the token presale and become a property owner for as little as $1,000.

ADA & DOGE Price Predictions For 2025",https://thecoinrise.com/0-0248-entry-20-future-can-10-cex-listings-bring-huge-rois-for-blockdag-holders-ada-doge-price-predictions-for-2025/,"The Dogecoin price prediction is heating up, with analysts eyeing a potential leap to $2.50 by 2025. Meanwhile, Cardano’s whale activity is making waves as massive investors push ADA past $1, sparking fresh excitement among traders. But the real buzz is around the BlockDAG (BDAG) Network’s plan to list on 10 centralized exchanges. Analysts predict these CEX listings could be the key for BlockDAG to hit $20 by 2027, making it the top crypto for 2025. Traders are already rushing to lock in BDAG at the current presale batch 27 price of $0.0248 before the listings go live. Dogecoin Price Prediction: What Experts Expect for 2025 Dogecoin price prediction has become a hot topic among analysts as the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve. Recently, popular platforms like Grok shared forecasts for Dogecoin’s trajectory for 2025. Analysts estimate that Dogecoin could soar between $1 and $2.50 by 2025, marking a significant increase from its current price of $0.3611.Grok projects a broader range, with potential highs of $1.445. Despite being 25% below its recent peak of $0.4835, Dogecoin remains a focal point for optimistic investors. As varied DOGE price predictions surface, the possibility of Dogecoin reaching new heights fuels ongoing speculation. Cardano Whale Activity Fuels Surge Past $1 Recent Cardano (ADA) whale activity has drawn significant attention as large-scale investors collectively amassed 100 million ADA tokens over the past two days, propelling the cryptocurrency above the $1 threshold. This whale-driven momentum underscores growing confidence in Cardano’s potential, as their substantial purchases apply upward pressure on prices while attracting additional interest from retail investors. Technically, ADA’s recent breakout aligns with bullish patterns, supported by key indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Fibonacci retracement levels. As the Cardano whale activity increases, ADA’s ability to maintain critical support levels will be crucial in determining whether it can sustain its path toward the anticipated $1.50 milestone. Why 10 CEX Listings Could Push BlockDAG Toward $20 Valuation BlockDAG’s plan to list on 10 centralized exchanges (CEX) is a calculated step toward establishing itself as a significant force in the crypto space. By expanding to multiple tier-two and tier-three exchanges, the coin will gain broader visibility, making it accessible to millions of active traders. Increased liquidity through higher trading volumes is expected to stabilize its market activity, creating smoother transactions and stronger market confidence. As history has shown, major exchange listings often lead to a surge in demand, which naturally places upward pressure on prices. For BlockDAG, this milestone is critical in amplifying its presence and appeal. BlockDAG’s ongoing crypto presale has already highlighted its potential, with over $181.5 million raised and a 2380% increase in price since the first batch. Currently valued at $0.0248 in batch 27, BDAG offers an entry point that reflects its upward momentum while remaining accessible compared to its projected post-listing valuation. This presale success demonstrates strong confidence in the project, setting the stage for the upcoming exchange listings to build on an already solid foundation. With the coin gaining traction before these listings, it offers early supporters a chance to benefit from its growth trajectory. Analysts anticipate that the exchange listings could help propel BDAG toward its forecasted $20 valuation by 2027. In addition to BlockDAG’s upcoming listings and $20 forecast, its scalable technology and expanding global adoption are positioning it as the top crypto for 2025. The combination of enhanced liquidity, broader visibility, and a proven presale track record suggests that the coin is well on its way to achieving long-term success and recognition in the blockchain ecosystem. Which Is the Top Crypto In 2025? Dogecoin price prediction continues to point toward a possible jump to $2.50 by 2025, keeping the coin firmly in analysts’ discussions. The recent Cardano whale activity remains a driving force, with major investors propelling ADA past $1. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is gaining momentum as a top crypto for 2025 . With 10 centralized exchange listings on the horizon, BDAG is poised for unmatched exposure and liquidity, paving the way for its predicted $20 valuation by 2027. Currently valued at a presale batch 27 price of $0.0248, BDAG offers a rare opportunity to secure significant gains before its upcoming listings spark a massive value surge.

This revelation places Trump among the wealthiest cryptocurrency entrepreneurs globally. The statement coincides with Trump’s launch of the TRUMP memecoin, a controversial move that has drawn attention from the crypto community. Cardano Co-Founder Charles Hoskinson Reveals Donald Trump’s Crypto Fortune In a recent post on X , Charles Hoskinson disclosed that a substantial portion of Donald Trump’s wealth is invested in cryptocurrencies. According to Hoskinson, this amounts to 78.5% of Trump’s estimated net worth of $29.6 billion. The revelation establishes Trump as one of the most prominent figures in the cryptocurrency space. Hoskinson noted that Trump’s extensive involvement in crypto could lead to notable changes in the sector. His administration may redefine the IRS’s policies on taxation of capital gains and the evaluation of digital assets’ fair market value. These anticipated changes could shape the crypto industry’s regulatory framework. Charles Hoskinson added, “The nice part of Trump newfound enormous crypto wealth will be changes to the IRS’s interpretation of capital gains and fair market value of crypto.” Notably, Eric Trump also commented on the swift valuation of the $TRUMP memecoin, heralding it as “the hottest digital meme on earth.” He highlighted its rapid market cap increase to over $5 billion within a day of its launch as a testament to its popularity. TRUMP Memecoin Gains $8B in Hours Before Inauguration Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s launch of the TRUMP memecoin has added further intrigue to his financial connection to the crypto world. The meme coin amassed $8 billion in market capitalization within hours of its release. Trump’s company, CIC Digital LLC, reportedly owns 80% of the coin’s supply, positioning it as a lucrative venture. More so, the TRUMP meme coin rally is a key driver pushing SOL price to new all-time highs. This surge highlights growing speculative interest and expands market participation within the Solana ecosystem. The broad appeal of meme coins contributes to the cryptocurrency’s robust valuation. The meme coin rally coincides with Trump’s imminent inauguration as president. However, the timing has sparked ethical concerns, with critics questioning the propriety of a president-elect introducing a profitable product while preparing to assume office. Ripple Lawyer Bill Morgan Comments on Trump’s Crypto Venture Additionally, Ripple lawyer Bill Morgan has commented on how Trump’s promotion of the TRUMP memecoin might influence ongoing legal and regulatory battles. Morgan argued that Trump’s involvement in promoting a speculative digital asset could complicate the SEC’s legal approach, particularly in its case against Ripple and XRP. Morgan pointed out that Trump’s “presidential immunity” might shield him from regulatory scrutiny. However, this raises broader questions about the need for robust crypto regulations. Trump’s actions, combined with his administration’s policy changes will likely shape digital asset oversight moving forward. The Ripple lawyer also added that the appeal against Judge Torres’ decision is promising given the President’s view on token issuance without post-sale obligations. Morgan argued that Ripple’s sales of XRP similarly lacked such obligations. This perspective may reinforce Ripple’s decision to pursue its cross-appeal. The @Ripple appeal of Judge Torres finding against Ripple’s defense that there must be a contract or post sale obligations is looking good. After all the President of the USA thinks a token with no post sale obligations to buyers can be issued and promoted without being… https://t.co/OByrCesd8j — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) January 18, 2025 As Trump prepares to take office, his crypto-focused agenda could redefine the sector’s regulatory environment and influence ongoing legal cases such as the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit. It is worth noting that Charles Hoskinson recently announced upgrades for the Cardano Lace Wallet , aiming to expand its functionality. These enhancements will support its growth and establish it as a leading cryptocurrency wallet in the industry.

In a Jan. 18 post on X, Buterin outlined the goals of this overhaul, which include supporting decentralized application developers and championing decentralization, censorship resistance, and privacy. He emphasized that the Ethereum Foundation would steer clear of political lobbying, ideological agendas, or assuming a central role in the ecosystem’s development. These changes follow a challenging year for the Foundation in 2024, during which its spending, roadmap, and personnel decisions were criticized by members of the Ethereum community. The Ethereum Foundation introduced a conflict of interest policy in May 2024 after prominent researchers took paid advisory roles at the EigenLayer Foundation, which oversees the restaking protocol. Justin Drake, a long-time Ethereum Foundation researcher, accepted such a role in May 2024, followed by Dankrad Feist. Drake later stepped down in November 2024, apologizing to the community and committing to avoid advisory roles, investments, or council positions in the future. In March 2024, Ethereum released the Dencun upgrade, which significantly reduced transaction fees for layer-2 networks by up to 99%. This fee reduction led to a rapid increase in Ethereum layer-2 rollups, with L2Beat reporting 55 such networks currently in operation. However, the proliferation of layer-2 solutions sparked concerns among market participants about cannibalizing revenue on the Ethereum base layer. Data from Token Terminal revealed that base layer revenues plummeted by 99% during the summer of 2024 but eventually recovered to pre-Dencun levels by year-end. As Ethereum continues to evolve, these leadership changes aim to foster a more robust and decentralized ecosystem while addressing challenges faced in 2024.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today,EN,0,0,ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-19 01:36:00

Polkadot leverages parachain auctions to boost developer involvement, while Tron champions staking programs that benefit those in it for the long haul. Yet, it’s BlockDAG ’s LAUNCH300 that’s turning heads by delivering a unique and immediate advantage to its participants. It combines easy access with substantial bonuses, setting itself apart in a crowded market and attracting both individual and institutional interest. BlockDAG: Redefining Incentives with a Bold Approach At the heart of the action, BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300 initiative offers a limited-time 300% bonus for early birds in its presale stage. This isn’t just any perk—it’s a strategic decision aligned with BlockDAG’s pledge to honor buyer confidence. The setup is crafted to maximize immediate returns and encourage ongoing involvement. LAUNCH300 doesn’t play favorites; it levels the playing field for all, fostering an environment where everyone can thrive. The program’s simplicity is its strength, ditching complications like staking or coin locking, providing a clear, upfront benefit that’s both liquid and actionable. Raising over $181 million, LAUNCH300 has carved out new norms for presale perks in the crypto realm, escalating the coin’s value to $0.0248—a whopping 2,380% spike since its debut. This approach isn’t just filling wallets—it’s building a committed and active community around BlockDAG’s expanding ecosystem. Polkadot: Pioneering but Selective Polkadot’s game plan revolves around parachain auctions, which let projects snag slots on its network. While this fosters innovation, it tends to favor those with deeper pockets, often leaving smaller investors out in the cold. The rewards? Locked in for six to 24 months, they’re not exactly liquid, which can be a turnoff for anyone looking for quicker access to their gains. While Polkadot excels at nurturing its ecosystem and ensuring scalability, its focus might be a tad narrow, particularly for regular investors craving more immediate and flexible rewards. Despite its success in cultivating a strong developer base, it’s time for a rethink to keep up with more inclusive, investor-friendly models like BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300. Tron: Loyalty Over Liquidity Over at Tron, the emphasis is on staking rewards and incentives for continued ecosystem engagement—great for promoting long-term stability and participation. Yet, this approach demands a lengthy commitment, which might not sit well with everyone, especially those looking for faster returns. As the network grows, maintaining consistent staking rewards becomes a challenge, possibly affecting the reliability of these incentives. Market Trends & Strategic Shifts The crypto community’s response to BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300 has been nothing short of enthusiastic. Early signs show a robust uptick in presale activity, signaling strong market alignment with the desire for immediate, substantial rewards. By introducing upfront bonuses, BlockDAG may well set a new trend, shaping future incentive strategies across the industry. The standout success of LAUNCH300 poses a significant challenge for Polkadot and Tron, prompting them to revisit their incentive strategies as the market tilts towards offerings that provide quick, tangible benefits. Key Insights BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300 is a bold affirmation of its commitment to community value, clearly outperforming the growth strategies of established networks like Polkadot and Tron. As it continues to smash presale records, BlockDAG is not just on a growth trajectory but is actively redefining participation in the crypto landscape, offering both new and seasoned buyers exciting opportunities to join its success story.

The analyst expects blue-chip assets to struggle in the short term as volatility rises and the Donald Trump administration comes into power. Meanwhile, whales are turning their attention to PropiChain (PCHAIN), an AI-driven altcoin focused on transforming the real estate industry. PropiChain has already raised over $2 million as smart money and retail investors bet big on the low-cap altcoin. The low-cap altcoin has the potential to outshine XRP and Solana. Analyst: XRP Triggers Sell Signal A pundit has indicated that XRP is flashing a sell signal, suggesting a potential correction for the altcoin. XRP has surged 44% in a week, taking its price to $3.27. Its yearly gains have extended to 475%. XRP has reached its highest price since 2018 and is less than 6% away from a new all-time high. The pundit claims that XRP is due for a correction. Bitcoin is already trading below $98K after reaching $100K. However, other analysts say XRP could hit a new peak before plunging to less than $3. PCHAIN: Traders Rush to Undervalued Low Cap Altcoin PropiChain is an undervalued low-cap altcoin attracting savvy investors. It is 200% up in the first two rounds of the presale, with more gains expected after listing on secondary exchanges. The promising altcoin is tipped to outperform XRP, an altcoin calling the shots during the current bull market. Investors are piling cash into the PCHAIN token not only because of its low $0.01 price but because of its potential to transform the real estate market with tokenization and fractional ownership. Real estate tokenization enables PropiChain’s users to buy portions of high-end properties. This allows them to earn passive income through rental income while their investments appreciate. It offers investors the chance to diversify their investments and build generational wealth. The AI features powering PropiChain are a game-changer. With its AI-driven predictive market analysis, the platform’s users have access to future real estate market patterns, helping them make informed decisions. PropiChain’s automated valuation models provide accurate property appraisal, making transactions smoother and more reliable. Buyers and sellers can rely on real-time data, eliminating the guesswork. This makes it easier for real estate deals to be closed quickly. Another important feature is smart contract automation . It handles transactions such as auto-leasing and lease renewals on behalf of landlords and tenants. By automating real estate management, PropiChain eliminates manual work and enhances efficiency. The platform’s smart contracts have been thoroughly audited by BlockAudit, a leading Web3 security firm. This makes the platform safe for users and investors. The addition of a metaverse for virtual property viewing adds a cutting-edge layer to the platform. Investors can walk through properties digitally to improve their decision-making process. Solana Faces DApp Activity Decline Solana’s DApp volumes have dropped by 10%, but strong inflows helped it surge. The layer-1 network regained strength and reached $211, marking a 9.5% gain in the past week. However, an analyst believes that Solana and XRP could face selling pressure that will tank their prices. Solana has also seen a decline in the total value locked (TVL), further fueling the predictions for a short-term correction. Invest in PCHAIN for Insane Returns in Q2 2025 PCHAIN is the best low-cap altcoin to invest in for massive gains in the 2025 bull market. At only $0.01, PropiChain is highly undervalued, allowing investors to make life-change gains. The low-cap altcoin is already up 200% during the first two rounds of the ongoing presale. Whales are rushing to buy the PCHAIN token before the presale is sold out. After listing the PCHAIN token on CoinMarketCap , PropiChain is attracting a new wave of investors keen on earning maximum returns on their investments. This development has solidified PropiChain’s commitment to transparency. If you missed XRP or Solana, this is your chance to invest in a project with unlimited potential. Invest in PCHAIN’s presale today at only $0.01 per token to grow a $1,000 investment into $500K by Q2 2025.

He revealed that the Bitcoin upper hand has moved above $105,400 and hinted at where the flagship crypto could be heading next. What’s Next For Bitcoin Price As Upper Band Moves Above $105,400? In an X post, Severino revealed that Bitcoin’s upper band is now above $105,400. With this development, he alluded to a previous analysis in which he revealed what could happen once the price breaks above $105,400. In the analysis, the crypto analyst mentioned that things could get interesting once BTC breaks above $105,400. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Spikes To Nearly $5 Billion – Impact On Price He then predicted that Bitcoin could rally to as high as $170,000. The analyst made this prediction while revealing how BTC witnessed a 90% surge from the wick low at the lower band to the local high. This happened the last time the flagship crypto got a head fake to the lower band before moving to the upper band. Based on this trend, Severino believes the Bitcoin price could record another 90% surge and rally to as high as $170,000. This price target is significant as it could mark the top for the flagship crypto. The crypto analyst mentioned that the cycle top for Bitcoin can be discussed once BTC reaches this $170,000 target. However, market experts like Standard Chartered have suggested that Bitcoin could rally beyond this $170,000 target. The financial institution predicted that a rally to $200,000 by year-end is achievable. Bernstein analysts also described a rally to $200,000 by year-end as conservative, meaning Bitcoin could rally higher. This bullish outlook for Bitcoin mainly stems from the fact that Donald Trump is set to take office on January 20. The pro-crypto US president-elect is expected to implement a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for the country, which will boost the flagship crypto’s adoption. BTC Not Far Away From A New All-Time High Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has suggested that Bitcoin will soon reach a new all-time high (ATH). In an X post, he stated that BTC is one daily resistance away from breaking out to a new ATH yet again. The crypto analyst added that a daily close above the final resistance followed by a post-breakout retest would be enough to launch the flagship crypto into price discovery. Until then, Rekt Capital mentioned that Bitcoin would continue to range between $101,000 and $106,000. Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto offered a more optimistic outlook for the BTC, stating that the flagship crypto has started its rally. He remarked that, as anticipated, the crypto has broken through resistance and is now primed for a strong rally.

Trump Buys Solana (TRUMPSOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Buys Solana launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Buys Solana by entering its contract address – 8Ruz6rzYPpKHActX3jo49v8WBhiJ5KsGM6dyCghQj3i – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SOL|SHIB|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-19 02:22:00

Currently valued at approximately $3.23, XRP is positioned among the most robust performers in the cryptocurrency market, boasting an impressive 43% gain over the past month. This price resurgence has propelled the market’s second-largest altcoin to a seven-year high, inching closer to its previous price record of $3.40, set in 2018. Bullish Projections For XRP Price In a recent social media update on X (Formerly Twitter), market analyst Ali Martinez highlights the significance of XRP’s recent breakout from a month-long consolidation phase between $1.90 and $2.60. Martinez notes that this price breakout has occurred within a symmetrical triangle pattern on the weekly chart, suggesting an optimistic trajectory for the altcoin. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Double Holdings To 43% Post-Merge – Details The analyst projects a possible price target of $15 for XRP, which would represent a staggering increase of over 365% from its current valuation. Supporting this bullish outlook, XForceGlobal proposed a range of final targets for XRP, estimating potential prices between $7 and $12, with more ambitious projections reaching $20 to $40 and two potential routes for the altcoin’s price: Slower Route: This scenario anticipates a five-wave minor degree into an intermediate degree wave, followed by a wave 1-2 pullback. If XRP can manage a controlled pullback in this phase, it would create a favorable environment for further bullish action. While this route may involve a deeper correction, the analyst asserts it ultimately promises the greatest rewards for long-term holders. Faster Route: In this scenario, the current five-wave ascent may already be part of a larger primary wave 5. While this route could still lead XRP to significant price levels around $7 to $12, it also suggests that the bull market may soon reach its conclusion. Expert Warns Of Potential Correction March Despite the optimistic projections, some experts, like Egrag Crypto, caution investors to remain vigilant. Egrag predicts a significant market correction could occur in March 2025. However, the expert also emphasizes that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains bullish, indicating that XRP still has room for growth in the short term. He anticipates that XRP may reach price levels between $4 and $5 before any potential downturn.

Whether through slower or faster routes, the future looks bright for XRP holders, provided they navigate the anticipated volatility with care.

Deaton has urged for an end to the “crypto wars” led by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Deaton’s statement follows a series of high-profile legal battles involving major entities such as Ripple, LBRY, Coinbase, and others, which he argues have consumed substantial resources without addressing substantive fraud. John Deaton Urges US Regulators to Drop Ongoing Crypto Cases In a lengthy post on X, John Deaton, an attorney known for his support of Ripple and other crypto companies, vocalized his frustration with the ongoing regulatory actions by the US SEC. Deaton highlighted several cases where crypto companies have faced legal challenges and financial burdens despite not being accused of fraud. He argued that these cases have drained company resources and impacted the crypto industry negatively. Additionally, John Deaton pointed out several instances where companies incurred substantial losses due to legal battles with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Notably, he mentioned that Ripple had spent over $150 million on legal fees in a case that did not involve any fraud allegations. This situation has affected Ripple’s operations and influenced its partnerships and market activities, with consequences for XRP holders. The Pro-XRP Lawyer added, “Having filed amicus briefs in the Ripple, LBRY, and Coinbase cases, representing users, developers, individual investors, and content providers, I’m sitting here thinking about the incredible waste of time, energy, money, and resources wasted during the last 4 years.” Despite John Deaton’s call for a reduction in aggressive SEC actions, the regulator continues its strict oversight. Recently, the US SEC sued Digital Currency Group , citing failure to disclose risks tied to Three Arrows Capital, resulting in a $38 million settlement. Impact on Companies and Innovation Further illustrating the impact of US SEC actions, Deaton referenced the case of LBRY, a platform that was shut down by the SEC without any fraud charges. The closure led to job losses and financial setbacks for its founder, Jeremy Kauffman. John Deaton emphasized, “NO FRAUD was committed or even alleged. There was a very active LBRY community and ecosystem of users and content providers utilizing the platform. LBRY employees lost jobs. An American entrepreneur, Jeremy Kauffman, lost millions due to legal fees.” Additionally, despite Kraken’s attempt to settle by paying a $30M fine, the platform faced subsequent lawsuits, showing a pattern of aggressive regulatory pursuits. According to the Pro-XRP Lawyer, these moves threaten innovation and the growth of the crypto sector. Reevaluation of SEC’s Approach To Crypto Regulations John Deaton’s appeals reflect a growing concern within the crypto community about how the US SEC handles cryptocurrency regulations. The legal expert suggests that a balanced approach would support the development of the crypto industry and uphold the integrity of regulatory practices. In addition, other crypto leaders have also voiced their perspectives as Gary Gensler departs from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Most recently, Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty openly mocked Gensler’s exit, signaling a potentially transformative shift in SEC’s crypto enforcement. Despite criticism from figures like John Deaton, outgoing Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler insists on the necessity of strict regulatory oversight for the crypto market. He emphasizes the importance of enforcement actions to safeguard investors from risks in the crypto industry.

BTFD is the Top New Meme Coin to Buy Today with its Phenomenal Referral Program,https://thecoinrise.com/worried-about-missing-neiro-btfd-is-the-top-new-meme-coin-to-buy-today-with-its-phenomenal-referral-program/,"Meme coins have come a long way since Dogecoin and Shiba Inu first stole the spotlight. What started as a playful twist on cryptocurrency has evolved into a serious investment opportunity for people looking to capitalize on short-term gains. And let’s be real—everyone loves a good underdog story, especially when it’s tied to major profits. Today, two fresh players in the meme coin space are creating buzz: BTFD Coin (BTFD) and Neiro (NEIRO) . These coins don’t just bank on internet culture; they’ve got innovative features, real-world utility, and wild community support. If you’re hunting for the top new meme coins to buy today , you’re gonna want to stick around for this breakdown. And hey, if you’re worried about missing out on NEIRO, let’s pump the brakes on that FOMO. BTFD Coin’s unique perks—like its P2E game, referral program, and massive 90% APY staking rewards—make it a killer choice for investors chasing high returns. Plus, its presale performance has been nothing short of legendary. So, let’s dive in and find out why these coins are worth your attention. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolution If you haven’t heard of BTFD Coin yet, you might be living under a rock. This meme coin has taken the market by storm with its innovative ecosystem. It’s more than just a coin; it’s a movement built around features like P2E gaming, staking rewards, and a robust referral program. And let’s talk about those staking rewards for a sec—90% APY! That’s unheard of in the crypto world and a game-changer for anyone looking to make serious passive income. BTFD’s referral program deserves a standing ovation. Picture this: every time you refer a friend, you’re earning extra BTFD. It’s like getting rewarded for spreading the word about something you’re already hyped about. And with the coin’s presale picking up speed, those rewards are stacking up fast. This program isn’t just about referrals; it’s about building a community—a “Bulls Squad,” if you will. The Bulls Squad is BTFD’s elite group of supporters who get access to exclusive content, early updates, and even better earning opportunities. Imagine being part of a crypto family that’s growing wealth together. Speaking of wealth, BTFD’s presale has been on fire. It started at a humble $0.000004 per coin and is currently priced at $0.000142 in Stage 13. Over $5.2 million has been raised so far, with 64 billion coins sold to over 8,600 holders. Crypto analysts are predicting a post-presale price of $0.0006, which means huge potential gains for early investors. Let’s break it down with some real numbers. If you invested $7,500 at the current price of $0.000142, you’d snag around 52,816,901 BTFD coins. When the price hits $0.0006, your investment balloons to over $31,690. Talk about a solid ROI. The best part? Joining the presale is ridiculously easy. Head to the presale page , connect your wallet, input your purchase amount, and confirm the transaction. In just a few clicks, you’re in the game. Don’t sleep on this—the presale is already in Stage 13 of 16, and coins are flying off the shelves. It’s not just a coin; it’s an opportunity to be part of something bigger. Ready to make moves? Neiro: A Fresh Contender in the Meme Coin Scene On the flip side, we’ve got Neiro (NEIRO), a meme coin with its own unique spin. NEIRO’s pitch? Merging cutting-edge AI with the playful charm of meme coins. It’s like your favorite meme coin went to a fancy coding bootcamp. Neiro’s ecosystem is designed around AI-powered analytics and community-driven decision-making, which sounds fancy—and it is—but it’s also super practical for crypto enthusiasts who want more than just hype. One of NEIRO’s standout features is its AI-driven trading assistant. Imagine having a virtual assistant that analyzes market trends and helps you make better trading decisions. It’s like having a crypto guru in your pocket. This isn’t just some gimmick; it’s a tool that’s making NEIRO a serious contender in the meme coin space. And let’s not forget the coin’s community governance model. Holders get to vote on key project decisions, making it a truly decentralized experience. The coin’s presale has also been making waves, with early investors already seeing impressive returns. Crypto analysts are optimistic about NEIRO’s future, with some predicting a 10x increase in value by the end of the year. That kind of growth potential puts NEIRO firmly in the “top new meme coins to buy today” category. Sure, it’s not as flashy as BTFD’s presale performance, but NEIRO’s focus on long-term utility and community engagement makes it a solid choice for investors looking for stability and innovation. But here’s the kicker: while NEIRO’s AI features are cool, it lacks the immediate rewards and FOMO factor that BTFD offers. If you’re all about building wealth and having fun while doing it, BTFD might still be the better pick. That said, NEIRO’s commitment to innovation means it’s not one to overlook. If you’re looking to diversify your portfolio, adding a bit of NEIRO could be a smart move. Conclusion So, what’s the verdict? Both BTFD and NEIRO are making serious waves in the crypto world, but they cater to slightly different crowds. BTFD is all about that short-term gain, with insane presale performance, staking rewards, and a community-driven ecosystem that’s impossible to ignore. It’s the kind of coin that makes you wanna shout, “Take my money!” Meanwhile, NEIRO brings a unique blend of meme culture and AI-driven utility, making it perfect for investors who value innovation and long-term potential. Here’s the thing: you don’t have to choose one or the other. Why not invest in both and cover your bases? But if you’re itching to act fast, BTFD’s presale is where the excitement’s at. With a listing price of $0.0006 and analysts predicting big things, now’s the time to join the movement. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the Bulls Squad and make serious gains. Make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity with the BTFD Coin presale .

One major crypto whale took advantage of the situation and bought 860,895 TRUMP tokens for $12 million at an average price of $13.94, as revealed by Lookonchain. A whale dumped 860,895 $TRUMP for 23.8M $USDC just now.

At the same time, there were reports that Trump’s team sold $500 million worth of tokens, maintaining control of 85% of total tokens. This revelation has raised issues of market manipulation as well as the future of the coin. A wave of high-profile trades The token’s meteoric rise has attracted several high-profile traders to the token. Lookonchain also reported that a wallet called “LeBron” exchanged $1 million USDC and bought 4.52 million TRUMP tokens within the first 5 minutes of the launch, and the investment grew to over $2 million. Another trader made headlines after turning $1.1 million into $70 million within four hours. The individual sold 1.35m TRUMP tokens for 3.65m USDC while holding on to 4.62m tokens worth $67.5m.

By selling part of their holding for $812,000, they made a profit of more than $3.7 million. Market activity was also boosted by large investors, or ‘whales’. One whale moved 61,205 SOL — which is more than $14.3 million — from OKX to buy 1.27 million TRUMP tokens. Another also used 8.5 million USDC to buy 1.03 million tokens at an average price of $8.28. Even with the sharp selloff, TRUMP surged to a record high of $35, then pulled back slightly. Currently, the token is priced at $26.72 and has risen dramatically by 328% in the last day. However, only 200 million of the total 1 billion tokens are currently in circulation, which raises the question of how further token emissions can affect the market. Trump enters the cryptocurrency market The project was revealed by Trump on his social media pages with the token intended to represent triumph and recovery. “My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!” he wrote. The coin’s official website refers to it as a symbolic digital asset with no utility, meaning, or use as a medium of exchange or a store of value. As reported by Cryptopolitan, concerns have been raised over this particular token’s authenticity, especially due to its close association with Trump. As of this writing, its market capitalization has reached almost $6 billion, as shown by CoinMarketCap.The proposed plan of the project is to release 800 million more tokens in the next three years, which has raised concerns regarding the pressure that it will have on the prices.

Donald Trump the Bull (DONBULL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONBULL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Trump the Bull can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Trump the Bull could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Trump the Bull launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Trump the Bull on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Donald Trump the Bull by entering its contract address – AmgaL1uuQ97qJoXfUUxdHipLJmVd3toChivEBiSFn7MW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONBULL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|TRADING|DOGE|SOL|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-19 03:50:00

Many suspect Ripple and Lumen have new competition on the horizon. With Ripple (XRP) currently near $3.28 and Lumen (XLM) around $0.17, both have been top picks for rapid transactions. Yet a fresh project called Remittix is making waves, offering a PayFi model that could upend older networks. Below, you’ll see why Remittix (RTX) draws so much attention and how it challenges traditional giants like Lumen and Ripple. Stellar (XLM) Chases New Heights with On-Chain Analytics Stellar, often called Stellar (XLM), trades around $0.43, posting an 18.50% jump in the past week and 11% in the last 30 days. Recently, Stellar teamed up with Nansen AI to offer in-depth on-chain analytics. This partnership lets Stellar investors and developers access real-time data about wallet behavior, transactions, and overall network health. Many see it as a big step toward building trust since clearer insights can encourage more people to adopt Stellar’s blockchain. Fans hope this data boost will bring fresh energy to XLM, which often competes with other payment-focused tokens. If stellar performance data attracts major partners or traders, Stellar (XLM) might ride higher, reinforcing its position among well-known cross-border coins. Critics, though, say XLM still needs broader commercial usage to stand out in a crowded market. Regardless, Stellar’s new analytics push could be exactly what it needs to keep drawing attention—and possibly new investments. Ripple (XRP) Surges to 7-Year High Momentum Ripple trades around $3.26, posting a 40% climb over the last week and a 28% gain this past month. Ripple (XRP) has seen its strongest price uptrend since early 2018, fueled by the SEC’s recent move to appeal a court ruling that stated XRP wasn’t sold as an unregistered security. Market watchers note that Ripple’s market cap hit $175 billion, surpassing financial giant BlackRock’s $156.9 billion mark. Analysts highlight XRP’s fastest growth in years, with the token’s 14-month RSI hitting 92—its highest since October 2017. This level of momentum suggests XRP might keep climbing if regulatory developments tilt in Ripple’s favor. Still, skeptics warn that any unfavorable court action could stall its progress, reminding investors that legal twists can shift sentiment fast. However, Ripple (XRP) appears poised for more upside if the bullish wave continues. Remittix Gains Traction as Stellar (XLM) and Ripple (XRP) Soar Even though Stellar (XLM) and Ripple (XRP) have reached new highs recently, many analysts still think Remittix has a bigger advantage. They believe Remittix (RTX) is the one coin focusing on quick, no-hassle solutions for moving funds globally. A jump from $0.0199 to $0.0217 in its presale, plus 195 million tokens sold and over $3.5 million raised, shows buyers’ eagerness for a PayFi coin that goes beyond hype. With Stellar (XLM) and Ripple (XRP) each counting on institutional or corporate deals, Remittix zeros in on everyday use: let people send or receive money without hidden fees, converting crypto to fiat in a snap. Why Remittix (RTX) Could Outclass Older Payment Tokens Both Stellar (XLM) and Ripple (XRP) chase large-scale adoption, but top analysts argue that Remittix stands out by helping regular users, not just banks or big partners. Remittix’s Pay API offers a straightforward way for merchants to accept crypto and settle in fiat without complicated steps—something that truly matters to day-to-day businesses. If you stack that against XLM and XRP, neither token directly solves real-world payment headaches for the average person. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) addresses cross-border fees and slow processing right from the start, aiming to mainstream crypto payments. That’s why many think Remittix could outshine legacy tokens, luring traders and the people who simply want cheaper, faster transactions without needing a deep understanding of blockchain. .

XYZVerse, Ripple, Solana, and Dogecoin are attracting attention for their unique qualities and growth prospects. This article examines what sets them apart and why they might be key considerations for those planning ahead. Score Big with XYZ: The New Meme Coin Heavyweight The fans are losing it! The XYZ token is in the crypto ring, landing blows on the competition – bullshit coins, worthless farming schemes, and scam projects. Like a true champ, this first-ever all-sports meme token has fought its way through the bear market with fearless momentum and shows no signs of slowing down. With eyes set on a roaring 75X growth , XYZ is destined to leave the 2024 meme coin triumphants like BOME and WIF trailing in its wake. Own the field, earn while the crowd plays XYZ is creating the ultimate playing field with the award-winning XYZVerse , recognized as the Best NEW Meme Project . Its unique concept marries the thrill of sports with the energy of meme culture.

Remember Polymarket’s massive $1 billion trading volume during the US election betting fever? XYZ is gearing up for an even bigger win in the GameFi arena, letting its stakeholders cash in on the perfect combo of meme coin vibes, sports hype, and crypto mass adoption. Missed meme coin supercycle? By capitalizing on the ever-expanding gambling niche, XYZ is set to become the G.O.A.T of meme coins . BOME’s 5,000% takeoff and WIF’s 1,000% year-to-date rally are now relics of the past because XYZ is set to explode by over 7,400% from its current price by the TGE and outshine its sensational predecessors.

Dogecoin: From Meme to Major Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) was launched in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies. It features the Shiba Inu dog from the “Doge” meme as its logo. Unlike some cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin has no maximum supply limit. Ten thousand new coins are mined every minute, making it abundant. Initially considered a joke, it gained popularity due to its fun approach and active community. In 2021, Dogecoin’s value surged, placing it among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This rise was partly influenced by social media and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Its technology is based on the Litecoin blockchain, providing fast transaction times. Dogecoin’s current market position reflects its strong community support. Whether it is attractive in the current market cycle depends on various factors, including market trends and investor sentiment. Solana and SOL: A High-Performance Blockchain Platform Solana is a blockchain platform designed for scalability and speed, providing a foundation for decentralized applications (dapps). It competes with platforms like Ethereum and Cardano by offering faster transactions and flexible development options across multiple programming languages. SOL is the native cryptocurrency of Solana, playing a central role in its ecosystem. It facilitates transactions, powers custom programs, and rewards network supporters. The SOL coin holds value by underpinning the operation of the Solana ecosystem. It rewards participants and grants users access to a variety of projects on the platform. Unlike some other blockchains, Solana does not use sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. Instead, it focuses on a high-capacity network capable of hosting products and services with high activity levels. This approach may attract developers and users seeking efficient and scalable blockchain solutions. The attractiveness of SOL in the current market cycle depends on various factors, including market conditions and individual perspectives. XRP: A Fast, Low-Cost Cryptocurrency for Borderless Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency supported by the XRP Ledger, designed to enable fast, low-cost, and borderless transactions. It operates on a decentralized system without a central authority, making transactions secure and irreversible. XRP is digitally native and programmable, resistant to censorship or counterfeiting, and does not require a bank account for settlements. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with an initial supply of 100 billion tokens. XRP aims to facilitate seamless payment transfers across various currencies, enhancing network liquidity and supporting the ecosystem. Ripple, initially known as OpenCoin Inc., was gifted 80 billion XRP for further development and placed 55 billion XRP in escrow to control the supply release. The technology behind XRP allows for quick settlement times and low transaction costs, which can benefit cross-border payments. In the current market cycle, XRP’s focus on speed and efficiency may appeal to users and institutions seeking reliable and cost-effective transaction solutions. Conclusion In the 2025 bull run, DOGE, SOL, and XRP show strong potential, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out by uniting sports fans globally and aiming for massive growth as a cultural icon.

The post , shared on his X account (formerly Twitter), portrays XRP as a token primed for significant growth. The GIF, created by eToro, a multi-asset trading platform, illustrates XRP’s mascot propelling toward the moon. This imagery aligns with the widespread belief in crypto that an asset described as “going to the moon” is expected to experience a substantial price increase. Portnoy’s post has garnered significant attention, amassing over a million views and more than 12,000 likes since it was published. With a following of over 3 million on X, Portnoy’s influence in sparking discussions on XRP’s potential has not gone unnoticed. pic.twitter.com/inLxvk1srs — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) January 15, 2025 Portnoy’s Involvement with XRP Portnoy’s engagement with XRP dates back to last year when he revealed his investment in the token. During a live stream for his “Davey Day Trader Global” series, he disclosed owning approximately $1.3 million worth of XRP. This announcement was warmly received by the XRP community , with individuals like Abs from Good Morning Crypto referring to him as an “official XRP Army Member.” XRP’s Market Performance Portnoy’s recent post coincides with a notable rally in XRP’s price. The cryptocurrency surpassed the $3 mark yesterday, a milestone it last achieved in 2018. XRP climbed to a high of $3.39 before stabilizing below $3.20. At the time of writing, XRP is valued at $3.28 reflecting a 1.40% increase in the past 24 hours. The asset’s market capitalization has also surged, reaching $188.7 billion. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s remarkable performance can be traced back to November, following Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Since then, XRP has gained over 500%, rising from approximately $0.49 to its current levels. Market speculation suggests the incoming administration might intervene in the legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty has shared updates hinting at the possibility of the lawsuit’s dismissal, fueling optimism among investors. The renewed confidence in XRP, amplified by figures like Portnoy, underscores the growing belief in the token’s potential for long-term gains. As legal uncertainties surrounding Ripple’s case with the SEC appear closer to resolution, market sentiment continues to strengthen.

This marks the first publicly known case in Russia of using digital currency to fund a military group. Crypto-Funding to Ukrainian Army A resident of the Mirninsky District in Yakutia has been sentenced to seven years in a maximum-security penal colony for financially supporting a Ukrainian terrorist organization, the FSB Directorate for the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) reported on January 14. The individual, an employee of a diamond mining company, was found guilty of transferring funds to Ukrainian forces via cryptocurrency. The financial assistance was directed toward a unit of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), aiding their reconnaissance and subversive activities against Russian security interests. The investigation revealed that the offender joined a terrorist organization group on a social network, where he received detailed instructions from Ukrainian curators on how to transfer the funds to a designated cryptocurrency wallet. This sentencing follows an earlier report on January 10, where a resident of Yenakiyevo in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) was detained on charges of treason. The detainee was accused of repeatedly transferring money to electronic accounts that funded Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel. This decision comes in the wake of a related case where a Russian national was apprehended for funding digital accounts linked to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Russia’s Crypto Embrace Amidst a global push for Bitcoin adoption, Anton Tkachev, a State Duma deputy from the New People Party, formally proposed establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve in Russia in December. Meanwhile, domestic firms have already started utilizing Bitcoin and other digital assets for international payments, which is enabled by recent legislative adjustments designed to offset Western sanctions. These moves align with President Vladimir Putin’s earlier statement wherein he highlighted Bitcoin’s resistance to global regulation and indicated his endorsement of cryptocurrencies, linking the asset class’s rise to the declining role of the US dollar as a reserve currency due to its political use.

In a tweet that has sparked widespread discussion, King underscored Ripple’s growing influence in the financial technology sector and its long-term vision to reshape the industry. King’s tweet emphasized Ripple’s significant investment—over $100 million—in its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to prove that XRP is not a security. With this legal victory secured, Ripple is now poised to expand its operations aggressively. Many still view Ripple as a payments company, but King argues this perception is outdated. Ripple is now a serious competitor to major fintech companies like Stripe and PayPal. Ripple spent over $100,000,000 to prove that $XRP is not a security — now they are switching from defense to offense. Most people still think this is just a payments company — and they couldn't be more wrong. Here is what you should know as $XRP enters this next phase: pic.twitter.com/NscK4mtYX8 — Austin King (@0xASK) January 17, 2025 Ripple’s Strategy: Building, Not Improving According to King, Ripple’s 10-year strategy has been to build an entirely new financial infrastructure rather than improving existing systems. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is a testament to this vision, designed to facilitate fast, low-cost payments while offering scalability and versatility for tokenization. King asserts that this approach sets Ripple apart from its competitors, who remain entrenched in legacy systems. Ripple’s ambition extends far beyond the $500 billion fintech market. The company is focusing on tokenization, a burgeoning sector with the potential to transform trillions of dollars in assets. In the U.S. alone, over $55 trillion in assets could be tokenized, offering immense growth opportunities. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Tokenization: The Next Frontier Tokenization converts physical and traditional financial assets into digital tokens on a blockchain. The XRP Ledger is optimized for such applications, making it a strong contender for leading the tokenization market. However, Ripple recognizes the importance of collaboration and interoperability in achieving this goal. King revealed that Ripple works with partner networks, such as Omni Network, to distribute tokenized assets across the broader blockchain ecosystem. Omni Network aims to enhance the XRP Ledger’s capabilities by designing mechanisms to allow XRP to collect fees from transactions on other chains, further increasing its utility and adoption. Ripple’s Impact on the Fintech Industry Ripple’s advancements are prompting responses from established fintech players. Companies like Stripe and PayPal are expanding their product offerings and making billion-dollar acquisitions to counter XRP’s growing influence. This competition underscores Ripple’s disruptive potential in the industry. As King notes, Ripple’s ability to execute its vision is rooted in its focus on innovation and partnerships. By leveraging the XRP Ledger’s unique capabilities, Ripple aims to dominate the tokenization market and position itself as a leader in the next wave of blockchain applications. As Ripple continues to evolve, stakeholders in the crypto and fintech sectors should closely monitor its developments.

Despite this notable interest, XLM’s price has been struggling over the past few days following its bullish breakout. On January 15, 2025, XLM broke out from a bullish inverted head-and-shoulders price action pattern. Since then, the price has entered a consolidation phase. Long-term holders appear to be consistently accumulating, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . $20 Million XLM Worth XLM Outflow Data from spot inflow and outflow analysis reveals that exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of $20 million worth of XLM over the past three days. This substantial outflow, following a bullish breakout, is considered an ideal opportunity. Source: Coinglass In cryptocurrency, outflow refers to the transfer of assets from exchanges to wallets, indicating potential accumulation. This can create significant buying pressure and drive further upward price momentum. XLM Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, XLM appears bullish but is currently stuck in consolidation. Based on recent and historical price momentum, if XLM breaks out of this consolidation and closes a daily candle above the $0.50 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 25% to reach the $0.65 level in the future. Source: Trading View On the positive side, XLM’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains below the overbought zone, indicating that the asset has ample room for significant upward movement. Current Price Momentum At press time, XLM is trading near $0.48 and has experienced a price surge of over 2% in the past 24 hours. Additionally, its trading volume has increased by 5% during the same period, indicating growing interest from investors and traders, which could potentially drive XLM’s price higher.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|XLM|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-19 04:39:54

With Solana reaching new all-time highs and XRP making gains, there’s a lot of bullish momemtum. XRP continues to consolidate just below its all-time high, which isn’t surprising as it may take some time before the price breaks and sustains above this level. The key support levels for XRP remain defined between $2.52 and $2.94, and these levels are still valid. At the moment, XRP is experiencing a pullback, which is a natural part of any price movement and could present an opportunity for future growth. Key Support Levels: At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.21 and is down by more than one percent in the last 24 hours. However, the altcoin has gained an impressive 25 percent in the last week. The retracement levels are expected to reach between the 38.2% and 78.6% Fibonacci levels, with support areas at $2.94, $2.81, $2.68, and $2.52. Possible Outcomes: In terms of possible outcomes, if Wave A extends slightly lower, it would still be part of a healthy three-wave move down. A bounce from these levels would likely be corrective in nature, leading to another dip before a potential rally. Looking ahead, if XRP breaks above $3.39 or $3.40, we could see prices move toward the next major Fibonacci level, possibly reaching $4.19 or even $5. However, if the price falls below $2.52, it would invalidate the bullish structure. Conclusion: The latest market data shows XRP holding a strong position with a market cap of over $180 billion. Despite a recent 7% dip, many see this as a buying opportunity for long-term gains. As the inauguration draws closer and Trump’s influence in the crypto space increases, some experts predict significant price movements ahead.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-19 04:43:23

While other cryptocurrencies like XRP and Bitcoin (BTC) recorded massive gains in this bull market, Cardano (ADA) maintained a relatively muted price last year, experiencing significant volatility. Despite this, analysts remain bullish on ADA, emphasizing its potential for a substantial price recovery and a surge to new ATHs. Cardano Price Targets $6 ATH Ali Martinez, a prominent crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), shared a bullish price prediction for Cardano, forecasting a massive surge to $6. The analyst compared the similarities in ADA’s current price movement to historical patterns. He shared two parallel price charts of Cardano depicting its price action from 2018 to 2021 and 2022 to 2025. Related Reading: Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts Dogecoin Price From January To December 2025 In the left chart, ADA traded within a sideways accumulation zone, highlighted by the rectangular box, before experiencing a breakout above $0.14. Following the breakout, Cardano’s price corrected by about 43.6%, a massive decline that pushed its value below the $0.1 mark. As is often seen among cryptocurrencies, Cardano’s significant price crash established a solid foundation for a notable rally. After its substantial decline, the cryptocurrency initiated a significant price rally, reaching a peak of approximately $3.08. This remarkable price surge represented a gain of over 4,095%. In the right chart, Martinez identifies a similar sideways accumulation pattern between 2022 and 2023 of this year’s bullish cycle. Following this, Cardano broke out to reach a new price high of $0.8. After this, the altcoin underwent a 42.65%, mirroring the crash in 2021. Based on the historical fractal, Martinez predicts that Cardano could soon initiate its second leg up, potentially mimicking its impressive price rally in 2021 within the next two to three weeks. As a result, the analyst has set a bullish target for Cardano at above $6, marking a significant gain of 2,220.68%. While historical patterns do not accurately predict future price movements, they can provide insights into market trends, conditions, and other factors. Martinez’s bullish prediction for the Cardano price relies on the assumption that it can repeat similar market behavior and conditions during its 2021 bull rally. Related Reading: XRP Price Rallies To ATH At $3.4, Here’s What’s Driving It And Why The Pump Will Continue Update On ADA Price Analysis As mentioned earlier, the Cardano price declined severely last year despite bullish sentiment spreading to other altcoins in the market. In the last few weeks, ADA seemed to be recovering from bearish trends, as CoinMarketCap’s data showed a price increase of 16% over the past week. Cardano also experienced notable price gains in the last month, rising by over 10%. Although its price has reclaimed its $1 mark, ADA’s momentum seems to be fading, as the cryptocurrency has pulled back, recording a decline of 4% over the last 24 hours.

According to Fox Business, within 24 hours, the value of $TRUMP skyrocketed from just a few cents to $33.87, marking an incredible gain of over 18,000%. Adding to the excitement, Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the U.S., announced that it would list the $TRUMP coin.

The $TRUMP website reveals that 80% of the coin is controlled by CIC Digital, an affiliate of the Trump Organization, along with a co-owned entity called Fight Fight Fight. Coinciding with Trump’s upcoming inauguration, the meme coin’s release has sparked further interest as speculation grows around what role the new administration will play in the future of cryptocurrency. Trump is reportedly planning to issue executive orders related to Bitcoin and the broader crypto industry on his first day in office or shortly thereafter. One of the key points of his campaign was to advocate for a more relaxed regulatory approach to digital currencies. Additionally, Trump has discussed the possibility of creating a Bitcoin strategic reserve as part of his crypto policy. As Trump prepares to step into office, the crypto world is eagerly awaiting how his policies may shape the future of digital assets. $TRUMP’s dramatic launch is just the beginning, and many are watching closely to see what other developments unfold in the coming days.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-19 05:04:48

Musk Kills Bears (MUSKBEAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBEAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Kills Bears can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Kills Bears could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Kills Bears launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Kills Bears on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Kills Bears by entering its contract address – 9yoxPCyAdEVRfAtkztzC7yKuhy7vEEEjXm3Ym8ajJEww – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBEAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|SOL|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-19 05:13:00

While the likes of Solana and Dogecoin have dominated the market for a long time, newer DeFi tokens like Elluminex could outrank both in the coming week. Elluminex is a next-generation DeFi project that has come to redefine how crypto transactions are executed. Projected to launch on TON blockchain, It will address issues related to fragmented liquidity, high gas fees, and complex interfaces inherent in the DeFi landscape. Expert Predicts $4 Milestone For XRP, Once Key Resistance Level Is Broken The Ripple price chart shows that the altcoin is experiencing a market correction that opens the door to buying the dip. For Ali Chart , an on-chain analyst on X, the XRP token has been consolidating in the current bull flag for a while, and should it pass the $2.60 resistance level, it will head to $4. Based on data from CoinMarketCap , XRP price has already soared by 116% in the past month. Although the price dipped by 3% a few days ago, XRP trading volume is up by 37%, a signal of an impending bullish rally. As per Tradingview , XRP crypto currently trades above the 50-day SMA, with its 14-day RSI showing 66. Given that the XRP market sentiment is bullish, if the XRP crypto price should pass the $2.70, $2.84, and $2.97 resistance zone, the altcoin price will likely head towards the $4 next target. Solana Coin Sees Temporary Dip, But Trading Volume Surges By 41% Although the Solana token price has dipped in the past weeks, investors remain optimistic of a market rally in the coming weeks. According to CoinMarketCap , Solana’s price declined 10% in the past month and a further 3% in the past 7 days. However, the Solana trading volume has increased by over 25% in the past 24 hours due to the increasing whale accumulation. A crypto trader on X, Allien Ovich , believes Solana’s price could turn higher despite trading within a downtrend channel. According to the tweet, when Solana crypto breaks above $227.5, it can only go higher. However, despite the bullish outlook, Solana’s market sentiment remains neutral. Also, Solana recorded 13 green days in the past month, which is a concern for most holders. Although Solana is struggling to stay above the crucial $220 support zone, the growing adoption of the Solana blockchain makes it one of the altcoins to watch in the coming weeks. Investors Eyeing Dogecoin Breakout Towards $1 Mark Dogecoin (DOGE) has failed to capitalize on Bitcoin’s recent bullish rally as the meme coin price continues to drop. Dogecoin price plummeted by 2% in the past week, as per CoinMarketCap , and 3% some days ago. This means this coin is undergoing correction, which could be a good time to buy. While analysing the Dogecoin price chart on X, Andrew Griffiths claims that Dogecoin is currently building upward momentum. Using the 4-hour Heikin Ashi Chart, Andrew projects bullish momentum for the Dogecoin crypto, which could pave the way for a rally toward $0.54. Meanwhile, Dogecoin market sentiment is bearish despite price volatility of 4%.key oscillators such as Awesome Oscillator (5, 34) and VWMA (10) are flashing sell signals; however, Coincodex projects a massive 226% price gain in the short term. Elluminex: A Top DeFi Project Projected For Massive Rise Based on data by Mordor Intelligence , the DeFi market size is projected to hit $78B by 2029. To improve the DeFi space and harness its full potential, Elluminex (ELX) is launching a new DeFi hub on the TON blockchain, which will address major issues relating to interoperability, scalability and security that users face in the DeFi industry. The new DeFi protocol is designed to connect isolated blockchains while offering users a high level of liquidity that is hard to match by other platforms. Through the Elluminex decentralized exchange, users will be able to trade seamlessly with little or no slippage and earn profits. The Elluminex ecosystem is designed with advanced trading features, like the AI portfolio tracker, which provides real-time data and analytics, allowing traders to trade with insight and earn rewards all from one place. Outside of that, there is an educational platform designed to enhance users’ understanding of the DeFi industry. Elluminex aims to leverage the TON blockchain to develop a platform which allows users to trade, stake, farm, bridge and track their portfolio with ease. Given the limited 350M total supply and the deflationary mechanism, the Elluminex native token, ELX, could follow the path of Dogecoin 2021 bull season. Which Top Cryptocurrencies Will Experience Explosive Growth Soon? With the altcoin season far from over, Solana, XRP and Dogecoin prices could witness massive rallies before the end of the bull cycle. However, Elluminex is coming up with a solution to common DeFi problems, which will likely trigger its adoption. With the goal of bringing DeFi to the TON ecosystem, the ELX token price might follow the path of the Dogecoin 2021 bull season.feF For more information about Elluminex (ELX) visit the links below: Website: https://elluminex.com/ Twitter/X: https://x.com/elluminex Telegram: https://t.me/Elluminex Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

Bitcoin (BTC) price resurged to the $105K level as the week closed, whereas Ripple’s XRP witnessed gains of nearly 30% in the past seven days. Further, the new meme coin TRUMP has emerged as the talk of the cryptocurrency town, surging phenomenally ahead of Donald Trump’s upcoming presidential inauguration. So, let’s delve deeper into some of the most buzzworthy crypto market updates reported by CoinGape over the past week. BTC & Crypto Market Carry Momentum Ahead Of Donald Trump’s Presidential Inauguration Notably, a pro-crypto wave appears to have engulfed the broader market as Donald Trump is set to take office on January 20. The 47th U.S. president’s pro-cryptocurrency stand and immense support for digital assets have significantly impacted the market. Amid soaring optimism in light of Trump’s presidential inauguration, BTC and top crypto prices recovered following a recent waning action, further underscoring the Republican’s influence on the market. BTC price gained over 10% in the past seven days and exchanged hands at the $105K level as the week closed. ETH price gained slightly by 3% during the same period, closing the week at the $3,370 level. Simultaneously, Solana closed the week at around $257, a massive 37% surge in the past seven days. Also, meme coins such as SHIB and DOGE pumped 5%-20% over the past week. As mentioned above, the rising trajectories fall in line with Donald Trump’s upcoming presidential inauguration. Moreover, in light of this saga, Oklahoma recently introduced a Bitcoin Reserve Act, further bolstering support for the asset amid a bullish market. Additionally, CoinGape reported that even Wyoming proposed legislation to allow state funds’ investment in BTC. Overall, the abovementioned developments as the Republican is set to commence his presidential term have underlined a bullish impact on the crypto market. Ripple’s XRP Hovers Above $3 Simultaneously, Ripple’s native coin has emerged as another hot buzz in the market, surging 28% over the week to close at $3.26. The crypto leverages a broader bullish momentum as the 47th U.S. president is set to begin his term, as mentioned above. Besides, a stockpile of other developments garnered additional attention toward the digital asset. Notably, the odds of an XRP ETF have gained significant weight amid Gary Gensler’s exit. As per Nate Geraci, filings for ProShares Leveraged & Inverse XRP ETFs and ProShares XRP Futures ETF have been submitted recently. This development has ignited considerable market optimism surrounding Ripple’s coin. Further, Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen has reportedly moved $60.54 million XRP from his wallet, sparking discussions amid new filings in the lawsuit against the SEC. Intriguingly, even Ripple whales moved over 130 million tokens as both parties agreed to file stipulations regarding cross-appeals, and the SEC filed its new opening brief. Altogether, the abovementioned events emerged as some of the most impactful news for the Ripple community this week. TRUMP Meme Coin Gains Traction On the other hand, Donald Trump announced the TRUMP meme coin launch this week, sparking additional discussions. Notably, the Official TRUMP coin witnessed a phenomenal 3000% uptick within just 20 hours, reaching right behind Pepe Coin in terms of market cap. The token’s rising popularity ahead of the presidential inauguration has further raised eyebrows among traders and investors globally. Meanwhile, it’s also noteworthy that the whale accumulations for the new meme coin on Solana have witnessed a remarkable rise, sparking optimism over the asset’s future movements.

As Render’s price shows resilience and Aptos boasts a surging TVL fueled by expanding DeFi and AI integration, blockchain innovation is taking giant leaps. These projects are redefining their niches, but the spotlight now shifts to Web3Bay . Web3Bay is rewriting the rules of online shopping by combining blockchain efficiency with user-friendly features. Its presale is quickly gaining traction, offering a first-mover advantage in decentralized e-commerce. With 3BAY tokens priced to rise at each stage and projected to deliver high ROI, missing this presale could feel like skipping Bitcoin or Ethereum’s early days. Will you act now or watch from the sidelines? Web3Bay’s Blueprint for E-Commerce Dominance Will Web3Bay’s presale turn into one of those moments you regret passing up, like missing out on Bitcoin or Ethereum in their infancy? As a pioneer in decentralized e-commerce, Web3Bay is building an entirely new way to shop online. Its 3BAY tokens act as the foundation for a system that eliminates intermediaries, ensuring faster, more secure transactions. The platform’s ongoing presale, now in its 4th stage with 3BAY priced at $0.004562, has already gained significant attention, raising over $830,000 and selling 220 million tokens to date, making it a contender among high ROI crypto opportunities. Web3Bay’s strength lies in its ability to merge Web2 familiarity with Web3 innovation. By incorporating user-friendly features and supporting traditional payment options like PayPal (planned for future integration), it ensures usability for both crypto enthusiasts and everyday shoppers. This inclusive approach could drive mass adoption and position Web3Bay as a game-changer in online retail. With decentralized storage via IPFS and token incentives such as governance rights and purchase discounts, the platform appeals to users on multiple levels. The roadmap ahead includes major milestones like DAO implementation, 3BAY token listings on top exchanges, and new feature rollouts that could substantially enhance token value. Each presale stage raises the token price, creating structured prices to the benefit of the community. Missing this opportunity could mean watching Web3Bay redefine e-commerce without you. Render Price Update: What’s Driving RNDR’s Momentum? The Render price recently touched $7.48, reflecting a slight pullback after reaching an intraday high of $8.09. This follows a 30% surge earlier in 2025, showcasing renewed market confidence in the RNDR token. Analysts suggest this upward trend could target $14.32 and possibly the $19-$20 range if the bullish momentum continues. With growing adoption in AI-powered rendering and holographic media, Render Network’s influence in creative industries is expanding rapidly. 2024 was a transformative year for Render, with its usage rate tripling and partnerships powering high-profile projects like the Las Vegas Sphere’s visuals. As Render sets new standards in decentralized rendering, the current Render price reflects its growing role in reshaping 3D media creation. RNDR’s utility and market demand are driving attention, positioning it as a strong contender for significant growth in 2025. Aptos TVL Surges Amid Ecosystem Growth The Aptos TVL has been climbing steadily, now supported by a thriving DeFi ecosystem that saw a 28-fold increase in daily decentralized exchange volumes, reaching $21.5 million within a year. Aptos’ focus on seamless AI integration and expanding its financial ecosystem has made it a key player in blockchain innovation. Recent reports highlight over 27.7 million active addresses and 1.7 billion transactions processed, with a record 326 million transactions completed in a single day. As Aptos introduces stablecoins like USDT and USDY to its ecosystem, its Aptos TVL growth reflects both scalability and user confidence. Plans to expand AI-driven clienteling and modern POS solutions on the Aptos ONE platform are set to fuel further adoption. These strategic advancements suggest Aptos is positioning itself for long-term impact in decentralized finance and retail technology. The Final Take With the Render price aiming for targets beyond $14 and Aptos’ expanding ecosystem reflected in its rising Aptos TVL, these projects demonstrate blockchain’s potential for innovation and growth. However, as promising as these established names are, Web3Bay brings a fresh opportunity to the table. Its presale offers access to 3BAY tokens at prices designed for high growth potential, making it a compelling choice for those seeking a high ROI crypto. With plans to bridge Web2 and Web3, upcoming token listings, and community-driven governance, Web3Bay could redefine decentralized e-commerce. The question remains: Will you regret overlooking Web3Bay’s presale as it sets the stage for long-term dominance in a rapidly evolving market? The time to act is now.

Here Are The Top 10 Coins With The Most Potential,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/will-trumps-inauguration-boost-crypto-here-are-the-top-10-coins-with-the-most-potential/,"As President-elect Donald Trump prepares for his inauguration on January 20, the crypto community is buzzing with anticipation regarding the potential impact of his administration on digital assets. Analysts are closely examining which crypto assets may benefit the most during this pivotal period, especially given Trump’s vocal support for making the United States a leader in the crypto space. Market expert Xremlin suggests that Trump’s presidency could usher in a “golden era” for crypto. His analysis focuses on US-founded coins and assets linked to the Trump family, indicating that the inauguration might catalyze significant price movements for certain altcoins. Notably, Eric Trump has publicly shared his investments in Sui (SUI), Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), and Bitcoin (BTC), suggesting a focus on already established cryptocurrencies. The Leading Crypto Contenders Ethereum (ETH): The analyst shares that Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem, known for its smart contract functionality and diverse use cases. He suggests that as a leading platform for decentralized applications (dApps), its significance in the market is undeniable, making it a staple in any crypto portfolio. Bitcoin (BTC): Often referred to as digital gold, Bitcoin is the most recognized cryptocurrency and serves as a benchmark for the entire market. Xremlin observes its potential inclusion in a US Strategic Bitcoin reserve could further solidify its status and drive additional interest from institutional investors. Solana (SOL): As a US-founded blockchain with a robust user base, Solana has gained attention for its speed and scalability. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve In The US: 65% Chance It Happens In 2025 The analyst speculates that it could soon see the launch of an exchange-traded fund (ETF), which would enhance its visibility and accessibility to mainstream investors. Sui (SUI): Positioned as a direct competitor to Solana, Sui boasts higher transactions per second (TPS) but still lacks a significant user base. Being US-founded, it reportedly stands to gain from any favorable regulatory developments that may arise during Trump’s administration. World Liberty: Initiated by the Trump family, is another one to watch, according to Xremlin. Although it has yet to launch, its connection to the Trump name could reportedly generate price spikes once it enters the market. Additional Contenders For The “Trump Trade” Beyond the aforementioned digital assets, Xremlin highlights several other US-founded projects are gaining traction and could play a role in the so-called “Trump trade”: Ripple (XRP): Known for its blockchain-based payment protocol, Ripple facilitates real-time cross-border payments, making it a key player for financial institutions. Chainlink (LINK): As a blockchain-agnostic platform, Chainlink connects various chains to major financial institutions, enabling seamless data connectivity and interoperability. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts When Dogecoin Price Will Hit $3 This Cycle Ondo (ONDO): This platform bridges traditional financial products like US bonds and treasuries to the blockchain, enhancing accessibility and efficiency in the DeFi space. Hedera (HBAR): Governed by a council that includes tech giants like Google and IBM, Hedera is designed for fast and energy-efficient transactions, ensuring stability and transparency. Stellar (XLM): Focused on facilitating low-cost cross-border payments, Stellar collaborates with companies such as Circle and MoneyGram to integrate blockchain solutions into the U.S. financial system.

In his post , Kwok contrasted the hype surrounding an $8 billion XRP ETF with the far greater opportunities in real-world tokenized assets (RWAs), emphasizing their capacity to revolutionize markets like real estate and mortgages. A $16 Trillion Opportunity Kwok referenced his experiences presenting alongside Ripple CTO David Schwartz, who envisions a path to a $16 trillion market in tokenized assets. According to Kwok, this massive opportunity lies not in catering to ETFs but in addressing significant inefficiencies across industries such as real estate, mortgages, and liquidity management. Real estate, a $200 trillion market, is riddled with challenges, from fractional ownership complications to liquidity constraints and inefficiencies in mortgage financing. Kwok emphasized the potential of blockchain technology, particularly the XRPL , in providing innovative solutions to these longstanding issues. lots of hype about an $8bn $xrp etf. but as a builder, i couldn’t care less. i’ve presented on-stage with ripple cto david schwartz twice. and he sees an easy straight line to a $16 TRILLION market in tokenised assets. how? hint: it’s not about building for etfs a thread pic.twitter.com/IyLLQQM3I6 — Phil Kwok | EasyA (@kwok_phil) January 15, 2025 Real-World Applications of Tokenization Kwok highlighted two specific applications of tokenization: Expanded Mortgage Markets: Tokenization could enable the issuance of mortgages not just on homes but on any asset class. This innovation could dramatically expand lending markets, creating new economic opportunities. Fractional Ownership: Blockchain technology could allow individuals to own shares of properties worldwide without navigating complex paperwork or legal barriers. Such developments would democratize access to investment opportunities, empowering individuals to participate in high-value markets that were previously inaccessible. Why the XRP Ledger? The XRP Ledger’s attributes make it uniquely suited for these applications. Its fast transaction speeds, low costs, and secure fixed functionalities position it as a preferred platform for tokenizing real-world assets. The XRPL could unlock unprecedented value across various markets by addressing inefficiencies and enabling seamless peer-to-peer transactions. Kwok’s stance on ETFs underscores his belief that blockchain technology’s true potential lies in creating transformative use cases rather than building solutions for traditional financial instruments. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Perspective Kwok’s insights resonated with other members of the blockchain community. One X user, “TheGameoflife,” noted , “Blockchain technology fixes trust. Today we have brokers, agents, [and] middle men all with their hand in the cookie jar. When we can do peer-to-peer transactions using a decentralized trust system, the possibilities are endless.” This comment highlights the broader sentiment that decentralization and tokenization have the potential to eliminate intermediaries, streamline processes, and build trust in industries traditionally burdened by inefficiencies. A Paradigm Shift in Blockchain Applications Kwok’s argument aligns with a growing belief among blockchain builders: the most transformative applications of the technology lie in real-world use cases. The tokenization of assets represents a shift toward creating systems that address tangible problems and unlock new value propositions. While the $8 billion XRP ETF represents a milestone, Kwok’s vision for tokenized assets positions the blockchain space as an enabler of far larger economic opportunities. With a focus on RWAs and the capabilities of the XRPL, the blockchain community appears poised to redefine how value is created, managed, and distributed. This perspective reminds builders and investors alike that the journey toward a $16 trillion tokenized asset market is just beginning.

The cryptocurrency ( TRUMP ), which President-elect Donald Trump launched as an homage to himself, is quickly gaining traction in the digital asset space, with trading volumes surging on major platforms like Binance and OKX, where it is listed. The coin’s rally reflects a growing appetite for meme coins backed or launched by famous individuals. The downside is that these types of assets often experience speculative booms due to their viral appeal. Some are even called out for being rug pulls. The Official Trump coin has both going for it, but at last check Sunday, it’s up almost 330%. Source: CoinGecko You might also like: What is a crypto rug pull? How to stay safe from rug pulls What critics are saying TRUMP’s creators, and Trump himself, are leaning into the president-elect’s political brand, positioning the token as both a financial asset and a cultural statement. For example, its logo — emblazoned with the words “Fight Fight Fight” — differentiates the token from other unofficial Trump meme coins that flooded the market. Official Trump’s listing on Binance and OKX has further legitimized it, providing access to millions of global traders. However, the coin has not been without controversy. Critics argue that TRUMP represents a potential conflict of interest, particularly as Trump is about to be sworn in as commander-in-chief of the U.S. Stephen Findeisen, also known as the crypto sleuth Coffeezilla on YouTube, called the launch “ historic in its stupidity .” Anthony Scaramucci, a Bitcoin bull who briefly worked for Trump and now runs the investment firm SkyBridge Capital, warned his one million followers on X not to “delude” themselves about the Official Trump meme coin launch. The Trump meme coin stuff is bad for the industry. Don’t delude yourself. It’s Idi Amin level corruption. — Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) January 18, 2025 Ben Meiselas, co-founder of Meidas Touch, suggested Trump could have focused on more urgent matters rather than meme coins. https://twitter.com/meiselasb/status/1880455817306206589 Despite the criticism, TRUMP’s rapid rise underscores the ongoing influence of political and cultural figures in the cryptocurrency market, raising questions about the intersection of finance, politics, and blockchain technology. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy also chimed in, equating Trump’s meme coin launch to the alleged pump-and-dump scheme involving Haliey Welch, the viral “ Hawk Tuah ” star. I have a dumb 2 part question. 1. What’s the difference between the Hawk Tuah coin and the Trump coin besides nothing? 2. Can I string up my own coin now and tell people it’s a Ponzi scheme from the jump and I’m gonna rug pull at some point and you better just hope you’re… — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) January 18, 2025 It’s worth noting that the Trump family already actively promote tokens tied to World Liberty Financial. In September, CoinDesk reported that 70% of the platform’s tokens were held by its founders, team members, and service providers. The same goes for Official Trump. Some 80% of the meme coin is reportedly held by CIC Digital, a Trump Organization affiliate.

However, Elluminex (ELX) is set to outperform them both with its unique premise that could revolutionize the entire DeFi space and unlock the latent potential of the TON blockchain. Let’s dive deeper and discover why this project could be one of the hottest plays in 2025. How Elluminex Is Pioneering DeFi On TON TON is the fastest-growing blockchain in the Layer 1 space, tapping directly into Telegram’s massive 950-million user base. Although TON already asserted itself in the crypto gaming niche with viral Telegram-based titles like Notcoin and Hamster Kombat, it still lacks a unified DeFi solution, meaning significant revenue is being left on the table. Ethereum’s numbers and usability skyrocketed when Uniswap was released, the same happened with Binance Smart Chain and Pancake Swap. Soon, TON will have its very own DeFi protocol — Elluminex . However, Elluminex is not just another run-of-the-mill decentralized exchange, it brings forward a 360-degree ecosystem that addresses all inefficiencies commonly found in old-guard protocols. Through its revolutionary cross-chain bridge, Elluminex will integrate all major blockchains and allow them to interface with one another. This in turn will translate into a deep, unified liquidity pool, as liquidity is sourced from the various chains, allowing users to trade and invest with minimal slippage and greatly reduced waiting times. At the core of the Elluminex ecosystem is the $ELX utility token, which will power key features like governance and staking. Holders of the token can opt to stake their $ELX and earn up to 18% APY. This model not only ensures long-term holding but combined with the automated burn mechanism, deflationary pressure will drive the price of $ELX much higher, allowing crypto players to to benefit from both staking rewards and appreciation gains. The launch of the $ELX presale is yet to be unveiled, and once it is live, early buyers will have the opportunity to build a future-proof $ELX position at a discounted price. Keep an eye on Elluminex’s socials and official website to stay up to date with the latest developments. Fantom Is In The Red, Will It Go Lower? After bottoming out during the summer slump Fantom (FTM) skyrocketed with a triple-digit surge, peaking at $1.43 just a few days ago. However, as the market-wide correction began, Fantom faced significant declines that saw it breach below $1.20. At the time of writing, Fantom trades at $1.15 following a 13.5% intraday decline. The 90% rise in trading volume underscores significant trader activity happening at these levels, and over the last 24 hours, about $950 million worth of FTM has changed hands across platforms. Over the last year, Fantom has been finalizing its rebrand to Sonic and since yesterday, the new Layer 1 is now live. FTM holders will be able to swap their tokens for the native S token on a 1:1 ratio. Staking and governance features will also be live soon. This revamped Fantom ecosystem boasts 10,000 TPS, near-instant finality, and an upcoming $260M airdrop, positioning Sonic as the successor to Fantom’s legacy. Solana-Killer Sui Continues To Make Strides In 2024 Sui (SUI) topped headlines and positioned itself among the leading Layer 1 platforms. This has also been reflected by its stellar performance, as Sui has been in up-only mode for months, breaking to a new all-time high several times in a row. The latest Sui peak was at $4.93 but as traders booked profits, a pullback followed, and today, Sui sells for $4.73 with a slight 1.5% increase on the daily timeframe. In terms of raw numbers, Sui’s 120,000 transactions per second could pose a threat to Solana’s dominion as the fastest blockchain in the space. Just recently, Sui partnered with SatLayer to integrate Bitcoin’s security and liquidity into its ecosystem, enabling Bitcoin restaking and DeFi (BTCfi) capabilities.

Coinbase posted on Sunday that it plans to list the TRUMP token. The announcement came via its Coinbase Assets X account, which provides information on new assets, however the exchange did not provide a concrete timeline for listing. Binance said it plans to open trading for the TRUMP token on the the morning of Jan. 19. The token is already trading on many other centralized exchanges, such as Bitget, KuCoin and Kraken according to CoinGecko. On-chain data shows that the token has a market cap of just over $7.6 billion, and trading volume of approximately $15 billion. While many of the largest crypto exchanges have eagerly embraced Trump’s official memecoin, the first Trump-themed token, one of the original Political Finance (PoliFi) tokens, had trouble getting listed on exchanges. As CoinDesk reported earlier this year, ByBit and OKX rejected the team’s application to list the token given concerns about the project being too political. Kraken did not respond to their application to list, and would not discuss the matter on the record. The first Trump token, the Ethereum-based MAGA, is down 84% from its June high of $17.80, according to CoinGecko , but continues to be actively traded. MAGA dumped hard after the launch of the officialTrump token, falling from $3.50 to $1.44 over the weekend with its market cap declining from $158 million to $64 million. The token has slowly recovered after the initial fall likely due to general interest in Trump-themed tokens on the eve of the inauguration. The tokenomics of TRUMP have been criticized by many online, who have pointed out that 80% of the token supply is controlled by wallets owned by CIC Digital. CIC Digital LLC is the Trump Organization affiliated firm that launched Trump Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) in 2023. Data from OpenSea shows that there’s a second wave of interest in these NFTs with over 2,800 sales in the last 24 hours worth over 765 ETH ($2.5 million).",Markets,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BNB|MARKET|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-19 06:24:36

Donald Trump the Bull (DONBULL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONBULL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Trump the Bull can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Trump the Bull could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Trump the Bull launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Trump the Bull on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Donald Trump the Bull by entering its contract address – AmgaL1uuQ97qJoXfUUxdHipLJmVd3toChivEBiSFn7MW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONBULL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|TRADING|DOGE|SOL|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-19 06:29:00

While Bitcoin remains a household name, other projects like Avalanche and Immutable X have made serious strides, carving out niches in blockchain innovation. Joining these big names is Qubetics ($TICS) , a project that’s redefining Web3 utility. If you’re seeking the Top Coins for Significant Returns, these three cryptos should be on your radar. Avalanche and Immutable X have proven their worth over the years with their scalability and innovation, but Qubetics is a game-changer that’s shaking things up. With its focus on interoperability and a suite of groundbreaking tools, Qubetics is poised to lead the charge for significant returns in 2025. Let’s dive into what makes these projects the Top Coins for Significant Returns. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Interoperability in Web3 Qubetics is not merely another cryptocurrency; it is the world’s first Web3 aggregator, designed to integrate multiple blockchains seamlessly. Its advanced interoperability tools enable businesses, developers, and individuals to interact effortlessly across various ecosystems, fostering a unified and efficient digital environment. Imagine you’re a property developer in Miami wanting to tokenize an apartment complex. With Qubetics, you can create digital tokens that represent shares of the property, allowing global investors to buy in with ease. Or think about a freelance artist in São Paulo selling tokenized ownership of their latest work, opening new revenue streams. Qubetics makes these scenarios practical and accessible. In its 17th presale stage , Qubetics has raised over $9.8 million, onboarded more than 14,800 token holders, and sold over 423 million $TICS tokens. At $0.0501 per token, analysts project exponential growth: $TICS could reach $0.25 by the presale’s end, offering a nearly 400% return. Post-presale predictions of $1, $5, or even $15 highlight Qubetics’ massive potential, making it one of the Top Coins for Significant Returns. Qubetics’ focus on interoperability is equally groundbreaking. Businesses can bridge their operations across blockchains, creating new efficiencies. Developers can build dApps that work on multiple platforms without extra coding. And for everyday users? Transactions and asset management just got a whole lot simpler. This commitment to real-world usability cements Qubetics’ place among the most exciting projects in crypto. Avalanche: Speed and Scalability at Its Core Avalanche is known for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and unparalleled scalability. It’s one of the most robust platforms for deploying decentralized applications (dApps) and enterprise-grade solutions. Whether it’s DeFi, NFTs, or gaming, Avalanche has become a go-to for developers who need performance without compromise. In 2025, Avalanche continues to deliver on its promise of efficiency. The network can process over 4,500 transactions per second, making it a favorite for projects that require high throughput. Imagine a DeFi platform in New York managing thousands of trades per second or a gaming company in Tokyo powering millions of in-game transactions seamlessly. Avalanche makes it all possible. Its native token, AVAX, has also been a consistent performer. Trading at around $20, AVAX is considered undervalued by many analysts, especially given its growing adoption. With more projects choosing Avalanche as their foundation, the token’s value is poised to rise significantly, making it one of the Top Coins for Significant Returns. Immutable X: Redefining NFTs and Gaming Immutable X has quickly become a leader in the NFT and gaming space, offering a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. By eliminating gas fees and speeding up transactions, Immutable X has made it easier than ever for creators and gamers to interact with blockchain technology. It’s no wonder the platform is often touted as a game-changer in its niche. In 2025, Immutable X continues to dominate by providing a seamless experience for NFT minting and trading. Imagine a digital artist in Los Angeles creating an NFT collection without worrying about exorbitant gas fees. Or a game developer in London enabling players to trade in-game assets instantly. These are just a few of the possibilities made real by Immutable X. What sets Immutable X apart is its focus on sustainability. By leveraging Ethereum’s security while minimizing environmental impact, it’s winning over eco-conscious users and developers. If you’re bullish on the future of NFTs and gaming, Immutable X deserves a spot in your portfolio as one of the Top Coins for Significant Returns. Conclusion: Don’t Miss the Chance Crypto investing is all about timing and spotting potential. Qubetics, Avalanche, and Immutable X each bring something unique to the table. Qubetics is redefining interoperability , Avalanche is leading the way in speed and scalability, and Immutable X is transforming the NFT and gaming landscapes. Qubetics’ presale offers a rare opportunity to get in early on a project with massive upside potential. Don’t wait—join the revolution today and position yourself for significant returns with the Top Coins for Significant Returns.

Despite his previous hesitations about cryptocurrency, Trump had expressed his belief that America would become “the crypto capital of the planet” once he returned to Washington. The timing of the launch has raised some eyebrows. Critics have accused Trump of capitalizing on his imminent presidency to profit from the popularity of cryptocurrencies, particularly meme coins. However, some experts are focusing on how this move could have an impact on ongoing legal battles in the crypto space, particularly the high-profile lawsuit between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple Lawsuit: Could Trump’s $TRUMP Coin Affect the Case? Attorney Bill Morgan recently discussed thE implications of Trump’s actions on the Ripple lawsuit. Morgan pointed out that the appeal of Judge Torres’ finding against Ripple’s fair notice defense is now looking more promising. For context, the SEC has been pursuing legal action against Ripple, claiming that the company’s sale of XRP violated securities laws. However, Ripple argues that it had no clear notice that its sales of XRP were subject to SEC registration requirements. Morgan drew attention to Trump’s stance on the issue of cryptocurrencies and investment contracts. While Trump has issued and promoted the $TRUMP meme coin, he does not believe that such tokens should be classified as investment contracts that require SEC registration. This is a key issue in the Ripple lawsuit, where the SEC argues that XRP should be treated as a security, while Ripple maintains that it is a digital asset. The @Ripple appeal of Judge Torres finding against Ripple’s defense that there must be a contract or post sale obligations is looking good. After all the President of the USA thinks a token with no post sale obligations to buyers can be issued and promoted without being… https://t.co/OByrCesd8j — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) January 18, 2025 Given that Trump has issued a speculative meme coin without adhering to the traditional regulatory frameworks that the SEC enforces on other tokens, Morgan questioned how the SEC v. Ripple case could continue under these circumstances. He said that Ripple’s sales of XRP, like the promotion of $TRUMP, did not involve any post-sale obligations, which is a point of contention in the Ripple case.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-19 06:31:02

According to DeFi Llama , Solana’s ( SOL ) DEX protocols handled $19.47 billion in volume, up from $19.37 billion the previous day. The previous daily record was $7.5 billion in November last year. This surge happened because of the recent launch of the Official Trump ( TRUMP ) meme coin that launched on Friday, Jan. 17. So far, the token has gained a market capitalization of over $7.5 billion, while its 24-hour trading volume jumped to $11 billion. You might also like: Official Trump meme coin surges 330%, critics raise concerns Most of this volume is happening in Solana DEX networks, led by Meteora, Raydium, Orca, and Lifinity. Other centralized exchanges like OKX, Binance, Bitget, and MEXC have also listed the token and are starting to gain some market share. Solana’s DEX volume was significantly higher than other leading layer-1 and layer-2 chains. Ethereum’s ( ETH ) protocols handled $3.63 billion in the last 24 hours, while BNB Chain, Base, and Arbitrum handled $3 billion, $2 billion, and $1 billion, respectively.

Bonk ( BONK ) jumped by 10%, with its 24-hour volume reaching over $1 billion. Fartcoin price jumped by almost 30%, with its volume reaching $557 million. This performance led to higher fees for the Solana blockchain. Data by TokenTerminal shows that the fees jumped to $4.7 million, the highest level since Jan. 8.

It jumped to a high of $275 on Jan. 19, crossing last year’s high of $265 and invalidating the double-top pattern that formed. A double-top is a risky sign that often leads to a bearish breakout, initially to the neckline. In this case, the neckline was at $170, its lowest point this month. Solana’s price has remained above all moving averages, while the Money Flow Index has tilted upwards and is nearing its overbought level.

As a result, the crypto market is already surging exponentially, with several altcoins set to skyrocket on 20 Jan. Interestingly, Official Trump meme coin, Solana and XRP, might create new ATHs on Monday. A ‘Trump Pump’ Might Surpass Buyers’ Expectations With less than a day until President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20th, traders are excited to see how his administration, which is rumored to be supportive of crypto, will influence the industry’s future. Also read: XRP Lawsuit News: Ripple’s Fight with SEC Faces New Twist as Trump Promotes Meme Coin On Friday, Bitcoin reached its highest price of 2025, with investors looking forward to Donald Trump’s second presidential inauguration on January 20th. Trump is said to be planning to sign over 100 executive orders right away, some of which might address Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. As a result, several altcoins, along with a new meme coin launched by Donald Trump, have begun to see significant increases in value. However, there is also worry about potential pump-and-dump schemes in the market, although the likelihood of this happening is quite low. Official Trump Price Analysis Donald Trump announced a new cryptocurrency called the Trump memecoin just days before his inauguration. Despite concerns of potential scams, the excitement drove the memecoin’s value on the Solana blockchain to soar to a market capitalization (FDV) of over $38 billion. The hype is expected to grow as the meme coin endorsed by the incoming president boosts trader confidence. Currently, the Official Trump meme coin is trading at $38.8, having surged over 190% in the last 24 hours. It is anticipated that the Trump coin will maintain its buying demand on January 20th. With the price chart showing a rising wedge pattern, the coin’s value is predicted to skyrocket above $40. The target price for January 20th is set between $70 and $80. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana price continues to surge above immediate resistance lines, reaching its November highs. As of writing, SOL price trades at $270, increasing over 8.9% from yesterday’s rate. The 20-day average price has begun to rise, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved into overbought territory, hinting at a minor retest of immediate support level. There’s a slight resistance at $303, but it’s expected that this price can be surpassed. If so, the SOL/USDT pair might increase to $350 tomorrow. XRP Price Analysis XRP continues to surge due to the fact that the new SEC might bring fresh crypto policies, impacting Ripple’s legal lawsuit positively. XRP price has been surging exponentially and is preparing for further surges tomorrow by consolidating at $3.2. For a robust surge, XRP needs to hold above the EMA20 trend line.

Moreover, the Company has significantly improved its financial performance, turning large losses into net income over the past three years. Year-end results will be reported in April 2025; I anticipate that those results, which will reflect the Trump crypto rally, should serve as a catalyst to propel the stock higher. Introduction When I last covered Defi Technologies Inc. ( OTCQB:DEFTF ) (the "" Company "") for Seeking Alpha on December 7, 2021, the crypto market, including the Company, was in a bubbly bull market. The Company's stock price was $2.87 then compared to $3.08 today (1/16/25). While on the surface it might look like the stock price has been largely range bound over the period, the reality is that the ride from then to now has been an epic roller coaster as shown in the chart below. Seeking Alpha Indeed, the Company would go on to lose more than 95% of its value at its nadir during the course of the crypto bear market of 2022-2023. It is more than three years later, and for the reasons described herein, I still believe the Company remains a BUY and I include the Company in the speculative bucket of my Model Asset Allocation . A Growing Business Business Segments Per it most recent Management Discussion & Analysis ("" MD&A ""), the Company generates revenue via a half dozen business segments: 1. Valour Asset Management ("" Valour ""). Valour is the Company's key business segment, offering Exchange Traded Products (“ ETPs ”) that ""synthetically track the value of a single DeFi protocol or a basket of protocols."" See MD&A linked above. Valour's products are mainly offered in Europe. As of September 30, 2024, such products offer exposure to the following, among other protocols: Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ); Ethereum ( ETH-USD ); Solana ( SOL-USD ); Polkadot ( DOT-USD ); Cardano ( ADA-USD ); Uniswap ( UNI-USD ); Cosmos ( ATOM-USD ); Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ); Chainlink ( LINK-USD ) and Enjin Coin ( ENJ-USD ). See MD&A above for further details (Note 12, page 23). 2. The Company's DeFi Alpha segment operates an arbitrage trading desk (the "" Trading Desk ""). The Trading Desk seeks to ""identify low-risk arbitrage opportunities within the crypto ecosystem."" Per the Company's website : With a primary focus on both centralized and decentralized markets, the trading desk ensures minimal exposure to market and protocol risks, effectively mitigating revenue volatility. Since its inception, DeFi Alpha has delivered significant results, generating over C$133.1 million (US$97.5 million) in cash and digital asset equivalents in 2024."" 3. The Stillman Digital segment is, according to the MD&A, ""a leading digital asset liquidity provider that offers limitless liquidity solutions for businesses, focusing on industry-leading trade execution, settlement and technology."" The Company acquired Stillman Digital in October 2024, issuing Company shares to finance the acquisition. The Company's year-end financials should provide investors with initial insights into this segment's performance. 4. The Company's DeFi Ventures segment invests in decentralized finance businesses, seeking to maintain a diversified portfolio of companies. The portfolio companies of Defi Ventures are described here . 5. Per the MD&A, the Company's DeFi Infrastructure segment offers ""governance services and products within the DeFi ecosystem."" For more information regarding services and the Company's partners, see this link . 6. Finally, the Reflexivity LLC business segment is a provider of boutique crypto industry research. Co-founded by Anthony Pompliano and Will Clemente, the Company acquired Reflexivity LLC in the first quarter of 2024. *** Notably, in my prior articles concerning the Company, including my original article linked here , I noted that the Company retained an interest in crypto miner, Hive Digital Technologies Inc. ( HIVE ). Today, however, that investment no longer appears to be on the books of the Company. Certain Recent Developments After the close of the third quarter of 2024, the Company has made some positive announcements that demonstrate positive momentum for Valour. Per the MD&A, those developments include: In October 2024, Valour listed the Valour Sui ( SUI-USD ) ETP on the Spotlight Stock Market in Stockholm, Sweden (the "" Spotlight Stock Market ""). SUI, a protocol that I own, is a Layer 1 blockchain with a high quality management team (previously part of the Diem project of Facebook/Meta Platforms, Inc. ( META )). Also in October 2024, Valour listed the first-ever Valour Bittensor ( TAO-USD ) ETP on the Spotlight Stock Market, providing investors with access to Bittensor's ""decentralized machine learning protocol."" [The Author is unfamiliar with this protocol.] A month later, in November 2024, the Company announced that Valour and affiliates had introduced a new physically backed, high-yield Bitcoin ETP for German investors in collaboration with Core Foundation . Net Income The Company has grown revenues and net income materially over the last three years. (Canadian Dollars) September 30, 2021 September 30, 2024 Total Revenues 9,967,376 152,436,040 Total Expenses 25,376,938 55,199,666 Net Income (21,454,530) 95,145,316 Indeed, the Company has turned large losses into profits. Keep in mind too that the bull market in crypto accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2024 in anticipation of (and following) the Trump victory. The Company is estimated to report 2024 year-end earnings on April 2, 2024. I am anticipating that the Company will have a solid quarter as its assets under management ("" AUM "") more than doubled year over year (and exceeded $1 billion (Canadian)). This could be a big catalyst for the stock price, particularly if the Company can continue to show overall growth in AUM and net inflows into its ETPs. Balance Sheet (Canadian Dollars) September 20, 2021 September 20, 2024 Current Assets 264,598,501 832,070,950 Current Liabilities 246,809,926 789,761,126 Current Ratio ** 1.07 1.05 Total Assets 372,062,311 928,959,248 Total Liabilities 246,831,974 789,761,126 Shareholder Equity 125,230,337 139,198,122 Shares Outstanding (Diluted) 189,037,949 339,793,738 ** Not included in the linked balance sheets included above. Added by Author. The balance sheet has grown over the last three years, but liquidity has not necessarily improved as the Current Ratio has actually declined. Shareholder Equity has slightly improved, but there has been significant shareholder dilution along the way. With profits and AUM growing, however, it is important for the Company to begin to improve its liquidity profile. I will be looking at year-end results closely in this regard. A risk I see is that management is possibly doing too much and making investments in too many verticals. Other risks are noted or referenced below. Risks Key risks are enumerated in the MD&A linked above. Notably, however, the decline in the Canadian dollar is having an adverse effect on the Company. The chart below shows the performance of the Canadian dollar via the Invesco CurrencyShares® Canadian Dollar Trust ETF ( FXC ) and the US Dollar Index ( DXY ) over the last three years. Seeking Alpha Moreover, a large number of the Company's ETPs are listed on European exchanges, and the recent trend for the Euro has been downward as well. The chart below shows the performance of the Euro via the Invesco CurrencyShares® Euro Currency Trust ETF ( FXE ) and the US Dollar Index ( DXY ) over the last three years. Seeking Alpha Needless to say, ownership of the Company includes material foreign currency risk associated with the Canadian dollar , the Euro and certain other European currencies. Further, due to the Company's size (under $1 billion market cap) and it being domiciled in Canada, it is not included in any large stock indexes (at least as far as I can tell) and, as such, the Company is not the beneficiary of material passive flows. This could prove to be a competitive disadvantage. Lastly, with significant exposure to alt-coins, the Company is very volatile. Since it began trading on public markets (in or about March 2020), it makes Bitcoin look very dull by comparison as shown in the chart below. Seeking Alpha In short, this kind of volatility is not for everyone. Conclusion With its fast growing asset management business, the Company is a speculative BUY . Moreover, it continues to hold promise as a call option on the crypto/DeFi space. Consequently, it holds a place in the speculative bucket of my Model Asset Allocation .",DEFTF|DEFI:CA,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-19 06:56:03

In 2022, the Department of Justice managed to take control of 94,643 of 119,754 bitcoins associated with the hack, paving the way for restitution. The DOJ is working on getting the rest of the stolen coins, which were subjected to money laundering attempts. Before the hack, the stolen amount of bitcoins was worth around $72 million. Following the price drop, these coins’ value was estimated at $58 million. As of Jan. 19, 2025, the value of 94.6k BTC is estimated at $9 billion. The number of stolen assets was more than half of the bitcoins controlled by Bitfinex at the time. Table of Contents The details of the ruling The people behind the hack and money laundering Is the ruling controversial? The details of the ruling The ruling may be found controversial as every single Bitfinex client holding money on the exchange in 2016 was affected regardless of whether criminals emptied their wallets because the unaffected addresses were partly emptied by the exchange (“a sole victim”) itself. Read more: Bitfinex could be ‘sole victim’ of 2016 hack, US government says The platform cut every deposit by 36.06% and compensated it with some amounts of BFX tokens or Right to Recovery Tokens issued by the parent company iFinex. These tokens could be redeemed for cash or converted into iFinex equity. The ethical questions behind cutting the clients’ deposits by a third aside, the compensation was hardly just even in 2016, considering that the hack caused a substantial BTC price drop. Nevertheless, the latest ruling leaves a window of opportunity for the affected Bitfinex clients, as they can claim the portions of the restitution individually until January 28. According to the judge, neither the exchange nor its users fit the victim criteria; however, thanks to plea agreements, voluntary restitution became possible. The people behind the hack and money laundering People behind the plea are Ilya Lichtenstein and his wife Heather Morgan, a man who made a bigger-than-life crypto hack, and his wife with whom they tried to launder the money. The press dubbed them “Bitcoin Bonnie and Clyde.” In contrast to the real-life Bonnie and Clyde, Lichtenstein and Morgan turned out to be far more interesting and entertaining than the legendary crime couple of the 1930s, immortalized in pop culture. While Lichtenstein was a low-key IT entrepreneur and didn’t catch the public eye, Morgan was writing for Inc. and Forbes, but most famously following the arrest, she became a “weirder-than-Bjork” rapper under the Razzlekhan moniker. She dropped her latest video on January 10, 2025, and it really adds a nice portion of surrealism to an entire situation. However, we cannot underestimate Lichtenstein’s enigma as well as the smart methods of hacking Bitfinex and ways to launder the money stolen from the exchange. Lichtenstein and Morgan’s actions became the subject of a Netflix documentary series, which is currently in the works. Lichtenstein and Morgan admitted their involvement in money laundering, while Lichtenstein alone pleaded to hacking Bitfinex. He got a 5-year sentence, while his wife is facing 3 years in jail. On Dec. 19, 2024, the prison video of Lichtenstein apologizing for the hack and regretting his past deeds was posted on his X account. In the video, Ilya took 100% responsibility for the heist and said his wife didn’t know about the hack. He said he was willing to return all the stolen money. I have something to say #FreeRazzlekhan pic.twitter.com/9HIvOxcbgr — Ilya Lichtenstein (@unrealdutch) December 19, 2024 Lichtenstein and Morgan admitted their involvement in money laundering while Lichtenstein alone pleaded to hacking Bitfinex.

There are several ways to look at the situation and decide whether the ruling was a victory or a failure for the crypto community. Those who believe that the U.S. should not sell any bitcoins cannot applaud this ruling as, according to it, the money held by the DOJ will be sent to a company headquartered in Taiwan and the British Virgin Islands. However, if the government chooses to accumulate one million bitcoins, 94,643 bitcoins will not be critical damage on the way to this goal. Not good news anyway. Should be returned in kind to the users as well since they all took a haircut due to this hack. — Mike (@immortalbitcoin) January 15, 2025 Those who believe that the stolen funds should be returned to the affected clients barely see the ruling as justified. The time frame set to claim a partition of the restitution (until January 28) seems to be tough. All in all, it’s good to have an opportunity. And, finally, those who prefer Bitfinex having these coins over the DOJ can celebrate as the coins will be released from the government back to Bitfinex and the affected party will get most of what they had on their balance. The money is likely to hit the market again. Hopefully, it will improve the opportunities for exchange in the recovery of clients’ funds.

XRP: The Borderless Coin Aiming to Revolutionize Digital Payments XRP is a cryptocurrency designed to make money move as fast as information. It runs on the XRP Ledger, a decentralized system without a central authority. Transactions are quick, low-cost, and secure. With XRP, you don’t need a bank account to send or receive funds. It’s open to everyone, borderless, and resists censorship or counterfeiting. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP started with 100 billion coins. They gave 80 billion to Ripple, a company working to improve the network and support the ecosystem. Ripple uses XRP to boost liquidity and help with currency exchanges. To control the supply, they’ve placed 55 billion XRP in escrow, releasing it slowly over time. The name XRP comes from “ripple credits,” showing its goal to make payments flow smoothly across different currencies. In the current market, XRP stands out for its speed and low transaction fees. Compared to other coins, it offers practical solutions for global payments. As digital transactions grow, XRP’s technology could make it an attractive option for those looking for efficient and affordable transfers. Conclusion In the current bull run, coins like XRP perform well, but XYZVerse’s unique sports-memecoin fusion positions it for remarkable growth and potential to outshine others.

The analyst revealed a bullish pattern that could send Dogecoin to as high as $5. Dogecoin Price Set To Explode To As High As $5 In an X post , Trader Tardigrade predicted that the Dogecoin price could explode to as high as $5. This came as he noted that Dogecoin is set to finish the final stage of its bull run . The crypto analyst added that the Chande Momentum Oscillator (ChandeMO) indicates that DOGE still has a long way to go before reaching the top in this cycle. The crypto analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the Dogecoin price could rally to as high as $5 based on this ChandeMO indicator. There was also the possibility of the foremost meme coin even rallying further to $9 in this market cycle. Trader Tardigrade has continued to provide a bullish outlook for the meme coin in his analyses, suggesting that DOGE could indeed witness a parabolic rally. Before now, the crypto analyst mentioned that the Dogecoin price is aligning with the 50 Arnaud Legoux Moving Average (ALMA). He further remarked that this pattern is perfectly synchronized with the last cycle from 2018 to 2020. Based on this development, he added that DOGE is in the midst of a surge. The crypto analyst had also previously predicted that the Dogecoin price could reach double digits in this market cycle. According to him, if the meme coin mirrors the 2021 bull cycle , it could rally to as high as $30. Meanwhile, he predicted that DOGE could rally to $8.7 if it mirrors the 2017 bull run. DOGE Closes Above The Macro .786 Fib In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital revealed that the Dogecoin price has officially closed a daily candle above the macro .786 Fibonacci level. In line with this, the crypto analyst remarked that the goal now is to see a follow-through to the upside. He added that is this happens, then the previous highs at the macro golden pocket around $0.48 is next. The crypto analyst previously revealed that the Dogecoin price closed a daily candle outside of a falling wedge pattern and mentioned that $0.41 was the next important price level. With Dogecoin reaching this level, the $0.48 target is the next level to keep an eye on, as the crypto analyst suggested. In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto stated that the Dogecoin price is aiming for $0.66. He remarked that DOGE would take off after breaking out of the symmetrical triangle. The crypto analyst added that bullish momentum is building. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.4, down almost 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Altcoin News|Dogecoin|Analyst|crypto|Crypto Analyst|crypto news|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-19 07:00:20

Nevertheless, meme coins remain highly volatile and risky assets, and investors should be wary before allocating funds to them. The president-elect shook the entire crypto market on Friday night when he announced the launch of the OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP) meme coin and invited his millions of followers and supporters to join his community. Despite the controversial launch and fears about a potential hack or a scam, the token became an overnight sensation. Its price is now worth $40, while its market capitalization has soared past $8 billion, making it the third-largest meme coin, sitting behind only DOGE and SHIB. With this remarkable rise in value within mere hours, the number of success stories for traders who got in early (possibly insiders) and have already sold some portions to capture massive profits has gone through the roof. Turned $1.1M into $70M in just 4 hours—incredible! This trader has sold 1.35M $TRUMP for $3.65M, and still holds 4.62M $TRUMP ($67.5M), bringing his total profit to over $70M! https://t.co/m1k6zmKgLA pic.twitter.com/U3IeU23PER — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 18, 2025 After the initial buying spree, more information emerged later from Lookonchain about deposits to large exchanges, such as OKX, where the same traders most likely capitalized on the price rally by selling off their tokens. Whale “Fpj236…uVJr” deposited all 1.27M $TRUMP ($43.9M) into #OKX an hour ago, with a profit of $29.6M! https://t.co/RN5fXx11CW pic.twitter.com/4HyHZSHgou — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 19, 2025 One of the more famous traders, which Lookonchain called ‘legendary,’ made $6.8 million on the TRUMP token within a day after securing a $12.5 million profit from BOME last year. OFFICIAL TRUMP’s launch was a highly successful and impressive story. However, not all meme coins have the same spectacular path. There are thousands of such tokens released on a daily basis, and most turn into quick rug pulls, leaving investors with empty hands. As such, traders should be wary when dealing with meme coins, even if they are launched by the upcoming US president.

This surge in stablecoin issuance highlights the growing activity within the ecosystem and the increasing adoption of the XRP Ledger for financial applications, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi). JUST IN Total 7,876,559 #RLUSD Minted In Last 24 Hours #XRP Ledger pic.twitter.com/Y8V1VdYqpA — XRP CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) January 17, 2025 RLUSD, a stablecoin issued on the XRP Ledger, is gaining traction as a reliable asset for transactions and settlements. The latest data from the XRP Ledger showcases multiple high-value transactions involving RLUSD, such as a 690,000 RLUSD transfer and another for 2,008,333 RLUSD. These transactions emphasize the scalability and efficiency of the ledger in handling large volumes of digital assets with minimal transaction costs. For example, fees for these transfers were as low as 0.000135 XRP, further reinforcing the utility of the XRP Ledger as a cost-effective platform. The rapid minting of RLUSD aligns with the broader adoption of stablecoins in the cryptocurrency industry. Stablecoins like RLUSD are crucial for mitigating volatility in digital asset markets, providing users with a stable value tied to fiat currencies while leveraging the transparency and speed of blockchain technology. With RLUSD gaining momentum, the XRP Ledger is solidifying its position as a preferred platform for stablecoin issuance and DeFi applications.

During an interview with Bloomberg, Ripple President Monica Long recently expressed confidence about the prospects of an XRP ETF . She highlighted the improving regulatory landscape in the United States, creating favorable conditions for cryptocurrency-based financial products. The push for an XRP ETF gained traction in October 2024 when Bitwise became the first asset manager to file an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This move was soon followed by filings from other major institutions, including Canary Capital and 21Shares, signaling strong institutional interest in XRP as an investment vehicle. An XRP ETF, if approved, is expected to drive further adoption by providing institutional and retail investors with regulated exposure to XRP. Market analysts believe such a product could catalyze mainstream acceptance of XRP and its associated technologies, such as the XRP Ledger. As RLUSD continues to gain momentum and institutional interest in XRP grows, the ecosystem appears poised for significant growth. Whether through stablecoin adoption or the introduction of ETFs, the XRP Ledger is solidifying its role as a foundational platform for blockchain-based financial solutions.

Related Reading: Chainlink Weekly Chart Looks Promising – If Bulls Reclaim $30 ‘ATH Are Next’ Chainlink Faces Potential Correction In a recent X post, More Crypto Online shared a cautious technical analysis of the LINK market. Using the Elliott Wave Theory, these analysts have determined Chainlink must stay above $23.85 to preserve its current bullish trend. For context, the Elliott Wave Theory is a trading tool used by traders to predict market breeds based on crowd psychology and market cycles. In price prediction, the Elliott Wave Theory can often present a white scenario i.e. the optimistic bullish case and the yellow wave i.e. an alternative case most likely a correction before an uptrend continues. For the LINK market, the white scenario assumes upward movement will continue provided the asset stays over $23.85 which represents a critical support zone. Any price fall below $23.85 could cause a shift in market dynamics, potentially halting Chainlink’s bullish charge. However, there is also potential for a corrective yellow wave. In this context, this yellow wave follows as an initial upward movement and represents only a temporary pullback before the trend resumes its bullish trajectory. According to the analysts at More Crypto Online, if LINK dips below $23.85, the corrective wave is expected to occur between $19.26 and $22.39, converting this region to a potential retracement zone for further gains.

In other news, certain crypto analysts are highly bullish on LINK amidst the asset’s price rally. In an X post, market pundit AMCrypto has backed Chainlink to experience massive price gains in February. According to AMCrypto, LINK is currently still in consolidation despite recent gains. The analyst predicts the cryptocurrency will experience more weeks of range-bound movement below $30, before executing a major price breakout in February. Based on AMCrypto’s forecast, Chainlink is expected to trade as high as $54 in this projected price surge indicating a potential 125.37% gain on the coin’s current market price. At the time of writing, LINK trades at $23.95 following a 2.75% decline in the past day. On the other hand, the tokens’ trading volume valued at $957.45 million reflects a 13.97% gain in the past day. With a market cap of $23.94 billion, Chainlink continues to rank as the 12th largest cryptocurrency in the world.

The BTC price dropped to around $90,000 earlier this month before reclaiming $100,000 on Thursday. Since then, the prices have continued to surge, hitting a high of $105,900 on Friday. Trump’s new meme token has stirred the Bitcoin and overall crypto community On Friday, Trump launched his new meme token, sending shockwaves through the world of Bitcoin and crypto. Crypto investor and Youtuber Anthony Pompliano even asked investors to “buckle up,” saying financial markets were not prepared for what was to come. At the time, the meme token’s market cap was close to hitting $8 billion , but it has now climbed to nearly $9 billion. Moreover, CNBC crypto trader and founder of Crypto Banter Ran Neuner remarked: “The Trump meme coin is real. This is just a taste of what we can expect for the next four years!” You’re not bullish enough.” ~ Ran Neuner Most analysts and traders are bracing for continued volatility across crypto markets. Nonetheless, Trump’s promotion of his new meme coin has sent an optimistic message that he intends to fulfill his crypto promises, fueling analysts’ expectations. On Friday afternoon, Bitcoin was already trading at $104,800 before surging to $105,900 later in the day. Bitcoin is trading at $105,283, a 0.83% rise in the last 24 hours. Its 24-hour trading volume is at $50.24 billion. News on possible crypto orders has also helped to push BTC prices up Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to issue over 100 executive orders immediately after his inauguration. Some have hinted that some of the executive orders will be related to Bitcoin or crypto, rallying high price expectations once he enters office. According to sources familiar with the matter, analysts should expect at least one crypto executive order for the first 100 days of Trump’s term. Furthermore, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.9% in the 12 months through December. According to traders, this makes another Fed rate cut seem more likely, which could make Bitcoin more attractive. As we await a new presidency, the collective insights from many analysts paint a diverse picture of Bitcoin’s potential trajectory. While some predict stability or modest gains, reflecting a tempered optimism, others anticipate more pronounced fluctuations driven by investor sentiment and political climate changes.

The asset has now received backing from two of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges amid its mindblowing rally and spectacular trading volumes. Binance, Coinbase Join the Pack It’s not every day that you see the release of a meme coin by a former and upcoming US president. But we do live in wild times, and that’s what happened on Friday evening when the president-elect, who will return to office on January 20, announced the launch of such a token dubbed Official Trump. Within a day or so, the asset exploded in value and is currently the 23rd-largest, according to CoinGecko, and 21st-biggest on CoinMarketCap. Despite the discrepancies, both platforms agree that its price is well above $43, and its market cap is somewhere around $9 billion, creating numerous success stories in the meantime. Moreover, the trading volumes went through the roof (over $11 billion within a 24-hour period). This has turned many leading exchanges toward the TRUMP token. Binance and Coinbase were the latest (and among the biggest) to join the craze. The largest US-based crypto exchange said it had added TRUMP to its roadmap, which typically means that it will be listed for trading soon. Binance noted that trading for TRUMP will begin on January 19 at 8:30 UTC, and the first pairs will be against the two biggest stablecoins, USDC and USDT. Withdrawals will be available from January 20 at the same time. Above PEPE After speculating yesterday whether TRUMP can become the largest meme coin by market cap, the asset, which was in fourth place at that time, has climbed a spot and is now above PEPE. The frog-based meme token peaked at around $0.000021 yesterday, but when the TRUMP mania went wild, it started to lose value rapidly. It now sits below $0.000018, down by 15% within a day. Its market cap has dropped to $7.5 billion on CG, well below TRUMP’s $9 billion. Next on Official Trump’s path toward the number one spot is Shiba Inu, which is also down daily. Its market cap stands close to $13 billion, which seems doable given the massive rally that transpired since TRUMP’s launch.

The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the JITO price from an immediate surge. However, if the JITO price successfully breaks above $3.472, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $4.32. If bulls cannot initiate a surge, JITO price may drop below the immediate support line at $3.122, resulting in a correction to $2.752. Is Jito a good investment? For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network’s largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2024 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Why is the JTO price down today? JTO’s price lost its momentum around $3.5, resulting in a minor correction. Buyers are currently defending a drop below $3. Will JTO’s price recover? If JTO’s price faces buying demand around the current price level, we might see a strong rebound and JTO might surge toward $4. Will JTO reach $10? JTO price might reach the $10 mark in 2025 if buying demand surges and Jito attracts altcoin investors. However, our JTO price prediction states it might reach the $10 level by 2026. Will JTO price reach $100? Due to the effort of the Solana community, JITO Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is currently no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment. Recent news/opinion on JTO news Solana staking pool Jito clocked monthly revenue from priority fees and tips of more than $100 million in November and December, according to a Dec. 26 note from Kairos Research, a cryptocurrency researcher. Jito price prediction January 2025 Over the last few days, JTO coin prices have aimed to surge above crucial Fib levels.

Burniske tells his 317,600 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) four-year cycle may witness an abrupt end with the installment of a pro-crypto US government. BTC’s four-year cycle is based on halving events when Bitcoin miner rewards are slashed in half every four years. In the past, halvings have correlated with parabolic rallies for Bitcoin as the reduction in new BTC emissions created an imbalance between supply and demand. Says Burniske, “Continue to believe there are high odds we break the simplistic four-year cycle that BTC has honored the last ~12 years… With a supportive US administration, crypto could be entering a Goldilocks period over the next many years, where returns aren’t as parabolic, but instead we see steadier growth, not to mention majors stop suffering 85-95% drawdowns.” In investing, a Goldilocks scenario is when an asset class sees moderate and sustainable growth over a long period of time. Burniske also predicts market meltdowns that crypto investors have been accustomed to will likely be in the rearview mirror once digital assets enter Goldilocks territory. He believes that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will support the steady rise of crypto assets while minimizing market drawdowns. “On drawdowns: I’m not saying they’ll stop, I’m saying it’s possible they get less extreme for the majors, which could whiplash people who overtrade with too much aggression… I also think BTC and ETH both having ETFs, and perhaps SOL+ soon, will provide more consistent buying pressure for these assets.” While the investor believes in steady growth for large-cap coins, he notes that digital assets could still witness gut-wrenching corrections but they likely won’t be as severe as the ones seen in the past. “If you ever want to see the percentage drawdown BTC could be exposed to, look at the 200-week SMA (simple moving average), which has been our most reliable technical support each bearish period. Right now at ~$40,000 that suggests a 60% drawdown is possible, which is a far cry from 80%+ (has to drop another 50% from 60% down, to hit 80% down). As BTC rises, so too will the 200-week SMA.” Burniske concludes by saying that 2025 will likely be a “great year” for crypto investors.
