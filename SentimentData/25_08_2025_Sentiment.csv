A new wave of layer-1 blockchains is emerging as serious contenders, offering scalability, interoperability, and sustainability as their edge. Among the most promising are Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Polkadot (DOT), each carving out a unique position in the market. As this momentum builds, many traders are preparing for the next altcoin season. Some investors are also looking at newer projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has been gaining attention as a strong diversifier alongside these major contenders. Cardano (ADA): The “Slow and Steady” Innovator Cardano is built on a peer-reviewed, research-first philosophy, making it one of the most methodical projects in crypto. Its proof-of-stake consensus ensures security and energy efficiency while its governance model gives ADA holders the ability to vote on development funding. Recent upgrades like Project Acropolis and the upcoming Hydra scaling solution highlight its steady but impactful growth path. While not the fastest in terms of transaction speeds, its academic foundation and community-driven treasury system make it a long-term favorite. Solana (SOL): The High-Speed Contender Solana has established itself as one of the fastest blockchains in the industry, capable of handling thousands of transactions per second at negligible costs. This efficiency makes it popular in gaming, DeFi, and NFT applications. The network continues to evolve with new stress tests proving its scalability. Institutional interest is also growing, with multiple Solana-related ETFs under consideration, signaling that Wall Street is watching closely. A Hidden Gem with Big Potential While established blockchains like ADA, SOL, and DOT are solid bets, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become one of the most talked-about tokens of 2025 . Early rounds sold out rapidly, attracting both retail and institutional attention. Analysts highlight its strong fundamentals, audited smart contracts, and growing community as reasons it could deliver extraordinary returns. With forecasts suggesting a possible 50x surge for early backers , MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as not just another altcoin, but a project with breakout potential that could rival early successes like XRP and SOL once it secures major exchange listings. Polkadot (DOT): The Interoperability Champion Polkadot takes a different approach, focusing on interoperability through its relay chain and parachain ecosystem. This design allows different blockchains to communicate seamlessly, a key step toward realizing Web3. Its recent Polkadot 2.0 upgrade introduced elastic scaling, which dynamically adjusts resources based on demand. The return of Gavin Wood as CEO of Parity Technologies has also boosted confidence in the project’s long-term vision. Final Thoughts Cardano, Solana, and Polkadot represent three of the strongest plays for the future of blockchain. Cardano appeals to those who value security and academic rigor, Solana dominates in speed and scalability, and Polkadot is paving the way for a truly connected Web3. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing investor imagination with its explosive growth potential and record-breaking presale momentum. As altcoin season nears, these projects could define the next phase of the crypto market.

The latest Shiba Inu (SHIB) market analysis shows wallet activity jumping 30%, sparking fresh retail excitement, yet doubts remain about its real utility. Despite growing wallet numbers, SHIB struggles to turn this attention into lasting value. The TRUMP coin price also exposes hesitation. Even after a sentiment spike following Donald Trump’s meeting with Vladimir Putin, momentum fizzled. The coin traded in a narrow band without any major breakout, showing weak follow-through. However, BlockDAG (BDAG) is writing a different story. With over $381 million raised, Batch 29 priced at $0.0276 before an expected $0.05 launch, and a projected 2660% ROI, BlockDAG is delivering real traction. Features like Buyer Battles and rapid adoption have pulled it into the spotlight. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Market Analysis: Wallet Growth Without Clear Utility Fresh data showing a 30% rise in new wallets has reignited interest in Shiba Inu (SHIB). Driven by community hype, SHIB has a history of sudden surges when sentiment flips. Some believe this jump could be an early sign of another rally. Still, analysts warn wallet growth does not always signal strong buying pressure. Many new accounts may be short-term speculation rather than serious accumulation. History does suggest, however, that similar waves of activity preceded SHIB’s explosive 2021 rally when retail excitement pushed it to extreme highs. In the bigger picture, SHIB’s movements often mirror risk appetite across the market. A surge in speculative plays can signal confidence that spills into larger assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Whether this wallet surge sparks a breakout or fades will define SHIB’s near-term story. TRUMP Coin Price: Political Buzz Without Market Strength The TRUMP coin price has become a telling case. Optimism spiked after Donald Trump’s meeting with Vladimir Putin, fueling speculation that political narratives could spill into crypto. Weighted sentiment climbed to its highest level in more than a month. Despite this surge, the TRUMP coin price stayed locked between $8.40 and $9.50, failing to break resistance. Technical indicators like the Chaikin Money Flow showed outflows, suggesting the hype lacked strong capital backing. Momentum signals also pointed to weakness. The MACD kept flipping but failed to create lasting bullish momentum. For many, the TRUMP coin price shows the limits of relying on political events. The lack of real inflows kept it from building a sustainable run. BlockDAG: $381M Raised, 2660% ROI Potential, & Buyer Battles Fueling Buzz BlockDAG is charting a different course with concrete results. Having raised more than $381 million, the project’s presale ranks among the largest of the year. Batch 29 is currently priced at $0.0276, with a target launch price of $0.05. This structure gives early buyers near-double gains before listing even begins. The headline figure is the projected 2660% ROI, supported by the presale’s performance, broad adoption, and its hybrid blockchain-DAG framework. Unlike speculative runs, this projection leans on data and adoption milestones rather than empty promises. Adding to its momentum is Buyer Battles, a gamified presale feature where the day’s top buyer secures all unsold tokens from the daily 50M allocation, at no cost. This mechanic has not only kept presale engagement high but also intensified competition among participants, ensuring steady traction. Together, BlockDAG’s funding, ROI potential, and gamified presale strategy create a compelling contrast to SHIB and TRUMP. Instead of chasing sentiment, BlockDAG is offering structure and rewards that deepen participation. Closing Note The gap between speculation and substance has rarely been clearer. Shiba Inu’s latest wallet spike, shown in the Shiba Inu (SHIB) market analysis, highlights its struggle to hold long-term momentum. The TRUMP coin price reveals how political hype fades without capital inflows. BlockDAG stands apart. With $381 million already raised, a presale entry at $0.0276 ahead of a $0.05 launch, and a projected 2660% ROI, it has secured attention with tangible achievements. Buyer Battles further amplify engagement, offering daily incentives that keep participation alive. As the market sorts hype from execution, BlockDAG’s strategy of combining community activity with measurable results makes it a standout. Where SHIB and TRUMP ride on sentiment, BlockDAG is proving its case with adoption, structure, and momentum that could define the next breakout.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Cardano, MATIC, Arbitrum, and Aave are being ranked among the best altcoins with a 20,000% ROI outlook. Here’s why traders are watching them closely. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Community-Driven Altcoin With Security at Its Core MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly gaining traction as one of the best altcoins with a 20,000% ROI outlook. Built on a zero-tax and transparent framework, the project has attracted wide interest for its community-first approach and verified smart contract audits. With early metrics already surpassing other meme-inspired assets, MAGACOIN combines cultural appeal with real DeFi use cases. Analysts argue that the blend of meme culture and serious utility gives it staying power in a crowded market. Traders looking for early-stage altcoins are paying close attention to MAGACOIN as listings approach. Cardano Sentiment Amid Market Moves Cardano is also ranked among the best altcoins with a 20,000% ROI outlook. The token surged over 130% since July before cooling off near $0.85. While some see this as a healthy pause, others worry the uptrend may be losing steam. At the same time, debates inside the Cardano community around treasury allocation and governance have created a split in sentiment. With a pending audit report due to address older financial concerns, ADA’s next move could be shaped by both price action and community confidence. Polygon (MATIC/POL): Strength in DeFi and Enterprise Adoption Polygon remains in focus as one of the best altcoins with a 20,000% ROI outlook, driven by fresh growth in DeFi and corporate adoption. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) hit $1.23 billion in 2025, fueled by activity on QuickSwap, Polymarket, and record stablecoin settlements. Polygon Labs is also pushing for enterprise use cases, framing the network as a reliable backbone for tokenized assets and on-chain finance. With more than 97% of holders upgrading from MATIC to POL, the project continues to solidify its place in the market. Arbitrum (ARB): Expanding Into Public Finance and GameFi Arbitrum is earning its place among the best altcoins with a 20,000% ROI outlook thanks to new partnerships and ecosystem growth. The state of Wyoming selected Arbitrum to help launch its stablecoin FRNT, a U.S. Treasury-backed digital asset — a first for blockchain-based public finance. Beyond this, a proposal to integrate Ronin, the network behind Axie Infinity, into Arbitrum Orbit could introduce over 1 million new users. These developments highlight the network’s growing relevance in both institutional finance and gaming. Aave (AAVE): Growing Through Institutional Collaboration Aave is also ranked among the best altcoins with a 20,000% ROI outlook. The DAO recently partnered with Kraken’s Ink Foundation, enabling its V3 protocol to power lending on Kraken’s new Layer 2 network. This deal includes a revenue-sharing model, marking a fresh pathway for predictable returns. At the same time, integration with Pendle Finance has fueled billions in fixed-income exposure, boosting Aave’s role as a key DeFi infrastructure. Its mix of enterprise adoption and yield-driven strategies continues to draw interest from traders. What Traders Should Do Next For traders seeking exposure to the best altcoins with a 20,000% ROI outlook, diversification across proven ecosystems and community-driven projects is key. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as an early-stage opportunity with momentum building quickly. With listings expected soon, timing could be critical.

This includes the growing projections that say the price could explode from the current $0.09 to as high as $4 this year. Furthermore, the projection also shows that Remittix could break out by the end of this year, potentially replacing Dogecoin and Cardano as a top 10 cryptocurrency. According to the growth analysis, Remittix has seen a rising accumulation that is making it the best crypto presale to buy now, with over $21 million raised. However, here is the analysis that shows why Remittix could displace Dogecoin and Cardano from the top 10 soon. Cardano Price Muted Near $1 Since April The Cardano price saw a huge sell-off in February, which has seen the price continue struggling below $1. Although it attempted to reclaim a position above $1 in March and Early August, the price has failed to succeed. This weak price momentum is now fueling a bearish sentiment, which could see Cardano out of the top 10 spot in the coming months. However, while the price remained bearish, there are some factors experts believe could help see a price change later this year. These factors include: a rise in digital currency built on the Cardano blockchain Growth in cross-border payments is fueled by the recent network upgrade And the change to bullish sentiment with an eventual Cardano ETF approval Although these factors could lead to a price pump in the future, the current decline rate may cause ADA to drop out of the top 10 before the positive results take effect. Is There Still Game For The Dogecoin Bull In 2025 Dogecoin has since fallen out of the top investment of 2025, with the price repeatedly losing ground at significant support. Also, the rise in new meme coin favourites in the market, such as the TRUMP coin, BONK, and PEPE, is fueling further sell-off. However, Dogecoin maintains a significant hold of the meme coin market, remaining the biggest meme coin by market cap. But, with the Dogecoin price trading 46% below the 2025 high, investors are losing hope of a potential Dogecoin bull. Also, while the Dogecoin market cap still sees it at a number 8 position in the crypto market, experts say the ongoing sell-off could see it out of the top 10 soon. Remittix Cap Surge, Becoming The Best Crypto Presale To Buy Now The Remittix cap has surged to over $21 million in the last few days as buying momentum grows to a record high. Analysts are saying this surge in demand is mirroring the path of BNB, XRP, and ETH, making Remittix the best crypto presale to buy now with 50x potential. Analysis shows Remittix proportion is a top-tier solution capable of helping it capture up to 10% of the 190T payment market in the coming months. Furthermore, the crypto-to-fiat solution of the Remittix coin is becoming a highly sought-after solution that could revolutionize the payment market. Moreover, with the Remittix token set for a market entry this year, the adoption looks highly positive to skyrocket. This also shows Remittix with the potential to displace Dogecoin and Cardano downward in their top 10 spot. But with Remittix still at $0.0969, analysts are projecting a price change of up to $4 later this year.

Metaplanet Bitcoin , a trailblazing Tokyo-listed firm, has achieved a truly significant milestone, marking a new era for crypto-forward companies. Its recent promotion from small-cap to mid-cap status within the prestigious FTSE Global Equity Index Series, and subsequent addition to the FTSE Japan Index, is a monumental leap forward. This development, as reported by Cointelegraph, powerfully underscores the growing influence of Bitcoin treasuries in traditional finance and signals a shifting landscape for institutional adoption. What Does Metaplanet Bitcoin’s Inclusion in FTSE Japan Index Mean? This isn’t just a minor update for Metaplanet; it’s a powerful statement reverberating across global markets. FTSE Russell, a highly respected subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG), officially announced this pivotal change in their Semi-Annual Review on August 22. The reclassification, set to take effect after markets close on September 19, means Metaplanet is now recognized alongside larger, more established companies operating within Japan’s dynamic economy. For Metaplanet Bitcoin , this promotion signifies: Increased Visibility: Greater exposure to a wider pool of investors. Enhanced Credibility: A stamp of approval from a leading global index provider. Potential for Growth: Attracting more institutional investment interest and capital. Being part of the FTSE Japan Index elevates Metaplanet’s profile considerably. It means more fund managers and institutional investors will actively consider it for their portfolios, given its enhanced liquidity and market presence. This move highlights a broader, undeniable trend where companies with significant Bitcoin holdings are increasingly gaining traction and legitimacy in conventional financial markets, challenging long-held perceptions. The Unstoppable Power of Bitcoin: Fueling Metaplanet Bitcoin’s Phenomenal Growth The undeniable driving force behind Metaplanet’s impressive ascent is its visionary and strategic accumulation of Bitcoin. The company proudly holds an astounding 18,888 BTC in its treasury. This substantial holding firmly positions Metaplanet as the seventh-largest publicly traded holder of Bitcoin globally, according to comprehensive data compiled by BitcoinTreasuries.net. To truly put this into perspective, Metaplanet Bitcoin now holds more Bitcoin than well-known and influential entities such as Coinbase, Tesla, and Hut 8. This aggressive and forward-thinking Bitcoin treasury strategy has clearly paid off handsomely. By embracing Bitcoin, Metaplanet has not only created a robust hedge against inflation and currency devaluation but has also strategically positioned itself as a unique and compelling investment opportunity within the competitive Japanese market. Their unwavering commitment to Bitcoin has effectively differentiated them, attracting significant attention from both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and discerning traditional investors alike, eager to capitalize on this innovative approach. Why is This a Game Changer for Metaplanet Bitcoin and the Crypto Ecosystem? Metaplanet’s inclusion in the FTSE Japan Index is far more than just a corporate achievement; it represents a profound and significant step forward for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. It provides further, undeniable validation for Bitcoin as a legitimate, valuable, and increasingly recognized treasury asset. When a reputable and influential index like FTSE includes a company primarily known for its substantial Bitcoin holdings, it sends a clear and unequivocal message to the entire financial world: Bitcoin is not only here to stay but is actively driving tangible corporate value and innovation. This groundbreaking development could powerfully inspire other publicly traded companies, particularly within Japan and across the dynamic Asian markets, to seriously explore and implement similar Bitcoin treasury strategies. It demonstrably shows a viable and successful pathway for seamlessly integrating digital assets into traditional corporate finance, potentially accelerating institutional adoption on a global scale. The ripple effect of Metaplanet Bitcoin ‘s success could be truly substantial, reshaping corporate financial strategies worldwide. Looking Ahead: The Monumental Impact of Metaplanet Bitcoin’s Strategic Move What does this monumental shift mean for the future trajectory of both Metaplanet and the wider crypto space? Metaplanet’s enhanced status will almost certainly lead to increased trading volume for its stock and, consequently, improved stock performance. Moreover, it establishes a critical precedent for how traditional financial indices will evaluate and categorize companies with significant digital asset exposure moving forward. We might very well see more indices adapting their criteria to explicitly acknowledge the growing and indispensable role of cryptocurrencies in corporate balance sheets across various industries. This bold move by Metaplanet Bitcoin is a powerful testament to foresight, courage, and strategic planning. It vividly showcases how innovative approaches to treasury management can lead to remarkable growth, unparalleled recognition, and significant influence within the highly competitive global financial landscape. It’s an unmistakable signal that the convergence of traditional finance and the revolutionary crypto world is not just a distant possibility but a rapidly unfolding and exciting reality. In conclusion, Metaplanet’s promotion to the prestigious FTSE Japan Index, undeniably driven by its substantial Bitcoin treasury, marks a pivotal and transformative moment. It profoundly validates Bitcoin’s role as a legitimate corporate asset, significantly enhances Metaplanet’s market standing, and critically paves the way for even greater institutional crypto adoption globally.

These presale tokens come with the possibility of going up in value by multiples, giving investors a scarce chance to jump on a project before it becomes popular. This week, three standout projects are being ranked among the best crypto presales to buy now: MAGACOIN FINANCE , Bitcoin (BTC) , and Dogecoin (DOGE) —tipped for 30x ROI potential by leading analysts. These tokens are prime candidates for explosive growth due to certain factors. Let’s analyze those factors one by one. MAGACOIN FINANCE — The Breakout Presale With 30x Potential At the top of the best crypto presales list is MAGACOIN FINANCE , a powerful new project capturing major attention in the early investment community. Experts believe it has the right mix of early-stage potential, strong community support, and growth-focused tokenomics. It’s gaining attention as a high-upside choice for those seeking big returns this cycle. The countdown is live and only a limited number of tokens remain. Demand is surging before the next price jump. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been selected as one of the best altcoins to buy for investors building aggressive bull run portfolios. For investors seeking massive upside in early-stage crypto, MAGACOIN FINANCE ranks among the best crypto presales available this year — and possibly this cycle. Bitcoin (BTC) — Market Leader Now Entering a Strategic Accumulation Phase While Bitcoin is recording strong surges, many analysts are treating the current market consolidation near $113,000–$114,000 as a rare “re-entry window” — and with good reason. BTC recently slipped below $114,000 amid heightened trading volume and mixed sentiment. Support lies at $112,000 with bears watching the $110,000 level. However, U.S. banking groups are pushing for friendlier crypto regulations, and the SEC is updating oversight policies, potentially paving the way for broader institutional access. BTC/USDT Chart: TradingView Despite volatility, major players like Harvard and MicroStrategy continue buying. Over 30% of circulating BTC is now held by centralized institutions. If BTC rebounds above $116K, analysts forecast a retest of $120K and possibly new highs by Q4. For long-term investors, Bitcoin remains one of the best crypto presales in spirit — offering a relatively discounted price for an asset still poised to lead the next bull run. Dogecoin (DOGE) — Meme Coin King Ripe for Institutional Breakout Dogecoin continues to surprise analysts with its growing institutional appeal and on-chain adoption. Though not a traditional presale, DOGE’s current price action and whale activity make it behave like a stealth presale opportunity before the next big breakout. DOGE is trading just above critical support at $0.22. Analysts warn of a drop to $0.18 if support breaks, but a rebound to $0.30 is likely with ETF approval news. With an 80% approval probability, Dogecoin could be the next meme coin to attract institutional ETF capital. The growing number of Dogecoin application scenarios, investors’ trust in it, and the favorable regulatory outlook are all factors that make the presale of Dogecoin one of the best in the crypto space with the potential of a steep rise of value, thus turning it into an asset that is still valuable at its current price.

50624094,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=791365,1756078803,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50624094.jpeg,Food lobby begs Trump for tariff carveouts on cucumbers and fis,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/food-lobby-begs-trump-for-tariff-carveouts/,"Food industry leaders in the U.S. are flooding Trump’s trade team with one message: don’t slap tariffs on products we can’t grow. That plea, coming from grocers, seafood firms, restaurants, and fresh produce lobbies, follows the White House decision this month to hit dozens of countries with a wave of new duties. According to the Financial Times , Trump’s latest tariffs have pushed America’s overall trade tax rate to the highest it’s been in decades, and food lobbyists are now working overtime to get their most vulnerable products exempted. Their pitch is blunt: some items just aren’t grown in this country at scale, and tariffs on them are going to wreck prices across the food chain. Instead of launching an all-out war on Trump’s policy, the lobbyists are going in one-by-one, trying to carve out exceptions for cucumbers, fish, shrimp, pineapples, coffee; anything that could make a grocery bill worse. Seafood industry defends imports as essential Gavin Gibbons, the chief strategy officer at the National Fisheries Institute, argued that the seafood trade should be treated differently. “There are so many voices, so many products that say, ‘Well, we just need an exemption, because we’re unlike others’,” he said, and added, “We would like an exemption for all [seafood].” Gavin said that 85 percent of seafood consumed in the U.S. is imported, and American fisheries are already capped at their legal harvest limits. Expanding domestic fish farms isn’t feasible either, thanks to tight federal rules. Government data shows the U.S. had a $24 billion seafood trade deficit in 2022, and Gavin warned that without tariff relief, that number would only grow. Shrimp is especially dependent on imports. He said 90 percent of shrimp eaten in the U.S. is brought in from abroad, and over a third of that comes from India, which Trump is now punishing with a 50 percent tariff in response to its oil deals with Russia. Restaurants are also caught in the crossfire. The National Restaurant Association sent a letter last month to trade representative Jamieson Greer warning that food prices on menus could climb fast if fresh ingredients, many of which are only available seasonally, get hit with high duties. Produce groups push back on rising food costs On the produce front, the industry is just as alarmed. The U.S. imports $36 billion worth of fresh fruits and vegetables, with Mexico leading the pack, followed by Peru for fruits and Canada for vegetables. Andy Harig, a vice-president at the Food Industry Association, which represents major grocers like Walmart and Albertsons, explained what’s at stake if exemptions aren’t granted. “Tariffs are designed to raise prices. Some of these are significant enough that they will raise prices by a very noticeable amount,” he said. Andy’s team recently analyzed the case of cucumbers, a product that’s become almost entirely import-reliant. In 1990, just 35 percent of cucumbers came from outside the U.S. That number is now close to 90 percent. If the U.S. tried to grow them year-round, it would need massive greenhouse operations — a costly undertaking that would hit shoppers hard. Andy added that his group isn’t calling for a return to old trade models. “There is still a desire to be able to ask for exemptions, and try to turn these tariffs into a more targeted and focused kind of approach to addressing both reshoring production in the U.S. and supporting U.S. jobs,” he said. There are a few trade deals on the table that might offer partial relief. A new agreement with Indonesia includes language about natural resources that aren’t available domestically, which might open a door for exemptions on things like tropical fruits. A similar line appears in the U.S.–EU trade deal, but that document doesn’t say which products might qualify. Brazil, which just got slapped with a 50 percent tariff, managed to get some foods excluded — like orange juice and Brazil nuts — while coffee was left out, despite not being produced in the U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted last month that items like coffee, mangoes, and pineapples could eventually be spared, but again, nothing’s guaranteed.

A significant Bitcoin dip caught many by surprise, as the market reacted to a massive sell-off. This sudden downturn wasn’t random; it stemmed from a single, powerful entity—often referred to as a “whale”—making a strategic move that sent ripples across the digital asset landscape. Understanding these large-scale transactions is crucial for anyone following the volatile crypto market. What Exactly Triggered This Bitcoin Dip? According to Jacob King, CEO of WhaleWire, a prominent analyst in the crypto space, a single whale initiated today’s notable Bitcoin dip . This influential trader reportedly offloaded an astonishing amount of Bitcoin, moving over 24,000 BTC in total. The sheer volume of this transaction highlights the power that individual large holders can wield over market dynamics. King detailed this activity in a recent post on X, bringing transparency to an otherwise opaque market event. The sell-off was not a one-time event but part of a larger strategy. The whale transferred more than 12,000 BTC to the Hyperunite platform today alone. This move contributed significantly to the immediate price pressure on Bitcoin. In fact, the broader sell-off had already seen 18,000 BTC, valued at approximately $2 billion, change hands. The remaining 6,000 BTC, worth around $670 million, is currently being offloaded, further intensifying the market’s reaction. Why Did the Whale Favor Ethereum After the Bitcoin Dip? Interestingly, the proceeds from this substantial Bitcoin dip -inducing sell-off are largely flowing into Ethereum (ETH). This strategic reallocation raises important questions about the whale’s perspective on the future performance of these two leading cryptocurrencies. Is this a long-term bet on Ethereum’s ecosystem growth, or a short-term arbitrage opportunity? Analysts often debate the motivations behind such significant portfolio shifts. The decision to pivot from Bitcoin to Ethereum suggests a belief in ETH’s potential for greater upside or perhaps a diversification strategy. Ethereum’s robust ecosystem, encompassing DeFi, NFTs, and a thriving developer community, might present a compelling case for large investors seeking growth beyond Bitcoin’s established store-of-value narrative. However, such large moves can also create temporary imbalances, offering opportunities or challenges for other market participants. How Do Whale Movements Impact the Market After a Bitcoin Dip? Whale movements, like the one causing this recent Bitcoin dip , demonstrate the concentrated nature of wealth in the cryptocurrency market. When an entity holding such a vast amount of assets decides to buy or sell, it can significantly influence price action. This is particularly true for less liquid assets, but even Bitcoin, with its multi-trillion-dollar market cap, is not immune. Here’s why whale activity matters: Price Volatility: Large sell-offs increase supply, driving prices down. Large buys increase demand, pushing prices up. Market Sentiment: Other traders often interpret whale moves as signals, leading to cascading buy or sell orders. Liquidity Challenges: Massive orders can strain exchange liquidity, especially during rapid movements, leading to slippage. These actions underscore the importance of monitoring on-chain data and expert analysis to understand the underlying forces driving market trends. While retail investors cannot replicate whale strategies, understanding them helps in making informed decisions. What Are the Broader Implications for Investors After This Bitcoin Dip? The recent Bitcoin dip serves as a potent reminder of the inherent volatility in the crypto market. For investors, this event highlights several key considerations: Risk Management: Always consider the potential for sudden price swings due to large-scale transactions. Diversification and setting stop-loss orders can mitigate risks. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: While short-term dips can be alarming, long-term investors often view them as buying opportunities. Assess your investment horizon carefully. Market Analysis: Stay informed about expert opinions and on-chain analytics. Sources like WhaleWire provide valuable insights into large-scale movements. Navigating these waters requires both patience and a clear strategy. Reacting impulsively to every market fluctuation can be detrimental to long-term investment goals. Instead, focus on understanding the underlying reasons behind such movements and how they fit into the broader market narrative. In conclusion, the recent Bitcoin dip , driven by a substantial whale sell-off and a pivot towards Ethereum, underscores the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While such events can cause immediate price volatility, they also offer crucial insights into the strategies of major players and the evolving landscape of digital assets. Staying informed and maintaining a well-thought-out investment strategy remains paramount for success in this exciting yet challenging space.

The Federal Reserve’s top officials met in Wyoming last week, and nobody left with a clear plan. According to Bloomberg, Jerome Powell used his Friday speech to hint at a possible interest rate cut in September. But nothing was decided. Everyone’s split. Inflation’s up. Jobs are down. And pressure from the White House is now front and center. Powell said the Fed was facing a “challenging situation.” He wasn’t joking. The central bank’s 2% inflation target is still being missed, and recent numbers suggest prices are going higher. At the same time, the job market’s taking hits. Hiring slowed sharply over the summer. While unemployment remains low, demand and supply in the labor market are both falling. Powell described the current labor conditions as “curious,” adding that it’s unclear where things are headed next. Fed clashes over rate path and political heat The divide inside the Fed became clearer during the conference. Some members want to lower rates. Others are worried it’s too soon. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said the hardest part of the job is “to get the timing right at moments of transition.” And right now, no one agrees on the timing. At July’s meeting, two Fed governors dissented when officials held rates steady. If a cut comes in September, more dissents could follow in the opposite direction. Powell didn’t sound confident. This year’s speech was weaker than last year’s, when there was stronger support for immediate cuts. Back then, inflation looked like it was fading. Not anymore. Tariffs are now visibly raising prices, and there are signs that inflation is spreading to products and services not directly affected by those tariffs. Another new detail emerged: Powell introduced a revised policy framework. The Fed has updated its internal guidebook for how it tackles inflation and jobs. The last version, made during the pandemic, focused too much on low inflation. This one is different. It brings the Fed’s attention back to its basic goals, full employment and price stability. Carolin Pflueger, an associate professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy, said Powell’s focus was clear: “His job is inflation and unemployment, and that can only be achieved within an independent Fed.” Tension grows as Trump targets the Fed Tensions at Jackson Hole weren’t just about policy. They were also about politics. President Donald Trump used the same Friday morning to go after Fed Governor Lisa Cook. He said Cook should resign or be fired because of allegations tied to mortgage fraud. Trump has been pressuring the Fed hard to cut rates, and his move against Cook was just another part of that campaign. Security around the event was the tightest it’s been in years. Armed officers from the Fed Police, U.S. Park Police, and the local sheriff’s office patrolled the lodge grounds. On Friday, they had to escort James Fishback, a known Trump supporter and critic of the Fed, out of the building. Fishback shouted at Cook in the lobby, demanding answers about the fraud accusations. The political tension didn’t go unnoticed. Harvard economist Karen Dynan, a regular at the symposium, said attendees mostly avoided discussing politics during formal sessions. But it still came up over coffee and meals. She pointed out that serious economic questions require more than gut instinct: “These are not problems that can be solved by thinking about one’s intuition or talking to just a circle of people around you. You really need this sort of expertise.” International guests responded fast to Powell’s speech. The euro rose 1% against the dollar right after he spoke. That made things worse for Europe, where inflation is already expected to drop to 1.6% next year. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Sergey Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that there’s no scheduled meeting. “Putin is ready to meet with Zelensky, when the agenda would be ready for a summit,” Lavrov said. Then he added, “And this agenda is not ready at all.” Trump had a face-to-face meeting with Putin in Alaska, then later hosted Zelensky at the White House with some European leaders in attendance. But while Trump was selling the idea of diplomacy, Russia didn’t hit pause. Instead, missile strikes on Ukraine ramped up again, one of them targeting an electronics plant tied to a U.S. company. That strike, coming days after the meetings, raised even more questions about whether Trump actually has any influence on ending the war. JD Vance, Trump’s vice president, tried to keep a straight face during his own NBC interview, saying they’re still betting on “energetic diplomacy” to end the war. “We’re going to eventually be successful, or we’ll hit a brick wall,” Vance said. “And if we hit a brick wall, then we’re going to continue this process of negotiation, of applying leverage.” That “leverage” seemed nowhere in sight by Sunday night, when Russia publicly blamed Ukraine for a drone assault on a nuclear power station. Ukraine attacks Kursk reactor and oil pipeline in the same 24 hours During Ukraine’s 34th Independence Day, drone strikes hit the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant in western Russia, near the Ukrainian border. Reactor number three’s capacity dropped by 50 percent, and Russian officials said other power infrastructure also got hit in the overnight strikes. According to the plant’s news update on Telegram, the fire was put out quickly, nobody was hurt, and radiation levels stayed normal. Two other reactors are still operating but aren’t producing power, while one remains shut for repairs. The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that radiation readings near the site were stable, posting, “Monitoring confirms normal radiation levels near Kursk NPP” on X. Alexander Khinshtein, the acting governor of Kursk, said the plant is just 60 kilometers from the border and called the drone strikes a breach of “all international conventions.” He called the attack a threat to nuclear safety, a line Moscow has used many times when its energy sites come under fire. But Ukraine wasn’t done yet. Robert Brovdi, who commands Ukraine’s Unmanned Systems Forces, confirmed they also went after the Unecha pumping station in Bryansk, which is part of the Druzhba oil pipeline. That pipeline still sends Russian crude to Hungary and Slovakia—the only two EU countries still taking fuel from Moscow. Bryansk’s governor Alexander Bogomaz said Himars rockets and drones were both used in the attack. The hit forced a total shutdown of oil deliveries to Hungary and Slovakia. Their foreign ministers, Péter Szijjártó and Juraj Blanár, told the European Commission that the suspension could last five days or more. In a letter, they wrote, “The physical and geographical reality is that without this pipeline, the safe supply of our countries is simply not possible.” Hungary gets more than half its crude from Druzhba, and this was the third time in a short period the system got hit. On Facebook, Szijjártó called it “another attack on the energy security of our country. Another attempt to drag us into war.” While the EU keeps rallying behind Kyiv with weapons and aid, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has stayed on the sidelines. He hasn’t supported military, political, or economic packages for Ukraine. And just last year, he flew to Moscow and held one-on-one talks with Putin, making him one of the only European leaders to do that since the full invasion started. Now with fuel to Hungary and Slovakia blocked and a nuclear site in Russia on fire, the gap between Trump’s version of progress and the actual events on the ground keeps getting wider.

Martins Kazaks, one of the loudest voices on its Governing Council, said the central bank is now entering a “monitoring” phase instead of constantly trying to shape the economy. Kazaks told reporters on Sunday that the ECB’s job for now is to keep an eye on things, not to intervene. “We’ve seen good news, we’ve seen bad news, but not sufficiently big news to lead to a rethink of what we would need to do,” he said. The ECB has already slashed interest rates eight times, dragging the deposit rate down to 2%. But in July, the policymakers hit pause. And next month, they’re expected to keep things steady again. Kazaks shuts down talk of another rate cut When asked about the idea of another interest rate cut, Kazaks didn’t hesitate. He said a small 25 basis-point cut would be pointless at this stage. “Another 25 basis-point cut won’t shift the economy massively,” he said. “It’s more like an insurance story in my view.” For him, that kind of cut isn’t needed. His Finnish colleague, Olli Rehn, backed that up. Rehn also spoke in a separate interview, saying, “Any ‘insurance cut’ just for its own sake wouldn’t be necessary.” Kazaks believes the market understands the message. “Markets understand us,” he said, noting that traders don’t expect another reduction this year, and that aligns well with how the ECB is looking at things. The September meeting will bring new projections, and Kazaks said those forecasts will guide any future moves. But for now, “we remain data dependent,” and “if we see that there is a need to move, then we move.” The June projections showed that inflation could drop to 1.6% in 2026 but rise again to 2% by 2027. Wage growth has slowed, just like the ECB expected, and manufacturing might finally be coming back to life after three years of struggle. Kazaks said that while inflation is where it needs to be, early next year might see a temporary dip. “We know that at the beginning of next year, we will somewhat undershoot but of course the question is, how it’ll start to rebound,” he said. EU’s trade deal faces criticism but gets defended Outside of interest rates, the broader economic picture still has cracks. A new trade agreement between the EU and the United States has reduced some uncertainty, but the 15% tariffs still sting. The tariff applies to most European exports and won’t be going away anytime soon. Kazaks said there’s some concern about cheap Chinese goods being redirected into the region, which adds more downside risks for growth. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen defended the deal in a column published in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung , calling it “a strong, if not perfect deal.” She said the agreement avoids a damaging escalation with the US and adds a layer of economic stability. “A trade war between the European Union and the US would have been celebrated by Russia and China,” she wrote. She warned that retaliatory tariffs could’ve hurt workers, consumers, and industries across Europe. Ursula said that while other US trading partners had extra tariffs slapped on top of old ones, the EU’s 15% tariff was “all inclusive,” giving European goods a cleaner path into the US market. “That allows European goods to access the US market under more favorable conditions,” she wrote, “which gives EU companies a significant advantage.” The deal was hashed out last month in Scotland between Ursula and US President Donald Trump. It hasn’t gone over well in Brussels, where lawmakers and industry groups are still fuming. But the paperwork is moving forward. Last week, both sides agreed on next steps to lower tariffs on European cars and hinted at future discussions about steel and aluminum. Brussels isn’t done pushing. Officials still want better terms for wine and spirits after failing to secure exemptions. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also backed the deal on Saturday. He said the tariffs will drag on Germany’s economy but added that a full-blown trade war with Washington would’ve been worse.

That’s it. Not even four in ten people. The Fed Chair, who is in his second term, just posted his second-worst approval rating ever. And this isn’t just a blip. The only time confidence in the position was this low in the last two decades was in 2014, when Janet Yellen was running the show. Back in 2020, Powell had 58%. Now, barely anyone’s buying what he’s selling. The Federal Reserve isn’t just dealing with inflation and unemployment anymore. It’s dealing with a public that no longer believes it has a clue what it’s doing. At the Jackson Hole symposium, Powell stepped up to deliver what’s his final headline speech as chair, just a the labor market is slowing down, which usually calls for interest rate cuts. But inflation is still alive and kicking, and the Fed doesn’t want to fuel it. Powell said an “adjustment” might be necessary, which, in Fed-speak, is code for: we’re about to cut. Powell prepares cuts as markets brace for political pressure The markets weren’t ready for that. They were expecting another boring script. What they got was Powell hinting loud and clear that rate cuts are coming, probably next month, and maybe again in the two meetings after that. The dollar tanked, bonds surged, and stocks rebounded at the end of a rough week. But there’s a risk baked into that move. The August job report doesn’t come out until September’s first week. If hiring picks up again, the Fed will have already slashed rates into a strong job market while inflation is still above target. That would be a misstep, according to Bank of America analysts, who warned that the Fed “would risk a policy error if it were to cut rates” too soon. Meanwhile, minutes after Powell’s speech, Trump put a target on Lisa Cook, one of the Fed’s board members. Wearing his red “Trump was right about everything” cap, he told reporters he’d fire her if she didn’t quit over claims about her mortgage paperwork. Lisa said she won’t be “bullied,” but that doesn’t mean anything under this administration. Trump’s grudge against Powell is personal, as he’s called him a “numbskull,” “an idiot,” and “a fool” more than once for not slashing rates earlier and harder. Now, Powell might finally be cutting, but Trump isn’t impressed. He’s already placed Stephen Miran, an ally who once argued that presidents should be able to fire central bank officials whenever they want, into a temporary Fed post. And Trump’s already replaced the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics with a loyalist. Fed independence weakens as Trump allies step in The Fed is supposed to operate outside of politics. But by the time next year’s Jackson Hole meeting happens, there’s every reason to believe the Fed will look very different. A new, Trump-approved chair will likely be running it. The question then becomes: will that chair follow data, or follow orders? That’s not some hypothetical worry. Right now, bond markets are flashing warning signs. Long-term Treasurys are performing worse than shorter-term debt, suggesting investors think the Fed will be pressured to keep interest rates too low, not because it’s good policy, but because it’s good politics. If borrowing stays cheap, Trump can keep spending big without raising taxes. That’s the real game here. Even Powell’s last stand wasn’t one-sided. He promised to fight inflation “come what may,” but also said he’s watching the labor market closely because it can unravel fast. That’s classic Fed balancing; cautious, data-driven, no sudden moves. But once Powell is out, that style may disappear. If the next chair tries to speak up or resist, it might just signal to investors that something’s wrong. Dissent could be seen as either healthy debate or proof that the chair has lost control. Either way, reading the Fed will get harder, not easier. And the stakes will be even higher.

The Sui blockchain has achieved a monumental milestone, with its cumulative Sui DEX volume soaring past an incredible $130 billion. This staggering figure highlights a significant surge in activity and adoption within the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector on Sui. What’s Behind Sui’s Explosive DEX Volume Growth? This remarkable achievement was brought to light by Marc Shawn Brown, Cointelegraph’s head of social media, who shared the news in a recent post on X. It’s not just a number; it represents a thriving ecosystem where users are actively engaging with decentralized applications. A Decentralized Exchange, or DEX, allows users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other without the need for a central intermediary. On Sui, these platforms offer a new way to interact with digital assets, providing greater control and transparency. Why Does This $130 Billion Sui DEX Volume Matter? Reaching such a high cumulative Sui DEX volume is a clear indicator of several positive trends for the Sui blockchain and its community. Let’s break down why this milestone is so important: Increased Adoption: It shows a growing user base that trusts and utilizes Sui’s DeFi protocols. More volume means more people are choosing Sui for their trading needs. Ecosystem Health: High trading activity often signals a robust and healthy ecosystem, attracting more developers and projects to build on Sui. Liquidity Depth: Significant volume contributes to deeper liquidity pools, making it easier for users to execute large trades with minimal price impact. Network Utility: This milestone underscores the practical utility of the Sui network, proving its capability to handle substantial transaction loads efficiently. What Powers Sui’s DeFi Ascent and Impressive Sui DEX Volume? Several factors contribute to Sui’s impressive growth and its substantial Sui DEX volume . The blockchain was designed with scalability and low transaction costs in mind, making it an attractive platform for DeFi activities. Sui’s unique object-centric model and parallel execution capabilities allow it to process transactions rapidly, which is crucial for high-frequency trading on DEXs.

50624521,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=791080,1756079940,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50624521.jpeg,"Analysts Say Solana And BNB Rally Exhausted, But Say Layer Brett Is Only Warming Up",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/analysts-say-solana-and-bnb-rally-exhausted-but-say-layer-brett-is-only-warming-up/,"As Binance coin (BNB) and Solana (SOL) face mounting pressure to sustain their momentum, a meme newcomer is preparing for its next mark-up phase. Market participants are witnessing an intriguing shift where trending cryptocurrencies encounter resistance while explosive platforms like Layer Brett demonstrate remarkable resilience and growth potential. Solana price under pressure despite recent gains The Solana price recently broke out of a rising wedge pattern, only to encounter selling pressure that led to lower highs. SOL’s structural support at around 181 is accompanied by an ascending trendline, but direct resistance at 187 and 189 is a problem for bulls. Furthermore, SOL’s futures open interest decreased by 7 percent to 11.5 billion, and options volume soared more than 90 percent. These changes reflect a move by traders to de-leverage, hedge exposure, and actively manage risk. On-chain activity mirrors this cautious stance. In August, capital outflow of about $85 million points to the fact that investors are cashing in or moving to more prospective projects. Layer Brett has already captured the hearts of these risk-hungry investors with its Layer 2 innovation and staking benefits. BNB’s uptrend is at risk of a reversal The BNB price jumped to a fresh record high in August, gaining more than 16% to hit a new all-time high near $900. This price action elevates Binance coin’s status as one of the best-performing top altcoins of this cycle. This positive BNB performance coincides with a wave of corporate treasury moves by institutional players. The latest to join the fray is the Hong Kong public company China Renaissance. The company announced a $100 million BNB buy, joining the likes of Windtree, BNC, and CEA Industries in unveiling BNB treasury strategies. Despite this excitement, daily volume for the Binance Coin is down by about 19% to $1.9 billion. Historically, a spike in an asset’s price amid a decrease in trading volume can signal a dip in interest from market participants. It suggests there is a potential weakening of resolve and that the uptrend could be at risk of exhaustion. Why Layer Brett is warming up amid sell-off pressure in BNB and SOL Layer Brett merges meme coin energy with advanced technical utility, a rare and powerful combination in today’s market. Its crypto presale is on fire , with the most eye-catching attraction being the enormous staking rewards. The current APY on staking $LBRETT is still above 2,620%, having started above 55,000% and gradually decreasing as more users join in. Even at this level, the rewards dwarf anything seen in other projects. What’s even more electrifying about Layer Brett is its strong fundamentals. Built on Ethereum Layer 2, $LBRETT offers speedy and cheap transactions, adding to the allure of being built using the world’s most secure smart contract blockchain. The project is also completely decentralized, requiring no KYC and offering complete self-custody of tokens after presale launch. This tech-backed meme mania, combined with irresistible staking incentives, has many predicting that $LBRETT could deliver a 120x rally by late 2025. Conclusion Solana races, and Binance Coin builds, but none match the disruptive force of Layer Brett. By merging speed, security, staking rewards, culture, and integration, this new project redefines what a breakout coin looks like in 2025. With the presale live and $LBRETT priced at just $0.0047, the window to secure early entry and participate in the $1 million giveaway is closing fast. Investors seeking exponential returns should visit the Layer Brett presale, where the digital gold rush is currently heading.

But as the next bull run looms, several alternatives, including possible even greater gains in percentage terms, are starting to emerge. Meme coins used to be dismissed in the past cycles, however, this time they have shown that they can capture massive liquidity, cultural interest, and mass adoption. Some of the tokens that have been making headway are Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, MAGACOIN FINANCE, Pepe, and Dogwifhat, each of which combines branding, momentum, and interest amongst investors. Dogecoin: Legacy power, but fading whale interest Dogecoin (DOGE) remains the most iconic meme coin, powered by Elon Musk’s backing and years of cultural dominance. It has the best name recognition in the industry and continues to command a following of long-time believers. DOGE has failed to break new highs in the second cycle, and the whales are not keen on this accumulation. Unless something is added to its utility or produces a robust development pipeline, DOGE can become less of an investment and more of a piece of culture. As analysts comment, DOGE might see retail buying periods boosting it during bull markets, but the growth potential may be minimal compared to new market meme coins. Shiba Inu: Ecosystem growth meets cooling hype Shiba Inu (SHIB) earned its spot as a serious meme contender during its explosive 2021 run. Developers have since expanded their scope with Shibarium , a Layer-2 network aiming to reduce fees and increase transaction speed. Even with these updates, SHIB has not gained much value when compared to its competitors since it remains relatively less practical. Any activity by whales also implies diminished cumulative accumulation, meaning large players are returning to invest elsewhere. Unless Shibarium achieves widespread adoption and introduces compelling dApps, SHIB may struggle to keep pace with the next generation of meme tokens, even with its loyal community. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whales’ new favorite accumulation play In contrast to DOGE and SHIB’s slowing momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become a focal point of whale interest. Built on Ethereum, the project has passed a full audit , strengthening credibility and investor trust. Its capped token supply introduces scarcity, while its presale has already drawn thousands of participants , with rounds selling out in record time. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE especially attractive is its mix of strong meme branding tied to global headlines and fundamentals that extend beyond hype. The whale trackers are reporting massive wallets with DOGE selling and MAGA purchasing, the same patterns at the beginning of SHIB and PEPE before their massive rallies. Analysts highlight forecasts of up to 15,000% ROI potential, a figure that has fueled buzz across crypto forums and Telegram groups. With cultural resonance, scarcity mechanics, and early adoption momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a meme coin that could lead the pack in the upcoming cycle. Pepe: Viral branding, but short-term risk Pepe (PEPE) captured attention in 2023 by leveraging the internet’s most recognizable frog meme. Its meteoric success meant that it was listed on the best exchanges and even pushed volumes to billions within days. Pepe branding is clearly powerful, but its performance under market conditions is irregular. The price of the token is highly dependent on speculative surges, with sharp spikes often followed by steep corrections. With no strong fundamentals or ecosystem development, analysts warn that PEPE appears to be endlessly in a loop of temporary hype. Nevertheless, its ability to attract global attention is what makes it a player during the high seasons in retailing. Dogwifhat: Solana’s breakout meme contender Dogwifhat (WIF) has earned a reputation as Solana’s leading meme coin, riding on the network’s scalability and ultra-low transaction costs. Its playful branding and viral presence on platforms like X (Twitter) have helped it achieve rapid adoption. WIF trading volumes are constantly placed at the top of the meme sector, and its community is falling in size. Nevertheless, it is highly dependent on the performance of Solana, in general. Provided that Solana can maintain its momentum, WIF may continue to build; otherwise, WIF may stagnate. Nonetheless, its status as the best Solana meme means that it will continue to see the spotlight come the next bull market. Why these five could surpass Cardano Cardano is already on a high platform with a solid foundation, but it is low-key in comparison with meme coins that thrive on a high level. DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and WIF thrive on cultural hype and rapid liquidity inflows, while MAGACOIN FINANCE blends political and meme appeal with fundamentals like scarcity, audits, and whale accumulation. This distinctive positioning allows MAGA to not only be another meme project but one that can have staying power. With an increase in retail speculation in 2025, these five altcoins are in the best position to produce explosive returns compared to Cardano. While ADA may continue steady development, investors chasing outsized returns are increasingly drawn to meme coins, with MAGACOIN FINANCE leading the charge as the most compelling play of the group. Conclusion The next bull run might not just reward old blockchains like Cardano but turn meme coins into surprising leaders. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have historical strength, but they are starting to decline. Pepe and Dogwifhat are fun, but can be uneven when it comes to sustainability. MAGACOIN FINANCE, however, combines early whale accumulation, capped supply, and strong audit credibility, placing it in a unique position to dominate. As whales rotate out of older tokens and retail traders chase the next breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE looks ready to outpace not only Cardano but also its meme rivals.

The Stargate LayerZero acquisition has officially been approved, marking a pivotal moment for omnichain bridging. This isn’t just another headline; it’s a major development that could reshape how assets move across different blockchains, promising a new era of interoperability. What Exactly Happened with the Stargate LayerZero Acquisition? The Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) of Stargate (STG), known for its omnichain-native asset bridge, has given the green light to a substantial $138 million acquisition by LayerZero (ZRO). This significant move was first reported by Unfolded on X, confirming months of speculation and negotiation within the crypto community. Initially, this proposed merger faced considerable pushback. Many STG token holders felt the initial offer, which involved merging under LayerZero’s ZRO token, undervalued their assets. They argued that the terms were unfair, leading to a period of intense debate and discussion within the Stargate DAO. Why Was There Initial Resistance to This Major Deal? The initial resistance to the Stargate LayerZero acquisition stemmed from concerns about the valuation and the future of the Stargate ecosystem. STG token holders expressed worries that the proposed terms did not adequately reflect Stargate’s true value and potential in the market. They also questioned the implications for their existing fee-sharing mechanisms and governance. This internal debate highlights the critical role of DAOs in modern crypto governance. Token holders actively participated, voiced their concerns, and ultimately influenced the negotiation process before the final approval of the Stargate LayerZero acquisition , demonstrating true decentralized power. What Does This Acquisition Mean for Stargate and Its Holders? With the approval of the Stargate LayerZero acquisition , several significant changes are on the horizon for the Stargate ecosystem and its community: DAO Dissolution: Stargate’s decentralized autonomous organization will be formally dissolved. This means the independent governance structure that STG holders participated in will cease to exist. End of Fee-Sharing: The current fee-sharing arrangements for locked STG holders will come to an end. This was a key point of contention during the initial discussions, directly impacting token economics. Operational Integration: Stargate’s operations will be fully integrated into LayerZero. This suggests a unified approach to omnichain solutions under the broader LayerZero umbrella, streamlining development and execution. For STG holders, this transition will involve a swap of their STG tokens for ZRO tokens, the specifics of which were central to the acquisition discussions and subsequent approval. How Did Other Players React to the Stargate LayerZero Acquisition? The interest in Stargate wasn’t limited to LayerZero alone. Other prominent players in the cross-chain bridging space also expressed late interest in acquiring the omnichain bridge. These included major protocols like: Wormhole: A well-known interoperability protocol that facilitates transfers between different blockchains. Axelar: Another major player providing secure cross-chain communication and asset transfers. Across: A fast, cheap, and secure cross-chain bridge, also looking to expand its capabilities. This competitive interest underscores Stargate’s strategic importance and its valuable technology within the rapidly evolving multi-chain ecosystem. The ultimate approval of the Stargate LayerZero acquisition means LayerZero successfully fended off these rival bids, solidifying its position. What’s Next for Omnichain Bridging After This Major Acquisition? The Stargate LayerZero acquisition is poised to have a profound impact on the future of omnichain bridging. By integrating Stargate’s robust bridging capabilities, LayerZero aims to strengthen its position as a leading interoperability protocol, offering a more comprehensive solution. This merger could lead to several positive outcomes for the entire blockchain ecosystem: Enhanced Security: A combined entity might offer more secure and robust bridging solutions, reducing risks associated with cross-chain transfers. Improved Efficiency: Streamlined operations could lead to faster and more cost-effective cross-chain transfers for users across various networks. Broader Ecosystem: LayerZero’s expanded reach could facilitate even more seamless interaction between diverse blockchain networks, fostering greater adoption. The crypto community will be closely watching how this integration unfolds and what innovations it brings to the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape, expecting a more unified and efficient future. A New Era for Cross-Chain Interoperability The approval of the Stargate LayerZero acquisition marks a significant milestone in the quest for true blockchain interoperability. Despite initial hurdles and competing interests, the deal moved forward, promising a unified and potentially more powerful solution for moving assets across various chains. This development underscores the dynamic nature of the crypto space, where innovation and strategic partnerships continually redefine the boundaries of what’s possible. It’s an exciting time to be involved in the future of decentralized finance, witnessing such transformative events. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Stargate LayerZero acquisition?

With fresh institutional demand, major technical upgrades, and bold community-driven projects, several tokens are being ranked as the best altcoins to buy 2025. Yet the real hype is around MAGACOIN FINANCE presale , where analysts are projecting major gains. 1. Cardano Targets $2 With ETF Hopes Cardano is back in focus after gaining commodity status alongside Ethereum and Bitcoin under the Clarity Act. This gave institutional players confidence to load up on ADA. The community also unlocked $71 million in treasury funds to accelerate protocol development, making this one of the boldest moves in ADA’s history. The Ouroboros Leios consensus upgrade is expected to improve throughput by 2.5x, while Hydra Layer-2 could scale to over 1 million TPS by Q4. That’s fueling the Cardano price prediction 2025 , with analysts placing ADA between $1.50 and $3 if the ETF approval lands. For those tracking the top cryptos for next bull run, Cardano’s mix of regulation clarity, technical growth, and strong community backing makes it hard to ignore. 2. Bitcoin Upside Potential Stays Strong Bitcoin remains the anchor for crypto investing. Institutional adoption is climbing fast, with over 297 public companies now holding BTC and ETF inflows topping $118 billion by Q3. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF alone has attracted more than $13 billion, with major names like Goldman Sachs and Harvard Management adding exposure. Consensus forecasts target $200,000 by year-end, with most analysts projecting a range between $80,000 and $181,000. If the bullish side holds, BTC could easily headline the best crypto to buy 2025 lists again. 3. MAGACOIN FINANCE Grabs Spotlight With Explosive Bonus Among the strong crypto presales , MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly stealing the show . Experts are tipping it for staggering gains in the 10,000%–13,000% range, making it one of the most hyped launches. The community focus and viral branding are drawing massive attention.

For those scanning the best presales 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a fresh, rising star that’s aligning with investor appetite for high-upside meme-driven plays. 4. Dogecoin Keeps Its Meme Energy Dogecoin still commands attention as the original meme coin. Talk of a DOGE ETF has stirred speculation again, while the community remains one of the strongest in crypto. With Elon Musk’s consistent support, DOGE continues to hold a $33 billion market cap. Price action has been consolidating between $0.18 and $0.23. Analysts say a breakout above $0.25 could send it toward $0.40. While risk remains, DOGE always finds itself mentioned in top cryptos for next bull run conversations because of its unique network effect. 5. Shiba Inu Expands Beyond Meme Status Shiba Inu has worked hard to evolve beyond its meme coin roots. Its Layer-2, Shibarium, now powers DeFi applications, staking rewards, and burning mechanisms that keep reducing supply. With ongoing burns and Ethereum-based security, SHIB’s roadmap positions it well among the best altcoins to buy 2025 . Price targets range between $0.000015 and $0.000020 if bullish sentiment continues. 6. PEPE Maintains Viral Traction PEPE continues to ride its meme-driven momentum, backed by strong community activity and viral culture. Trading ranges between $0.00001 and $0.000013, analysts see upside toward $0.00005 in high-energy scenarios. As one of the most-watched tokens across social media, PEPE benefits from retail-driven excitement. It’s not as structurally sound as ADA or BTC, but meme energy alone places it among the best meme coins to buy in 2025 style tokens favored for speculation. 7. Dogwifhat (WIF) Holds Whale Backing WIF stands out as Solana’s leading meme coin. Built on fast, low-cost rails, it’s technically positioned well with bullish chart patterns forming. Large whale accumulation adds weight to the bullish case. Forecasts put WIF in the $1.39–$2.73 range in 2025, with long-term projections hitting as high as $7–$15. Its viral meme foundation makes it a contender for the best altcoins to buy 2025 list.

The market may have hit a slowdown, but investors and traders have continued their never-ending search for the next opportunities. With altcoin and Bitcoin dragging, attention has moved to presale opportunities, especially the best crypto presale to buy now, as the 2025 bull cycle takes shape. Expectedly, established names continue to dominate, but newer entrants with strong narratives are taking over. Three projects in particular—XRP, HBAR, and MAGACOIN FINANCE—are being watched closely for their ability to deliver explosive upside. XRP brings regulatory clarity and institutional support, while HBAR rides on enterprise innovation. A newer player, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is surging on presale momentum to form a trio of the most talked-about lineups for investors this year. MAGACOIN FINANCE Rises on 12,500% Opportunity Presale hype is returning to the crypto market, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is the project getting all the attention. Granted, XRP and HBAR are established tokens, but analysts are picking MAGACOIN FINANCE over the two in their list of breakout tokens in 2025. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its community-driven branding and institutional-grade ecosystem. Renowned experts who track early-stage projects say everything about MAGACOIN FINANCE is different when compared with other meme tokens now. Analysts predict investors who get in early could see an incredible 12,500% return on their investments. That explains why crypto market attention is turning to the project by the minute. Even whale investors have picked up, indicating that the price of MAGACOIN FINANCE may explode anytime now. In a market that rewards only those who act fast and smart, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the token everyone is looking at as the best crypto presale to buy in 2025. The window of opportunity to act is fast closing. XRP Holds Investor Attention Meanwhile, XRP is once again in the spotlight, even after recent price declines. While some see the weakness as a buying opportunity, all eyes are on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC recently delayed its decision on multiple XRP ETF applications until October 2025 — a date that could prove decisive for Ripple’s future in U.S. markets. If approved, ETFs would signal major institutional support, potentially lifting XRP back above $3. HBAR Expands Enterprise Reach Hedera (HBAR) is building momentum through enterprise-focused partnerships and ecosystem growth. Despite showing volatility in August, HBAR’s July rally of 85% reminded investors of its upside potential. Analysts warn August has historically been weak for HBAR but highlights bullish catalysts ahead, including speculation around potential BlackRock-linked ETF activity and new tokenized stock launches via Swarm. With steady trading volumes and strong corporate ties, Hedera remains one of the best altcoins to invest in 2025 for those seeking long-term enterprise plays. Conclusion For investors scanning the market for the best crypto presale to buy now, XRP, HBAR, and MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out for very different reasons. XRP offers regulatory-driven upside, and HBAR brings enterprise adoption. However, crypto traders said MAGACOIN FINANCE’s potential to deliver massive returns to investors makes it a clear winner among the three.

U.S. Treasury tokenization is projected to hit $4.2 billion in 2025, with short-term bonds leading activity. Regulatory developments in Hong Kong, Singapore, and the U.S. are laying the groundwork for broader institutional entry. The market for tokenized real-world assets (RWA) could expand to $16 trillion by 2030, according to the 2025 Skynet RWA Security Report . The report said tokenized U.S. Treasuries have already grown rapidly, and are projected to reach $4.2 billion this year, with short-term government bonds accounting for most of the activity. Institutional Interest in Tokenization The report noted that traditional financial institutions and blockchain-native firms are driving adoption, using RWA products for both yield opportunities and liquidity management. Skynet said major banks and asset managers are exploring tokenization as a way to digitize assets ranging from debt instruments to commodities. The report pointed to growing use cases in private credit, trade finance, and money market funds. RWAs could reach $16T by 2030. But with new value comes new risks across asset, legal, operational, data, and on-chain layers. Which protocols lead in security? What threats does this sector face? Learn more in our Skynet RWA Security Report — CertiK (@CertiK) August 21, 2025 “This convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) presents opportunities for improved efficiency, transparency, and accessibility,” the report stated. It also noted that platforms in Hong Kong, Singapore, and the United States are setting regulatory frameworks that could accelerate institutional entry. Challenges for RWA Growth Despite the growth potential, the report outlined structural hurdles for the sector, including limited secondary market liquidity, varying legal treatment across jurisdictions, and the need for standardized risk controls. Cybersecurity and smart contract vulnerabilities were also noted, with Skynet stressing that “use of regulated, qualified custodians with robust security infrastructure, such as federally chartered crypto banks or firms licensed by reputable authorities, is a critical factor.” The report projected that infrastructure investments and regulatory clarity would be required to meet the forecast $16 trillion market size by the end of the decade. “The powerful combination of reliable real-world yields with blockchain’s native liquidity and composability is drawing in both retail and institutional capital,” the report said. While the tokenization of real-world assets is gaining traction in capital markets, many retail investors still lack direct access to these products. Bridging this gap may require regulated intermediaries and simplified on-ramps that align with existing investor protections. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What types of assets are being explored for tokenization beyond government bonds? Institutions are evaluating tokenization for private credit, real estate, commodities, and even intellectual property. These categories are less liquid and harder to price, but tokenization could streamline settlement and open access to new investor groups. Why is secondary market liquidity still limited for RWA tokens? Most RWA tokens are held by institutions or issued in closed environments with restricted trading. Without broader exchange listings or robust DeFi integration, active secondary trading remains difficult. What role could central banks or public institutions play in RWA development? Some central banks are exploring tokenization to improve collateral mobility or enhance transparency in monetary operations. Public-sector involvement could also boost market credibility and infrastructure reliability. Are there tax or accounting implications for holding tokenized assets? Yes, the treatment of RWA tokens may differ by jurisdiction and asset type. Investors and issuers must consider valuation, reporting standards, and auditability—areas where current rules are still catching up to blockchain formats.

For the first time, ETH climbed past the $4,900 mark, capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike. This bullish trajectory signals a potentially transformative period for the second-largest cryptocurrency, prompting many to consider its long-term prospects. What’s Fueling This Remarkable Ethereum Price Surge? Several factors contribute to Ethereum’s impressive rally. According to CoinDesk reports, citing various analysts, the momentum is strong and sustained. One key indicator comes from crypto analyst Crypto Rover, who noted on X that exchange reserves for ETH are shrinking at an unprecedented rate. This trend is significant because: Reduced Supply: Fewer Ethereum tokens are available on exchanges for immediate sale. Increased Demand: Investors are moving their ETH off exchanges, often into staking or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, indicating a strong belief in its future value. Consequently, this supply-demand dynamic naturally creates upward pressure, directly contributing to the ongoing Ethereum price surge . It suggests that holders are opting for long-term strategies rather than short-term trading. Is Ethereum’s Growth Outlook Truly Topping Bitcoin? A compelling narrative emerging from the market is the potential shift in leadership from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ethereum. Analyst Miles Deutsher pointed out that while Bitcoin’s momentum appears to be waning, dip-buying activity in ETH remains robust. This observation suggests a significant re-evaluation by investors. Investors are actively purchasing Ethereum during price dips, indicating strong confidence in its fundamental value and future potential. This behavior contrasts with a perceived slowdown in Bitcoin’s recent upward trajectory, making the Ethereum price surge even more noteworthy. Decoding the Bullish Trajectory of the Ethereum Price Surge Beyond market dynamics, Ethereum’s intrinsic value and ongoing development contribute significantly to its positive outlook. The network’s continuous upgrades, such as the upcoming Dencun and future sharding implementations, aim to enhance scalability, security, and efficiency. Moreover, Ethereum remains the backbone of a vast ecosystem, including: Decentralized Finance (DeFi): A thriving landscape of lending, borrowing, and trading platforms. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): The primary blockchain for digital collectibles and art. Decentralized Applications (dApps): A wide array of innovative applications built on its robust infrastructure. These use cases drive utility and demand, further solidifying the foundation for a sustained Ethereum price surge . However, potential challenges include regulatory uncertainties and the need for continued scalability improvements to manage network congestion and gas fees effectively, though Layer 2 solutions are actively addressing these. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor For those navigating the current market, understanding Ethereum’s drivers is crucial. Observing on-chain metrics, such as exchange reserves and staking rates, can provide valuable insights. Monitoring major network upgrades and the health of the DeFi and NFT ecosystems will also offer clues about future price movements. Always remember that the crypto market can be volatile, and thorough research is paramount before making investment decisions. In conclusion, the current Ethereum price surge is more than just a fleeting moment; it reflects strong underlying fundamentals, increasing demand, and a growing belief in its long-term growth potential. As Bitcoin’s dominance faces new challenges, Ethereum is confidently carving out its path as a leading force in the digital asset space, promising an exciting future for its ecosystem and investors. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What caused the recent Ethereum price surge? The recent Ethereum price surge is primarily driven by shrinking exchange reserves, indicating strong investor demand and a move towards long-term holding. Analyst observations about fading Bitcoin momentum and robust ETH dip-buying also contribute to this sentiment. How high can Ethereum’s price potentially go? Predicting exact price targets is challenging due to market volatility. However, analysts point to strong fundamentals, continuous network upgrades, and the expansive DeFi and NFT ecosystems as factors that could support significant future growth for Ethereum. Is Ethereum now a better investment than Bitcoin? While Bitcoin remains a dominant force, some analysts suggest Ethereum’s growth outlook is currently more dynamic, driven by its utility and ecosystem development. The “better” investment depends on individual risk tolerance and investment goals. What are the main risks associated with investing in Ethereum? Key risks include regulatory uncertainties, potential network congestion issues (though Layer 2s are addressing this), and overall cryptocurrency market volatility. Investors should conduct thorough research and consider their risk appetite. What does ‘dip-buying’ mean in the context of ETH? Dip-buying refers to the strategy of purchasing an asset, like Ethereum, after its price has dropped. Strong dip-buying activity in ETH suggests that investors see these price drops as opportunities to acquire more tokens, signaling confidence in its recovery and future growth.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index recently dipped to 47, settling firmly into the ‘Neutral’ zone. This shift, down six points from the previous day, reflects a moment of indecision among investors. Understanding this crucial index can help you gauge market sentiment and make more informed decisions. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does it Tell Us? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool designed to measure the current emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. It provides a snapshot of whether market participants are feeling overly greedy, potentially leading to a market correction, or overly fearful, which could signal a buying opportunity. The index operates on a scale from 0 to 100. 0-24: Extreme Fear – Investors are very worried, often a sign of undervaluation. 25-49: Fear – General apprehension in the market. 50: Neutral – The market lacks a strong directional bias. 51-74: Greed – Growing enthusiasm and potentially overvalued assets. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Euphoria, often preceding a market top. Currently, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 47, the market sentiment remains firmly in the ‘Neutral’ territory. This suggests that neither strong buying pressure nor panic selling is dominating the landscape right now. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The index isn’t just a random number; it’s a carefully calculated metric that aggregates data from various sources. Developed by the software platform Alternative, it considers six key factors, each weighted differently, to paint a comprehensive picture of market sentiment. Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often signals fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it to average values. Strong, sustained buying volume can indicate greed. Social Media (15%): Scans social media platforms for sentiment analysis of crypto-related discussions. More positive mentions can push the index towards greed. Surveys (15%): Gathers investor sentiment through weekly polls. (Note: These surveys are currently paused, meaning this component is not actively contributing to the score at this time.) Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Assesses Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. A rising dominance often indicates fear, as investors might be moving from altcoins to Bitcoin as a ‘safe haven.’ Google Trends (10%): Examines search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Sudden spikes in fear-related searches (e.g., “Bitcoin price manipulation”) can signal panic. By combining these diverse factors, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a holistic view of the market’s emotional state, moving beyond just price action. Navigating the Neutral Zone: What Does 47 Mean for Investors? A reading of 47 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index places us squarely in the ‘Neutral’ zone. This particular sentiment can be both a challenge and an opportunity for investors. It means there’s no overwhelming consensus, leading to potential sideways movement or increased volatility as the market seeks direction. For investors, this ‘Neutral’ stance often translates into: Uncertainty: A lack of strong conviction from either bulls or bears. Opportunity for Analysis: It’s a prime time to conduct your own research, rather than being swayed by extreme market emotions. Cautious Approach: Many traders might adopt a ‘wait and see’ strategy, or focus on specific altcoins with strong fundamentals rather than broad market trends. Potential for Quick Shifts: Neutrality can be fragile. A single significant news event could quickly push the index into fear or greed. Understanding that the market is in a neutral phase allows you to adjust your strategies. Avoid impulsive decisions driven by herd mentality. Instead, consider this a period for careful observation and strategic planning. Why is Monitoring the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Important for Your Strategy? Paying attention to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers valuable insights beyond simple price charts. It helps you understand the underlying psychology driving market movements. When the index leans towards extreme fear, it often presents a contrarian buying opportunity, as legendary investor Warren Buffett famously advised to ‘be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful’. Conversely, an index showing extreme greed might signal a good time to take profits or exercise caution, as the market could be overheated. While the index is a helpful indicator, it’s crucial to remember that it’s just one tool in your investment arsenal. Always combine it with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and a clear understanding of your own risk tolerance. The recent dip of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 47 and its continued stay in the ‘Neutral’ zone highlights a period of market indecision. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing; it offers a chance for investors to pause, assess, and make thoughtful choices without the intense pressure of extreme emotions. By understanding how this powerful index works and what its current reading implies, you can better navigate the often-turbulent waters of the cryptocurrency market. Stay informed, stay strategic, and always prioritize your long-term investment goals. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a sentiment indicator that measures the current emotional state of the cryptocurrency market, ranging from ‘Extreme Fear’ (0) to ‘Extreme Greed’ (100). How often does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index update? The index typically updates daily, providing a fresh snapshot of market sentiment. What does a ‘Neutral’ reading on the index mean? A ‘Neutral’ reading, like the current 47, indicates that there’s no strong consensus in the market. Neither fear nor greed is dominating, suggesting a period of indecision or potential sideways movement. Can I use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to predict prices? While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable sentiment tool, it should not be used as the sole predictor of price movements. It’s best combined with fundamental and technical analysis for a comprehensive investment strategy. Who developed the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is provided by Alternative, a software development platform. Did this article help you better understand the Crypto Fear & Greed Index?

Today, these significant financial instruments opened with a notable gap down, indicating a potential shift in market sentiment. This particular event saw CME Bitcoin futures open a substantial $3,785 lower than their previous close, prompting many traders and investors to assess the implications. What Exactly Happened with CME Bitcoin Futures? According to data from TradingView, Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) began the trading day at $113,450. This figure represents a significant decline from the previous close, which stood at $117,235 on the four-hour chart. This difference creates what is known as a “gap” in the trading world. Understanding this movement is crucial for anyone involved in crypto trading. Here’s a quick breakdown: Previous Close: $117,235 Today’s Open: $113,450 The Gap: A notable $3,785 downward difference Such gaps are not uncommon, especially in markets that don’t trade 24/7, like the traditional futures markets. However, the size of this particular gap in CME Bitcoin futures can provide valuable insights into market dynamics. Why Do CME Bitcoin Futures Gaps Occur? Gaps in futures markets typically occur when significant price movements happen outside of regular trading hours. For CME Bitcoin futures , this often means price action over the weekend, when the CME market is closed, directly impacts the opening price on Monday. Consider these factors that contribute to such gaps: Weekend Volatility: The underlying Bitcoin market continues to trade globally 24/7. Major news, market sentiment shifts, or large transactions during the weekend can cause Bitcoin’s spot price to move considerably. Institutional Activity: The CME market is largely driven by institutional investors. Their collective sentiment and trading strategies can heavily influence opening prices. Liquidity Changes: Periods of lower liquidity can sometimes amplify price movements, leading to larger gaps when trading resumes. Therefore, a gap down often suggests that the broader Bitcoin market experienced a significant selling pressure or negative news over the weekend. What Does This Gap Mean for Traders of CME Bitcoin Futures? For traders, a gap in CME Bitcoin futures can present both challenges and opportunities. It’s a signal that the market is reacting to external forces, and understanding these reactions is key. Potential Challenges: Increased Volatility: Large gaps can often lead to further volatility as the market attempts to “fill” the gap or continue in the direction of the gap. Stop-Loss Slippage: Traders with stop-loss orders placed within the gap range might experience slippage, meaning their orders are executed at a worse price than intended. Potential Opportunities: Gap-Fill Strategies: Some traders operate on the belief that most gaps eventually get “filled,” meaning the price will return to the previous close level. This can create specific trading strategies. Trend Confirmation: A strong gap down can confirm a bearish sentiment, allowing traders to position themselves accordingly if they believe the trend will continue. It is crucial for traders to conduct thorough research and consider their risk management strategies when dealing with such market movements. Always analyze the broader market context. The recent $3,785 gap down in CME Bitcoin futures highlights the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While such movements can signal increased volatility and present risks, they also offer seasoned traders specific opportunities to capitalize on market inefficiencies. Staying informed about global market events and understanding the mechanics of futures trading remains paramount for navigating these waters successfully. Frequently Asked Questions About CME Bitcoin Futures Q1: What are CME Bitcoin futures? A1: CME Bitcoin futures are cash-settled futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) that allow investors to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without owning the underlying cryptocurrency. They are popular among institutional investors. Q2: Why did CME Bitcoin futures open lower today? A2: The futures likely opened lower due to significant price movements in the underlying Bitcoin spot market over the weekend when the CME futures market was closed. Negative news or selling pressure during this period can lead to a gap down on opening. Q3: What does a “gap down” mean in futures trading? A3: A “gap down” occurs when a financial instrument’s opening price is significantly lower than its previous closing price, creating an empty space or “gap” on the price chart. It indicates strong selling pressure between trading sessions. Q4: How do traders typically react to a gap in CME Bitcoin futures? A4: Traders might react in several ways: some may anticipate a “gap fill” (price returning to the previous close), while others might see it as a confirmation of a new trend. Risk management, including stop-loss orders, becomes even more critical during such volatile periods. Q5: Are CME Bitcoin futures regulated? A5: Yes, CME Bitcoin futures are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in the United States, providing a level of oversight and investor protection not always present in other crypto markets.

Institutional money is also flowing in, with ETF inflows hitting $164 million. Its DeFi and NFT ecosystems are doing well, and engineers are still working to make them better constantly. Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche has become the platform of choice for businesses. Its unique subnet architecture lets users construct their own blockchains. A lot of DeFi projects and big partnerships have come to this platform because of how flexible it is. AVAX is still a strong competitor since transactions are confirmed quickly, in approximately a second, and the number of validators is expanding. Its market cap of around $14 billion shows strong investor confidence, and many expect the ecosystem to keep expanding as blockchain adoption increases. Ripple (XRP) Ripple has been an established leader in cross-border payments. XRP is still being used by financial institutions because of its low transaction costs and settlement speed. Regulatory positive outcomes have also earned people the confidence to trust the project once again. XRP has a good liquidity and market cap of 30 billion. It is exchanging at $0.50 to $0.55. As the global partnerships expand, XRP remains one of the most helpful altcoins with real-life applications. Toncoin (TON) Toncoin is growing super fast because it is highly integrated with Telegram, and this exposes it to millions of users across the globe. The TON ecosystem has an increasing number of decentralized apps, and the low fees and high transaction rates render it extremely helpful. TON, which has a $6 billion market cap, is trading at $1.20-1.30 and is niching itself to pursue social media with blockchain. It is worth watching due to its usefulness and popularity amongst users. Conclusion The number of good altcoins is numerous in 2025. Solana is quick and scalable, Avalanche supports businesses, Ripple remains the best payment system, and Toncoin intends to bring social media and crypto together. All these alternatives aside, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the most exponentially growing altcoin . Most early investors believe that MAGACOIN is the next big success story since it promises a ROI of 45x.

An Ethereum whale , a term for a large holder of ETH, has recently made headlines by depositing a substantial amount of Ethereum onto the OKX exchange. This isn’t just any transaction; it marks the end of an over decade-long holding period for this particular investor, leading to a remarkable profit. What does this extraordinary move signify for the broader crypto market? An Astounding 11-Year Hold: The Ethereum Whale’s Strategic Deposit Imagine holding onto a volatile asset like Ethereum for more than a decade. That’s precisely what an Ethereum whale , identified by the address starting with 0xf3c, accomplished. After an incredible 11-year dormancy, this patient, long-term holder made a decisive move, depositing 1,962 ETH—valued at an impressive $9.38 million—to the OKX cryptocurrency exchange. This strategic deposit, first brought to light by the reputable on-chain analytics platform Onchain Lens on X, immediately captured the attention of traders and analysts. It serves as a compelling example of successful profit-taking after an exceptionally patient investment strategy. Such extended holding periods are rare and often indicate deep conviction in an asset’s long-term potential. Transaction Details: Amount Deposited: 1,962 ETH Current Market Value: Approximately $9.38 million Destination Exchange: OKX Holding Duration: Over 11 years Unpacking the Massive Profit: What the Ethereum Whale Gained The financial outcome of this transaction is truly substantial. By depositing 1,962 ETH, the Ethereum whale realized an astounding profit of roughly $4.7 million. This figure powerfully illustrates the exponential growth Ethereum has experienced since its early days. When this whale initially acquired their ETH, its per-unit value was dramatically lower than its current market price, highlighting the power of early adoption and sustained holding. As of recent data, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at approximately $4,794.87, showing a modest 0.26% increase over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. This stable, albeit slightly positive, price action provided an opportune moment for the whale to secure their gains, capitalizing on Ethereum’s strong, long-term performance. Such large-scale movements by long-term holders, often referred to as “old money,” can sometimes offer valuable insights into market sentiment. They might signal a belief that current price levels are attractive for profit realization, or perhaps a strategic re-allocation of capital. What Does This Ethereum Whale Activity Signal for the Market? Whenever an Ethereum whale executes a move of this magnitude, the broader crypto community engages in lively discussions about its potential implications. Is this a precursor to a market correction, or simply an individual investor wisely cashing out well-deserved profits? Here are a few key perspectives to consider: Calculated Profit-Taking: The most direct interpretation suggests the whale is liquidating a portion of their extensive holdings after a highly successful, multi-year investment. This is a standard and rational practice, particularly following periods of significant asset appreciation. Market Confidence Indicator: While some might view large deposits to exchanges as a bearish signal (implying an intent to sell), it can also indicate a healthy market. It shows that long-term investors feel confident enough to realize profits without fearing they will miss out on immediate, parabolic gains. Strategic Portfolio Management: Whales typically manage diverse and vast portfolios. This specific deposit could be an isolated event or part of a larger strategy to rebalance assets, diversify investments, or position capital for emerging opportunities within the dynamic crypto ecosystem. It is always crucial for investors to analyze such movements with a discerning eye, avoiding impulsive reactions. On-chain data provides unparalleled transparency, but individual whale actions are just one piece of the complex puzzle that defines market direction. Lessons from the Long-Term Ethereum Whale: Patience Pays Off The remarkable journey of this Ethereum whale offers several invaluable lessons for both novice and experienced crypto investors. Foremost among them is the virtue of patience, which, in this instance, paid off handsomely. Holding an asset through numerous market cycles, enduring both dramatic bull runs and challenging bear markets, required extraordinary conviction and resilience. Furthermore, this event underscores the growing importance of understanding on-chain analytics. Platforms like Onchain Lens empower investors with data-driven insights, allowing them to track significant transactions and identify potential trends before they become mainstream news. While these observations are not financial advice, monitoring whale behavior can provide a unique and informed perspective on market dynamics. This transaction stands as a powerful testament to the potential for substantial returns within the cryptocurrency market, especially when coupled with a clear, long-term vision and strategic timing for profit realization. It reminds us that significant wealth can be built through consistent belief in an asset’s fundamental value. In conclusion, the deposit of $9.38 million worth of ETH by an 11-year-old Ethereum whale into OKX is a truly remarkable event. It vividly highlights the incredible gains achievable in the crypto market and exemplifies the strategic decision-making employed by long-term holders. This move, which netted a $4.7 million profit, is a testament to the power of patience and astute market timing, offering valuable insights into the behavior of major players within the digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is an Ethereum whale? A Ethereum whale refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of Ethereum (ETH). Their transactions often have the potential to influence market sentiment due to their significant holdings. Q2: Why is an Ethereum whale depositing ETH to an exchange significant? Such a deposit is significant because it often signals an intent to sell or move funds for other purposes, like rebalancing a portfolio. Large movements can sometimes cause market participants to speculate about potential price impacts, though it’s not always a direct indicator of a price drop. Q3: What is OKX? OKX is a leading global cryptocurrency exchange that provides a platform for trading various digital assets, including Ethereum. It offers services like spot trading, derivatives, and decentralized finance (DeFi) products. Q4: How do on-chain analytics platforms track these movements? On-chain analytics platforms, like Onchain Lens, monitor public blockchain data. Since all Ethereum transactions are recorded on a public ledger, these platforms can track large transfers from specific addresses to exchanges, providing transparency into significant market activities. Q5: Does this deposit mean ETH’s price will drop? Not necessarily. While a large deposit could indicate an intent to sell, which might put downward pressure on prices, it could also be part of a broader strategy, such as diversifying or preparing for new investments. The market’s reaction depends on many factors beyond a single whale’s action. If you found this insight into the Ethereum whale ‘s massive move intriguing, share it with your network!

This week brings a significant event that demands attention: a packed token unlock schedule . These scheduled releases can introduce substantial liquidity, potentially influencing market dynamics and token prices. Let’s dive into the details of what’s coming, especially the noteworthy $116 million GT unlock. What is a Token Unlock Schedule and Why Does it Matter? Before we get into the specifics of this week’s releases, it’s essential to grasp what a token unlock schedule truly means for the crypto ecosystem. Token unlocks refer to the release of previously restricted cryptocurrency tokens into the circulating supply. These tokens are often held by early investors, team members, or project treasuries, subject to vesting periods designed to ensure long-term commitment. When these tokens are unlocked, they become available for trading. This can increase the total circulating supply, which, in turn, can put downward pressure on a token’s price if the newly available tokens are sold. Conversely, if the market absorbs them well or demand is high, the impact might be minimal. Therefore, tracking these events is a vital part of informed investment strategy. This Week’s Major Token Unlock Schedule Highlights According to reliable data from DropsTab, this week is set to be particularly active with several significant token unlocks. All times listed are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), so mark your calendars and adjust for your local timezone. The sheer volume of tokens entering the market could create interesting trading opportunities or challenges for various projects. Here’s a breakdown of the key releases: VENOM: 56.9 million tokens ($8.42 million), representing 2.71% of circulating supply, at 00:00 UTC on Aug. 26. GT: A staggering 6.67 million tokens ($116 million), representing 5.42% of circulating supply, at 00:00 UTC on Aug. 26. This is the largest unlock by value this week. ORDER: 50.13 million tokens ($8.51 million), representing 17.74% of circulating supply, at 00:00 UTC on Aug. 26. SAHARA: 89.73 million tokens ($7.77 million), representing 4.40% of circulating supply, at 12:00 UTC on Aug. 26. HUMA: A substantial 536.13 million tokens ($14.19 million), representing 30.93% of circulating supply, at 12:00 UTC on Aug. 26. SOPH: 294.63 million tokens ($9.78 million), representing 14.73% of circulating supply, at 12:00 UTC on Aug. 28. KMNO: 229.16 million tokens ($14.02 million), representing 8.73% of circulating supply, at 00:00 UTC on Aug. 30. OP: 32.21 million tokens ($24.97 million), representing 1.84% of circulating supply, at 00:00 UTC on Aug. 31. ALT: 240.54 million tokens ($8.63 million), representing 6.02% of circulating supply, at 06:00 UTC on Aug. 31. The GT Token Unlock: What Does $116 Million Mean? Among this week’s numerous releases, the GT token unlock stands out due to its sheer value. With $116 million worth of GT tokens entering circulation, it’s natural for investors to wonder about the potential ramifications. GateToken (GT) is the native utility token of the Gate.io exchange, a major player in the crypto trading landscape. Its ecosystem benefits from the token’s utility in fees, VIP tiers, and other incentives. An unlock of this magnitude, representing 5.42% of the circulating supply, could introduce significant selling pressure if recipients decide to cash out. However, the strong utility and established user base of Gate.io might help absorb some of this supply. It is crucial to monitor trading volumes and price action closely around the unlock time to gauge market sentiment effectively. This particular event is a key highlight in the overall token unlock schedule . Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Investors How should investors approach a week with such an active token unlock schedule ? Prudent decision-making is paramount. Firstly, always conduct your own thorough research (DYOR) on each project. Understand the project’s fundamentals, its tokenomics, and the purpose of the unlocked tokens. Secondly, consider the percentage of circulating supply being unlocked. A higher percentage generally indicates a greater potential for price volatility. For example, HUMA and ORDER have significant percentages being unlocked. Thirdly, look at the historical performance of tokens after previous unlocks. Does the project typically see a dip, or does the market absorb the supply efficiently? For those holding any of these tokens, or considering an entry, setting stop-loss orders can be a wise risk management strategy. Alternatively, for those looking for potential entry points, a temporary dip post-unlock could present an opportunity, but this comes with inherent risks. Always remember, the crypto market is highly volatile, and past performance is not indicative of future results. This week’s comprehensive token unlock schedule presents a fascinating landscape for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors alike. From the substantial GT unlock to the various other projects releasing tokens, staying informed is your best defense and offense. These events are a natural part of a project’s lifecycle, designed to distribute tokens over time. However, their immediate impact on supply and demand warrants careful observation. By understanding the mechanics and preparing your strategy, you can navigate these market shifts with greater confidence.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin’s price is holding near records, but the chain itself is quiet. Glassnode data shows transaction fees have collapsed back toward decade lows, even as BTC flirts with six figures. In past cycles, fee spikes tracked bull markets as traders bid for blockspace. This year, the fee curve is flat while price rises, a clear sign that onchain demand is no longer driving the market. A new report from Galaxy Research shows median daily fees have fallen more than 80% since April 2024, with as much as 15% of daily blocks now clearing at just 1 satoshi per vbyte. Nearly half of recent blocks are not full, signaling weak demand for blockspace and a dormant mempool. This is a sharp contrast to prior bull cycles, where price rallies translated into congestion and fee spikes. The data confirms a structural shift: spot ETFs and custodians now hold more than 1.3 million BTC, and coins parked in those wrappers rarely touch the chain again. At the same time, retail activity that once clogged the Bitcoin blockchain has migrated to Solana, where memecoins and NFTs benefit from cheaper and faster execution. The result, Galaxy notes, is that the bitcoin price is being set by custodial inflows while the network's onchain demand – once a proxy for price movement – has slowed down. For miners, this dynamic is particularly punishing. With rewards halved to 3.125 BTC and fees contributing less than 1% of block revenue in July, profitability is under strain. That stress is pushing listed miners to diversify into AI and HPC hosting. Read more: Bitcoin Mining Faces 'Incredibly Difficult' Market as Power Becomes the Real Currency A report from earlier this year by Rittenhouse Research argues that Galaxy Digital’s move out of mining altogether could be the model for the sector. This move has been applauded by the equity markets. While BTC is down more than 3% on-year, the CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF has gained nearly 22%. Investors are rewarding firms that have leaned into diversification rather than relying on block rewards alone. Listed miners tell a similar story. Hive, Core Scientific, and TeraWulf all reported Q2 results padded by HPC and AI hosting revenues. Those with no diversification, like Bitdeer and BitFuFu, remain deeply exposed to electricity costs, equipment depreciation, and a fee market that Galaxy warns in its report is “anything but robust.” The juxtaposition is telling: Galaxy’s own research warns that the Bitcoin blockchain's settlement role is stagnating, while Galaxy's balance sheet is being repositioned for growth in AI data centers. Onchain data makes the point: without organic demand for blockspace, fees can’t fund security. And if fees stay low, equity markets are painting a clear picture that mining sector’s best future returns may come from AI, not Bitcoin. Market Movements BTC: Bitcoin traded at $113,286.95, down 1.79%, after briefly plunging to a six-week low near $110,600, with the broader crypto market facing heavy liquidations and volatility. ETH : Ether traded flat at $4,779 as Jerome Powell’s dovish Jackson Hole remarks boosted expectations of a September rate cut, with asset managers predicting new highs for bitcoin and an ETH breakout above $5,000 despite risks from treasury adoption and equity volatility. Gold: Gold closed at $3,371 after Powell’s dovish Jackson Hole remarks boosted September rate-cut odds. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific stocks climbed Monday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 1.08%, after Powell signaled potential Fed rate cuts in September during his Jackson Hole speech.

The latest data reveals a fascinating shift: the Altcoin Season Index currently stands at 49, signaling that we are firmly entrenched in what’s known as Bitcoin Season. This critical metric helps investors understand whether altcoins or Bitcoin are leading the charge in the volatile crypto landscape. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a crucial tool provided by CoinMarketCap (CMC), a leading cryptocurrency price data platform. It helps investors gauge the market’s prevailing trend by comparing the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, over the past 90 days. Here’s how this insightful index works: If at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin during that 90-day period, the market enters a definitive Altcoin Season . Conversely, if 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin, we are in Bitcoin Season. The index itself ranges from 1 to 100, providing a clear numerical snapshot of the market’s pulse and helping identify key trends. Decoding the Current Bitcoin Season: Why is the Index at 49? With the Altcoin Season Index registered at 49 at 00:32 UTC on Aug. 25, the message is clear: Bitcoin is currently dictating market momentum. A score of 49 falls well below the 75% threshold required for an Altcoin Season, indicating that a significant majority of altcoins have not surpassed Bitcoin’s performance in recent months. This period often sees investors consolidating their positions into Bitcoin, viewing it as a more stable asset during times of uncertainty or as a primary driver of market liquidity. Understanding this trend is vital for making informed investment decisions and adapting your portfolio strategy. Why Does Bitcoin Season Occur and What Drives It? Several factors can contribute to Bitcoin’s sustained dominance during a Bitcoin Season. These influences often stem from broader economic conditions and specific crypto market dynamics: Market Uncertainty: In times of global economic instability or heightened regulatory concerns, investors often flock to Bitcoin. They perceive it as a “safe haven” asset within the inherently volatile crypto landscape due to its larger market cap and established presence. Institutional Inflows: Large institutional investments frequently target Bitcoin first. These significant capital injections establish a strong foundation before potentially diversifying into smaller, more speculative altcoins. Pre-Halving Cycles: Historically, Bitcoin tends to show strong performance leading up to its halving events. These events reduce the supply of new Bitcoin, which can pull capital away from altcoins as anticipation builds. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic trends, such as interest rate changes or major geopolitical events, can significantly influence investor sentiment. These often favor Bitcoin due to its perceived resilience and liquidity. Navigating the Market During Bitcoin Season: Actionable Insights For investors, a prevailing Bitcoin Season requires a thoughtful and strategic approach. While altcoins might experience less growth, it doesn’t mean they are without opportunity. However, the investment focus often shifts significantly. Consider these actionable insights to manage your portfolio effectively: Focus on Bitcoin: Naturally, strengthening your Bitcoin position can be a sensible strategy during this time. Bitcoin’s performance often sets the tone for the entire market. Research Strong Altcoins: Identify altcoins with robust fundamentals, strong development teams, and clear, innovative use cases. These projects may be more resilient or offer better recovery potential when market sentiment shifts. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Continue to invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price fluctuations. This disciplined strategy can mitigate risk and build positions over time, averaging out your entry price. Risk Management: Be mindful of increased volatility. Set clear stop-loss orders and avoid over-leveraging, especially with smaller, less liquid altcoins. Prudent risk management is key. Looking Ahead: When Will Altcoin Season Return? The crypto market is inherently cyclical, and Bitcoin Season does not last forever. Predicting the exact return of an Altcoin Season is challenging, but certain indicators often precede it, signaling a potential shift in market dynamics: Bitcoin Price Consolidation: After a significant run-up, Bitcoin often enters a period of consolidation or sideways trading. This allows capital to flow out of Bitcoin and into altcoins, seeking higher returns. Increased Risk Appetite: A general increase in investor confidence and willingness to take on more risk can fuel altcoin rallies. This often follows periods of Bitcoin stability or growth. Technological Breakthroughs: Major advancements, successful network upgrades, or significant project launches within specific altcoin ecosystems can attract substantial attention and investment, kickstarting individual altcoin runs. Historically, a strong Bitcoin rally often precedes an Altcoin Season, as profits from Bitcoin are then used to invest in promising altcoin projects, driving their prices higher. Embracing the Crypto Cycles with the Altcoin Season Index Understanding the dynamics of the Altcoin Season Index and recognizing whether the market is in a Bitcoin Season or an Altcoin Season is paramount for any crypto enthusiast. While the index currently points to Bitcoin’s dominance, this is a natural phase in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape. By staying informed, adapting your strategies, and conducting thorough research, you can navigate these market cycles effectively and position yourself for future opportunities, regardless of which season prevails. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric from CoinMarketCap that tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. It helps indicate whether altcoins or Bitcoin are currently dominating the market. 2. What does an Altcoin Season Index of 49 mean? An index of 49 signals that the market is currently in Bitcoin Season. This means that fewer than 75% (specifically, more than 25% but less than 75%) of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days, indicating Bitcoin’s stronger performance. 3. How long does Bitcoin Season typically last? There’s no fixed duration for Bitcoin Season. Market cycles are influenced by numerous factors, including macroeconomic conditions, technological developments, and investor sentiment. Bitcoin Season can last for weeks or months before a shift occurs. 4. Should I sell all my altcoins during Bitcoin Season? Not necessarily. While Bitcoin may be outperforming, it’s an opportunity to re-evaluate your altcoin holdings. Focus on projects with strong fundamentals, consider dollar-cost averaging, and manage your risk effectively. Selling all altcoins might lead to missing out on potential future gains. 5. What usually triggers the next Altcoin Season? An Altcoin Season often follows a period of Bitcoin consolidation after a strong rally. Increased investor risk appetite, significant technological breakthroughs within altcoin ecosystems, or major positive news for specific projects can also act as triggers.

This week brings a series of key economic events that could significantly sway traditional markets and, by extension, the volatile world of digital assets. Understanding these pivotal moments is crucial for navigating potential shifts in investor sentiment and market liquidity. From central bank insights to critical economic data, staying informed is your best strategy. What Key Economic Events Are Shaping Monday’s Outlook? The week kicks off with significant commentary from Federal Reserve officials, offering valuable insights into the U.S. monetary policy landscape. These key economic events often provide clues about future interest rate decisions, which directly influence the strength of the dollar and investor appetite for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Monday, August 25 (All times UTC): 19:15 U.S. Fed Logan Speaks: Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan’s remarks can shed light on the Fed’s perspective on inflation and economic growth. Traders often scrutinize these speeches for any hawkish or dovish leanings. 23:15 U.S. FOMC Member Williams Speaks: New York Fed President John Williams, a permanent voting member of the FOMC, offers another crucial perspective. His comments can carry significant weight regarding the Fed’s policy path. These early week speeches are important because they help set the tone for market expectations. A hawkish stance could strengthen the dollar, potentially creating headwinds for crypto prices, while a dovish tone might have the opposite effect. Mid-Week Market Movers: More Fed Insights and Beyond As the week progresses, central bank communication remains a focal point. Continuous dialogue from Federal Reserve members helps market participants build a comprehensive picture of the economic outlook and policy direction. Monitoring these ongoing key economic events is essential for any informed investor. Tuesday, August 26: 12:30 U.S. FOMC Member Barkin Speaks: Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin’s insights will contribute further to the ongoing discussion about economic conditions and monetary policy. His remarks can offer regional perspectives that inform the broader Fed narrative. Wednesday, August 27: 15:45 U.S. FOMC Member Barkin Speaks: Barkin delivers another speech, providing an additional opportunity for markets to gauge the Fed’s sentiment. Consistent messaging or any shift in tone from officials can trigger market reactions. These speeches are not just academic exercises; they are powerful signals. Investors actively listen for nuances that could indicate a change in the Fed’s strategy, impacting everything from bond yields to equity valuations and, ultimately, the crypto market. Critical Data Releases: How Will Key Economic Events Impact Thursday? Thursday is packed with crucial economic data releases, moving beyond just central bank speeches. These quantitative key economic events provide concrete evidence of economic health and inflationary pressures, often leading to immediate market volatility. Prepare for potential shifts as these numbers hit the wire. Thursday, August 28: 01:00 S. Korea Interest Rate Decision (Aug.): An interest rate decision from a major Asian economy like South Korea can impact global sentiment, especially for emerging markets and currencies. 12:30 U.S. GDP (QoQ) (Q2): Gross Domestic Product is the broadest measure of economic activity. This second-quarter reading will indicate whether the U.S. economy is expanding, contracting, or stagnating. A strong GDP report suggests economic resilience, while a weak one could fuel recession fears. 12:30 U.S. Initial Jobless Claims: This weekly report provides a real-time snapshot of the labor market’s health. A rise in jobless claims indicates a weakening job market, which can signal broader economic slowdown. 20:00 U.S. Fed Waller Speaks: Another influential voice from the Federal Reserve, Governor Christopher Waller, will offer his perspective. His remarks are closely watched for insights into the Fed’s current thinking on inflation and employment. Collectively, these Thursday releases offer a comprehensive view of the U.S. economic landscape. Strong data might reinforce expectations for higher interest rates, while weaker figures could prompt discussions of potential rate cuts, both of which have profound implications for market risk appetite. The Week’s Grand Finale: Understanding Friday’s Key Economic Events The week concludes with a highly anticipated inflation report, often considered the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge for price stability. This particular key economic event is pivotal for understanding the ongoing battle against inflation and its potential impact on future monetary policy decisions. Friday, August 29: 12:30 U.S. Core PCE Price Index (YoY) (Jul.): The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, particularly the ‘Core’ reading (excluding volatile food and energy prices), is the Federal Reserve’s primary inflation measure. A higher-than-expected reading could reinforce the need for tighter monetary policy, while a lower figure might offer some relief. This data directly influences interest rate expectations. The Core PCE report is a significant market mover. Its outcome can solidify or shift market expectations for the Fed’s next moves, influencing everything from the dollar’s value to stock market performance and, importantly, the sentiment surrounding cryptocurrencies. Be prepared for potential volatility following this release. Staying informed about these crucial economic releases is not just for traditional investors; it is equally vital for those in the crypto space. These key economic events collectively paint a picture of global economic health and monetary policy direction, which inevitably ripples through all asset classes. By understanding these dynamics, you can make more informed decisions and better position your portfolio for the week ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the FOMC and why are their members’ speeches important? The FOMC, or Federal Open Market Committee, is the monetary policy-making body of the Federal Reserve System. Speeches by FOMC members are crucial because they communicate the Fed’s outlook on the economy, inflation, and future interest rate policy. These insights can significantly influence market sentiment and asset prices, including cryptocurrencies. How do U.S. GDP reports impact financial markets and crypto? The U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) report measures the total value of goods and services produced in the economy. It’s a key indicator of economic health. Strong GDP can lead to a stronger dollar and potentially higher interest rates, which might put pressure on risk assets like crypto. Conversely, weak GDP could signal a slowdown, potentially leading to a weaker dollar and a more favorable environment for some crypto assets. What is the Core PCE Price Index and why is it significant? The Core PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) Price Index is the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices. It’s significant because the Fed uses it to guide its monetary policy decisions, particularly regarding interest rates. A higher-than-expected PCE can signal persistent inflation, potentially leading to more aggressive rate hikes and impacting market sentiment. How do interest rate decisions, like South Korea’s, affect global markets? Interest rate decisions by central banks, even in smaller economies, can create ripple effects globally. They influence currency strength, capital flows, and investor confidence. For instance, a rate hike in South Korea could strengthen the Won and potentially draw capital away from other markets, indirectly affecting global liquidity and investor appetite for risk, including crypto. Why should crypto investors pay attention to traditional economic events? While cryptocurrencies are a distinct asset class, they do not exist in a vacuum. Macroeconomic factors, central bank policies, and global economic health significantly influence investor sentiment and liquidity across all markets. Traditional key economic events can drive changes in the dollar’s strength, risk appetite, and overall market stability, all of which impact crypto valuations.

Traders are on the lookout for the best altcoins to buy now , focusing on coins with breakout setups and strong analyst forecasts. BNB, Cardano, Stellar, and Pi Coin are all drawing attention. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being talked about as a rising star, with speculation of explosive returns. 1. BNB’s Rally Potential and Analyst Targets The latest BNB price prediction puts the coin in a range between $581 and $1,000 after hitting a new ATH. Analysts note that BNB’s momentum has been supported by Bitpanda’s DeFi Wallet adding BNB Chain support for European users, giving retail investors more on-ramps. The coin also pushed toward a new all-time high, solidifying its position in discussions around the best crypto to invest in . With Binance’s ecosystem continuing to expand and retail adoption growing, BNB looks firmly placed among the top cryptos for 2025. 2. Cardano ADA Forecast After ETF Outflows Cardano’s story has been shaped by institutional flows, with recent ETF redemptions worth $945 million dragging sentiment. Still, the Cardano ADA forecast remains intact, with predictions ranging from$0.80 to $1.25 for 2025. Its smart contract upgrades and strong community backing are keeping ADA in the spotlight, and many traders consider it one of the best altcoins to buy now when looking at medium-term opportunities. 3. Stellar XLM Breakout Fueled by Speculation Stellar’s recent performance has turned heads. A Ripple-SEC settlement brought clarity to the sector, lifting XLM by more than 14%. On top of that, speculation of a Visa-Stellar partnership drove another sharp intraday move. Analysts now forecast a rally from $0.40 to $1.00, framing it as a Stellar XLM breakout story for 2025. This mix of regulatory clarity and payment-network speculation makes Stellar a strong candidate in altcoin market analysis, and it’s regularly mentioned alongside other top cryptos for 2025. 4. Pi Coin’s Institutional Attention Pi Coin’s 2025 predictions range between $1.50 and $2.00 in an aggressive case. Backing from Ulu Ventures and the launch of a post-mainnet hackathon with 160,000 PI in developer prizes added to the hype. Despite bearish on-chain signals, institutional positioning has made traders take Pi more seriously in altcoin market analysis conversations. 5. MAGACOIN FINANCE and the 5,000% Projection Altcoin hunters are circling MAGACOIN FINANCE with talk of up to 5,000% gains projected for 2025. Smart money is positioning early, with the PATRIOT50X code offering a 50% bonus entry point . Many see MAGACOIN as not just another altcoin but a fresh, fast-growing play carving its own lane. For traders looking beyond the usual suspects, MAGACOIN is quickly being mentioned in discussions of the best crypto to invest in over the next market cycle. Final Thoughts: Altcoins to Watch in Q3 and Q4 BNB, Cardano, Stellar, and Pi Coin are all showing catalysts that keep them high on investor watchlists. From the BNB price prediction pointing to fresh highs, the Cardano ADA forecast holding steady despite institutional pressures, to the Stellar XLM breakout fueled by sector optimism—these projects are widely ranked among the best altcoins to buy now . At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction as an exciting new project with bold return projections. With analysts linking it to the next explosive leg higher, MAGACOIN is being watched alongside other top cryptos for 2025 , making it a unique addition to any trader’s research list.

Chainlink is in focus as analysts highlight a bullish forecast, while Litecoin is showing signs it could break a multi-year resistance level and aim higher. Both assets are gaining momentum, but one project is stealing more headlines. BlockDAG, which has raised over $381 million in its presale, is now backed by a huge base of 2.5 million mobile miners. With a live demo of its X1 and X10 mining setup and the launch of BlockDAG Academy, it is becoming one of the most talked-about projects today. The mix of adoption, education, and tested mining hardware is giving BlockDAG a clear advantage that goes beyond short-term speculation. Chainlink Forecast: Bullish Momentum Gains Attention Chainlink (LINK) is seeing renewed energy as its price forecast turns bullish. Analysts note LINK has regained upward momentum, and many believe the chart suggests a rally could continue if current support holds strong. Chainlink’s role as a bridge connecting blockchains with real-world data remains at the center of this outlook. This utility continues to shape market opinion, even when volatility strikes. Forecasts now point to LINK possibly moving toward higher resistance levels. Growing demand for decentralized oracles, along with integrations in DeFi systems, is strengthening the case for steady growth. Institutional interest is another key factor adding support to this positive view. Analysts agree small pullbacks may occur, but the overall chart favors an upward path if the support base holds. With trading volumes showing steady demand, LINK is being recognized as one of the stronger projects in this cycle, keeping it firmly on traders’ watchlists. Litecoin Price Watch: Eyes on $220 Target Litecoin (LTC) could be gearing up for one of its biggest moves in years. Analyst Ali explained that Litecoin’s setup looks very similar to Ethereum’s breakout pattern, pointing toward a possible run to $220. At present, Litecoin is trading near $129, a price area that has been strong resistance since March 2022. After multiple failed attempts to break this zone for over three years, a close above $130–$140 is now seen as critical. If Litecoin pushes through, charts show very little resistance until $200. That window creates a path for faster gains, making $220 a natural target. This outlook has fueled excitement among traders waiting for momentum to build. The comparison to Ethereum’s earlier breakout adds further weight to the case. For Litecoin, which has often trailed behind in market headlines, breaking this resistance could signal a long-awaited return to strength and higher visibility. BlockDAG Craze: 2.5M Miners, $381M Presale, Academy & Demo Fuel Growth While Chainlink and Litecoin are drawing attention for technical reasons, BlockDAG is dominating discussions through adoption, education, and live proof of delivery. The project’s presale has already crossed $381 million, with over 25.3 billion coins sold. Batch 29 is currently priced at $0.0276, still below the expected launch price of $0.05. BlockDAG’s X1 mobile mining app is a major reason behind its rise. More than 2.5 million users are mining daily without needing costly hardware, making entry simple and accessible. This has helped create one of the largest early communities in crypto. To push adoption further, the team launched the BlockDAG Academy. It offers a three-tier learning system with on-chain certifications, giving participants blockchain knowledge and practical skills. This makes BlockDAG more than just a coin, but a platform focused on utility and education. Another highlight came in July, when BlockDAG held a live demo showcasing both the X1 app and the X10 miner. The X10 unit, which connects via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or Ethernet, proved it can mine up to 200 BDAG daily compared to 20 from the X1 app. With over 19,350 miners already sold, generating more than $7.8 million in sales, this demonstration confirmed the system’s scale and reliability. With a 2,660% ROI already achieved between batch 1 and batch 29, BlockDAG is proving itself with numbers, education, and a working ecosystem that is drawing attention across the market. Final Say! Chainlink’s positive forecast and Litecoin’s attempt to break past $140 and aim for $220 are both keeping the charts lively. These moves create short-term opportunities while also pointing toward longer-term optimism. But BlockDAG is making a case that goes beyond technical setups. A $381 million presale, 2.5 million daily miners, over 19,350 miners sold, and the launch of the BlockDAG Academy show that it is building a solid foundation early. The live demo of its mining tech further proved it can deliver real results. In a space often dominated by hype, BlockDAG is pairing strong presale excitement with real adoption and working systems. While LINK and LTC look set for strong moves, BlockDAG is making headlines as a project with traction, growth, and community power.

The surge captured global attention, but the momentum quickly unraveled as reports of insider trading and highly concentrated token ownership surfaced. Within hours, the token’s value collapsed to around $1.05 billion, reinforcing concerns about sustainability and investor trust. Investigations into YZY Coin’s launch revealed that insiders controlled over 94% of the supply. This raised questions about whether the rally was fueled more by manipulation than by organic demand. The fallout left many retail investors wary, with some calling YZY one of the most volatile celebrity-backed launches to date. However, that shifted attention to the token with the best upside this year: MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Analysts’ Top Crypto Presale Pick While YZY Coin captured headlines with its explosive but unstable debut, analysts say the real momentum is building around MAGACOIN FINANCE. Thousands of investors are shifting into the best crypto presale , drawn by forecasts of massive ROI potential that could make it one of the best-performing altcoins in the next bull cycle. Experts consistently rank it among the strongest presales of 2025, citing both its early traction and its structured rollout. The presale has already raised more than $12.5 million, underscoring the demand from retail and whale investors alike. Beyond its presale growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining credibility with audited contracts and a transparent supply model that sets it apart from tokens plagued by insider distribution issues. Early adopters are also responding to unique presale incentives. The PATRIOT50X code, which unlocks a 50% extra allocation, has accelerated inflows as investors look to secure positions before allocations close. Analysts warn that time is limited, and momentum is only likely to intensify as the broader market turns bullish. For many, MAGACOIN FINANCE is not just a speculative play but a strategic positioning move for 2025. It offers exposure to meme-driven enthusiasm without sacrificing transparency and sustainability — a balance that makes it stand out against high-profile but unstable launches like YZY Coin. Conclusion — Two Very Different Stories Kanye West’s YZY Coin may have captured attention with its celebrity-driven hype and explosive launch, but its volatility and insider concentration have cast a shadow over its long-term potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE, by contrast, is emerging as the consensus choice for investors seeking both high upside and structural credibility. As the second hald of the year unfolds, analysts are clear: YZY Coin might have been the loudest debut, but MAGACOIN FINANCE looks set to be the most sustainable winner.

50627045,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=791401,1756083913,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50627045.jpeg,Telegram founder claims case is baseless and criticizes French government,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/telegram-founder-claims-case-is-baseless/,"Telegram founder Pavel Durov has provided an update on his legal battle with the authorities in France, claiming that a criminal investigation into the case has not unearthed any proof of foul play on his part. Durov, in a post on Telegram on Sunday, called his arrest last month by French police “unprecedented,” and insisted that it was “legally and logically absurd” to punish a tech chief for acts of independent site users. “A year later, the ‘criminal investigation’ against me is still struggling to find anything that I or Telegram did wrong. Our moderation practices align with industry standards, and Telegram has always responded to every legally binding request from France.” Durov said he still has to report to France every two weeks and that there was no date for an appeal, describing the case as a “weird detention” and saying it had done “irreparable damage” to France’s reputation as a free country. Durov pushes back as France intensifies scrutiny over Telegram’s content moderation The crypto community has widely condemned the Telegram CEO’s arrest. Human rights activists and free speech campaigners have also accused the French government of forcing him to censor Telegram. Durov was then charged and initially stopped from exiting France, while investigators probed the platform’s content moderation rules, accusing it of featuring harmful content. Last year, French President Emmanuel Macron dismissed allegations of political motivation in the arrest when he said in an August 26 X post that freedoms must be protected “within a legal framework” to guarantee citizens and their rights. His comments drew backlash, including Helius CEO Mert Mumtaz, who responded: “Why aren’t you personally in jail for not controlling 100% of all crime in France?”. Durov has said Telegram obeys “all” legal requests but will leave all jurisdictions where censorship is mandated. He also reiterated that the platform will not violate user privacy by sharing encryption keys or creating backdoors. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , his recent appearance at a Paris court shows that French authorities continue to press the case. This comes even as Telegram has stepped up cooperation. The case against Durov reflects the mounting friction between law enforcement and tech platforms over who should bear responsibility for online content, as governments around the world tighten their scrutiny of social media and messaging services. It also marks yet another instance of Durov openly criticizing French authorities. In September, he addressed his legal troubles in France by calling out authorities for sidestepping official EU channels and interrogating him directly. In his defense, Durov pointed to Telegram’s active moderation practices, including the daily removal of harmful content and collaboration with NGOs, while reaffirming his commitment to safeguarding the nearly one billion users on the platform. TON adoption grows as Telegram’s Web3 scene expands Telegram has become a hub for Web3 activity thanks to its integration with The Open Network (TON), whose native token, Toncoin (TON -2.43%), ranks as the world’s twenty-first largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to price data. Toncoin has also been adopted by Verb Technology, a digital asset treasury (DAT) company that holds more than 8% of the token’s circulating supply and plans to rebrand as Ton Strategy Company. User activity on TON spiked in the weeks following Pavel Durov’s arrest, though engagement has since eased from those highs, according to data from The Block. Durov was first permitted to leave France in March to travel to Dubai, where Telegram is headquartered, and his family resides.

Adding to the discussion, finance expert and crypto enthusiast Armando Pantoja shared a rare technical view, stating that although he does not often engage in technical analysis, the current setup looks like “the calm before a massive move up.” The 15-minute chart from Binance shows the digital asset’s price compressing between a descending trendline overhead and a rising trendline below, a structure consistent with a symmetrical wedge . I don’t do Tech Analysis often but this $XRP chart looks like the calm before a massive move up. pic.twitter.com/D6PAJyR3Qu — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) August 24, 2025 XRP Key Levels to Watch The asset recently fell below the bottom trendline of this wedge, but rebounded sharply from a demand zone near $2.77, rising to $3.09, and it is now headed for the upper trendline. The Fibonacci extension levels on the chart also mark short-term supports at $3.06 (Fib. 0.118), $3.03 (Fib. 0.236), and $2.979 (Fib. 0.382), with a deeper backstop near $2.7685 (Fib. 0.5). One of the primary drivers for this sharp rebound was the resolution of Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). If the asset can sustain its momentum and break through the wedge’s upper trendline, it could enter a new price discovery phase and experience the massive move Pantoja predicts. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Next Targets The target zones cluster around $3.168, $3.206, and $3.219. With the chart’s current price shown at $3.0913, those objectives sit reasonably higher. A move to $3.1679 represents a gain of about 2.48%. A push to $3.2061 represents a gain of about 3.71%, and reaching $3.2191 represents a gain of about 4.13%. All three targets sit above the upper trendline, and reaching these levels could signal a new phase of growth for XRP. Short-term risk also appears on the chart. RSI is shown at 78.75, an overbought level that often precedes cooling before continuation. That could produce a pullback toward $3.06 or $3.03 without invalidating the structure. If buyers defend those retracement bands and the rising lower trendline, a breakout through the upper boundary would keep the higher targets in play. Pantoja’s post places a bullish lens on a wedge that has compressed price action into a narrow range, and the analyst is confident that a breakout and another bullish phase are imminent.

Raydium, a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Solana blockchain, recently completed an astounding Raydium RAY token buyback . This isn’t just a routine financial maneuver; it’s a powerful statement of strength and commitment within the DeFi space. What Exactly is This Raydium RAY Token Buyback? Raydium’s developer, known as @0xINFRA on X, recently announced a significant milestone. Over the past 90 days, the platform expended an impressive $196.3 million to repurchase 71 million RAY tokens. This massive repurchase represents roughly 26.4% of the token’s circulating supply. To put this into perspective, a token buyback occurs when a project uses its funds to buy back its own tokens from the open market. This action reduces the total supply of tokens, which can, in turn, increase the value of the remaining tokens. It’s a strategy often employed to benefit existing token holders and demonstrate confidence in the project’s future. Why is Raydium’s Buyback So Significant for the Market? Raydium currently leads the industry in buyback profitability, a testament to its robust financial health and strategic execution. This substantial Raydium RAY token buyback offers several key benefits: Increased Scarcity: By reducing the circulating supply of RAY tokens, Raydium makes each remaining token more scarce. This can lead to increased demand and potentially higher prices. Enhanced Investor Confidence: A large-scale buyback signals to the market that the project team believes the token is undervalued and has strong future prospects. This boosts trust among current and potential investors. Demonstrated Profitability: Leading the industry in buyback profitability suggests that Raydium’s operational model is highly effective and generates significant revenue, which it then reinvests into its ecosystem and community. Moreover, this move showcases Raydium’s dedication to long-term value creation for its community, distinguishing it in a competitive decentralized finance landscape. How Does This Raydium RAY Token Buyback Impact the Solana Ecosystem? Raydium’s position as a cornerstone of the Solana DeFi ecosystem means its actions have broader implications. The success of this Raydium RAY token buyback reflects positively on the overall health and maturity of Solana’s decentralized finance sector. It highlights the network’s capacity to support large, profitable DApps. A strong Raydium attracts more liquidity and users to Solana, fostering a vibrant environment for innovation and growth. Other projects on Solana might look to Raydium’s strategy as a benchmark for their own tokenomics and community engagement efforts. What’s Next for Raydium and RAY Holders After This Major Event? The completion of this substantial Raydium RAY token buyback positions the platform for continued success. For RAY token holders, this could mean sustained value appreciation and a more stable investment. Looking ahead, Raydium will likely continue to innovate within the Solana ecosystem, expanding its offerings and reinforcing its market leadership. Investors and users should remain informed about future developments and community proposals. The proactive approach to token management demonstrated by this buyback suggests a commitment to ongoing growth and value for the Raydium community. In conclusion, Raydium’s $196.3 million RAY token buyback is a powerful display of financial strength and strategic vision. By significantly reducing its circulating supply, Raydium has not only demonstrated impressive profitability but also reinforced investor confidence and solidified its leading position within the Solana DeFi landscape. This move sets a high standard for tokenomics in the decentralized exchange space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a token buyback in cryptocurrency?

Existing investors are set for a 300% ROI minimum profit at listing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has crossed more than $14.8 million and has over 15600 investors to date. Promising aggressive 50x growth projections as ETH makes its systematic ascent. As decentralized finance ecosystems mature at a frenzied pace, Mutuum Finance’s new model is taking liquidity and headlines by storm, setting itself up for a dramatic shift in crypto market sentiment. Ethereum Trades Near $4,296 as Market Cautious, with Mutuum Finance on the Fringe Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at approximately $4,295.94 with some intraday stability after corrections and ETF-driven volatility recently. The broader crypto market has been defined by muted investor sentiment as Ethereum finds it difficult to consolidate near the $4,100–$4,300 zone amid short-term pressure and macroeconomic conditions. Meanwhile, the narrative wraps up with an update on emerging interest in a viral DeFi project, Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Stage 6 Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in the sixth presale round, priced at $0.035 per token. Following this round, the price increases by 14.29% to $0.04, reflecting growing demand and confidence by early adopters. The presale has already garnered over 15,600 investors and over $14.8 million in funding, reflecting strong early traction and investor interest. A USD-Pegged Stablecoin on Ethereum Mutuum Finance will launch a USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain with the objective of providing a stable, transparent, and secure store of value. The stablecoin will act as a stable digital asset for everyday transactions, decentralized applications, and portfolio stability over the long term. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins, which have always proven to be vulnerable to market volatility, this asset is designed with the objective of reducing speculation and avoiding the limitations of high volatility. Dual-Lending: Future-Proof DeFi Infrastructure Mutuum Finance presents a dual-lending strategy that merges automation with user-defined control to deliver a highly efficient and versatile decentralized finance ecosystem. Peer-to-Contract lending is executed by automated smart contracts that enable lending and borrowing without human involvement. Interest rates are automatically adjusted in real time based on the demand and supply in the market, rendering it a transparent and self-governing process. Peer-to-Peer lending enhances this by enabling direct interaction between lenders and borrowers. In this model, the intermediaries are cut out, and users have greater flexibility in setting terms and negotiating agreements, offering both accessibility and convenience of the platform. With this two-pronged approach, Mutuum Finance provides a stable, future-proof infrastructure that strives to foster financial inclusion, provide stable yields, and unlock opportunities for retail and institutional participants alike. Its focus on security, transparency, and scalability sets the stage for a sustainable and growth-oriented DeFi ecosystem. Mutuum Finance Provides Stability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) announced an official Bug Bounty Program with a reward pool value of $50,000 USDT. The project will choose four severities. These are critical, major, minor, and low. The project is also running a $100,000 giveaway to onboard the project community. 10 investors stand a chance to win $10,000 Mutuum Finance tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $14.8M from 15,600+ investors and is priced at $0.035 in Stage 6, which will move 14.29% higher to $0.04. With 50x growth expectations, a $100K giveaway, and a $50K CertiK bug bounty, it’s shaping up to be one of 2025’s most anticipated DeFi plays.

Over 300 financial institutions are now using RippleNet for cross-border payments, processing billions in settlements with remarkable efficiency. Reports confirm that in Q2 2025, institutional purchases of XRP reached more than $7.1 billion , underlining its growing acceptance by banks and payment providers. Yet as institutional flows consolidate around giants like XRP, retail traders and agile funds often rotate into leaner, high-upside plays where smaller inflows can spark exponential gains. That dynamic has recently brought MAGACOIN FINANCE into the spotlight, as conversations among analysts highlight it as a next-generation contender positioned at the opposite end of the spectrum—small enough to multiply rapidly, yet structured enough to capture long-term narratives. Why banks are betting on Ripple Global institutions such as Santander, SBI Holdings, and PNC Bank have already deployed Ripple-powered platforms. Santander’s “One Pay FX” app allows near-instant global transfers, while SBI Remit leverages XRP’s On-Demand Liquidity for Asian remittances. These real-world use cases are no longer theoretical—they are live, regulated banking solutions used by millions of customers. This momentum has been reinforced by regulatory clarity. The landmark settlement with the SEC officially determined that XRP should not be classified as a security in secondary markets. That legal breakthrough has already triggered the relisting of XRP on U.S. exchanges and renewed optimism around the prospect of spot XRP ETFs . With regulatory obstacles removed, banks and asset managers now have a clear runway to integrate Ripple’s solutions at scale. Ripple’s expansion in the U.S. is equally telling. By applying for a bank charter and Federal Reserve master account access , Ripple is positioning itself not as a fintech outsider, but as a regulated participant in the financial system. This ambition underscores why banks are increasingly aligning with Ripple: they want crypto technology that can scale within compliance frameworks. While banks focus on Ripple’s utility and compliance, retail investors are chasing the next big narrative. Here, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out. Positioned as a culturally resonant, it blends scarcity mechanics with an audited, capped supply structure that appeals to traders looking for asymmetric returns. Analysts suggest MAGACOIN’s trajectory mirrors early-stage meme tokens that later gained mainstream traction. But unlike many short-lived experiments, MAGACOIN comes with strategic expansion plans, audited credibility, and a rapidly growing early community. This combination has drawn attention to its presale phases, where entry costs remain low compared to future projections. For those who missed XRP’s institutional-scale growth, MAGACOIN offers a very different, but potentially just as rewarding, avenue for participation in 2025’s shifting crypto landscape. Forecast models even suggest that 25x growth could easily be achievable as liquidity expands and adoption grows. XRP sets the rails, MAGACOIN rides the narrative Banking adoption of XRP gives crypto legitimacy, ensuring regulatory structures embrace digital assets instead of excluding them. This creates downstream effects: when institutions validate crypto, investor appetite for smaller tokens often surges. MAGACOIN Finance could benefit from that renewed appetite. Historically, altcoins with strong cultural hooks have captured retail interest once the market environment turns bullish. XRP might become the backbone of institutional settlement, but it is tokens like MAGACOIN that capture attention and liquidity from traders seeking exponential upside. The timing is fortuitous, just as Ripple cements its role in banking, MAGACOIN positions itself as the retail growth story for 2025. Conclusion: banks fuel XRP, culture fuels MAGACOIN FINANCE Ripple’s XRP is the clear institutional favorite, backed by regulatory clarity, financial integration, and global adoption. But while XRP offers steady credibility and gradual gains, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides the early-mover potential of explosive growth . For investors, the pairing is complementary: Ripple defines the rails, MAGACOIN rides the narrative. With forecasts pointing to 25x potential upside , MAGACOIN FINANCE is earning a place on 2025’s shortlist of altcoins to watch. Just as banks move decisively into XRP, retail participants are eyeing MAGACOIN as the bold counterpart driving cultural momentum.

For those keen on discovering these nascent opportunities, platforms like Binance Alpha offer a crucial window. An exciting development is on the horizon: the Binance Alpha listing of Bitlayer (BTR) set for August 27. This move signals a fresh opportunity for enthusiasts to explore an early-stage crypto project within the trusted Binance ecosystem. What Exactly is a Binance Alpha Listing? Binance Alpha operates as a specialized platform nestled within the broader Binance Wallet. Its primary mission is to shine a spotlight on promising, early-stage cryptocurrency projects before they potentially gain wider recognition. Think of it as an incubator or a curated showcase for innovation. Purpose: To introduce innovative tokens to a broader audience and foster community engagement. Selection Process: Projects are chosen based on their community engagement and their alignment with emerging market trends. This rigorous vetting helps ensure a certain level of potential and relevance. Upcoming Addition: Bitlayer (BTR) will be officially added to Binance Alpha on August 27 at 10:00 UTC. This information comes directly from Binance’s official website, providing a reliable source for this significant event. This Binance Alpha listing offers a unique glimpse into the future of crypto innovation, allowing users to discover projects early. Why is Bitlayer (BTR) a Notable Addition to Alpha? The selection of Bitlayer (BTR) for a Binance Alpha listing is not arbitrary. Alpha’s stringent criteria mean that Bitlayer has demonstrated qualities suggesting potential impact and relevance within the crypto space. While specific details about Bitlayer’s technology or use case aren’t provided in the initial announcement, its inclusion implies it aligns with current market demands and boasts a dedicated community. For early adopters and curious investors, such a listing often serves as a green light to delve deeper. It encourages thorough research into the project’s whitepaper, team, and overall vision. The platform aims to bring projects that resonate with the dynamic nature of the digital asset landscape, providing a credible stage for their debut. What Does This Binance Alpha Listing Mean for Potential Investors? It’s vital to understand the implications of a Binance Alpha listing . While it provides exposure and validation for early-stage projects, it comes with a crucial caveat: it does not guarantee future listings on Binance’s main spot or futures trading platforms. Consider these key points: Early Exposure: Investors gain the chance to discover and potentially participate in projects at an early stage. This can be appealing for those seeking high-growth opportunities before wider market adoption. Due Diligence is Key: Since there’s no guarantee of wider adoption, individuals must conduct thorough research. Understand the project’s fundamentals, risks, and long-term viability before making any decisions. Risk vs. Reward: Early-stage projects inherently carry higher risks but also offer the potential for significant rewards if they succeed. Balancing these factors is crucial for any investor. The Alpha platform serves as a launchpad, offering a unique opportunity for discovery, but not a definitive endorsement for main exchange integration. Navigating Early-Stage Crypto Projects on Binance Alpha Engaging with projects featured on Binance Alpha requires a strategic approach. Here are some actionable insights to help you make informed decisions: Research Thoroughly: Beyond the initial announcement, explore Bitlayer’s official documentation, community channels, and development roadmap. Look for transparency and clear objectives. Assess Community Engagement: Alpha values community activity. Observe the project’s active user base, developer activity, and overall sentiment. Understand the Technology: What problem does Bitlayer aim to solve? How innovative is its proposed solution? A strong technical foundation is often a good indicator. Manage Expectations: Remember the disclaimer – an Alpha listing is a showcase, not a promise of future major exchange listings. Be realistic about potential outcomes. Start Small: If you decide to invest, consider starting with a small allocation that aligns comfortably with your personal risk tolerance. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. This disciplined approach can help you make informed decisions when exploring new opportunities like the Bitlayer Binance Alpha listing , ensuring you navigate the early crypto landscape wisely.

Ethereum continues to dominate as the institutional favorite, Shiba Inu maintains its cultural footprint in the meme sector, but a new name—MAGACOIN FINANCE—is capturing the sharpest attention. With ROI projections climbing as high as 20,000%, it has become the token analysts are calling the most ambitious presale of the year. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Forecasted 20,000% ROI As Ethereum attracts institutional inflows and Shiba Inu works to reignite its community base, MAGACOIN FINANCE has carved out its own spotlight in 2025. Its capped crypto presale is rapidly shrinking in availability, and the combination of scarcity and early demand has fueled forecasts that now stretch as high as 20,000% ROI for early entrants . This surge of attention reflects more than meme-driven speculation. Analysts argue that MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the cycle’s clearest asymmetric bet, drawing both whales and retail investors eager to capture the type of exponential gains that defined earlier meme phenomena. The project’s rise is increasingly being compared to the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, when hype and timing created generational returns for early adopters. In the same way, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale is being framed as a rare window where risk and reward align for those willing to step in early. While the volatility and liquidity risks are undeniable, the growing consensus is that MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the boldest speculative opportunity heading into 2025 — one that could either fizzle quickly or rewrite the meme coin leaderboard. Ethereum (ETH) — Blue-Chip Altcoin Growth Ethereum is unlikely to deliver 20,000% gains, but it continues to anchor portfolios as the dominant smart contract platform. Spot ETH ETFs have driven billions in institutional inflows this year, helping ETH surge past $4,475 and cementing its reputation as a long-term hold. Its appeal lies in predictability. With strong developer activity, billions in DeFi liquidity, and expanding real-world adoption through tokenization and NFTs, Ethereum remains the safest high-cap altcoin play for 2025. Analysts forecast steady price targets in the $5,000 to $7,000 range, making ETH a core choice for investors seeking stability. Shiba Inu (SHIB) — Community Power, Limited Upside Shiba Inu retains one of the largest meme coin communities and continues to build around its ecosystem through Shibarium and DeFi integration. However, analysts are clear that SHIB’s days of exponential growth are behind it. The token’s enormous supply makes another 20,000% rally virtually impossible, and whale activity has cooled compared to its early surge years. That said, SHIB remains relevant as a lower-risk meme option, backed by a strong base of holders and ongoing development. For new capital, though, much of the speculative momentum is rotating into emerging plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion — Speculation Meets Stability Choosing the best crypto to buy in 2025 comes down to strategy. Ethereum offers security and steady growth, Shiba Inu delivers community power with limited upside, and MAGACOIN FINANCE presents the riskiest but potentially most rewarding opportunity. Its presale buzz, whale participation, and 20,000% ROI projections have made it the center of market speculation heading into the next cycle. For risk-tolerant investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the token that could define 2025.

A significant Bitcoin whale , a long-time holder often called an OG, recently executed a truly massive transaction. This move involved converting a substantial amount of Bitcoin into Ethereum, signaling a potentially evolving strategy among major crypto investors. What does this mean for the market? Let’s dive in. What’s Behind This Massive Bitcoin Whale Move? Recent on-chain data reveals a staggering event: a single Bitcoin whale sold 19,663 BTC. This amounted to an incredible $2.22 billion. The funds were then used to acquire 455,672 ETH. Onchain Lens on X, citing a report from the Unit team (developers of Hyperliquid’s asset tokenization layer), brought this significant activity to light. Such large-scale movements by a Bitcoin whale always capture market attention, prompting questions about underlying motives and future market trends. Sold: 19,663 BTC (valued at $2.22 billion) Acquired: 455,672 ETH Source: Onchain Lens on X, Unit team report This particular investor is known to be a Bitcoin OG, indicating a deep understanding of the crypto landscape. Their decision to reallocate such a significant portion of their portfolio suggests a calculated move rather than a hasty one. It highlights a strategic assessment of the market’s current state and future potential. A Closer Look at the Ethereum Staking Strategy The story doesn’t end with the conversion. A substantial portion of the newly acquired Ethereum has already been put to work. Specifically, 279,000 ETH, worth approximately $1.13 billion, has been staked. Staking involves locking up cryptocurrency to support the network’s operations, in return for rewards. This action by the Bitcoin whale adds another layer of intrigue to their strategy. Why would a major investor choose to stake such a large sum? Earning Passive Income: Staking allows holders to earn rewards, effectively generating passive income on their Ethereum holdings. Supporting Network Security: Staking contributes to the security and stability of the Ethereum network. Long-Term Conviction: Staking typically implies a long-term bullish outlook on Ethereum, as the assets are locked for a period. The investor still holds 176,616 ETH ($832 million) on-chain and has additional BTC on Hyperliquid. They plan to convert this remaining Bitcoin into Ethereum as well, further solidifying their commitment to the ETH ecosystem. This reinforces the idea of a deliberate, long-term play by the Bitcoin whale . Implications of This Strategic Portfolio Shift When a Bitcoin whale makes such a significant move, it often sparks discussion across the entire crypto market. This shift could signal several things: Changing Market Dynamics: It might reflect a belief that Ethereum offers stronger growth potential or better risk-reward in the current market cycle. Diversification Trend: Large investors often seek to diversify their portfolios. Moving from a single dominant asset like Bitcoin to a leading altcoin like Ethereum could be a diversification play. Confidence in Ethereum 2.0 (Proof-of-Stake): The substantial staking activity underscores strong confidence in Ethereum’s transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism and its future scalability. This move could potentially influence other large holders, or at least encourage them to re-evaluate their own allocations. It highlights a growing maturity in how major players approach digital asset management. Navigating the Crypto Waters: What Does This Mean for You? While most of us aren’t Bitcoin whales , understanding these large-scale movements offers valuable insights. They provide a glimpse into the strategies of experienced investors. Consider these actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on on-chain data and expert analyses. Such insights help you understand broader market trends. Consider Your Own Strategy: This event highlights the dynamic nature of crypto investing. Re-evaluate your portfolio regularly based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Research Staking: If you hold Ethereum, exploring staking options could be a way to grow your assets, similar to the strategy employed by this large investor. Remember: Large individual moves do not always dictate the entire market, but they certainly provide interesting data points. They can signal underlying shifts in investor sentiment and capital flow. The recent, strategic move by a prominent Bitcoin OG to shift a massive $2.22 billion from BTC to ETH and then stake a significant portion is a compelling story in the crypto world. This action highlights a calculated reallocation of capital, potentially driven by long-term conviction in Ethereum’s ecosystem and its staking rewards. It serves as a powerful reminder of the ever-evolving strategies employed by major players and the continuous search for optimal returns in the digital asset space. This Bitcoin whale has certainly made a splash! Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a Bitcoin whale? A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Bitcoin. These holders often have enough capital to influence market prices with their trades. 2. Why would a Bitcoin whale convert BTC to ETH? Reasons vary, but they often include seeking diversification, believing in stronger growth potential for Ethereum, or leveraging Ethereum’s staking opportunities for passive income. 3. What does it mean to stake Ethereum? Staking Ethereum involves locking up a certain amount of ETH to help secure the Ethereum network (specifically, its Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism). In return, stakers earn rewards for their participation. 4. How does this transaction impact the broader crypto market? While one transaction doesn’t define the entire market, a move of this size by a Bitcoin whale can signal shifts in investor sentiment, potentially influencing other large holders and sparking discussions about the relative strengths of Bitcoin and Ethereum. 5. Is this a common occurrence for large investors? Large investors frequently rebalance their portfolios. However, a single transaction of this magnitude is notable and often scrutinized for its potential market implications and strategic insights.

Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes recently dropped a bombshell prediction: the U.S. stablecoin strategy could be the secret sauce fueling a massive crypto bull market that lasts all the way until 2028. This isn’t just a fleeting trend; Hayes suggests a calculated move by Washington to cement its financial influence globally, with profound implications for your crypto portfolio. What is This U.S. Stablecoin Strategy All About? Speaking at Tokyo’s WebX conference, Hayes painted a clear picture. He believes U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will actively push other nations to adopt U.S.-issued stablecoins. Think of it as a modern twist on expanding reserve currency dominance, but this time, it’s digital. This isn’t just about convenience; it’s about power. Here’s how Hayes explains the core idea: The U.S. aims to promote its stablecoins globally, much like it promoted the dollar in the past. This initiative could allow Washington to bypass the Federal Reserve, gaining more direct influence over interest rates. Essentially, it’s a strategic play to maintain economic leverage in a rapidly digitizing world. This aggressive U.S. stablecoin strategy would fundamentally change how global finance operates, creating a new pathway for American economic policy. How Could Stablecoins Fuel a Crypto Bull Market? Hayes’s prediction isn’t just based on policy; it’s tied to market mechanics. He argues that if benchmark interest rates drop to around 2%, the supply of stablecoins could skyrocket to an astonishing $10 trillion. Why does this matter for crypto? An increased stablecoin supply injects immense liquidity into the crypto market. Consider these points: Enhanced Liquidity: More stablecoins mean more capital readily available to flow into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins. Easier On-Ramps: Stablecoins act as a bridge between traditional finance and crypto, making it simpler for new investors to enter the market. Reduced Volatility: While still volatile, a deeper market with more stablecoin liquidity can absorb larger trades, potentially reducing extreme price swings. This surge in available capital, driven by the ambitious U.S. stablecoin strategy , would naturally support continued market growth, potentially sustaining a bull run for years. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for U.S. Stablecoin Strategy While the prospect of a prolonged bull market is exciting, achieving this vision won’t be without its hurdles. The successful implementation of the U.S. stablecoin strategy depends on several factors: International Acceptance: Will other nations readily adopt U.S.-issued stablecoins, or will they prefer their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)? Regulatory Frameworks: Clear and consistent global regulations are crucial for widespread adoption and investor confidence. Competition: Other countries and private entities are also developing their own stablecoin solutions, creating a competitive landscape. However, the opportunities are equally immense. If successful, this strategy could solidify the U.S. position in the digital economy, providing a stable, regulated on-ramp for global crypto adoption. It’s a game-changer that could redefine financial sovereignty. The Bottom Line: A Vision for Crypto’s Future Arthur Hayes’s vision presents a captivating scenario for the crypto world. The proposed U.S. stablecoin strategy isn’t just about financial instruments; it’s about a geopolitical play that could dramatically reshape the global economic landscape and, consequently, the crypto market. While challenges remain, the potential for a sustained bull market through 2028, fueled by a $10 trillion stablecoin supply, offers an incredibly optimistic outlook for investors and enthusiasts alike. It’s a bold prediction, but one that warrants close attention as the digital finance revolution unfolds. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the core idea behind Arthur Hayes’s U.S. stablecoin strategy prediction? A1: Arthur Hayes believes the U.S. will actively promote the global adoption of its stablecoins, similar to past efforts to expand the U.S. dollar’s reserve currency dominance. This strategy aims to enhance U.S. financial influence and potentially bypass the Federal Reserve in setting interest rates. Q2: How could a U.S. stablecoin strategy impact the crypto bull market? A2: Hayes suggests that if benchmark interest rates drop to around 2%, stablecoin supply could reach $10 trillion. This massive influx of stablecoins would significantly increase liquidity in the crypto market, providing more capital for investment and sustaining a bull market. Q3: Who is Scott Bessent, and what is his role in this strategy? A3: Scott Bessent is mentioned by Arthur Hayes as the U.S. Treasury Secretary who would be instrumental in pushing other nations to adopt U.S.-issued stablecoins, central to the proposed strategy. Q4: What are the potential challenges for this U.S. stablecoin strategy? A4: Key challenges include gaining widespread international acceptance, establishing clear and consistent global regulatory frameworks, and navigating competition from other countries and private entities developing their own stablecoin solutions. Q5: What is a stablecoin? A5: A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar or a commodity like gold. They aim to reduce the volatility often associated with other cryptocurrencies, making them suitable for transactions and as a bridge to other digital assets. Found this analysis intriguing?

While Ethereum and Solana remain central to institutional portfolios, a new name is now capturing attention. Analysts are projecting MAGACOIN FINANCE to deliver up to substantial returns, and its presale momentum has made it one of the most talked-about tokens heading into the next cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGACOIN) — Forecasted 44x ROI Investors scanning the top altcoins for long-term positioning keep coming back to MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is increasingly being ranked alongside Ethereum and Solana as a 2025 standout. With forecasts calling for a 44x move, it is drawing the strongest inflows among current crypto presales and establishing itself as the year’s leading altcoin opportunity. Momentum around MAGACOIN FINANCE has accelerated as traders shift capital from established names into higher-upside plays. The presale has already generated significant attention across retail and whale communities, signaling broad conviction in its growth potential. Analysts emphasize that what sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is not just early hype, but the level of sustained engagement around the project. Its rise is being compared to the breakout trajectories of past cycle winners, where community momentum and early positioning proved decisive. For many investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents a chance to capture exponential returns in a way that established assets can no longer offer. That is why it continues to lead discussions of the best altcoins to buy in 2025 . Solana (SOL) — ETF Momentum and Ecosystem Growth Solana remains a top pick among institutional investors after the launch of a dedicated ETF in mid-2025. The network processes over 65 million transactions daily with near-zero fees, making it one of the most efficient blockchains at scale. Developer activity has continued to expand, with DeFi and gaming leading adoption. More than $9 billion in value is now locked in Solana’s ecosystem, underscoring its staying power. Analysts see Solana as a growth-focused asset for those seeking scalability and ecosystem depth, even if it does not promise the same multiples as smaller presale tokens. Ethereum (ETH) — The Smart Contract Foundation Ethereum continues to anchor the market as the dominant smart contract platform. The recent “Pectra” upgrade reduced fees and improved throughput, strengthening its appeal for both DeFi and enterprise adoption. Institutional demand has also grown, with spot ETH ETFs fueling billions in inflows this year. Price forecasts for Ethereum range from $5,000 to $7,000 by late 2025, reflecting steady growth potential. While Ethereum is unlikely to match the explosive upside of emerging tokens, it remains the most reliable long-term holding for investors seeking stability in volatile markets. Conclusion — MAGACOIN FINANCE Takes the Lead Ethereum and Solana continue to offer strong foundations for portfolio growth in 2025. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is now leading the conversation, with forecasted returns of up to 44x and presale momentum that rivals some of the most successful altcoin launches of past cycles.

Japan is actively working to cultivate a welcoming Japan crypto environment . This development signals a significant move towards integrating digital assets into the mainstream financial landscape, potentially reshaping how we view investments and technological innovation in the region. Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato recently revealed the country’s commitment to fostering an atmosphere conducive to crypto development, according to reports from Jin10 . This announcement isn’t just a casual remark; it reflects a deliberate strategy to position Japan at the forefront of the digital economy. Japan Crypto Environment: What’s Happening? Minister Kato’s statement emphasizes a forward-thinking approach. He highlighted that cryptocurrencies could become a vital component of a diversified investment portfolio. This perspective suggests a shift from mere regulatory oversight to active encouragement of crypto adoption and innovation within Japan. What does this mean for the everyday investor and the broader crypto community? It implies that Japan is not only acknowledging the existence of digital assets but also recognizing their potential value. This positive stance could lead to clearer guidelines, increased institutional participation, and a more stable market for crypto enthusiasts. Why is Japan Embracing the Crypto Environment? Japan has always been a nation that values technological advancement and economic stability. Creating a favorable Japan crypto environment aligns perfectly with these national priorities.

Japan appears to view crypto not as a threat, but as an opportunity for progress. Navigating the Future: Opportunities in Japan’s Crypto Environment The commitment to nurturing a robust Japan crypto environment opens up numerous opportunities. For businesses, this could mean easier market entry, clearer operational guidelines, and access to a growing pool of tech-savvy talent. For investors, it translates into potentially more accessible and secure avenues for engaging with digital assets. However, with every opportunity comes responsibility.

A recent statement from Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has sparked significant discussion, highlighting a fascinating shift in this landscape. Speaking at the WeX2025 event in Japan on August 25, CZ confidently asserted that stablecoins are not just growing, but actively outpacing Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), effectively rendering many CBDC efforts obsolete. This bold claim invites us to delve deeper into why one digital asset class is flourishing while another struggles for relevance. Why Are Stablecoins Surging Ahead? CZ’s observations, reported by JinSe Finance, point to a clear divergence in market acceptance. He noted that stablecoins , typically backed by real-world assets like fiat currencies, enjoy significantly higher market acceptance and facilitate broader transactions globally. Think about it: when you use a stablecoin, you’re interacting with a digital asset designed to maintain a stable value, mirroring traditional currencies without the volatility often associated with other cryptocurrencies. This inherent stability makes them incredibly appealing for everyday transactions, remittances, and even international trade. In contrast, CZ highlighted that CBDCs are experiencing nearly zero adoption. Many countries embarked on CBDC experiments as early as 2013–2014, but these initial forays are now largely considered outdated and ineffective. The promise of government-backed digital money has yet to translate into widespread practical use, leaving a significant gap between ambition and reality. This stark difference in adoption rates forms the core of CZ’s argument. What Makes Stablecoins More Appealing Than CBDCs? The appeal of stablecoins lies in several key areas that resonate with users and businesses alike. They offer: Stability: Their value is pegged to a stable asset, removing the speculative risk often associated with cryptocurrencies. This predictability is crucial for commerce. Accessibility: Stablecoins can be easily sent and received across borders, often with lower fees and faster transaction times than traditional banking methods. They democratize access to financial services. Innovation: The ecosystem around stablecoins is vibrant, constantly developing new use cases in DeFi, NFTs, and beyond. CBDCs, on the other hand, often face hurdles related to privacy concerns, lack of perceived benefits over existing digital payment systems, and the slow pace of governmental implementation. Users often question what unique problem a CBDC solves that isn’t already addressed by mobile banking or private digital currencies. How is China’s Stance on Stablecoins Evolving? An interesting development CZ pointed out is China’s evolving approach to stablecoins . Historically, China has maintained tight control over cryptocurrencies. However, CZ observed a shift from this restrictive stance towards a more open perspective, particularly with Hong Kong taking a proactive role. This change could signify a growing recognition of stablecoins’ potential utility, even within jurisdictions known for strict financial regulations. Hong Kong’s active engagement in exploring frameworks for stablecoins suggests a pragmatic approach. They aim to balance innovation with regulatory oversight, potentially positioning themselves as a hub for digital asset development. This regional shift could have broader implications, encouraging other nations to re-evaluate their own positions on stablecoins. Are CBDCs Truly Obsolete? While CZ’s declaration of CBDCs as “obsolete” might seem strong, it reflects the current reality of their limited adoption. The early experiments simply haven’t captured the public’s imagination or offered compelling advantages over established payment systems or the burgeoning stablecoins market. For CBDCs to gain traction, they would need to: Offer clear, tangible benefits that private digital currencies or existing banking systems do not. Address privacy concerns effectively to build user trust. Demonstrate seamless integration into daily life without undue friction. The challenge for central banks is to innovate rapidly enough to compete with the agile, market-driven development seen in the stablecoin space. Without significant re-evaluation and adaptation, many CBDC projects risk remaining experimental curiosities rather than becoming widely adopted digital currencies. In conclusion, Changpeng Zhao’s insights from WeX2025 paint a clear picture: stablecoins are currently dominating the race for digital currency adoption. Their inherent stability, global accessibility, and the dynamic ecosystem built around them offer compelling advantages that CBDCs have yet to match. While central banks continue their exploration, the market has spoken, embracing stablecoins as a practical and effective solution for digital transactions. The future of money is undeniably digital, and for now, stablecoins appear to be leading the charge with astounding momentum. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What did CZ say about stablecoins and CBDCs? Binance co-founder CZ stated that stablecoins are significantly outpacing Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) in market acceptance and adoption, considering many CBDC experiments obsolete. 2. Why do stablecoins have higher market acceptance? Stablecoins are backed by real-world assets, offering stability, global accessibility, lower transaction fees, and faster processing times, making them highly appealing for various transactions. 3. What are the main advantages of stablecoins? Key advantages include their stable value (pegged to fiat currencies), ease of cross-border transactions, and their role in fostering innovation within the broader digital asset ecosystem. 4. Has China’s stance on stablecoins changed? CZ noted a shift in China’s stance from tight control to a more open approach, with Hong Kong actively exploring frameworks for stablecoins. 5. Are all CBDC initiatives considered obsolete? CZ specifically referred to early CBDC experiments from 2013-2014 as obsolete due to their near-zero adoption. For new CBDCs to succeed, they need to offer distinct advantages and address user concerns effectively. Did CZ’s insights resonate with you?

In a significant move that underscores this trend, SBI Group, one of Japan’s largest financial conglomerates, has announced a strategic partnership with Chainlink, the leading decentralized oracle network. This collaboration aims to accelerate the embrace of blockchain technology and digital assets by institutions globally, marking a pivotal moment for the industry. Why is Institutional Digital Asset Adoption a Game-Changer? Institutions, from banks to asset managers, are increasingly recognizing the immense potential of digital assets. They offer unprecedented efficiencies, transparency, and new investment opportunities. However, navigating the complexities of blockchain technology, ensuring security, and achieving seamless integration with existing systems have been significant hurdles. This is where partnerships like SBI and Chainlink become vital, paving the way for broader institutional digital asset adoption . Consider the traditional financial landscape. It often grapples with: Slow settlement times. High operational costs. Limited interoperability between different systems. Digital assets, especially when tokenized and managed on secure, interoperable blockchain networks, promise to address these challenges head-on. The collaboration between SBI and Chainlink directly targets these pain points. Unlocking Potential: The SBI Group and Chainlink Partnership The strategic alliance between SBI Group and Chainlink is set to revolutionize how institutions interact with digital assets. Announced via a PR Newswire release, this partnership focuses on leveraging Chainlink’s robust suite of services to facilitate the secure and efficient transfer of value across various blockchains. This is crucial for accelerating institutional digital asset adoption . The core of this collaboration involves three key Chainlink technologies: Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP): This protocol enables secure communication and transfer of value between different blockchain networks. It’s like a universal translator for blockchains, allowing assets and data to move freely and safely. SmartData: Chainlink’s oracle services provide reliable, real-world data to smart contracts. For institutions, this means access to accurate market prices, interest rates, and other critical information directly on-chain, powering sophisticated financial products. Proof of Reserve: This mechanism offers cryptographic proof of an asset’s collateralization, ensuring that tokenized assets are fully backed by their underlying reserves. This transparency builds crucial trust for institutions venturing into tokenized real-world assets. These tools are essential for building a robust infrastructure that supports the complex needs of institutional players in the digital asset space. What Challenges Does This Partnership Tackle for Institutional Digital Asset Adoption? The path to widespread institutional digital asset adoption is not without its obstacles. One major challenge is the fragmented nature of the blockchain ecosystem. Different blockchains often operate in isolation, making it difficult to transfer assets or data between them. Chainlink’s CCIP directly addresses this by providing a secure, standardized way for cross-chain interactions. Another significant hurdle is data integrity. Institutions require highly reliable and tamper-proof data to make informed decisions and execute smart contracts. Chainlink’s SmartData ensures that off-chain data feeds are delivered securely and accurately to on-chain applications, mitigating risks associated with unreliable information. Furthermore, trust and regulatory compliance are paramount. For tokenized real-world assets, institutions need assurances that the digital representation is genuinely backed by physical assets. Chainlink’s Proof of Reserve offers this verifiable transparency, helping to meet regulatory requirements and foster confidence among institutional investors. Paving the Way: The Future of Institutional Digital Asset Adoption This partnership is more than just a collaboration; it’s a blueprint for the future of finance. By combining SBI Group’s deep financial expertise and extensive network with Chainlink’s cutting-edge decentralized infrastructure, the two entities are creating a powerful synergy. This will undoubtedly accelerate the global movement towards institutional digital asset adoption . Imagine a future where: Real-world assets like real estate or commodities are seamlessly tokenized and traded across multiple blockchains. Financial institutions can issue and manage digital bonds with unprecedented efficiency. Cross-border payments become instant and significantly cheaper. The SBI-Chainlink alliance is actively building the rails for this exciting future, offering actionable insights for other financial players considering their foray into digital assets. It highlights the importance of robust, secure, and interoperable infrastructure. In conclusion, the partnership between SBI Group and Chainlink represents a monumental leap forward for the digital asset landscape. By integrating Chainlink’s CCIP, SmartData, and Proof of Reserve, this collaboration is actively dismantling barriers to institutional digital asset adoption . It promises to usher in an era of greater efficiency, transparency, and innovation across global finance, truly transforming how institutions interact with the burgeoning world of blockchain and digital assets.

Among the 10 best cryptos to buy now, Ethereum, XRP, and Avalanche are standing out — but a hidden gem presale is capturing even more attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE has entered the conversation, with analysts forecasting staggering returns that rival the early days of major altcoin breakouts. Ethereum: The Market’s Anchor Ethereum remains the top altcoin in crypto markets. Even though its price is down to $4,150 with recent volatility, Ethereum remains the backbone of the entire DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 adoption. With ETH ETFs gaining over $1 billion in inflows and strong institutional confidence, analysts expect ETH to rally toward $5,000 in the months ahead. Long-term investors see Ethereum as essential for any portfolio because of its developing dominance and network effect. XRP: Legal Clarity and Institutional Traction XRP has achieved regulatory clarity after years of uncertainty as confirmed not to be a security in secondary sales. Mature whales residing on exchanges have increased their accumulated funds to around $2.90, adding strong support for XRP. Even though there is perpetual volatility, analysts are expecting a surge in price towards $3.39 in September as ETF speculation builds and retail interest strengthens. Avalanche: DeFi and Real-World Assets Growth Avalanche (AVAX) is gaining a lot of popularity among retail and institutional investors. There are presently $300 million in tokenized hedge funds and $188 million in tokenized real-world assets on the blockchain. Currently trading close to the $23 mark, AVAX is showing strong support. If it manages to hold its momentum, we could see higher levels in the $32–$37 range. Avalanche is a strong buy for investors positioning themselves for the next cycle amid rising developer activity and the network’s scalability. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Hidden Gem Thousands of investors have already joined the wave into MAGACOIN FINANCE, with analysts forecasting a staggering 20,000% ROI in the next bull run. Ranked among the best altcoins to buy right now , momentum is accelerating quickly. Early buyers using PATRIOT50X unlock a 50% EXTRA presale bonus, but allocations are running out fast. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its capped supply, transparent audits, and heavy whale-backed demand. Analysts believe that these fundamentals position it not only as a meme-driven play but also as one of the most strategic accumulation opportunities heading into 2025. TRON and Chainlink: Driving Real-World Connectivity TRON (TRX) has become a strong backbone for stablecoin transaction volume, surpassing $668 billion. TRX is trading at about $0.35 but long-term holders are taking profits. As DeFi activity grows, TRON may look to hit $0.38 in the near-term as yields near 10%. Chainlink (LINK), which has been on the rise since mid-April, recently surged to yearly highs near $25.60. Specifically, the price was up 8% in a span of just one day. A collaboration of wallet businesses and oracle technology has contributed to the rise of the Chainlink coin. If momentum continues, analysts see long-term upside by 2025 to $50-55. Hedera, SUI, and BNB: Scaling Adoption Hedera (HBAR) is maintaining long-term stability in the $0.23–$0.26 range thanks to new partnerships and app launches. SUI is trading today at $3.48 and could test its yearly high of $5.37 on-chain engagement. At the same time, Binance Coin (BNB) attains strength at the level of $829. The coin is still near yearly highs and has witnessed some solid buying. Litecoin and Polkadot: Recovery and Value Plays Litecoin (LTC) has shown a recovery and now trades beyond $112. Over the last year, Litecoine (LTC) has increased by almost 70%. Analysts consider it a strong mid-cap buy, with the target set at $138. Polkadot (DOT), currently valued at about $3.89, might indicate a potential rally in the months ahead as prices are hovering above lows with increasing volumes. Conclusion Ethereum, XRP, and Avalanche are likely to be the clear leaders in the next bull cycle. Meanwhile, tried and tested TRON, LINK, and BNB also have their share of strong fundamentals. However, analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE is the real breakout candidate, with predictions of a staggering 20,000% ROI prompting unmatched presale demand. MAGACOIN FINANCE is proving to be impossible to ignore for investors who want stability with high upside.

Cardano’s recent rally is driven by stronger market presence and rising whale interest. Solana is working its way through a tight resistance range, keeping traders watching closely for a breakout. However, BlockDAG is pushing forward with a very different strategy. With over $381 million raised and its price at $0.0276 in Batch 29, it’s offering a rare early-stage entry. Between its sports tie-ups, real-world product demos, and a slick user dashboard, BlockDAG is not just trending, it’s setting the pace for what comes next. Cardano’s Climb Signals Whale Interest and Altcoin Rotation Cardano (ADA) is gaining attention with a steady increase in market strength. Its overall market dominance has jumped to 0.85%, showing a weekly rise of 16.19%. A 1.43% increase in daily dominance also points to growing traction among traders. Since mid-August, ADA’s market share has risen even as other coins have stumbled. This suggests a shift toward altcoins, especially those with stronger fundamentals. Technical analysts say this growing dominance could be a sign that a bigger price move is coming soon. If this trend continues, Cardano may emerge as one of the most promising Layer 1 platforms. With DeFi activity rising and large holders accumulating more, ADA is making a strong case for further growth, and buyers are starting to take notice. Solana Nears Breakout as It Moves Toward $210 Solana (SOL) is trading just under $198, bouncing back from $192 with help from $44.14 million in spot inflows. Since April, SOL has followed a rising channel pattern, and now it’s testing a resistance range between $200 and $210. The next key level is $199.25, with the main breakout zone at $210 to $213.26. The trend remains positive. Moving averages are lined up in support, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 62.65 shows strength without being overbought. Bollinger Bands are widening, signaling that volatility is about to rise. If SOL breaks above $210, a sharp move to $225 or $230 could follow. Some even point to $252 as a possible target if momentum holds. Institutional flows support this view, but failing to stay above $194 could bring a drop to $186. The next few days will likely decide the short-term outcome. BlockDAG’s Real Products, $381M Raised, and Batch 29 Entry Strengthen Leadership While Cardano and Solana continue to trade actively, BlockDAG is quietly building something more powerful. The presale has raised $381 million so far, selling over 25.3 billion coins. Its current price of $0.0276 in Batch 29 gives early backers a 2,660% return compared to Batch 1. The final launch price is set at $0.05, leaving more room for growth. In July, BlockDAG showcased real, working products. The X1 mobile miner showed how over 2.5 million users can earn BDAG coins right from their phones through a simple mining app. Alongside that, the X10 hardware miner proved its power by producing up to 200 coins a day with plug-and-play ease. So far, nearly 19,400 hardware miners have been sold, bringing in over $7.8 million. The project has also secured listings on 20 exchanges, including BitMart, LBank, and MEXC, showing strong planning ahead of its mainnet launch. Few presales offer this kind of visibility and access. BlockDAG’s partnerships with sports teams like the Seattle Seawolves and Orcas are giving it extra brand reach. Its newly upgraded Dashboard V4 looks and feels like a full trading platform. It includes real-time data, wallet balances, referral rewards, and daily leaderboards to keep users active and engaged. With long-term estimates placing BDAG anywhere between $1 and $10, the current price of $0.0276 is attracting serious attention. BlockDAG is not just a presale story; it’s proving its use case, growing its global community, and positioning itself for sustained impact in the market. Final Word Cardano’s return to strength and Solana’s steady chart setup are encouraging signs for this cycle. But BlockDAG is showing what it means to prepare for the long haul. From working products and confirmed listings to a growing user base and polished interface, it’s building more than hype, it’s building trust. With $381 million already raised, a low entry price still active, and real-world adoption in motion, BlockDAG is shaping up as the project to beat. If you’re watching for the next breakout name in crypto, this might be your clearest shot.

In the thrilling, yet often unpredictable, realm of digital assets, understanding market dynamics is crucial. Today, we’re diving deep into the recent crypto liquidation events that shook the perpetual futures market over the last 24 hours, revealing significant shifts and investor sentiments. What Exactly is Crypto Liquidation in Perpetual Futures? Before we unpack the numbers, let’s clarify what crypto liquidation means, especially within the context of perpetual futures . Essentially, liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This happens because their margin — the collateral they’ve put up — falls below a required level, usually due to adverse price movements. Imagine you’re betting on a cryptocurrency’s price to go up, using borrowed funds (leverage). If the price drops significantly instead, your initial collateral might not be enough to cover potential losses. Therefore, the exchange automatically closes your position to prevent further losses and protect itself. This mechanism is a critical risk management tool for both traders and platforms. The Shocking 24-Hour Crypto Liquidation Breakdown The past 24 hours have seen a remarkable amount of capital wiped out, primarily affecting ‘long’ positions — those betting on price increases. This significant event highlights the extreme volatility inherent in the digital asset markets. Here’s a quick look at the staggering figures for crypto perpetual futures liquidation across major assets: Bitcoin (BTC): A massive $236.43 million in liquidations, with an overwhelming 94.98% being long positions. This indicates a sharp and sudden downturn in BTC’s price, catching bullish traders off guard. Ethereum (ETH): Close behind, with $215.43 million liquidated, and 58.85% of these were long positions. While substantial, the lower long percentage compared to BTC suggests a more balanced, albeit still negative, sentiment or a less aggressive dip. Solana (SOL): Experienced $33.27 million in liquidations, with 59.19% also being long positions. SOL’s figures, though smaller in absolute terms, still represent a considerable impact relative to its market cap. These figures paint a clear picture: a significant downturn caught many long traders off guard, leading to substantial losses. The high percentage of long liquidations indicates a sharp price drop, forcing exchanges to close these leveraged bets automatically. Such events often lead to a ripple effect, impacting market sentiment and potentially triggering further price corrections. Why Does Crypto Liquidation Matter to Traders and the Market? Understanding these crypto liquidation events is vital for anyone involved in the digital asset space. Firstly, liquidations often amplify price movements. When a large number of long positions are closed, it adds selling pressure to the market, which can drive prices down even further, creating a cascade effect. Moreover, these events highlight the inherent risks of trading perpetual futures with high leverage. While leverage can magnify gains, it also dramatically increases the potential for rapid and substantial losses. Traders must always consider their risk tolerance and employ robust risk management strategies. The Ripple Effect: Psychological Impact and Market Sentiment Beyond the immediate financial losses, significant crypto liquidation events profoundly affect market psychology. Traders who experience liquidations may become more cautious, leading to reduced trading activity or a shift towards less risky strategies. This collective sentiment can influence future price action, often creating periods of consolidation or continued downward pressure. Moreover, the fear of further liquidations can deter new capital from entering the market, slowing down recovery. Therefore, understanding these psychological shifts is just as important as analyzing the raw data when assessing the overall health and direction of the perpetual futures market. Navigating Perpetual Futures: Actionable Insights How can traders better navigate the volatile landscape of perpetual futures and minimize their exposure to crypto liquidation ? Understand Leverage: Always use leverage responsibly. Higher leverage means a smaller price movement can lead to liquidation. Set Stop-Loss Orders: These are crucial tools to limit potential losses by automatically closing a position if the price hits a predetermined level. Monitor Funding Rates: Funding rates in perpetual futures can offer insights into market sentiment and potential price movements. Diversify and Manage Risk: Never put all your capital into one highly leveraged trade. Diversify your portfolio and manage your overall risk exposure. By implementing these strategies, traders can protect their capital and approach the market with greater confidence, even amidst intense volatility. The recent 24-hour crypto perpetual futures liquidation breakdown serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and unforgiving nature of leveraged trading. While the potential for high returns is alluring, the risks are equally significant. Staying informed, understanding market mechanics, and practicing disciplined risk management are paramount for sustained success in this exciting market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a perpetual futures contract? A perpetual futures contract is a type of derivative that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiry date, unlike traditional futures. It aims to mimic the spot market price through a funding rate mechanism. 2. How does leverage contribute to crypto liquidation? Leverage allows traders to open positions larger than their initial capital. While this can amplify profits, it also significantly increases the risk. A small adverse price movement can quickly deplete the margin, leading to forced liquidation. 3. Are all liquidations ‘long’ liquidations? No. Liquidations can be ‘long’ (when the price drops, closing a buy position) or ‘short’ (when the price rises, closing a sell position). The recent data showed a high percentage of long liquidations, indicating a market downturn. 4. What can traders do to avoid liquidation? Traders can implement several strategies, including using lower leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin, and continuously monitoring market conditions to react quickly to adverse price movements. 5. Does crypto liquidation only happen on specific exchanges? Crypto liquidation is a standard risk management mechanism across all cryptocurrency exchanges that offer leveraged perpetual futures trading. The specific thresholds and liquidation processes may vary slightly between platforms. Did you find this breakdown of crypto perpetual futures liquidation insightful?

ETH is now consolidating gains and might find bids near the $4,550 support. Ethereum started a fresh upward move and traded to a new all-time high. The price is trading above $4,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a rising channel with support at $4,750 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start another increase unless there is a close below $4,550 in the near term. Ethereum Price Regains Traction Ethereum price formed a base and extended its increase above the $4,550 level, unlike Bitcoin . ETH price gained momentum for a move above the $4,650 and $4,720 levels. The bulls even pushed the price to a new all-time high above $4,900. A high was formed at $4,956 and the price recently started a downside correction. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $4,207 swing low to the $4,956 high. Besides, there was a break below a rising channel with support at $4,750 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $4,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,820 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,850 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,920 level. A clear move above the $4,920 resistance might send the price toward the $4,950 resistance. An upside break above the $4,950 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $5,000 resistance zone or even $5,150 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,820 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,680 level. The first major support sits near the $4,580 zone and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $4,207 swing low to the $4,956 high. A clear move below the $4,580 support might push the price toward the $4,550 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $4,440 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $4,320. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

A recent report from NICE Investors Service, a respected South Korean credit rating agency, sheds crucial light on the profound implications for the nation’s banking sector. This development could reshape how money moves and how traditional financial institutions generate income, creating both challenges and opportunities. What are Won Stablecoins and Why Do Banks Care? Simply put, won stablecoins are digital currencies designed to maintain a stable value, pegged 1:1 to the South Korean Won. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, their stability makes them attractive for everyday transactions and remittances. While they offer efficiency, their emergence presents a complex scenario for established banks. The NICE Investors Service report highlights a significant concern: a potential reduction in banks’ interest income. This is because a substantial shift of funds from traditional bank deposits into stablecoins could shrink the deposit base that banks rely on for lending. This shrinking base directly impacts their ability to earn interest, which is a core part of their business model. Moreover, the report notes that the banks’ traditional intermediary role could weaken. If consumers and businesses increasingly use won stablecoins for transactions, the need for banks to facilitate these transfers might diminish. This presents a fundamental challenge to their long-standing position in the financial ecosystem. The Shifting Landscape: Who Wins and Who Loses with Won Stablecoins ? The impact of won stablecoins is not uniform across the financial industry. The NICE Investors Service analysis paints a clear picture: Banks: Potentially face negative effects due to reduced interest income and a weakened intermediary role. Securities Firms: Could see positive effects. As stablecoins gain traction, these firms might find new avenues for investment products, trading, and asset management services tied to digital assets. Credit Card Industry: Expected to experience a neutral impact. While stablecoins might offer alternative payment methods, the core services and infrastructure provided by credit card companies could remain largely unaffected initially. This nuanced view underscores the dynamic nature of financial innovation. While banks might face headwinds, other sectors could thrive by adapting to the digital currency era. Navigating the Future: Are South Korean Banks Ready for Won Stablecoins ? Despite the potential for reduced interest income, there is a silver lining for banks. The NICE report suggests that directly issuing won stablecoins could open up new revenue streams through fee income. This new income could potentially offset some of the losses from shrinking deposits, creating a new business model for the digital age. South Korean banks are not standing idly by. More than ten major institutions, including industry giants like KB Kookmin, Shinhan, KEB Hana, Woori, and Nonghyup, have already formed a consortium. This collaborative effort demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing the developments surrounding stablecoins. Their goal is likely to explore: Joint issuance strategies for won stablecoins . Developing common standards and infrastructure. Lobbying for favorable regulatory frameworks. Identifying new service opportunities within the stablecoin ecosystem. This collective action is crucial for traditional banks to remain competitive and relevant in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. By working together, they can leverage their combined resources and expertise to navigate the complexities of digital currencies. What Actionable Steps Can Banks Take Regarding Won Stablecoins ? For banks, understanding and adapting to won stablecoins is paramount. Key actionable insights include: Innovation: Invest in blockchain technology and digital payment solutions. Collaboration: Participate actively in industry consortiums and partnerships. Regulation: Engage with policymakers to shape a supportive regulatory environment. New Services: Explore offering stablecoin-related services, such as custody, lending, or integrated digital wallets, to generate new fee income. Embracing these changes can help banks transform potential threats into strategic advantages. In conclusion, the advent of bank-issued won stablecoins in South Korea represents a pivotal moment for the financial sector. While traditional banks face the challenge of potential interest income reduction, their proactive engagement through consortiums and exploration of new fee-based services demonstrate a strong will to adapt. The future of finance in South Korea will undoubtedly be shaped by how these institutions embrace and integrate digital currencies into their core operations. This is a dynamic space, and vigilance, innovation, and collaboration will be key to success. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are won stablecoins ? Won stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, directly pegged to the South Korean Won, making them suitable for everyday transactions and financial activities. How will stablecoins impact South Korean banks’ interest income? According to NICE Investors Service, if funds shift from traditional bank deposits into won stablecoins , banks could see their deposit base shrink, leading to a reduction in their interest income from lending activities. Which financial sectors are positively or negatively affected by won stablecoins ? The report suggests banks could be negatively affected, securities firms could see positive impacts, and the credit card industry is expected to experience a neutral effect from the rise of won stablecoins . What are South Korean banks doing in response to stablecoin developments? More than ten major South Korean banks, including KB Kookmin and Shinhan, have formed a consortium to collectively address and develop strategies for won stablecoins , indicating a proactive approach to this emerging technology. Can banks benefit from issuing their own won stablecoins ? Yes, the NICE report indicates that directly issuing won stablecoins could create new fee income streams for banks, potentially offsetting some of the losses from reduced interest income and opening new business models. The emergence of won stablecoins is a game-changer for South Korea’s financial future.

The positive ripple effects of such institutional moves include: Increased Market Confidence: Large-scale investments foster trust among retail and institutional investors alike, suggesting stability. Enhanced Liquidity: Greater participation by major players can improve market depth and stability, making trading more efficient. Mainstream Acceptance: These acquisitions push Bitcoin further into the mainstream financial narrative, reducing skepticism. Regulatory Clarity: As more institutions adopt Bitcoin, it often prompts clearer regulatory frameworks, benefiting the entire ecosystem. However, challenges remain. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and regulatory landscapes are still evolving. Companies must navigate these complexities carefully, but Metaplanet’s sustained strategy suggests a well-considered and risk-managed approach. The Strategic Advantages of Metaplanet Bitcoin Holdings Integrating Bitcoin into a corporate treasury is more than just an investment; it’s a profound strategic shift.

Investors are scanning the horizon for the best altcoins for 2025 , and a handful of names keep surfacing: XRP, Ethereum, BNB, and TRON. Alongside these, a new player, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is turning heads as whales move in. 1. XRP Price Prediction 2025 – Whale Accumulation Signals Upside XRP has become one of the best altcoins for 2025 thanks to heavy whale buying and strong ETF speculation. Over 900 million tokens were snapped up in just two days, suggesting that smart money is preparing for a breakout. The XRP price prediction 2025 points toward a wide range, with analysts watching for a push toward $8.50–$9 in Q4. With SEC approvals for an XRP ETF expected soon and BlackRock circling, retail investors are closely tracking this token’s next phase. 2. Ethereum Price Forecast – Institutional Demand Remains Strong Ethereum continues to show resilience with daily transactions holding above 1.7 million. CME futures open interest topping 2 million ETH shows institutions are favoring Ethereum as much as Bitcoin. The Ethereum price forecast hints at further strength if it maintains the $4,300 level. Analysts suggest ETH could reclaim higher ground if DeFi volumes keep rising, making Ethereum a top contender when ranking the top cryptos to buy in 2025. 3. BNB Crypto Outlook – Exchange Supply Squeeze Lifts Prices BNB recently hit an all-time high of $880 , backed by reduced exchange supply and institutional buying. Only 22.6% of supply sits on exchanges now, compared to 28.5% in mid-year. BNB All-Time Price Chart The BNB crypto outlook sees potential for $1,000–$1,500 targets if demand from both retail and institutional sides persists. Trading volume already surpassed $1.87 billion across exchanges, cementing BNB as one of the best altcoins for 2025. 4. TRON TRX Prediction – Network Expansion Boosts Confidence TRON is trading above $0.35 range after recent MetaMask integration, signaling stronger retail utility. Daily growth continues as developers add more dApps and integrations. Analysts watching the TRON TRX prediction highlight a potential steady climb through Q4, with TRX benefiting from stable DeFi adoption. TRON’s steady rise places it firmly on lists of the top cryptos to buy in 2025. 5. MAGACOIN FINANCE – The Rising Patriot Pick in the Crypto Market Forecast 2025 While blue-chip altcoins dominate headlines, analysts warn that the crypto market forecast 2025 may also reward hidden gems. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction with both whales and retail buyers calling it the “best altcoin under the radar.” The MAGACOIN benefit is its PATRIOT50X code , which gives buyers a 50% bonus , drawing in retail energy at the same time that whales quietly circle. With strong nationalist branding and momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as more than just another meme—it’s being called one of the best altcoins for 2025 that few are talking about yet. 6. Dogecoin Rebounds With Whale Support Dogecoin has rebounded around $0.22 , with whales adding $500 million worth of DOGE in Q3. The meme coin remains a favorite during speculative rallies, with 680 million DOGE accumulated by top wallets. This renewed whale activity suggests Dogecoin could still ride the broader meme cycle even as attention shifts toward newer tokens. 7. Shiba Inu Eyes Technical Breakout Shiba Inu is defending support near $0.000012, with a bullish cup-and-handle setup forming. With a trillion tokens changing hands and major wallet moves, SHIB is showing signs of gearing for a possible 125% upside in late Q4. If SHIB sustains accumulation trends, it could remain a contender among meme coins chasing speculative momentum. Final Thought – Altcoin Giants & MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Rising Star The best altcoins for 2025 —XRP, Ethereum, BNB, and TRON—are backed by whale accumulation, institutional interest, and network growth. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu continue to show they can rally when retail energy spikes. But the conversation is shifting. Alongside these big names, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as the rising star. With whales moving early, retail piling in, and a bonus available, it’s no surprise that some analysts argue MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the dark horse in the crypto market forecast 2025.

The second-largest cryptocurrency hit $4,954.81 on Sunday, marking its first all-time high since 2021. By Monday, it was trading slightly lower at $4,776.46, still up nearly 15% from Friday’s levels. The surge came as crypto markets cheered Powell’s remarks at Jackson Hole , where he hinted that interest rates could soon be lowered. The prospect of looser policy lifted equities and digital assets alike, with Bitcoin rising 4% on Friday and Ether leading the rally. $ETH looks ready to hit $5K really soon. After that, Ethereum will take a break before the next leg up. $10,000+ ETH is coming this cycle and there's nothing stopping that. pic.twitter.com/DIuCjqCtm7 — Ted (@TedPillows) August 24, 2025 Powell’s Jackson Hole Comments Spark Surge In September Cut Expectations Trump has publicly pressured Powell for months to cut rates, with the president criticizing him in June as “a political guy who’s not a smart person.” Powell’s comments shifted market expectations sharply, with CME FedWatch data showing an 87% chance of a September cut, up from 75% just a day earlier. Ethereum’s run has been bolstered both by macro factors and by structural shifts within the crypto sector. Ether treasuries have swelled, with corporate accumulators and ETFs driving demand. Data from Strategic ETH Reserve shows 10.6m Ether, worth more than $50b, now locked across entities and funds. Among the largest holders is Bitmine Immersion Tech , which recently added $45m worth of Ether. The firm, chaired by Wall Street veteran Tom Lee, now controls 1.5m ETH, worth over $7b. Other top entities include SharpLink Gaming with 740,800 ETH and Coinbase with 136,800 ETH. Nine Spot Ether Funds See Inflows With Zero Outflows Reported Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded net inflows of $341m on Friday, with none of the nine funds posting outflows, according to market data. That accumulation shows the changing market dynamic. Ether has consistently held above $4,000 this month, a level it repeatedly failed to breach since 2021. Unlike Bitcoin, which slipped 1.3% on Monday to $113,441, Ether has led the market’s momentum in recent weeks. Ethereum Now Priced Like Equities As Investors Embrace Rate Sensitivity Regulatory shifts have also supported the rally. A more favorable environment for stablecoins and institutional adoption has drawn traditional finance firms into Ethereum. Analysts point to growing use of the blockchain for settlement, tokenization and DeFi protocols as adding to its long-term appeal. Charley Cooper, chief operating officer of Ava Labs, said Powell’s stance was crucial. “Any cuts in rates are great for the crypto markets since lower rates increase money flow into riskier assets like crypto,” he said. He added that Powell has long shown an interest in blockchain, suggesting his outlook carries weight beyond monetary policy. Cooper argued the real story is how crypto markets now move with traditional risk assets. “Gone are the early days when people believed crypto operated independently of macro factors,” he said. “The fact that crypto now wants rate cuts because they boost prices shows it is being priced like regular equities.” Fed Minutes, ETF Outflows, Tariff Uncertainty Weigh On Bitcoin Meanwhile, Gadi Chait, head of investment at Xapo Bank, said Bitcoin’s pullback was not unusual. “Short-term swings like this are expected; they’ve long been a feature of the asset,” he said. This one likely came from hawkish Fed minutes, ETF outflows, and uncertainty around tariffs and geopolitics, he added. For Ethereum, however, the weekend’s breakout marks an important milestone. With its price near $5,000 and corporate treasuries expanding, the token has reasserted itself as the driver of crypto momentum.

Recently, the cryptocurrency community and traditional investors alike have been keenly observing the movements in Asia FX following statements from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. While the initial reaction saw a surge in Asian currencies, a subsequent ‘ticking down’ has left many wondering about the true implications. This article delves into the nuances of Powell’s remarks, the immediate and potential long-term effects on Asian currency markets, and what it all means for your investment strategies. Decoding Powell’s Dovish Tilt : What Does It Mean for Global Markets? When Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks, the world listens. His recent remarks, widely interpreted as a ‘dovish tilt,’ signaled a potential shift in the Fed’s aggressive monetary tightening stance. But what exactly constitutes a dovish tilt, and why did it create such a stir? What is a Dovish Tilt? A dovish stance indicates a central bank’s inclination towards lower interest rates or a less restrictive monetary policy. This often prioritizes economic growth and employment over inflation control. In contrast, a ‘hawkish’ stance favors higher rates to combat inflation. Powell’s Specifics: Powell’s comments suggested that the Fed might be nearing the end of its rate-hiking cycle, and that future rate increases could be smaller or paused sooner than previously anticipated. He acknowledged the progress made on inflation and hinted at a data-dependent approach. Initial Market Reaction: The immediate response was a classic ‘risk-on’ rally. Investors, anticipating an end to rising borrowing costs, moved capital into riskier assets, including emerging market currencies and equities. This explains the initial jump in Asia FX . This subtle but significant change in tone from the world’s most influential central bank has profound implications, particularly for regions sensitive to global capital flows like Asia. Asia FX Reacts: Initial Surge and Subsequent Correction Following Powell’s perceived dovish turn, Asian currencies initially experienced a notable rally. This was a direct consequence of improved risk sentiment and the potential for a narrowing interest rate differential between the US and Asian economies. However, this initial enthusiasm was tempered, leading to a slight tick down. What factors contributed to this dynamic? Why the Initial Jump? The immediate surge in Asia FX was driven by several interconnected factors: Risk-On Sentiment: A less aggressive Fed typically encourages investors to seek higher returns outside of safe-haven assets like the US dollar. This leads to capital inflows into emerging markets, boosting local currencies. Carry Trade Revival: With the prospect of US interest rates peaking, the attractiveness of carry trades (borrowing in a low-interest currency and investing in a high-interest one) increases. Many Asian economies offer higher yields, making their currencies more appealing. Improved Global Growth Outlook: A dovish Fed suggests less economic tightening globally, which can be beneficial for export-oriented Asian economies. Why the Subsequent Ticking Down? The subsequent slight correction or ‘ticking down’ in Asia FX can be attributed to a combination of profit-taking and a more nuanced re-evaluation of the situation: Profit-Taking: After an initial strong rally, some traders naturally took profits, leading to a temporary pullback. Re-evaluation of Fed’s Stance: While dovish, Powell’s statements were not an outright commitment to rate cuts. The market began to digest the possibility that future decisions remain data-dependent, and that inflation could still prove sticky. Local Factors: Domestic economic data, geopolitical tensions, and specific central bank policies within Asian countries also play a significant role. For instance, concerns over China’s economic recovery or specific regional inflation data can influence individual currency performance. To illustrate the dynamic, consider the performance of key Asian currencies around Powell’s remarks: Currency Initial Reaction (Jump) Subsequent Movement (Tick Down) Key Influences Japanese Yen (JPY) Strengthened against USD Slight weakening BOJ policy divergence, safe-haven demand fluctuations South Korean Won (KRW) Gained against USD Modest correction Export data, tech sector performance Indian Rupee (INR) Appreciated Stabilized/Slight dip Oil prices, capital flows, RBI intervention Chinese Yuan (CNY) Strengthened Consolidated China’s economic recovery, trade balance Understanding Central Bank Policy’s Global Ripple Effect The influence of the Federal Reserve extends far beyond US borders. Its monetary policy decisions create a significant ripple effect, impacting other central banks and global financial conditions. This interconnectedness is crucial for understanding currency movements, especially in emerging markets. How Does the Fed Influence Other Central Banks? Interest Rate Differentials: When the Fed raises rates, it makes dollar-denominated assets more attractive, drawing capital away from other regions. Conversely, a dovish Fed can reverse this trend, encouraging capital to flow into markets with higher growth potential or yields. Inflationary Pressures: US inflation and the Fed’s response can influence global inflation expectations. If the Fed is perceived to be taming inflation, it can alleviate pressure on other central banks to raise rates as aggressively. Policy Space: For many central banks, especially in developing economies, the Fed’s actions dictate their ‘policy space.’ If the Fed is tightening, they often feel compelled to follow suit to prevent capital flight and currency depreciation. A dovish Fed grants them more flexibility. This intricate dance of central bank policy means that even subtle shifts in rhetoric from the Federal Reserve can dictate the economic strategies of nations worldwide, directly influencing their currency valuations and overall economic stability. Navigating the Volatile Currency Markets : Challenges and Opportunities For traders and investors, the current environment in global currency markets presents both significant challenges and compelling opportunities. Understanding these dynamics is key to making informed decisions. Challenges for Market Participants Increased Volatility: Shifting expectations about central bank policy can lead to sudden and sharp movements in exchange rates, making it harder to predict short-term trends. Policy Divergence: While the Fed might be turning dovish, other central banks might still be fighting inflation or facing different domestic economic conditions, leading to complex and sometimes contradictory policy signals. Geopolitical Risks: Ongoing geopolitical tensions add another layer of uncertainty, impacting investor sentiment and capital flows, particularly in sensitive regions. Opportunities for Astute Investors Carry Trade Revival: As mentioned, a less aggressive Fed could re-energize carry trades, offering opportunities for investors willing to take on currency risk. Diversification: A weakening dollar could make a strong case for diversifying portfolios into other currencies, particularly those of economies with robust growth prospects. Hedging Strategies: For businesses with international operations, understanding these shifts allows for more effective hedging strategies to mitigate currency risk. Actionable Insight: In this environment, a diversified approach is paramount. Consider spreading your investments across different asset classes and geographies. Stay informed about economic indicators from major economies and the rhetoric from key central bankers. For those trading currency markets , employing robust risk management techniques, such as stop-loss orders, is more important than ever. The Federal Reserve’s Shadow: Long-Term Outlook for Asian Currencies The long-term trajectory of Asian currencies will heavily depend on the sustained stance of the Federal Reserve and its global implications. While a dovish pivot offers a near-term boost, the road ahead is complex. Potential for Capital Inflows into Asia If the Federal Reserve indeed pauses or begins to cut rates in the future, it could lead to significant capital inflows into Asian markets. This would be driven by: Search for Yield: Investors seeking higher returns will naturally look towards faster-growing Asian economies. Growth Prospects: Many Asian nations are projected to have stronger economic growth rates than developed economies in the coming years. Weaker Dollar: A weaker US dollar makes dollar-denominated debt cheaper to service for Asian governments and corporations, freeing up resources. Risks and Considerations However, the outlook is not without its challenges: Inflationary Pressures: A dovish Fed might lead to renewed inflationary pressures globally, which could force Asian central banks to tighten their own policies, potentially dampening growth. Slower Global Growth: While a dovish Fed aims to support growth, if underlying global economic issues persist, Asian export-dependent economies could still face headwinds. Domestic Policy Risks: Political instability, regulatory changes, or unforeseen economic shocks within individual Asian countries could always derail positive momentum. Ultimately, the long-term strength of Asia FX will be a delicate balance between the external influence of the Federal Reserve’s policies and the internal resilience and growth drivers of Asian economies themselves. Compelling Summary: Navigating the Nuances of Global Forex The recent ‘dovish tilt’ from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell initially sent a wave of optimism through global currency markets , particularly boosting Asia FX . This reflected a renewed appetite for risk and the potential for reduced pressure from rising US interest rates. However, the subsequent ‘ticking down’ underscores the market’s careful re-evaluation, acknowledging that while the Fed’s tone has softened, the path forward remains data-dependent and subject to various economic and geopolitical factors. Understanding the intricate dance between global central bank policy , local economic conditions, and investor sentiment is paramount for navigating these dynamic waters. As we move forward, market participants must remain agile, employing robust strategies to capitalize on opportunities while mitigating the inherent risks in a world where every central bank utterance holds significant weight.

Moreover, they have identified altcoins with institutional support that are likely to break out. This year’s best altcoins to buy already have some clear front-runners. Among them are Binance Coin (BNB), XRP, SEI, and fast-rising MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is a presale project. BNB Maintains Strength Near Yearly Highs BNB remained resilient today, presently trading at around $829 with a market cap of more than 120 billion dollars. Price action has been constant, where it hovers around its yearly high at $869. According to analysts, Binance is performing strongly because its exchange is dominant and continues to burn tokens while BNB is involved in DeFi and staking. Several investors think of BNB as a safe bet due in 2025 despite the volatility. XRP Consolidates With ETF Speculation XRP has stabilized around the $3 mark after weeks of regulatory delays over ETF approvals. The asset has proven resilient despite uncertainty, as over 93% of the circulating supply remains in profit. According to analysts, an XRP ETF approval could send prices back to its all-time high of $3.84. If institutional flows accelerate, it could also be $4.50. Traders looking for exposure to a primary settlement asset will find XRP a compelling option. MAGACOIN FINANCE Positioned as the Breakout Play BNB and XRP are established leaders, while SEI is gaining traction — but analysts say the real breakout lies in MAGACOIN FINANCE, still trading under $1. With forecasts of 55x upside and as much as 10,000% ROI potential, it’s being ranked among the best altcoins to buy in 2025. Early buyers are rushing to accumulate the token at the cheapest price, though supply is running out quickly. Analysts highlight that MAGACOIN FINANCE capped supply, verified audits, and whale-backed inflows give it the kind of fundamentals that fueled the earliest breakouts of BNB and XRP. If momentum continues at its current pace, MAGACOIN FINANCE could become one of the most talked-about altcoins of 2025. SEI Gains Momentum With Adoption SEI has emerged as one of the fastest-growing Layer 1 blockchains, recently surpassing 1 million daily active wallets and leading EVM-compatible chains in weekly activity. With strong traction in both DeFi and gaming sectors, analysts highlight SEI’s scalability and adoption curve as signals of long-term growth. Near-term volatility from token unlocks has not stopped whale accumulation, keeping SEI firmly on analyst watchlists for 2025. Conclusion: The 2025 Bull Market Leaders Institutional players are piling BNB and XRP in their wallets while SEI is fast catching on as a future blockchain leader. MAGACOIN FINANCE, on the other hand, has the greatest speculative upside according to analysts who predict exponential returns if momentum continues. For investors looking for stable yet high-growth opportunity, these four altcoins could be the best plays going into the 2025 bull market.

The race to $10 has become one of the defining narratives for altcoins in 2025. Traders are watching closely to see whether established names like XRP, Cardano, and Dogecoin can finally break into double digits, or if new contenders such as MAGACOIN Finance can capture attention with promises of outsized returns. Recent analyst reports suggest XRP has the strongest chance of crossing the mark first, though speculative momentum continues to build around other tokens. XRP (Ripple) — Leading the $10 Race XRP has steadily gained ground in 2025, trading around $3.50 as of late July. Analysts widely agree that the path to $7–$10 is becoming realistic by late 2025 or early 2026, driven by institutional adoption, whale accumulation, and improved regulatory clarity. Several recent breakouts have pushed optimism higher, with technical charts pointing toward continued upside momentum if current conditions hold. Although the $10 level remains ambitious, it is no longer dismissed as fantasy. Consensus views now place XRP as the most likely candidate to hit $10 first, especially if the broader market maintains its bullish cycle into year-end. Cardano (ADA) — Ambitious Targets, Limited Consensus Cardano has hovered around the $0.90 to $1.20 range throughout much of 2025. While some highly bullish projections suggest ADA could make a parabolic move toward $10, most mainstream forecasts are far more cautious. Analyst targets typically fall between $1.17 and $2.00, reflecting steady growth but nothing close to the tenfold increase required to touch double digits this year. For ADA to reach $10, it would require unprecedented market conditions and acceleration that are not reflected in the current consensus. As a result, the $10 target for Cardano is generally considered optimistic, with analysts rating its chances of achieving it in 2025 as very low. MAGACOIN Finance — Momentum From the Presale While XRP, Cardano, and Dogecoin dominate much of the mainstream $10 conversation, a growing number of investors are turning their attention toward MAGACOIN Finance. Analysts note that momentum around the presale has intensified as traders look beyond traditional names for higher multiples. Market sentiment increasingly frames MAGACOIN Finance as one of the best altcoins to buy for 2025, with FOMO building as new buyers flood in. Presale promotions have amplified this attention, particularly the limited-use code PATRIOT50X, which unlocks a 50% bonus for early participants. This has helped accelerate inflows and position MAGACOIN Finance as a speculative leader in the 2025 altcoin race. Though most forecasts suggest a $5 target is more realistic than $10 this year, its rapid adoption curve is driving investors to weigh it against larger, more established competitors. The combination of hype, community energy, and presale incentives is giving MAGACOIN Finance a unique role in the discussion, even if $10 remains out of reach in the short term. For risk-tolerant traders, it represents a different kind of opportunity compared to XRP’s more measured path. Dogecoin (DOGE) — Far From Double Digits Dogecoin continues to trade in the $0.10–$0.35 range, and most analysts forecast a potential rise to just $0.50–$0.58 by the end of 2025. Despite its meme coin status and strong cultural relevance, DOGE has not demonstrated the fundamental support necessary to fuel a rally toward $10. Even the most bullish technical models cap Dogecoin’s upside in the low single digits. As a result, analysts generally dismiss $10 as an unrealistic target within the current cycle, leaving DOGE trailing behind XRP, Cardano, and speculative plays like MAGACOIN Finance. Conclusion — XRP Out Front, MAGACOIN Rising Among the four tokens compared, XRP has the strongest analyst support for hitting $10 first in 2025, with momentum and institutional buying pushing it closer to the milestone. Cardano’s $10 target remains highly ambitious, while Dogecoin’s fundamentals leave it far short of double-digit valuations. MAGACOIN Finance is carving out a different role, riding speculative interest and presale-driven hype that continues to draw inflows. For investors tracking the $10 race, XRP appears the most likely to cross the finish line first. Still, MAGACOIN Finance’s growing presence in the conversation underscores how quickly sentiment can shift when community energy and investor incentives align.

The cryptocurrency's price fell by over 2% from $114,666 to $112,546 in under ten minutes to 07:40 UTC. The so-called flash crash occurred when a single whale sold 24,000 BTC, worth over $300 million, according to blockchain data firm Timechainindex.com. ""This entity liquidated their entire 24,000 balance, sending all of it to Hyperunite. They transferred 12,000 just today and are still actively selling, which is likely contributing to the ongoing price drop,"" the firm's researcher Sani said on X , adding that the whale still holds a total of 152,874 BTC across all associated addresses, including 5,266 BTC. ""The funds originally came from HTX about six years ago and had remained inactive until recent transactions involving one of their addresses containing approximately 24,000 BTC,"" Sani noted. Prices eventually hit lows under $111,000 before recovering to trade near $112,800 as of writing, according to CoinDesk data. Powel spike reversed The price drop has erased gains seen after Friday, after the Fed Chair Jerome Powell appeared to support the idea of rate cuts, while playing down the long-term inflationary impact of President Trump's tariffs during his annual speech at Jackson Hole. The so-called dovish speech saw BTC rally nearly 4% from $112,500 to $116,900 alongside a risk-on rally in U.S. stocks and the decline in the dollar index. Over the weekend, the analyst community expressed confidence that a rate cut would occur in September, potentially leading to new all-time highs in bitcoin and ether. Options disagree The Deribit-listed bitcoin options reveal a lingering risk aversion, according to data tracked by Amberdata. Specifically, the 25-delta risk reversals, a measure of investor sentiment comparing calls to puts, continue to trade in the negative territory through the December expiry, reflecting hedging activity and a bearish title. A negative risk reversal means that put options, which offer insurance against price declines, are more expensive than call options. In other words, despite the so-called dovish pivot by Powell, BTC options traders continue to price in uncertainty, bracing for a potential downside volatility.

A significant event is on the horizon for early-stage projects: the much-anticipated Alttown listing on Binance Alpha. This move could signal exciting new opportunities for the TOWN token and its community, drawing attention from across the digital asset landscape. What is Binance Alpha and the Alttown Listing ? Binance Alpha is an innovative platform nested within the broader Binance Wallet ecosystem. It serves as a launchpad, spotlighting promising early-stage crypto projects that have demonstrated strong community engagement and align with emerging market trends. Think of it as a discovery zone for potential future stars in the crypto space, offering early exposure. The latest project to capture Alpha’s attention is Alttown (TOWN). According to an official X post from Binance Wallet, the Alttown listing on Binance Alpha is set for August 26. This announcement has generated considerable buzz, as it provides a crucial platform for TOWN to gain visibility among a vast user base. Why Does an Alpha Listing Matter for Alttown Listing ? While an Alpha listing doesn’t guarantee a subsequent appearance on Binance’s main spot or futures markets, it offers several key benefits for projects like TOWN. It’s a powerful stepping stone for emerging tokens. Enhanced Visibility: Being featured on Binance Alpha exposes TOWN to millions of Binance Wallet users, significantly increasing its reach and potential investor base. Credibility Boost: Alpha’s selection process, based on community engagement and market trends, lends a degree of credibility to listed projects. This helps build trust. Early Investor Access: It provides an opportunity for early adopters and investors to discover and engage with the TOWN token before it potentially hits larger exchanges, offering a first-mover advantage. Community Growth: Increased exposure often translates to a growing community, which is vital for any crypto project’s long-term success and resilience. Therefore, this Alttown listing represents a pivotal moment for the project’s development and market presence, opening new doors for engagement. Understanding the Selection Process and Future Prospects for Alttown Listing Binance Alpha employs a rigorous selection process, focusing on projects that exhibit robust community activity and resonate with current market trends. This approach helps filter out less viable projects, presenting users with potentially higher-quality early-stage assets. Transparency in selection is key to its value. However, it’s crucial for enthusiasts and potential investors to understand the distinction: an Alpha listing is not a direct pipeline to a full Binance exchange listing. It serves as an independent showcase. Projects must continue to demonstrate their value, utility, and community support to potentially progress further within the Binance ecosystem. The journey for TOWN after its Alttown listing will depend heavily on its continued development and market performance, underscoring the need for ongoing innovation. What Should Investors Consider with the Alttown Listing ? For those interested in the TOWN token, the upcoming Alpha listing presents both excitement and the need for careful consideration. Here are some actionable insights to guide your decisions: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always thoroughly research any project, including Alttown. Understand its fundamentals, team, technology, and use case before making any commitments. Monitor Community Engagement: Since Alpha prioritizes community, observe TOWN’s community activity and development progress post-listing. Strong community signals ongoing support. Understand the Risks: Early-stage projects carry inherently higher risks. Be aware that token prices can be volatile, and there’s no guarantee of future success or a main exchange listing. Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from Binance Wallet and Alttown to keep abreast of any new developments and changes. This transparent approach to project showcasing helps users make informed decisions, fostering a more secure investment environment. The upcoming Alttown listing on Binance Alpha on August 26 marks a significant milestone for the TOWN token. It offers a unique opportunity for early discovery and engagement within the vast Binance ecosystem. While it doesn’t promise a direct path to the main exchange, it undeniably boosts visibility and credibility for Alttown. As always, diligent research and a clear understanding of the risks associated with early-stage crypto projects are paramount for any participant navigating this dynamic market.

Recent activity shows this clearly: XRP technical analysis revealed rejection at a critical ceiling, raising doubts about its momentum, while the Monero (XMR) price jump managed to push through despite a deposit halt, though its sustainability remains in question. Meanwhile, BlockDAG has carved out an entirely different story. With $381M raised, over 25B coins sold, and an ROI of 2,660% since batch one, it has turned early belief into measurable gains. Where other coins wrestle with short-term swings, BlockDAG’s presale has cemented its place among the top crypto coins right now, showing how consistent delivery can translate into results even before a single exchange debut. Early Backers See 26x Jump As BlockDAG Expands BlockDAG’s presale has become a standout in 2025 for showing how early conviction can pay off. Beginning at only $0.001, the price has climbed to $0.0276 by batch 29, giving early backers a massive 2,660% ROI. While this milestone alone is impressive, the broader story lies in how this growth has been achieved through structure, vision, and consistency. Unlike hype-driven rallies, BlockDAG’s rise stems from steady delivery. The rollout of mining rigs, progress on its testnet, and a clear path to mainnet have given the community concrete signs of progress. Add in constant communication and active engagement with holders, and it has built strong trust, turning short-term speculators into long-term believers who see more than just price action. So far, the presale has collected $381M and sold more than 25B coins, putting it among the top crypto coins in terms of reach and traction. Every batch increase reinforces demand while rewarding early participation, creating momentum that builds before exchanges even come into play. In essence, BlockDAG is rewarding timing, patience, and belief in its real-world direction, something most projects struggle to prove before launch, and a sign of how far-reaching its impact could be once trading begins. XRP Struggles To Hold Above $2.99 XRP met resistance at $3.09 after a quick push to $3.10, stalling its rally. Renewed selling pressure emerged near that zone, and despite rising trading volume from institutional activity, buyers couldn’t force a breakout. This highlighted that bigger players were taking profit and fading the gains, showing how fragile momentum can be when resistance walls hold firm. On the shorter charts, XRP held within a tight band between $2.94 and $3.10, with support sitting just around $3.00. Yet, slipping back under $2.99 left it vulnerable to testing $2.96, a level closely watched by bearish traders. If selling continues at these pressure points, it could create further hesitation in the market and limit near-term upside potential. From an XRP technical analysis view, momentum appears to be fading. The inability to stay above resistance and the looming threat of dropping into lower support signals caution for anyone anticipating further upside continuation, especially as broader market volatility makes each resistance test more difficult to sustain. Monero Defies Network Concerns With Rally Monero (XMR) climbed about 4% despite deposit services being paused, marking a standout move as the market turned shaky. Confidence in its resilience grew even as Kraken temporarily froze deposits due to concerns over one miner, Qubic, controlling a large share of hash power, which had raised fears of centralization among traders. The rally was backed up by indicators, too. RSI hovered around 56.49, while a bullish MACD crossover flashed on charts, signaling rising buy-side strength. Analysts suggest if demand stays firm, the Monero (XMR) price jump could stretch toward $325, showing there’s still appetite despite the temporary disruption. If momentum weakens, however, it risks sliding back near $270, making this a critical level to watch for the short term. For now, Monero’s ability to rise in the face of technical and network challenges underscores its reputation for resilience. Whether this turns into a longer-term trend will depend on how both demand and the hash power situation evolve in the coming weeks. Looking Ahead XRP technical analysis shows weakness after rejection at resistance, while the Monero (XMR) price jump reflects strength, yet also volatility tied to network concerns. In contrast, BlockDAG shows how steady execution and open communication create durable momentum and lasting confidence from its growing base. With $381M raised, 25B coins sold, and a 2,660% ROI since its earliest batch, BlockDAG’s growth story goes beyond short-term hype. Instead, it shows how clear delivery and real utility can build lasting trust, making it stand out against the unpredictable swings faced by others. This level of traction so early, before exchange trading even begins, signals that its roadmap and execution have struck a chord with the market in a way that few presales manage. For those watching from the sidelines, it demonstrates how disciplined follow-through can transform a concept into one of the top crypto projects to track heading into launch.

Analysts are pointing to Shiba Inu, PEPE, Dogecoin, Cardano, and MAGACOIN FINANCE as some of the best meme coins to buy for a 100x price pump potential in 2025. Shiba Inu Analysts Call Time on Breakout Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.00001246, down 10% in the past year, underperforming while Bitcoin surged 90%. However, TradingView analyst Hamidemo believes time is running out for buyers before SHIB begins a breakout. He notes that SHIB has been consolidating for over a year inside a massive triangular pattern. If it breaks, a 528% surge could take SHIB to $0.000078, with some analysts even targeting $0.000115. With many dismissing SHIB in its accumulation phase, analysts argue that it could become one of the fastest movers when sentiment shifts. PEPE Accumulation Signals Growing Interest PEPE, priced at $0.00001048, continues to attract long-term holders despite recent pullbacks. Exchange reserves dropped by 0.5% in the last 30 days, meaning fewer tokens are available on exchanges, while whales increased holdings by 1.5% over the same period. These trends indicate accumulation and faith in its staying power. With nearly half a billion dollars in daily trading volume, PEPE remains a top choice in the meme coin market. As altcoin appetite grows, its loyal community and supply dynamics keep it among the best meme coins to buy for 2025. Dogecoin Maintains Its Meme Coin Crown Dogecoin (DOGE), trading at $0.216, continues to dominate meme coin discussions thanks to its massive brand power and strong liquidity. It is consistently among the most traded assets, often ranking in the top 10 by volume. Dogecoin’s merge-mined structure with Litecoin adds to its security, while its broad visibility keeps it relevant for both retail and institutional traders. Once broader market sentiment improves, analysts expect DOGE to recover quickly. Its status as the original meme coin ensures it remains a natural pick for investors eyeing major rebounds. MAGACOIN FINANCE: ROI, Price Prediction & FOMO Factor MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention as one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025, with many traders eyeing it for high ROI opportunities. Analysts highlight growing FOMO around this community-owned project, noting that early buyers see it as a rare chance before listings. MAGACOIN combines meme coin appeal with DeFi infrastructure, making it more than just hype-driven. Market watchers suggest that with rising attention shifting toward this altcoin, it could become a top pick alongside SHIB, PEPE, and DOGE. For those looking for the next 100x play, MAGACOIN is increasingly seen as one to watch closely. What Should Traders Do Next? With meme coins back in the spotlight, traders are rebalancing their strategies ahead of 2025. Shiba Inu and PEPE show accumulation signs, Dogecoin keeps its dominance, and Cardano adds credibility with institutional interest. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting early buyers looking for outsized ROI.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/market-expert-says-stop-buying-xrp-after-this-date-heres-why/,"Popular crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto has recently presented a worrying timeline for XRP’s current bull cycle. In a recent video, he stated that the bull run “could literally end in one or two months,” adding that the market-cycle indicator that inspired this prediction has been “extremely accurate in the past.” The analyst warned investors to stop buying XRP after the cycle, reinforcing the bearish sentiment. His analysis invites a closer look at whether XRP is in the final phase of its upswing and what investors must do next. The chart shows the first cycle between 2017 and 2018, where XRP hit $3.36 before an extended consolidation that lasted for years. The second bull cycle ran from 2020 to 2021 with a peak of $1.96. Many experts believe the legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suppressed XRP’s price in 2021, preventing the asset from reaching a new all-time high while other assets performed beyond expectations. STOP Buying #XRP .. (after this date) pic.twitter.com/ZthPHLTc7B — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 24, 2025 XRP’s Current Cycle The current cycle has been a notable one for XRP. The digital asset began this run in late 2024, reaching a multi-year high of $3.39 in January. It also experienced its highest monthly close that month, exciting investors for a continued surge. However, it entered an extended consolidation phase before a quick rebound in July, renewing the bullish sentiment and reaching a new all-time high of $3.65 . While many analysts still anticipate a further climb, Steph’s chart suggests that the asset has exhausted the bullish momentum. Its price fell below the $3 support level in early August, but while it has reclaimed that level, this analysis suggests that another major decline is coming. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Is XRP Going to Fall Again? While a signal like this could end XRP’s bull run under normal circumstances, the asset is currently in a very different position. Ripple and the SEC have recently dismissed their appeals , ending years of legal turmoil and providing regulatory clarity for the digital asset in the U.S. Now that the lawsuit is over, many market participants expect continued strength. Legal clarity reduces uncertainty, supports liquidity, and attracts institutional participation. With all these bullish forces working together, the sentiment surrounding XRP might shift, and bulls might extend the current run with buying pressure, expecting continued growth for the asset as institutional and retail adoption grow.

SOL price is now consolidating above $200 and might aim for more gains above the $212 zone. SOL price started a fresh upward move above the $192 and $202 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $200 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a rising channel forming with support at $205 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could extend gains if it clears the $212 resistance zone. Solana Price Aims For More Gains Solana price started a decent increase after it found support near the $188 zone, unlike Bitcoin and like Ethereum . SOL climbed above the $195 level to enter a short-term positive zone. The price even smashed the $202 resistance. The bulls were able to push the price above the $208 barrier. A high was formed at $213 and the price is consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $177 swing low to the $213 high. Solana is now trading above $200 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a rising channel forming with support at $205 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $212 level. The next major resistance is near the $215 level. The main resistance could be $220. A successful close above the $220 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $225. Any more gains might send the price toward the $232 level. Downside Correction In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $212 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $205 zone. The first major support is near the $202 level.

The Tokyo-listed company now holds 18,991 Bitcoin in total, purchased at an average price of 15.05m yen per coin. In dollar terms, its stash is valued at more than $2.14b at current exchange rates. The move comes just a week after Metaplanet added 775 Bitcoin to its balance sheet, showing its rapid accumulation pace. This latest buy is part of what the firm calls its Bitcoin Treasury Operations, a strategy formalized last year to position Bitcoin as a core corporate reserve asset. Under this approach, Metaplanet taps capital markets through share issuances and bond programs, then channels the proceeds directly into Bitcoin acquisitions. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 103 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 18,991 BTC* pic.twitter.com/kCDNFw2zTy — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) August 25, 2025 Partial Redemption Of 19th Series Bonds Signals Balance Sheet Optimization As part of its balance sheet management, Metaplanet also redeemed 3b yen (about $20.4m) of its 19th Series Ordinary Bonds. The partial redemption reflects the company’s effort to optimize liabilities while continuing to allocate aggressively into Bitcoin. Metaplanet has attracted attention across financial markets for its aggressive pivot into digital assets. Often dubbed “Asia’s MicroStrategy” by industry watchers, the firm has mirrored the US software company’s strategy of leveraging corporate financing to build a massive Bitcoin war chest. Recent disclosures show the company actively uses stock acquisition rights to raise capital. Earlier this month, more than 4.9m new shares were issued following the exercise of warrants, further funding its crypto purchases. Metaplanet’s Strategy Anchored On Long-Term Bitcoin Value Over Fiat Reserves The company’s filings also outline its use of unique performance metrics such as “BTC Yield” and “BTC Gain” to measure shareholder value in Bitcoin terms rather than traditional profit and loss. In the quarter to date, Metaplanet reported a 29.1% BTC Yield, showing how its holdings per share continue to rise despite equity dilution. Its rapid accumulation also reflects Japan’s growing role in digital assets, at a time when regulatory clarity in the US has driven renewed institutional interest. The company’s aggressive stance comes against a backdrop of volatile markets. Bitcoin has been trading around $113,000 in recent days, pulling back slightly after setting record highs earlier this month. For Metaplanet shareholders, the wager is clear. Management has repeatedly argued that Bitcoin offers superior long-term value preservation compared with fiat cash reserves, and that the company’s role is to maximize Bitcoin per share through disciplined financing.

50637134,https://square.htx.com/?p=45773,1756099352,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/100/default.png,From Trading to Empowerment: HTX Unveils 2025 Mid-Year Performance and Strategic Roadmap,https://square.htx.com/from-trading-to-empowerment-htx-unveils-2025-mid-year-performance-and-strategic-roadmap/,"Panama, July 29, 2025 – HTX, a leading global crypto exchange, recently announced its robust performance for the first half of 2025, demonstrating resilient growth in both user base and trading volume despite macro headwinds and a shifting regulatory environment. To mark the occasion, HTX held a livestreamed strategy session on July 22, hosted by Molly, a leading voice within the HTX DAO ecosystem. The session featured a detailed review of HTX and HTX DAO’s achievements in the first half of the year, alongside a preview of key initiatives planned for the second half. From user acquisition and asset expansion to DAO governance upgrades and global compliance, both platforms continue to push the boundaries of user empowerment and ecosystem growth in the crypto space. A Growth Paradigm Backed by Strategic Focus While many crypto exchanges experienced stagnation or even recession in the first half of 2025, HTX defied market gravity with strong double-digit growth: ● User base surged past 50 million, marking a 14% increase in the past six months ● Trading volume rose by 17% YoY, with traders increasing by 11% ● In Q1, HTX stood out as the only Top 10 exchange to post positive trading volume growth, despite broad market weakness The third-party data strongly supports HTX’s resilience. As of end-May, at a time when global capital inflows became increasingly selective, HTX led the industry across 24H/7D/30D net inflows, reinforcing its status as a trusted “safe harbor” amid volatility. Behind these numbers lies HTX’s long-term commitment to high-quality assets, emerging narratives, and enhanced user experience. The platform secured early spots in key narratives like meme coins, AI, and stablecoins, and was among the first to launch breakout tokens in these sectors. HTX has also reportedly emerged as a first mover in stablecoin infrastructure. Spotting early signals from regulators and institutions this year, HTX identified stablecoins as a critical bridge between traditional finance and Web3, essential for broader crypto adoption and large-scale application. Prioritizing long-term ecosystem value over short-term profit, the platform launched six major stablecoins, including USD1, in May, accelerating its exploration in this sector. Meanwhile, HTX DAO continued to build its system infrastructure beyond token price, introducing a $HTX deflationary mechanism and deepening community governance. In Q2, $HTX burn volume rose by 15% quarter-over-quarter, bringing total burned value to $136 million, nearly 10% of its market cap. This demonstrates HTX DAO’s commitment to value anchoring and deflationary tokenomics. *View the full H1 2025 HTX performance report: https://square.htx.com.de/htx-releases-2025-mid-year-report-50-million-users-6-4-billion-assets-and-hot-crypto-surging-850-securely-positioned-among-the-worlds-top-exchanges/ Charting the Future with User Empowerment at the Core After a foundational first half, HTX is doubling down on its long-term goal of building a decentralized, fully transparent “People’s Exchange,” while HTX DAO is entering a new phase centered on community-driven governance. ● Climbing the compliance curve via on-chain value allocation According to Molly, HTX DAO is actively exploring partnerships with compliant U.S.-based exchanges. While regulatory complexity has slowed progress, the strategic intent remains clear and unwavering. Additionally, a newly updated HTX DAO whitepaper, now under legal review, will enshrine a mechanism to burn 50% of quarterly revenue in $HTX. “This signals HTX DAO’s shift toward deeper compliance and true decentralization,” said Molly. “By transparent revenue allocation and token burn mechanism, we’re reinforcing community trust and creating long-term value for $HTX holders.” ● Shifting governance and rewarding rights to the community through token empowerment HTX DAO’s second-half priority is token-based empowerment. Beyond the existing voting and token recommendation mechanisms, new initiatives will further decentralize governance and incentivize participation: 1. DAO Treasury System : A share of trading fees will flow into a community-managed treasury, funding ecosystem growth and innovation. 2. On-Chain Point-Based Reward System: Community engagement, such as posting, content sharing, or project referrals, will be recorded on-chain. Contributors will be rewarded via future token airdrops, transforming participation into yield. Molly claimed that these mechanisms represent a pivot handover of platform governance and revenue allocation rights, and they will redefine the user-platform relationship in the Web3 era. “It is just getting started,” she added. “More token utility and holder rewards are in the pipeline.” ● A comprehensive product upgrade for an improved experience In today’s market, a long-term vision and user-centric products are paramount. HTX is responding with a renewed focus on product innovation to create a more secure and intuitive trading experience. In H1 2025, HTX launched P2P Premium, the industry’s first P2P trading zone featuring high quality. With risk-factor detection, strict KYC enforcement, and 24/7 manual reviews, the platform guarantees zero payment anomalies and zero fund freezes, a new benchmark for P2P trading safety. In Q3, HTX brings a full app upgrade across 20+ products, including spot, margin, and futures trading. Users will enjoy enhanced UX, visual refreshes, and seamless order execution. A Fair, Transparent Path for Quality Asset Listings The live stream also addressed the community’s questions on token recommendation standards for listing. HTX’s listing framework is built around three pillars of strong community demand, a proven team and clear tokenomics, and the long-term commitment to community-building and value creation (e.g., $CFX). “Backed by robust liquidity and an active user base, HTX helps premium projects attract immediate market attention. With the global reach of our advisor Justin Sun, HTX listings often spark industry-wide momentum,” said Molly. To protect the integrity of the token recommendation, strict quality thresholds and anti-rigging safeguards are in place. Ultimately, Justin Sun plays an influential advisory role, offering strategic expertise and insights to support HTX’s leadership, ensuring fairness and preventing manipulation or bribery. HTX is taking the “bold yet cautious” approach to decentralization. During the DAO’s governance maturation phase, temporary centralized safeguards ensure system stability. HTX’s ultimate goal is to institutionalize a fully decentralized, user-governed exchange model with verifiable on-chain accountability.

The move coincided with dovish remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell at Jackson Hole, which strengthened expectations of September rate cuts and triggered rotation into risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Regulatory clarity following Ripple’s litigation outcome continues to support institutional flows, while analysts now point to ambitious $5–$8 targets should XRP break decisively above near-term resistance. Price Action Summary • XRP climbed 3% during the 24-hour period from August 23 at 15:00 to August 24 at 14:00, rising from $3.02 to $3.09 before consolidating back at $3.02. • The token traded in a $0.09 band, peaking at $3.09 on elevated 58.8 million volume—well above the 24-hour average of 33.2 million. • Support formed near $3.00 during the 11:00 candle on 46.6 million turnover, validating demand at the psychological level. • XRP ended the session near $3.02, suggesting renewed momentum while consolidating below resistance. Technical Analysis • Resistance remains firm at $3.08–$3.09, defined by high-volume rejection during the midnight rally. • Support solidified around $3.00 after multiple bounces with above-average participation. • Volume spikes confirm institutional flows, with $27 million worth of XRP reported transacted in one minute by fiatleak. • Chart structures resemble double-bottom and symmetrical triangle patterns, which analysts suggest could extend gains toward $3.30 and, if breached, open a path to $5–$8. What Traders Are Watching • Whether $3.00 holds as a durable floor during profit-taking phases. • A decisive breakout above $3.30 resistance as the trigger for higher-range targets. • Fed policy trajectory ahead of September—rate cut confirmation would likely sustain flows into risk assets. • Whale wallet accumulation and on-chain settlement volumes, which spiked 500% to 844 million earlier in the week. • Broader correlation with equities, as lower yields continue to push crossover inflows into digital assets.",Markets|AI Market Insights|XRP|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-25 05:24:50

China and Hong Kong markets led the region's gains, with local technology and artificial intelligence stocks performing particularly well. Silver prices held steady around $38.8 per ounce on Monday, hovering near their highest levels since 2011 amid bets on US Federal Reserve policy easing. Gold dipped to around $3,360 per ounce on Monday, following a more than 1% gain in the previous session. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.25% to above 42,900, while the broader Topix Index gained 0.5% to 3,116. The Japanese yen weakened to around 147.4 per dollar on Monday, giving back gains from the previous session, despite hawkish comments from Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda. Speaking at the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole conference on Saturday, Ueda said wages in Japan are expected to rise further amid a tightening labor market, signaling confidence that conditions for another interest rate hike are coming together. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.78% to above 3,860, while the Shenzhen Component climbed 1.8% to 12,384 on Monday, with the former hitting fresh ten-year highs as market momentum continued to strengthen, and the offshore yuan edged higher to around 7.16 per dollar on Monday, extending gains from the previous session to its highest level in four weeks. The People’s Bank of China injected a total of CNY 600 billion into financial institutions on August 25 through its one-year medium-term lending facility, aiming to maintain ample liquidity in the banking system. China has released draft regulations aimed at curbing unfair pricing practices on internet platforms, following widespread complaints from merchants and consumers. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 1.90% to 25,836 in Monday morning deals, extending gains for the second session and hitting their highest level in almost four years. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.11% to 81,459 in morning trade on Monday, erasing losses from the previous session. The Indian rupee weakened to around 87.43 per dollar on Monday, marking its third straight session of losses. Trade talks with Washington are ongoing, but India has drawn firm redlines, Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said Saturday, underscoring the need to protect farmers and small producers. His comments come days before additional U.S. tariffs of up to 50% on Indian goods take effect, among the steepest levies imposed by Washington, in response to New Delhi’s increased Russian oil imports. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.01% moving back above the record 9,000 milestones breached last week. The Australian dollar weakened to below $0.648 on Monday, pulling back from a 1.1% surge in the previous session. Australia’s government has unveiled a set of urgent measures to accelerate home construction amid a deepening national housing crisis, Bloomberg News said. In the U.S. on Friday, all three major indexes ended higher after Fed Chair Powell signaled the possibility of a September rate cut during his Jackson Hole speech, sparking the strongest cross-asset rally since April. Canada said Friday it will lift its 25% tariff on about half of the U.S. goods targeted since March, in a bid to reset trade ties with Washington. U.S. stock futures held steady on Monday as investors awaited a busy week of corporate earnings: Dow -0.08% ; S&P 500 -0.06% ; Nasdaq -0.05% .

This process has officially begun, and we haven't even occupied 0.01% of the total market yet.

He said Telegram complies with lawful requests while refusing to compromise on privacy, but warned that the year-long ordeal damaged France’s image as a free nation. Meanwhile, Coinbase secured a pause in a lawsuit over alleged violations of Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act. A judge agreed to wait for a related appellate ruling that could set precedent. The case accuses Coinbase of improperly collecting and sharing biometric data, which only adds to its legal troubles after a data breach earlier this year. Telegram Founder Blasts French Charges Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, spoke out once again about his ongoing legal case in France, and described the criminal investigation against him as “struggling” to find any evidence of wrongdoing. In a Telegram post on Sunday, Durov called his arrest by French authorities in August 2024 “unprecedented” and explained that holding a technology executive personally responsible for the actions of independent users was both “legally and logically absurd.” He also explained that Telegram’s moderation practices are consistent with industry standards and held firm that the company always complied with every legally binding request from French authorities. Telegram post from Pavel Durov Despite this, Durov revealed that one year later he is still required to return to France every 14 days, with no appeal date yet set. He warned that the French government’s handling of the case already caused “irreparable damage” to France’s image as a free country. His arrest last year triggered a wave of backlash from the crypto community, human rights organizations, and free speech advocates, many of whom accused the French government of trying to pressure Telegram into adopting stronger censorship policies. French prosecutors charged Durov in connection with Telegram’s content moderation policies, and alleged that the platform was being used to host harmful material. After his arrest, he was barred from leaving the country. French President Emmanuel Macron defended the move at the time, and rejected accusations that the arrest was politically motivated. He insisted that it was made within the framework of protecting citizens’ rights and freedoms. However, his comments only fueled further criticism online. Mert Mumtaz, CEO of node provider Helius, responded sharply to Macron by asking why the French leader was not being held personally accountable for failing to prevent all crime within France. Durov consistently maintained that Telegram respects the rule of law and complies with law enforcement requests, but he has also vowed that the platform will never compromise user privacy by handing over encryption keys or building backdoors into its systems. Instead, he said Telegram would rather exit a jurisdiction than give in to demands that violate its principles. Judge Pauses Coinbase Biometric Privacy Lawsuit In other legal news, a federal judge in Illinois granted Coinbase’s request to pause proceedings in a lawsuit about violations of the state’s Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The lawsuit was filed in May, and claimed that Coinbase collected users’ biometric data, including faceprints, as part of its Know Your Customer requirements without providing proper notice. Plaintiffs also alleged that the company shared this sensitive information with third-party verification providers without consent, which they said breached Illinois law. In a Thursday filing, Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman of the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division ruled in favor of Coinbase’s motion to stay the case while awaiting a decision from the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The appellate court is currently reviewing a case involving Nuance Communications and Charles Schwab’s use of voice identification technology. This ruling could directly impact the Coinbase matter. Judge Coleman said staying the case will help simplify issues, reduce litigation burdens, and would not cause undue prejudice against the plaintiffs. Coinbase ID verification process (Source: CourtListener ) Illinois’ BIPA sets strict rules for how private entities handle biometric data. Violations that are deemed negligent can result in penalties of $1,000 per occurrence, while reckless or intentional violations can carry fines of up to $5,000 per instance. The plaintiffs in the Coinbase lawsuit are also seeking to recover litigation costs. The legal challenge comes as Coinbase still faces scrutiny over its handling of user data. In May, the exchange disclosed a data breach involving customer support contractors in India who were bribed to access user accounts. The individuals behind the breach allegedly tried to extort $20 million worth of Bitcoin from Coinbase, though the company refused to comply.

Metaplanet aims to buy 210,000 BTC by 2027 under new capital-raising strategy. Eric Trump previously called himself a Bitcoin maximalist at the SALT conference. Eric Trump Joins Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Strategy: What to Expect in 2025 US President Donald Trump's son, Eric Trump, plans to attend a Metaplanet shareholder meeting on September 1, 2025, Bloomberg reports. The Japanese company, which follows a business model similar to Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), appointed Eric Trump as an adviser at the end of March 2025 to help promote Bitcoin. Metaplanet’s leadership is optimistic about the company’s mission to increase Bitcoin adoption, and Eric Trump's presence is seen as a strong indicator of their future strategy. According to Bloomberg, Trump will visit Tokyo after attending the Bitcoin Asia conference in Hong Kong on August 28-29. While Eric Trump has yet to comment on his upcoming trip, his participation is widely anticipated to play a key role in Metaplanet’s strategic direction. Metaplanet’s Capital-Raising Strategy The meeting on September 1 will see Metaplanet's shareholders voting on an expansion of its capital-raising plan, which involves purchasing 210,000 BTC by 2027. Eric Trump’s involvement is expected to provide both guidance and support for the company’s Bitcoin-focused vision, helping to convince stakeholders of the strategy’s effectiveness.

The exchange’s latest listings have posted standout performances, with $TREE (Treehouse) surging sixfold on its July 29 debut, drawing strong community buzz. On August 7, Jasper, Head of Assets at HTX, joined the third “Real Talk with HTX Executives” livestream to field questions from its community, X (formerly Twitter) users, and HTX DAO committee members. The session provided an in-depth look at the exchange’s asset-screening framework and the key indicators used to identify long-term bullish assets. Rigorous Screening to Capture Long-Term Winners To identify promising projects early, HTX has built a multi-layered evaluation system. Jasper explained that for projects already listed on other exchanges, HTX tracks their ongoing development before considering a listing. For pre-token projects, the review process incorporates on-chain metrics such as holdings allocation, on-chain activity, smart contract audits for vulnerabilities or backdoors, and the reasonableness of valuation, ensuring both potential and security. “HTX tracks potential issuers for up to a year in advance,” Jasper said. “Each goes through two to three deep-dive evaluations covering team background, investors, sector fundamentals, AML/KYC compliance, contract security, operational progress, traffic metrics, product overview, community traction, social sentiment, tokenomics, assets distribution, and the authenticity of on-chain data. We also rely on platforms like RootData, Glassnode, and CertiK to verify data integrity and contract safety.” To be truly promising, Jasper stated, an asset must address a fundamental demand of its sector. Protocols such as AAVE , UNI , LINK , and TRX , deeply embedded in DeFi and infrastructure, can truly serve industrial needs, generate stable cash flow, and have long-term viability. By contrast, projects built on inflated concepts, fabricated data, or manufactured hype are quickly flagged and eliminated. This disciplined approach ensures the exchange captures over 90% of its target opportunities. HTX is willing to pass on even the hottest trends, such as PUMP tokens, if valuation and market fundamentals don’t align. “This year alone, we’ve successfully sidestepped at least three high-profile projects that subsequently failed, underscoring the reliability of our framework,” Jasper noted. New Initiatives to Boost Transparency & Community Engagement To strengthen community engagement and improve investment transparency, HTX is experimenting with asset watchlists and trading pilot zones. Jasper explained that the HTX DAO’s crypto recommendations and voting essentially act as a watch list, enabling community members to nominate and evaluate potential listings. This serves as a valuable complement to the official vetting process. Additionally, HTX launched an Innovation Zone in the second quarter of this year, specifically designed for early-stage projects or meme coins with higher uncertainty and volatility. The main crypto zone remains dedicated to more mature and high-quality assets. The structure gives users a clearer way to balance risk appetite with opportunity. Jasper stressed that no exchange, not even market leaders like Binance or Upbit, can guarantee every listing will outperform. “The market is a zero-sum arena. Exchanges provide liquidity and charge reasonable fees for facilitation, but don’t dictate price action. Crypto performance depends on a complex mix of factors, including project ability, market-making strategies, tokenomics, sentiment, community traction, macro trends, and valuation. Investors must do their own homework, stay rational, and take responsibility for their own trades.” To learn more about HTX, please visit https://www.htx.com/ or HTX Square , and follow HTX on X , Telegram , and Discord .

Despite legislative efforts like the U.S. GENIUS Act, a leading voice in the banking sector, Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long, suggests that significant uncertainty still looms. Her recent remarks underscore the complex landscape financial institutions and fintechs face when dealing with stablecoins. What’s Stirring the Waters in Stablecoin Regulation? Caitlin Long, a respected figure in the digital asset space, recently shared her insights on CNBC, as reported by Wu Blockchain. She pointed out that the GENIUS Act, while a step forward, has not fully addressed several fundamental issues. These unresolved questions are crucial for the seamless integration of stablecoins into the traditional financial system. Specifically, Long highlighted the ongoing debate around whether traditional banks can issue tokenized deposits. Tokenized deposits are essentially digital representations of traditional bank deposits on a blockchain, offering potential for faster, more efficient transactions. However, the regulatory framework for these is still unclear. Moreover, the level of capital banks must hold when dealing with stablecoins remains ambiguous. This uncertainty creates hesitation and impacts how financial institutions approach these digital assets. Long also noted compliance shortfalls among crypto-focused fintech firms, indicating a need for clearer guidelines across the board. Unpacking the GENIUS Act: A Step Towards Stablecoin Regulation? Enacted in mid-July, the GENIUS Act was indeed designed to bring more structure to the stablecoin industry. Its provisions aim to enhance transparency and stability, which are vital for investor confidence. Here are some key requirements introduced by the Act: Federal Licensing: Stablecoin issuers must obtain federal licenses, ensuring they operate under specific legal frameworks. 1-to-1 Reserve Backing: Issuers are mandated to maintain full 1-to-1 reserve backing for their stablecoins, meaning each digital coin is fully collateralized by an equivalent amount of fiat currency or other liquid assets. Annual Audits: Issuers with a market capitalization exceeding $50 billion must undergo annual audits, adding a layer of scrutiny and accountability. Oversight for Foreign Entities: The Act includes compliance and oversight rules for foreign entities involved in stablecoin issuance, extending its reach beyond domestic players. While these measures are commendable for establishing a baseline for stablecoin regulation , Long’s perspective suggests they haven’t entirely resolved the underlying complexities. Persistent Hurdles in Effective Stablecoin Regulation Despite the GENIUS Act’s introduction, critical areas of uncertainty persist. Caitlin Long emphasized the need for regulators to clarify liability for interbank transfers of tokenized deposits. Currently, banks face restrictions on sharing customer information, which complicates these transfers. Enabling secure information sharing could significantly reduce compliance costs, especially for regional lenders. This is a crucial point because lower compliance burdens can foster greater adoption and innovation. The lack of clear guidance on these operational aspects continues to be a major hurdle for effective stablecoin regulation and broader acceptance. Without definitive answers on issues like capital requirements and interbank liability, financial institutions find it challenging to fully embrace stablecoins. This hesitation, in turn, slows down the potential for growth and innovation within the digital asset ecosystem. Why Clear Stablecoin Regulation is Crucial for Growth Achieving comprehensive and clear stablecoin regulation is not just about compliance; it’s about unlocking immense potential. When regulations are unambiguous, it: Reduces Costs: Banks and fintechs can operate with greater certainty, lowering legal and operational expenses. Boosts Innovation: Clear rules provide a stable environment for developing new products and services around stablecoins. Enhances Trust: Robust regulation protects consumers and fosters confidence in digital assets, encouraging wider adoption. Promotes Stability: A well-regulated market is less prone to volatility and systemic risks, benefiting the entire financial system. Ultimately, addressing these lingering questions will pave the way for stablecoins to fulfill their promise as a stable, efficient, and integral part of the future financial landscape. In conclusion, while the GENIUS Act represents a significant step in establishing a framework for stablecoin regulation , the insights from industry leaders like Custodia Bank’s Caitlin Long highlight that the journey towards comprehensive clarity is far from over. Addressing the nuanced challenges of tokenized deposits, capital requirements, and interbank liability will be crucial for the stablecoin industry to truly flourish and integrate seamlessly into the global financial system. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the GENIUS Act? A1: The GENIUS Act, enacted in mid-July, is a U.S. law requiring stablecoin issuers to obtain federal licenses, maintain full 1-to-1 reserve backing, undergo annual audits for larger issuers, and comply with oversight rules for foreign entities. Q2: Who is Caitlin Long and what is Custodia Bank? A2: Caitlin Long is the CEO of Custodia Bank, a Wyoming-based special purpose depository institution (SPDI) focused on serving the digital asset industry. She is a prominent advocate for clear cryptocurrency regulation. Q3: What are tokenized deposits? A3: Tokenized deposits are digital representations of traditional bank deposits recorded on a blockchain. They aim to combine the stability of bank deposits with the efficiency and programmability of blockchain technology. Q4: Why is regulatory clarity for stablecoins important? A4: Clear stablecoin regulation is crucial because it reduces compliance costs, encourages institutional adoption, fosters innovation, enhances market stability, and protects consumers, ultimately enabling the industry’s growth. Q5: What are the main unresolved issues concerning stablecoin regulation, according to Caitlin Long? A5: According to Caitlin Long, key unresolved issues include whether banks can issue tokenized deposits, the specific capital requirements for holding stablecoins, compliance shortfalls among crypto fintechs, and clarifying liability for interbank transfers of tokenized deposits.

50638665,564183,1756101638,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50638665.jpeg,Crypto News: Expectations For September Rate Cuts Drop Despite Powell’s Speech,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-news-rate-cuts-powell/,"Last week, Federal Reverse Chairman Jerome Powell set the crypto community on fire after speaking at the annual Jackson Hold economic symposium . During his speech, Powell had hinted toward possible rate cuts that could happen in the month of September, and since rate cuts have been historically bullish for risk assets, this quickly triggered a rapid bullish response from the community. However, expectations for a rate cut seem to have dwindled in the last few weeks, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool. Probability Of Rate Cuts Drops From 92% To 75% Earlier in the month of August, Bitcoinist had reported that the CME Group’s FedWatch tool was showing a high 92% probability of rate cuts happening in the month of September. This had come after there were no rate cuts in July, turning all eyes on the next September 17 date, with only a 7.8% probability that the Fed will keep rates the same and 0% probability of a rate increase. However, as the month of September draws closer, the probability of a rate cut looks to be on the decline. According to the FedWatch website , there is now a 75% probability that the Federal Reserve will institute rate cuts on September 17. This marks a major difference in the numbers from earlier in the month, suggesting that market developments have triggered a much more conservative outlook. The drop in the expectation of a rate cut has now moved into the more conservative territory of rates being kept the same. The tool shows that there is now a 25% probability that the Fed will choose to maintain rates as it did back in July. Interestingly, the probability of an interest rate hike in the month of September is still at 0%, showing no chance of this happening. Why Rise In Optimism Could Affect Crypto Despite the drop in the probability, optimism around a possible Fed rate cut is still high, as shown by data from Santiment. A report from the platform pointed out that social mentions of words like “fed”, “rate”, and “cut” have all hit a new all-time high. The report translates this as euphoria being very high, and for the crypto market, this could mean that it is headed for a top. Another thing that points toward a possible crypto top is the fact that Bitcoin balances on exchanges are on the rise once more. Usually, when investors send cryptocurrencies to exchanges, it means they are looking to sell, and such profit-taking could signal a top . As such, investors could benefit from taking a cautious stance as the market decides on a direction ahead of the FOMC meeting in September.",Crypto News|crypto|crypto community|Crypto Market|crypto news|Cryptocurrency|Cryptocurrency new|Fed Chairman|Federal Reserve|Federal Reserve news|Jerome Power,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-25 06:00:38

Big names like Cardano, Avalanche, Polygon are making headlines. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming more and more a name to watch for one of the best presales of 2023. According to analysts, it is becoming a prime target for whales and investors. Cardano (ADA): ETF Rumors Ignite New Momentum Cardano is exchanging hands for roughly $0.86. Not much price action has been seen, however, optimism is rising. Investors are talking about ETFs and smart contract upgrades. Analysts say ADA will stay in the $0.85–$0.87 range until August; however, a rise towards $1.10 or above may happen if momentum returns. As one of the top altcoins, ADA’s 2025 projections see a price as high as $2–$5.33 in bullish models. Avalanche (AVAX): Ecosystem Expansion and Enterprise Partnerships Avalanche strengthens its grip on the blockchain sector climbs up fast with huge adoption in DeFi, Gamefi, NFT AVAX has dropped slightly to near $39 and shows signs of recovery. The adoption of USDC and USDT, as well as tokenized hedge funds, allows institutional optimism. According to analysts, if AVAX manages to break out above the $41 mark, it may increase to the $47 level in the short term. Meanwhile, in the long run, AVAX price predictions are between $60 and $70. The “Everest” upgrade which was launched mid-august is aimed at making the networks even more scalable and fast. Polygon (MATIC): zkEVM and Real-World Partnerships Polygon is a key player in the scaling of Ethereum, and MATIC’s fundamentals are strong. Currently, it trades for about $0.97. It might retest the $1 soon. The bullish targets are $1.15–$1.22 if things heat up. Polygon’s zkEVM is increasingly being adopted as it recently partnered with JPMorgan and Disney, establishing its real-world utility. As the demand for Ethereum grows, Polygon can attract more users that want to use cross-border dApps, payments and identity devices for their long-term adoption. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Stealing the Spotlight Cardano, Avalanche, and Polygon are strong presale contenders, but analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE is stealing the spotlight. With forecasts of 30x upside and accelerating whale-backed inflows, it’s being called one of the best crypto presales of 2025. The project has already drawn thousands of investors, surpassing key milestones and proving its ability to capture attention in a crowded market. Early buyers using PATRIOT50X unlock a 50% EXTRA presale bonus, but spots are disappearing fast as allocations run out. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out further are its verified audits, capped supply, and the heavy speculation surrounding future Tier-1 exchange listings, positioning it as a once-in-cycle opportunity. Conclusion: A Market Where Presales Dominate the Buzz The 2025 market highlights that investors are not just focusing established giants like Cardano, Avalanche and Polygon but on presales showing serious upside that could go on to be the real breakout stars. The fundamentals of ADA, AVAX and MATIC are solid. But analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE has the momentum in its presale to achieve possibly better ROI than either ADA, AVAX or MATIC. For those who intend to get in early ahead of the next leg of the bull cycle, mixing blue-chip altcoins with high-growth presales should strike a good balance between safety and upside.

The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) set the fix at 7.1161 per dollar, down from 7.1321 on Friday, the firmest level since November. According to Bloomberg , the dollar weakened after Powell left the door open for rate cuts, saying the labor market is showing signs of strain even though inflation still hasn’t cooled completely. The Dollar Spot Index fell 0.8% following his remarks. The onshore yuan gained slightly, trading at 7.1605 per dollar, after hitting 7.1593, its highest level since late July. But while the reference rate got stronger, the yuan lost ground against a broader set of currencies. Bloomberg’s gauge tracking China’s currency versus major peers showed a decline early in the session, even with Monday’s firmer fix. The fixing dropped below 7.12 for the first time since last November, a sign officials may be responding more aggressively to the greenback’s retreat and trying to keep the yuan stable amid renewed global pressure. Beijing pumps liquidity into market to calm bond stress The PBOC also moved aggressively to pump cash into the system this month. Beijing added 600 billion yuan ($84 billion) through a mix of one-year Medium-Term Lending Facility loans and three- and six-month outright reverse repos. Bloomberg’s tally showed this was the largest monthly liquidity injection since January. The injection came as yields surged in the latest 30-year government bond auction, with investors demanding the highest payouts since December. As the central bank added cash, China’s overnight repo rate fell to 1.35%, dropping seven basis points. Futures tied to 30-year government bonds also jumped as much as 0.7%, their strongest one-day rise since April. The goal is to maintain easy funding conditions while borrowing demand stays high, and at the same time, avoid a fire sale in bond funds as more retail money flows into equities. PBOC has leaned hard into its two main tools, the MLF and reverse repos, after earlier policy tweaks this year gave them more flexibility. Officials are trying to balance that fresh money push with the risk of outflows from banks, as individual investors chase hot stocks and abandon savings accounts. Chip stock ETFs overheat as investors rush in Over in equities, Chinese tech funds saw massive demand. Premiums on chip-related ETFs soared last week, signaling intense buying activity. The CPIC SSE STAR Chip Design Thematic ETF surged to a 6.2% premium on Friday, well above its historical average of just 0.1%. Two other major chip funds, the Penghua SSE STAR Chip ETF and the China Universal SSE Science and Tech Innovation Board 50 ETF, also traded at higher-than-usual premiums. These premiums show that people were buying these ETFs well above their net asset value, often a sign of speculative fever. The surge followed news that DeepSeek’s new AI model had launched, boosting investor confidence in the semiconductor industry. There’s also renewed belief that Beijing’s tech self-reliance push will favor domestic chipmakers. That optimism fueled a massive run-up in tech indexes. The Star 50 Index, which focuses on hardware stocks, jumped 5.8% on Monday, bringing its total monthly gain to around 20%. The CSI 300 Index added over 1%, building on last week’s 4.2% climb. But the gap between prices and fundamentals is widening fast, with some market watchers warning about overheating sectors. Housing stocks rallied too, riding on hopes of more support from Beijing. China Vanke Co. rose to a six-month high, leading a 3% gain in a property sector index, the biggest one-day move in over a month. Shares of Sunac China Holdings Ltd. and Longfor Group Holdings Ltd. also jumped sharply. In Hong Kong trading, Vanke gained as much as 16%, and Sunac soared up to 13%.

Understanding the dynamics of BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios offers a crucial window into the market’s pulse. These ratios reveal whether more traders are betting on a price increase (long) or a price decrease (short) over a 24-hour period, providing invaluable insights for navigating the volatile crypto landscape. What Do BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios Reveal? The long-short ratio is a fundamental metric in cryptocurrency derivatives trading. It represents the proportion of long positions versus short positions on a particular asset, in this case, BTC perpetual futures . When the ratio favors longs, it suggests bullish sentiment, with traders expecting prices to rise. Conversely, a higher percentage of short positions indicates bearish sentiment, anticipating a price drop. Monitoring this metric helps traders gauge the prevailing mood and potential future price movements. This 24-hour snapshot provides a clear picture of how traders are positioning themselves. Across various cryptocurrency exchanges, the overall sentiment has shown a slight lean towards short positions. Let’s break down the recent data. Recent 24-Hour BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios: Total Market: Long 47.3%, Short 52.7% This overall figure suggests that, in the aggregate, more traders are currently anticipating a downward price movement for Bitcoin in the immediate future. Decoding Exchange-Specific BTC Perpetual Futures Sentiment While the total market ratio gives a broad overview, examining individual exchanges can reveal nuances. Different platforms often cater to varying trader demographics or have unique liquidity pools, leading to slight variations in sentiment. Here’s how the top three exchanges stacked up: Binance: Long 46.85%, Short 53.15% Bybit: Long 45.78%, Short 54.22% Gate.io: Long 47.24%, Short 52.76% Notice a consistent trend? All three major exchanges show a stronger lean towards short positions. Bybit, in particular, exhibits the most pronounced bearish sentiment among these, with over 54% of its traders holding short positions on BTC perpetual futures . This consistent bearish bias across prominent platforms underscores a cautious, if not outright pessimistic, outlook among a significant portion of the derivatives market participants. Why Are These Ratios Crucial for Your Trading Strategy? Understanding these long-short ratios goes beyond mere curiosity; it’s an essential tool for informed decision-making. These metrics can act as a contrarian indicator or confirm existing trends. For instance, an extremely high long ratio might signal an over-leveraged market, potentially leading to a “long squeeze” if prices drop unexpectedly. Similarly, an overwhelming short ratio could precede a “short squeeze” if an unexpected positive catalyst drives prices up, forcing short sellers to cover their positions. Savvy traders often use these ratios in conjunction with other technical analysis tools to identify potential entry and exit points. A sustained shift in the long-short balance can indicate a significant change in market dynamics. Therefore, keeping an eye on the BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios is not just about knowing what’s happening now, but anticipating what might happen next. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Market How can you leverage this information about BTC perpetual futures ? Firstly, consider it as a sentiment gauge. If the market is heavily skewed one way, be prepared for potential volatility in the opposite direction. Secondly, use it to confirm your own analysis. If your technical indicators suggest a bearish outlook and the long-short ratios align, it strengthens your conviction. However, always remember that no single indicator provides a complete picture. Market manipulation, sudden news events, or large institutional moves can quickly override prevailing sentiment. Therefore, combine these insights with comprehensive research, risk management strategies, and a clear understanding of your own risk tolerance. The goal is to make educated guesses, not certain predictions. In conclusion, the current dominance of short positions in BTC perpetual futures suggests a prevailing bearish sentiment across major exchanges. This valuable insight offers a glimpse into the collective mindset of derivatives traders, helping you to better understand the immediate market landscape. Staying informed about these crucial metrics can empower you to make more strategic and confident trading decisions in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a long-short ratio in crypto trading? A long-short ratio indicates the proportion of traders holding long positions (betting on price increase) versus short positions (betting on price decrease) for a specific cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin, on derivatives exchanges. 2. How is the 24-hour long-short ratio for BTC perpetual futures calculated? It’s calculated by aggregating the total value or number of open long positions and comparing it to the total value or number of open short positions for BTC perpetual futures contracts over a 24-hour period across various exchanges. 3. Does a high short ratio always mean Bitcoin’s price will fall? Not necessarily. While a high short ratio indicates prevailing bearish sentiment, it can sometimes act as a contrarian indicator. An overly skewed short position could lead to a “short squeeze” if prices unexpectedly rise, forcing short sellers to buy back, which further fuels the price increase. 4. Which exchanges were covered in the recent BTC perpetual futures long-short ratio data? The recent data highlighted long-short ratios from prominent exchanges including Binance, Bybit, and Gate.io, in addition to an overall market aggregate. 5. How can traders use long-short ratios in their strategy? Traders use these ratios as a sentiment gauge to confirm their analysis, identify potential market reversals (e.g., a heavily skewed ratio might precede a squeeze), and understand the collective market psychology when trading BTC perpetual futures . 6. Are long-short ratios the only indicator I should follow? No, long-short ratios are a valuable tool but should always be combined with other technical analysis, fundamental research, and robust risk management strategies for a comprehensive trading approach.

In his post on the X platform, Krueger argued that the value of ETH is disproportionate to its actual usage potential, even considering the most optimistic scenario. “Let's assume all Visa and Mastercard transactions switched to stablecoins on Ethereum. 393 billion payments per year x average $0.03 rollup fee = $11.8 billion in fees. The direct share of ETH (burn) would be approximately $1.8 billion, while layer 2 sequencers would earn approximately $10 billion,” Krueger said. According to the analyst, the current ETH market cap of approximately $575 billion equates to a 320x fee ratio compared to these revenue figures. Krueger noted that this multiple is excessive compared to tech giants: Apple: ~30x profit Google: ~25× earnings Ethereum: 320× fee Related News: JUST IN: Ethereum (ETH) Reaches Over $4,900 for the First Time in Its History - Here Are the Details Referring to ETH bull analyst Tom Lee, who has become increasingly popular on the cryptocurrency market agenda recently, Krueger said: “Even in a fantasy world where every Visa and Mastercard transaction was processed on Ethereum, ETH would still be overvalued. Tom Lee would get richer, and you would get poorer.” *This is not investment advice.

A single BTC whale sold 24,000 Bitcoin on Sunday, worth $2.7 billion, catalyzing a $4,000 crash in minutes. However, they still hold 152,874 BTC, valued at more than $17 billion.

They still hold 152,874 BTC worth more than $17 BILLION. h/t @SaniExp pic.twitter.com/m4aM9JwlAO — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) August 24, 2025 According to Sani , a Bitcoin on-chain analyst and founder of the Timechain Index, the entity liquidated their entire 24k BTC balance, sending it to Hyperunite. The coins had remained untouched for 5+ years. On Sunday alone, a staggering 12,000 BTC was sent to the Hyperunite trading platform and the whale is “still actively selling,” Sani wrote on X. BTC Slips Below $112.7K Amid Continued Whale Sell-Offs According to prominent Bitcoiner Willy Woo, the reason BTC has been slow to rise in this cycle is because the supply of BTC is centred around the large whales that peaked their holdings in 2011. “They bought their BTC at $10 or lower. It takes $110k+ of new capital to absorb each BTC they sell.” Why is BTC moving up so slowly this cycle? BTC supply is concentrated around OG whales who peaked their holdings in 2011 (orange and dark orange). They bought their BTC at $10 or lower. It takes $110k+ of new capital to absorb each BTC they sell. pic.twitter.com/7CbWXsvX2l — Willy Woo (@woonomic) August 24, 2025 This means that the difference in value, supply, and pace of sales has a significant impact on the amount of new capital needed to drive the price up. Further, Bitcoin OGs have been swapping BTC for ETH. Crypto analyst MLM pointed out that a whale sold 18.142K BTC worth $2.04 billion, with most of it rotated into Ethereum. “So far, the 2 entities have bought 416.598K ETH combined ($1.98 billion),” MLM wrote on X . “Out of the 416.598K ETH, 275.5K ETH ($1.3 billion) has been staked.” Meanwhile, on Thursday, another whale sold 670 Bitcoin worth $76 million to open a long position in ETH. “Once the whale started selling, it triggered a panic cascade, with other traders selling too, amplifying the crash,” WhaleWire CEO Jacob King said on X . “Most of the money is being moved into Ethereum, $2B bought and $1.3B staked.” Bitcoin Flash Crash – Is There a Chance for BTC to Revive? Bitcoin dropped 2.12% to $112,692 as of 12:26 a.m. ET on Sunday. The largest crypto fell to a low of around $110,500 per CoinMarketCap data . The RSI-7 at 40.72 suggests oversold conditions but no reversal signals yet. However, industry watchers say that the momentum is short-lived and is not a bearish sign. For instance, Aike Capital founder and crypto trader Alex Krüger wrote on X that BTC should be much easier to go up “once short-term momentum clears and price moves above $113,500 – $114,000.” Another crypto expert, Vijay Boyapati, said that the cycle is “one of the greatest monetization events in history.” No paper BTC conspiracies are required.

According to the company’s report, Realized Value Impulse (Long-Term) and Market Temperature indicators point to intense speculative strengthening in Ethereum: Realized Value Impulse (Long-Term) reveals an expansion in long-term realized market value. This is fueled by strong capital inflows and supply-demand dynamics, paving the way for significant price movements. The Market Temperature indicator, on the other hand, indicates that the market is “heating up.” More active investors, rising market sentiment, and increased volatility risk are opening the door to sharp price fluctuations in the short term. Related News: JUST IN: Ethereum (ETH) Reaches Over $4,900 for the First Time in Its History - Here Are the Details Alphractal pointed out that these indicators have reached a “boiling point” in Ethereum, arguing that strong movements could occur both upwards and downwards, and that investors should be extra cautious. On the Bitcoin side, however, the picture is different. The 30-Day Active Supply indicator measures the amount of unique BTC that has moved at least once in the past month and is currently signaling a clear “cooling” in the market. Alphactal explained that when this indicator rises, it reflects new capital inflows and intense investor activity, while when it falls, it reflects a calmer market environment. The current decline suggests that Bitcoin's supply movements are slowing and the market is preparing for the next big move. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin: Powell brings bearish lower high Bitcoin (BTC) has retraced to levels last seen before Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s dovish remarks on Friday, which set expectations for a potential rate cut in September. At the time of writing, BTC is trading just above $112,000, having peaked at around $117,440 on Friday. Technical scrutiny of the daily chart reveals that the pullback from the $117,000 peak has established a lower high in close proximity to the resistance line defined by the previous bullish trendline originating from the April lows. This lower high reinforces the prior trendline breakdown, signaling a continuation of bearish price action. Complementing this observation, the Guppy Multiple Moving Average (GMMA) indicator is poised to confirm a bearish momentum shift, highlighted by the imminent crossover of the short-term exponential moving averages (white band) below the longer-term averages (red band). On the weekly chart, the MACD histogram has initiated the new trading week with a sub-zero reading, highlighting the potential acceleration of downward momentum. In summary, what do you say about a market that not only resists a sustainable rally on the back of favorable news – such as Powell’s speech – but also maintains a series of bearish technical patterns? I'll leave it to the readers' discretion. Key technical support lies at the $110,756 level, corresponding to the lower boundary of the Ichimoku cloud, with a more substantial support zone marked by the 200-day simple moving average near $100,000. Conversely, reclaiming Friday's high of $117,440 is essential to resurrect the bullish case. Support: $110,756, $100,887, $100,000. Resistance: $117,440, $120,000, $122,056. Ether: Loss of upward momentum Ether (ETH) printed a doji candle with a prominent upper wick on Sunday, signaling market indecision at record highs. This candlestick pattern forms when the opening and closing prices converge, reflecting a stalemate between buyers and sellers. However, the relatively long upper shadow, in this case, means that the bull's attempts to push prices higher faced significant pushback from bears, who managed to pull the price back down before the close. While the doji itself does not guarantee a reversal, it highlights uncertainty and a possible loss of upward momentum. It warrants caution as it often precedes a potential reversal or a consolidation phase where the market awaits further catalysts for direction. A pullback appears likely, as the 14-day relative strength index continued to print lower highs over the weekend, contradicting the new price high. The so-called bearish divergence indicates a loss of upward momentum and often yields corrections. Interestingly, ether traded 3% lower on the day at $4,624 at press time, with charts indicating support at $4,065, the level from which ETH turned higher on August 20. Support: $4,065, $4,000, $3,805 (the 50-day SMA). Resistance: $5,000, record highs.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC recently dipped below the crucial $112,000 mark, trading specifically at $111,942.95 on the Binance USDT market. This significant movement has certainly captured the attention of investors and analysts alike. What’s Behind the Recent Bitcoin Price Drop? A sudden Bitcoin price drop often triggers questions about its underlying causes. While the exact catalysts can be complex, several factors typically contribute to such market movements. Investors often react to macroeconomic indicators, regulatory news, or shifts in market sentiment. For instance, broader economic concerns, like inflation or interest rate hikes, can lead investors to de-risk. This means moving away from volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Moreover, large sell-offs by institutional holders or whales can exert significant downward pressure on the market. How Does This BTC Price Fall Impact Traders? The current BTC price fall below $112,000 presents both challenges and, for some, potential opportunities. Traders who entered the market at higher price points might experience temporary losses. However, seasoned investors often view such dips as chances to accumulate more Bitcoin at a lower cost. For short-term traders: Increased volatility means higher risk but also potential for quick gains or losses. For long-term holders: A price correction can be a normal part of Bitcoin’s growth cycle, offering a chance to “buy the dip.” Market sentiment: A sharp fall can trigger fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) among newer participants. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights for Your Portfolio When facing a significant Bitcoin price drop , having a clear strategy is crucial. Panic selling is rarely the best approach. Instead, consider these actionable insights to manage your crypto portfolio effectively. First, always conduct your own research. Understand the fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin. Second, implement a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy. This involves investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of the price. This approach can help mitigate the impact of market volatility over time. Key strategies include: Risk management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversification: Spread your investments across different assets, not just Bitcoin. Stay informed: Follow reliable news sources and market analysis to make informed decisions. What’s Next for the Bitcoin Market? The future trajectory after a notable Bitcoin price drop is always a topic of intense speculation. Historically, Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience, recovering from numerous corrections to reach new all-time highs. However, past performance does not guarantee future results. Analysts will closely watch key support and resistance levels. A sustained bounce back could signal renewed bullish sentiment. Conversely, further dips might indicate a longer consolidation period. The overall health of the global economy and evolving regulatory landscapes will also play significant roles in shaping Bitcoin’s path forward. Conclusion: The recent Bitcoin price drop below $112,000 is a significant event in the cryptocurrency market, highlighting its inherent volatility. While such movements can be unsettling, they are a normal part of Bitcoin’s journey. By understanding the potential causes, managing risks, and staying informed, investors can navigate these fluctuations more confidently. Remember, a well-thought-out strategy is your best asset in the dynamic world of digital currencies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What caused the recent Bitcoin price drop below $112,000? A1: The exact cause is multifaceted, often influenced by macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, large sell-offs by whales, and shifts in overall market sentiment. Q2: Is a Bitcoin price drop a bad sign for the future of cryptocurrency? A2: Not necessarily. Bitcoin has historically experienced significant corrections before recovering and reaching new highs. Many see these dips as part of a natural market cycle and potential buying opportunities. Q3: How can I protect my investments during a BTC price fall? A3: Strategies like dollar-cost averaging (DCA), diversifying your portfolio, setting stop-loss orders, and only investing what you can afford to lose are crucial for managing risk during volatile periods. Q4: Should I buy Bitcoin when its price falls? A4: Buying during a dip can be a strategy for long-term investors, but it carries risks. Always conduct thorough research and consider your personal financial situation and risk tolerance before making investment decisions. Q5: What is the significance of the $112,000 level for Bitcoin? A5: Key price levels like $112,000 often act as psychological support or resistance points for traders. A break below such a level can signal further downward momentum or trigger stop-loss orders.

He argues that current prediction markets are fundamentally flawed when it comes to effective hedging, primarily because most platforms don’t offer interest payouts. This isn’t just a minor oversight; it’s a crucial missing piece that impacts their utility and broader adoption, according to Buterin’s recent Farcaster post, as The Block reported . What’s Missing from Today’s Prediction Markets? Imagine you have money, and you want to use it to bet on future events, perhaps to offset potential losses elsewhere – this is hedging. However, when you put your funds into most leading prediction markets , that money simply sits there. Buterin points out a key issue: users forgo a secure 4% annual yield, which is readily available on dollar-based assets. This “opportunity cost” means that by participating in a prediction market, you’re essentially losing out on potential earnings you could get elsewhere. It’s like choosing to keep your money under a mattress instead of in a savings account that pays interest. Opportunity Cost: Users lose out on potential passive income. Reduced Incentive: Less attractive for long-term hedging strategies. Inefficient Capital: Funds are not actively earning, making the platform less appealing. Why are Interest Payouts Crucial for Effective Hedging in Prediction Markets? Hedging is all about managing risk. If you’re using a prediction market to hedge against a future event, you want your capital to be as efficient as possible. Without interest payouts, the act of hedging becomes less appealing. For instance, if you’re betting against a certain outcome to protect another investment, your capital is tied up without earning anything. This makes the overall strategy less profitable and less compelling compared to traditional financial instruments that often provide some form of yield. Buterin believes that resolving this issue would unlock a wave of broader hedging scenarios, leading to significantly greater trading volumes across these platforms. Are Current Prediction Markets Falling Short? The Polymarket Example Buterin’s observations aren’t just theoretical; they align with recent market trends. For example, Polymarket, one of the leading platforms, saw its July volume decline to $1.06 billion from $1.16 billion in June. While this isn’t solely attributable to the lack of interest payouts, it highlights a potential struggle in sustaining engagement and growth. If users perceive a better return on their capital elsewhere, they will naturally gravitate towards those options. The current design of many prediction markets inadvertently creates a barrier for serious hedgers and long-term participants. Unlocking Revolutionary Potential: What If Prediction Markets Evolved? Imagine a future where prediction markets integrate interest-earning mechanisms. This transformative change could revolutionize how people approach risk management and speculation. Users could participate in markets, hedge their positions, and still earn a yield on their staked capital. This dual benefit would dramatically increase the attractiveness of these platforms, drawing in a wider audience and fostering more sophisticated trading strategies. The potential for increased trading volumes and more robust market participation is immense, moving prediction markets closer to becoming a truly powerful financial tool. In essence, Vitalik Buterin’s critique offers a vital roadmap for the evolution of prediction markets . By addressing the fundamental economic incentive of interest payouts, these platforms can transcend their current limitations and unlock a future where they serve as truly effective and appealing tools for risk management and speculation. This isn’t just about adding a feature; it’s about fundamentally rethinking their design to align with user expectations and financial realities, ultimately driving their growth and utility in the decentralized finance ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main issue Vitalik Buterin raised about prediction markets? A1: Vitalik Buterin argued that most leading prediction markets are poorly designed for hedging because they fail to offer interest payouts on users’ staked capital, leading to an opportunity cost. Q2: Why is the lack of interest payouts a problem for hedging? A2: When users participate in prediction markets , they forgo a secure annual yield (e.g., 4% on dollar-based assets). This makes hedging less appealing as their capital is tied up without earning any passive income, making the strategy less efficient. Q3: How would interest payouts benefit prediction markets? A3: Integrating interest payouts would make prediction markets more attractive for hedging and speculation. It would reduce the opportunity cost for users, likely driving greater trading volumes, fostering broader hedging scenarios, and increasing overall platform engagement. Q4: Did Buterin’s remarks coincide with any market trends? A4: Yes, his remarks coincided with Polymarket’s July volume declining to $1.06 billion from $1.16 billion in June, suggesting that current market designs might be struggling to retain user capital and engagement. Q5: What is “opportunity cost” in this context? A5: Opportunity cost refers to the potential benefit that a person misses out on when choosing one alternative over another. In this case, it’s the 4% annual yield users could earn on dollar-based assets but forgo by putting their money into a prediction market without interest. Q6: What does “hedging” mean in the context of prediction markets? A6: Hedging means making an investment to reduce the risk of adverse price movements in an asset. In prediction markets, it would involve taking a position to offset potential losses from another investment or future event. Share this insightful analysis!

Here’s the Scoop,https://cryptopotato.com/dogecoin-dips-before-major-breakout-heres-the-scoop/,"TL;DR Dogecoin forms a triangle pattern, with analysts closely watching the $0.25 resistance and $0.22 support levels. The price compresses near a breakout zone, signaling a potential move toward $0.31 or a drop to $0.19. Mixed market sentiment and rising crypto developments add fuel to Dogecoin’s tightening price action. Price Action and Key Levels Dogecoin (DOGE) was trading below $0.23 at press time, with a 24-hour decline of 4%, while it has remained flat on the weekly chart. Meanwhile, trading volume reached over $3 billion during the same period. The recent price movement comes as DOGE forms a symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart, a structure commonly linked to periods of tightening price action. Analyst Ali Martinez shared a chart showing the price nearing the lower boundary of this pattern. He commented that there may be “one last dip before the breakout .” Support is marked at $0.22, while resistance sits near $0.24. A move beyond this zone could lead to $0.26, $0.28, and $0.31, based on common retracement extensions. Dogecoin $DOGE : One last dip before the breakout! pic.twitter.com/DQh70ilOas — Ali (@ali_charts) August 25, 2025 Technical Outlook From Analysts Martinez believes DOGE could rally toward $0.3 if the current setup plays out. The price action is compressing near the triangle’s apex, often a signal of an incoming move. If the asset closes below $0.22, however, the setup may break down, bringing $0.209 and $0.19 into focus. Another analyst, Trader Tardigrade, examined the daily chart through the lens of Elliott Wave Theory. They noted that Dogecoin appears to be in a five-part correction pattern, commonly labeled A through E. According to their interpretation, “a motive wave in uptrend will follow this correction pattern.” This aligns with previous market cycles where such corrections are followed by trend continuation. The pattern remains intact and is approaching its end phase. Traders are watching for confirmation on direction as the price narrows within the structure. Source: X $0.25 Resistance and Market Setup Umair, a chart analyst on X, pointed to the $0.25 resistance level as a key zone. He noted that “recovering this will lead to 31c,” but added that failure could push DOGE back to $0.21 or $0.1949. The level has held as resistance multiple times in recent months. $Doge Doge at resistance almost, where it got significant rejections from previously. recovering this will lead to 31c, and if not then simply retraces back to 21c support.

The asset is currently squeezed between a rising support trendline and horizontal resistance. Volume remains average, with no confirmation of a breakout yet. A move above $0.25, accompanied by rising volume, may validate the pattern. Broader Market Context and Sentiment MarketProphit shared that sentiment around DOGE is currently mixed. While general trader sentiment shows optimism, the platform’s proprietary model remains cautious. This split in outlook reflects current uncertainty in the market. Several industry developments could be contributing to increased attention. The Federal Reserve has softened its stance on crypto banking regulations. Elsewhere, Thumzup acquired Dogehash in a $50 million deal. The company stated this move creates the largest Dogecoin mining operation to date. The post Dogecoin Dips Before Major Breakout?

But a couple of economic reports could crash that fantasy into a wall. Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell gave the greenlight for a possible rate cut. But he also warned that it all hinges on whether jobs and inflation numbers behave. Powell said the current high borrowing costs are now pushing too hard on the labor market. And that, he claimed, could justify cutting rates as early as mid-September. That was all traders needed to hear. US stocks popped. Bond yields plunged. Futures traders immediately priced in a 75% chance that the Fed trims its main rate by a quarter point in its next meeting. The current federal funds rate sits between 4.25% and 4.5%, but the market’s already guessing more cuts will follow deep into 2025. Traders brace for CPI and jobs data to decide September cut But that bet could die quick. Powell hinted, not promised. And several people inside and around the Fed aren’t convinced. The Fed is stuck between its two legal responsibilities, keeping employment strong and prices stable. Powell admitted it’s not looking good on either side. July’s jobs report showed hiring slowing way down. That data came in after the Fed’s last meeting. It spooked officials, but the 4.2% unemployment rate helped ease some of the tension. The problem is, if that starts rising, the story changes. Meanwhile, the inflation side of things is tangled in Trump’s economic moves. His new tariffs on foreign goods have triggered a heated debate inside the Fed. Some believe the price surge will pass. Others think it could stick. Businesses say the worst impact will hit after they run out of pre-tariff inventory. Consumer prices in July ran at a 2.7% annual rate. Not ideal, but not totally off the rails. The Fed’s preferred metric, the personal consumption expenditures price index, showed a 2.6% increase in June, above the 2% target. Powell tried to calm that with one line: “We will not allow a one-time increase in the price level to become an ongoing inflation problem.” That’s the tightrope the Fed is walking. Two reports dropping in September, the August jobs report on the 5th and the CPI on the 11th, will be make-or-break. Michael Gapen at Morgan Stanley said Powell’s tone was soft, but not soft enough to guarantee a cut. “It does not definitively say the Fed will cut in September, but it comes about as close as it can given the data between now and then,” he said . Fed split deepens as Trump slams central bank ahead of vote While the market debates, the Fed itself is splitting down the middle. Alberto Musalem, who runs the St. Louis Fed and votes this year, said inflation still looks too sticky. “There is a possibility, not the base case, that there could be some persistence,” he told Reuters after Powell’s speech. Boston Fed president Susan Collins also doesn’t think the decision’s final. She told Bloomberg, “It’s not a done deal in terms of what we do with the next meeting. And we’re going to get more data between now and then.” Jeff Schmid, who leads the Kansas City Fed, thinks the labor market’s still strong enough. Austan Goolsbee from the Chicago Fed isn’t so sure. He’s worried about lingering inflation, especially in services. All of them vote on rates, and clearly, not everyone’s on the same page. Inside the Fed board itself, cracks are showing. At the last vote in July, Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, both sitting governors and possible successors to Powell, voted for a quarter-point cut. That’s the first time two governors didn’t back the chair on rates since 1993. All of this is happening while Donald Trump, now back in the White House, is openly attacking the central bank. He’s called Powell a “numbskull” and a “moron” who’s always “too late,” and demanded a massive cut down to just 1%. Trump’s pick to fill the board seat left by Adriana Kugler, Stephen Miran, is expected to vote for a cut too, if confirmed in time by the Senate. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The move follows an announcement last week from Ripple Labs that it was working with SBI to fuel its RLUSD stablecoin adoption in Japan. RWA tokenization has hit an all-time high in terms of on-chain value, which is $26.5 billion according to RWA.xyz. However, this is a drop in the ocean compared to the multi-trillion-dollar traditional finance sector, which has yet to be brought on-chain. Last week, Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller revealed that the US central bank is actively conducting technical research on RWA tokenization and smart contracts. LINK Price Outlook Chainlink’s native token, LINK, has outperformed the wider crypto market recently, having surged more than 40% over the past month, primarily driven by RWA tokenization narratives. LINK was trading flat on the day at just below $26 during the Monday morning Asian session. It has started to consolidate at this level, where it has been for a week or so following a big move up from below $16 earlier this month. Nevertheless, LINK remains down over 50% from its peak more than four years ago, so there is plenty of room for upside in light of recent institutional partnerships and expansion. $LINK is on the edge of changing the trend towards upwards against $BTC .

A recent, substantial Bitcoin whale withdrawal has certainly sent ripples, capturing the attention of analysts and investors alike. This massive transfer of Bitcoin from a major exchange could signal important shifts in investor confidence and market direction. Understanding these large transactions helps us grasp the underlying forces at play in the dynamic digital asset space. Unveiling the Latest Bitcoin Whale Withdrawal Details Recently, a prominent crypto whale, identified by its wallet address beginning with bc1qgf, executed a significant transaction. This address received an additional 254.92 BTC, valued at approximately $28.57 million at the time of the transfer. The substantial funds originated from FalconX, a well-regarded prime brokerage platform for digital assets. This isn’t an isolated incident. The bc1qgf whale wallet began its accumulation spree just last month, steadily building its holdings. As a direct result of these consistent moves, the address now commands a staggering total of 2,219 BTC, worth roughly $249 million. Such a considerable Bitcoin whale withdrawal and subsequent accumulation pattern often suggests a strong, long-term bullish outlook from the holder, indicating they believe Bitcoin’s value will increase over time. Who Exactly Are These “Whales” in the Crypto Ocean? In the cryptocurrency market, “whales” are individuals or entities holding exceptionally large amounts of a particular digital asset, like Bitcoin. Their holdings are so significant that their buying or selling activities can visibly influence market prices. Think of them as the large ships in the ocean, creating waves that smaller boats feel. When a whale makes a move, such as a large Bitcoin whale withdrawal , it’s often seen as a signal. These large holders might be early adopters, institutional investors, or even crypto funds. Their decisions are usually based on deep market analysis and long-term strategies, making their actions a point of interest for the broader market. Why Does a Bitcoin Whale Withdrawal From FalconX Matter So Much? The significance of a whale’s move often depends on where the transaction occurs. When a whale withdraws a substantial amount of Bitcoin from an exchange, it generally indicates an intention to hold these assets for the long term. This contrasts with keeping funds on an exchange, which suggests a readiness to sell. Moving BTC off an exchange effectively reduces the immediate supply available for trading, which can be interpreted as a bullish indicator. Moreover, the origin of this particular transaction – FalconX – adds another layer of importance. FalconX is not a typical retail exchange; it primarily serves institutional investors, hedge funds, and sophisticated traders. A withdrawal of this magnitude from such a platform strongly implies institutional-level conviction and a strategic, large-scale investment. It suggests that a major entity or a very wealthy individual is taking a substantial long position on Bitcoin, likely after extensive due diligence. Key Implications of This Significant Movement This recent Bitcoin whale withdrawal offers several important insights for the market: Reduced Selling Pressure: By moving BTC off exchanges, the whale signals a reduced intent to sell in the short term, easing potential selling pressure. Long-Term Confidence: Consistent accumulation points to a strong belief in Bitcoin’s future price appreciation and its role as a store of value. Institutional Endorsement: The FalconX connection strongly hints at sophisticated, large-scale institutional interest and adoption, which can boost overall market confidence. Market Signal: It serves as a crucial data point for other investors. While not financial advice, such actions can influence broader market sentiment and investment strategies. Potential Risks and Considerations When Following Whales While tracking Bitcoin whale withdrawal patterns can be insightful, it’s crucial to approach this data with a balanced perspective. Whales, despite their size, are not infallible. Their actions are based on their own strategies, which may not align with every investor’s goals or risk tolerance. Consider these points: Market Manipulation: Some whales might engage in tactics to influence prices. Hidden Agendas: A whale’s full strategy isn’t always apparent from a single transaction. Delayed Information: On-chain data, while transparent, is historical. Market conditions can change rapidly. Always conduct your own thorough research and consult with financial professionals. Use whale activity as one data point among many, rather than a sole basis for investment decisions. In conclusion, the recent Bitcoin whale withdrawal of $28.57 million from FalconX by the bc1qgf address is a truly compelling event. It underscores significant ongoing accumulation by a major holder, potentially signaling robust long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s enduring value. These large-scale movements, especially when originating from institutional-focused platforms, continue to serve as vital indicators for understanding the evolving cryptocurrency market. Paying close attention to such transparent on-chain data can offer a unique and powerful perspective on where the market might be heading next. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Bitcoin whale withdrawal? A Bitcoin whale withdrawal refers to a large amount of Bitcoin being moved from an exchange wallet to a private, non-exchange wallet by a major holder (a “whale”). This often indicates an intent to hold the assets long-term rather than sell them immediately. Q2: Why is FalconX significant in this transaction? FalconX is a prime brokerage platform primarily serving institutional investors and large traders. A withdrawal of this magnitude from FalconX suggests that a sophisticated, large-scale entity or individual is behind the transaction, implying a high level of conviction. Q3: What does a whale accumulating BTC typically mean for the market? When a whale consistently accumulates BTC, it generally suggests a bullish outlook. They are buying and holding, which reduces the available supply on exchanges and can be seen as a positive signal for future price appreciation. Q4: How can I track Bitcoin whale activity? You can track Bitcoin whale activity using on-chain analytics platforms like Onchain Lens, Glassnode, or CryptoQuant. These tools provide data transparency, allowing you to observe large transactions and wallet movements on the blockchain. Q5: Are there risks in solely following whale movements for investment decisions? Yes, relying solely on whale movements carries risks. Whales have their own strategies and may not always be infallible. Their actions can sometimes be misinterpreted, or they might have hidden agendas. Always conduct your own research and consider multiple factors before making investment decisions. Did you find this analysis of the recent Bitcoin whale withdrawal insightful?

With institutional inflows, network upgrades, and whale activity fueling momentum, investors are hunting for the best altcoins to buy before the next market breakout. Analysts are highlighting Solana, Polygon (MATIC), Binance Coin (BNB), and MAGACOIN FINANCE as the best picks to go up to the moon with skyrocketing growth potential in 2025. Solana (SOL): Network Upgrades and ETF Momentum The Price of Solana (SOL) Today Solana (SOL) current price is $187.27 with a market cap of $55.50 B. Its price is 6.16% up in the last 24 hours. After a wild trading within $158, and $205 in August, Bitcoin Cash gained very positive momentum. This will make the blockchain one of the fastest ever created if Alpenglow upgrade is implemented, reducing block finality to less than 150 milliseconds for an entire network. 95% chance of ETF approval by October 2025, and with institutional buying at a scale the world has never seen before. With record high throughput and increasing DeFi adoption, Solana is one of the best altcoins to buy in September. Polygon (MATIC): DeFi Growth and Token Evolution Polygon (MATIC) has seen its Total Value Locked (TVL) reach $1.23 billion, a 43% increase year-to-date, led by QuickSwap and Polymarket. Daily active users now exceed 18.9 million, highlighting strong on-chain activity. Despite short-term pressure near $0.35 support, fundamentals remain robust with zkEVM scaling and the POL token migration strengthening governance and interoperability. CEO Sandeep Nailwal is set to outline new growth plans at the August 22 AMA, focusing on AggLayer v0.3 and scaling to 5,000 TPS. With deep DeFi momentum and a growing ecosystem, MATIC continues to rank among the best altcoins to buy for September. Binance Coin (BNB): Institutional Demand and New ATH BNB made a record high of $882 on August 21, before retracing to around $851. Institutional demand is picking up pace, as corporate treasuries purchased more than $600 million of BNB last month and Nasdaq-listed BNC plans to own 1% of supply by the end of the year. News of Binance Updates and its growing utility and use case are adding value to BNB, increasing its market share power. Now there are analysts who expect targets of $920-$1,000 and BNB is now clearly in the running for the best altcoins to buy going into September 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Moonshot with Strong Potential Unlike established giants, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in presale — giving investors a rare early entry opportunity. Analyzing various market models, one can conclude that MAGACOIN FINANCE might generate a very strong 30x return on investment before the upcoming sector-wide bull run. The investors who come in at the earliest stage stand to gain much more, as the presale is now open with a lucrative 50% extra bonus for anyone redeeming the code PATRIOT50X. This pairing of ample upward swing with mutually beneficial rewards is resulting in a wave of interest from big money holders. With analysts predicting a 30x surge in the next altseason, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being ranked alongside blue-chip projects as one of the best altcoins to buy in September 2025. Final Thoughts: Best Altcoins to Buy Before the Next Rally As September 2025 unfolds, Solana, Polygon, Binance Coin, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are emerging as the best altcoins to buy before the next breakout. With network upgrades, institutional adoption, and presale momentum aligning, these tokens present powerful upside potential. Smart investors are positioning now — history shows the biggest winners are those who move early, before the crowd rushes in.

Analyst Maps The Path",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/can-ethereum-really-hit-20000-this-cycle-analyst/,"Crypto analyst Astronomer (@astronomer_zero) says his long-standing bottom thesis on the ETH/BTC pair has played out and published explicit cycle targets anchored to the cross. In a chart shared on X, he reiterated that “ETH bottom call” is in and framed the roadmap entirely through ETH/BTC levels rather than ETH/USD, arguing that Ether’s outperformance typically follows Bitcoin’s impulse and that “all major liquidity comes from BTC.” How High Can Ethereum Go This Cycle? Astronomer’s post centers on a multi-month “zone” on ETH/BTC that he had marked in advance as a potential cyclical inflection. He writes that the call looked “delusional” when first drawn—“a ‘ridiculously long’ prediction line (straight up from the bottom) from what ‘could impossibly be the ETHBTC bottom’ at the time”—but says the turn aligns with his proprietary sentiment work. “The sentiment on ETH was the worst my sentiment metric has ever tracked,” with narratives ranging from “ETH is a bad investment,” to “ETH foundation is selling,” to “SOL is the new ETH,” to “utility coins are dead.” In his words, “that type of sentiment allowed us to confirm the bottom on ETHBTC in alignment with our ancient plan, at the time it hit our zone.” Related Reading: Ethereum Faces High-Risk Setup: Leverage-Driven Rallies Signal Volatility With that backdrop, the chart and commentary lay out three ETH/BTC targets for the remainder of the cycle. The first is 0.058 BTC per ETH, which he notes was “still 35% above here” at the time of posting and, translated directly using spot Bitcoin, “puts ETH at approx. $6.500 if BTC stays at this price.” The second is 0.091, “pretty much a double from here,” corresponding to “$ETH to $10,000+, 5 figures,” a level where he says he “will have sold over half of my spot bags.” The final and highest target is 0.16, “just under a 4x from here, putting ETH at $20,000 or higher.” He is explicit that the 0.16 mark is aspirational rather than base case: “That is certainly my highest target, and I do not expect that to be reached guaranteed. But I love it open just in case it does happen.” The technical logic he presents is deliberately pair-driven. By mapping the cycle with ETH/BTC, he seeks to capture relative strength rather than absolute price and to sidestep the moving base of BTC’s dollar value. The implied ETH/USD levels in his post are simple translations of ratio × BTC price; he adds that those USD conversions “will, in fact, be underestimates as I also see BTC rise further.” In other words, the chart’s horizontal levels are ETH/BTC at 0.058, 0.091, and 0.16; the USD numbers are contingent and will float with Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, BNB On The Rise Following Powell’s Fed Speech The analyst also rejects calendar heuristics outright. “The reason I never talk about seasonality or ‘red September’ or ‘sell in May, walk away’… is because I don’t want to promote putting your hard earned capital on weak data… Seasonality, has neither.” He adds that “Seasons don’t work in markets, only cycles do,” and signs off with a jab at the meme: “For red September, kindly, visit your local forest…” Importantly, the pathway he describes is conditional on the same relative-rotation dynamic that has governed past cycles: Bitcoin leads, Ether lags until liquidity rotates, then ETH/BTC advances through predefined shelves. In that framework, the analysis does not depend on any single ETH/USD number; it depends on ETH/BTC reclaiming and holding the cited bands. Astronomer is candid about positioning psychology as well. He argues that while “it seems as if many are all bull posting ETH now and holding big bags,” order-flow suggests “most of those people haven’t bought from down low, are rather frozen out or are forced to buy higher with higher leverage.” In his view, that structure still favors upside toward the posted ETH/BTC targets: “So as long as that stays that way, I continue to expect these targets.” At press time, ETH traded at $4,621.

Then you need to know about a significant development concerning STG and ZRO volatility . South Korea’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, Upbit and Bithumb, have issued a crucial warning to investors. They are urging caution regarding investments in Stargate Finance (STG) and LayerZero (ZRO). What’s Behind the STG and ZRO Volatility Warning? The Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA), a prominent self-regulatory body in South Korea, initiated this cautionary alert. Upbit and Bithumb, acting on DAXA’s recommendation, have highlighted potential risks on their official websites. This collective warning emphasizes the serious nature of the situation. The primary concern stems from LayerZero’s recent acquisition of Stargate Finance. Such corporate actions in the crypto space often lead to unpredictable market movements. Exchanges are specifically worried that this acquisition could significantly increase price swings for both the STG and ZRO tokens. Understanding Stargate Finance (STG) and LayerZero (ZRO) To grasp the implications of this warning, it helps to understand what these tokens represent. Stargate Finance (STG) is a fully composable liquidity transport protocol. It allows users to transfer native assets cross-chain, essentially bridging different blockchain networks. This functionality is crucial for interoperability in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. LayerZero (ZRO), on the other hand, is an omnichain interoperability protocol. It aims to connect various blockchains, enabling seamless communication and transactions across them. LayerZero’s vision is to create a unified blockchain ecosystem, making it easier for applications to operate across multiple chains without fragmentation. Navigating Potential Risks: What Should Investors Consider with STG and ZRO Volatility? When one project acquires another, especially in a rapidly evolving sector like cryptocurrency, several factors can influence token prices. The integration process, potential changes in tokenomics, and market sentiment all play a role. For STG and ZRO, the acquisition introduces a new layer of complexity. Investors must recognize that increased price swings mean higher potential for both gains and losses. This heightened STG and ZRO volatility requires a careful approach. Here are some key considerations: Market Sentiment: News of acquisitions can trigger speculative trading, leading to rapid price changes. Integration Challenges: The successful integration of two complex protocols is not guaranteed and can face technical hurdles. Regulatory Scrutiny: Mergers and acquisitions can attract increased attention from regulators, potentially impacting future operations. Tokenomics Adjustments: Changes to the supply, distribution, or utility of either token could affect their value. Actionable Insights for Managing STG and ZRO Volatility Given the warnings from Upbit and Bithumb, what steps can investors take? It is crucial to approach this situation with a well-thought-out strategy. Staying informed is your best defense against unexpected market movements. Conduct Thorough Research: Before making any decisions, delve deeper into the specifics of the LayerZero-Stargate acquisition. Understand the proposed integration plan and its long-term implications. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Volatile assets are not suitable for all investors. Evaluate whether your financial goals and risk appetite align with the potential swings in STG and ZRO prices. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid putting all your capital into a single asset or a pair of interconnected assets like STG and ZRO. A diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks during periods of high volatility. Stay Updated: Follow official announcements from Upbit, Bithumb, DAXA, LayerZero, and Stargate Finance. Market conditions can change quickly, so timely information is vital. The warnings about STG and ZRO volatility serve as a reminder of the inherent risks in the cryptocurrency market. While acquisitions can unlock new opportunities, they also introduce uncertainty. By understanding the underlying reasons for these warnings and adopting a cautious approach, investors can better navigate the evolving landscape of digital assets. This situation underscores the importance of regulatory bodies and exchanges in providing timely information to protect investors. Always prioritize due diligence and make informed decisions to safeguard your investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Why did Upbit and Bithumb issue a warning about STG and ZRO?

XRP Price and Market Activity XRP traded at $2.95 at press time with a daily turnover of $6.4 billion. The token slipped 2.5% in the past 24 hours and fell 1% over the last seven days. Despite the dip, trading activity among institutions has stayed strong after weeks of range-bound movement. Before yesterday’s retracement, XRP had jumped beyond $3.00 and up to $3.10 alongisde the rest of the market. The move came as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered dovish remarks at the Jackson Hole conference. His comments strengthened expectations of September rate cuts, which encouraged flows into risk assets such as digital currencies. Breakout Pattern and Analyst Targets Crypto analyst Javon Marks pointed to XRP’s long-term chart, noting that the asset has repeatedly formed large symmetrical triangles before breaking out. “Another >200% increase to $9.63+” could be next, he said, citing the strong similarity to XRP’s cycle in 2017, when the token rallied sharply after years of consolidation. According to past breakout and cycle performance and the extremely high similarities of this cycle, next up for $XRP is another >200% increase to $9.63+ and then… pic.twitter.com/FQ0Davg2R5 — JAVON MARKS (@JavonTM1) August 24, 2025 Marks highlighted Fibonacci extension levels as markers for possible targets. The 1.618 extension stands at $9.63, while the 2.618 extension stretches above $123 as a longer-term projection. Remarkably, the breakout level was drawn at $2, and XRP has already moved well past that level, trading as high as $3.60 during the recent run. Ripple’s court win in its case against the US Securities and Exchange Commission has helped XRP attract institutional interest. The ruling offered a clearer view of how the asset may be classified, and investors responded with increased inflows. Analysts believe that if XRP holds above near-term resistance, it could push toward price zones between $5 and $9. Marks’ chart shows consolidation zones after each breakout, suggesting that the asset may stabilize above $2 before attempting a larger run. Broader Analyst Perspectives Other market watchers are equally bullish. CryptoBull described $25 as “the most logical price target for XRP this bull run.” Another analyst, Crypto Feras, noted that while XRP remains about 9% below its 2018 peak, its market capitalization is now 41% higher. The commentator argued that although the token supply has grown, the asset could still deliver strong gains in this cycle. Source: X Feras also reminded traders that XRP lagged during the 2021 bull market, when Bitcoin surged to $69,000 but Ripple’s token failed to revisit its prior highs. Even so, current sentiment is supported by stronger institutional flows and improving macroeconomic conditions. The post XRP Rally Ahead?

The price of Bitcoin experienced a brief surge following Fed Chair Jerome Powell's subdued speech in Jackson Hole last Friday, but then fell over the weekend. At this point, Ethereum (ETH) is hitting new ATHs, while Bitcoin continues its downtrend. Bitcoin has fallen 2.14% in the last 24 hours to $112,600. Pointing out Bitcoin's recent slow performance, popular analyst Willy Woo said that big whales are responsible for this situation. Willy Woo, who asked in his post from the X account, “Why is Bitcoin's rise so slow in this cycle?”, pointed to ancient Whales as the reason for Bitcoin's slow rise. Woo said the reason for Bitcoin's slow rise is that these whales control a large amount of supply, and in response to their selling, a large amount of new capital needs to enter the market for the price to rise. Woo argued that the large amount of new capital needed to absorb sales is slow to enter the market, making it difficult to increase prices. Stating that the Bitcoin supply is concentrated in these whales, Woo stated that these whales bought the BTCs in their hands for about $10 or less in 2011. Pointing out that buying one BTC now requires more than $110,000, Woo argued that this difference in cost slows down BTC accumulation and price increases. “Why is BTC rising so slowly this cycle? The main reason for this is the high amount of capital required to accumulate Bitcoin. The Bitcoin supply is largely controlled by ex-whales, who bought Bitcoin at $10 apiece back then. But now it takes $110,000 per coin to absorb every BTC they sell and buy those Bitcoins.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Starts the New Week with a Drop!

This significant transaction, valued at approximately $250 million, immediately sparked discussions across the decentralized finance (DeFi) community. Such large movements often signal strategic plays by major investors, commonly known as ‘whales,’ highlighting the dynamic nature of digital asset management. What Does This Massive USDT Transfer to Aave Imply? This substantial USDT transfer to Aave represents a significant injection of liquidity into one of the leading decentralized lending and borrowing protocols. Aave allows users to lend out their crypto to earn interest and borrow other cryptocurrencies by providing collateral. USDT, or Tether, is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, meaning its value is designed to remain stable at $1. Increased Liquidity: The influx of $250 million in USDT dramatically boosts Aave’s liquidity pools, making more capital available for borrowing. Potential for Activity: More liquidity can lead to increased borrowing and lending activity on the platform, potentially influencing interest rates. Market Confidence: A large transfer to a major DeFi protocol like Aave can be seen as a vote of confidence in the platform’s stability and the broader DeFi ecosystem. Decoding the Whale’s Intent: Why the Crucial USDT Transfer? When such a massive USDT transfer to Aave occurs, crypto enthusiasts often wonder about the motives behind it. Whales typically move such large sums with specific strategic objectives in mind. While the exact reasons remain speculative without direct insight, several possibilities stand out: The whale might be positioning themselves for various opportunities within the DeFi space. For example, they could be: Seeking Yield: Aave offers competitive interest rates for lending stablecoins, making it an attractive platform for generating passive income. Collateral for Loans: The USDT could serve as collateral to borrow other cryptocurrencies, enabling leveraged trading or participation in other DeFi strategies without selling their stablecoin holdings. Preparing for Market Moves: Large sums are sometimes moved to prepare for significant market events, allowing the whale to react quickly to price fluctuations in other assets. Institutional Involvement: This kind of transaction could also indicate an institutional player entering or expanding their position within the DeFi ecosystem. How Does This Affect DeFi Liquidity and Market Stability? The sheer scale of this USDT transfer to Aave has broader implications for the decentralized finance landscape. Large movements of capital like this can influence various aspects of the market. Firstly, it reinforces Aave’s position as a robust and trusted protocol capable of handling substantial assets. Secondly, increased liquidity in stablecoins on platforms like Aave can lead to: Enhanced Borrowing Capacity: More USDT available means more users can borrow against their collateral, potentially fueling other DeFi activities. Rate Adjustments: A significant increase in supply could, in theory, lead to slightly lower borrowing rates or higher lending rates as the protocol adjusts to the new liquidity levels. Increased Trust: Such a large, successful transaction can bolster overall trust in the security and efficiency of DeFi protocols, attracting more users and capital to the space. Navigating Whale Movements: Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts Observing a USDT transfer to Aave of this magnitude offers valuable lessons for anyone interested in cryptocurrencies. While it’s tempting to try and mimic whale movements, a more informed approach is always recommended. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor On-Chain Data: Tools like Whale Alert provide transparency, allowing you to track significant transactions. Understanding how to interpret this data is key. Understand the Protocols: Familiarize yourself with platforms like Aave. Knowing how they operate helps you understand the potential implications of large transfers. Conduct Your Own Research: Never base investment decisions solely on whale activity. Always perform thorough due diligence on any asset or protocol. Diversify Your Portfolio: Relying on a single asset or strategy can be risky. A diversified approach helps mitigate potential downsides. The recent 250,000,000 USDT transfer to Aave is more than just a large transaction; it’s a testament to the evolving landscape of decentralized finance. It underscores the immense capital flowing into DeFi and the sophisticated strategies employed by major players. For both seasoned investors and newcomers, understanding these movements provides crucial insights into the health and future direction of the crypto market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Aave and why is it important? Aave is a leading decentralized lending and borrowing protocol in the DeFi space. It allows users to earn interest on deposits and borrow assets, playing a crucial role in providing liquidity and financial services without traditional intermediaries. Q2: What is USDT and why is it used in such large transfers? USDT (Tether) is the largest stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar. Its stability makes it ideal for large transfers because it minimizes price volatility, allowing whales to move significant value without exposure to market fluctuations. Q3: How do whale transfers impact the crypto market? Whale transfers can significantly impact market sentiment, liquidity, and even asset prices. They often indicate strategic positioning, potential large trades, or shifts in institutional interest, which smaller investors closely watch. Q4: Can this USDT transfer to Aave affect interest rates on the platform? Potentially, yes. A massive injection of USDT liquidity could lead to adjustments in Aave’s interest rates for both lenders and borrowers, as the protocol’s algorithms react to the increased supply and demand dynamics. Q5: How can I track large cryptocurrency transfers like this? Services like Whale Alert specialize in tracking significant cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. Many blockchain explorers also allow users to monitor specific wallet addresses for large movements. Did you find this analysis insightful?

The spike came amid heightened investor interest and positive macroeconomic signals. Shortly after touching the peak, the price experienced a minor pullback but remained in a strong uptrend. At the time of writing, ETH is trading just below $4,608, reflecting a 8.1% gain over the past week. Notably, Ethereum priced in Bitcoin has also reached a milestone, hitting 0.043 BTC, its highest value since September 2024. This shift indicates growing strength in Ethereum relative to Bitcoin, a potential sign that ETH is no longer as undervalued as before. This development reinforces the bullish trend for Ethereum and could hint at a larger market rotation in favor of altcoins. Why Is Ethereum Surging in August 2025? The rapid climb in ETH’s value appears to be fueled by several key factors: A hawkish-to-dovish pivot from the Federal Reserve. On August 22, Chairman Jerome Powell suggested that interest rate cuts may be on the table, sparking renewed risk appetite across markets. A resurgence of investor interest in Ethereum’s ecosystem ahead of anticipated upgrades and rollouts. Bitcoin’s dominance waning, giving altcoins like Ethereum room to outperform. Meanwhile, market volatility remains elevated. On the same day, daily liquidations surpassed $684 million, primarily from long positions in ETH and BTC, according to CoinGlass.

Investors eye MUTM as the next crypto to deliver 30x returns,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/25/best-crypto-to-buy-investors-eye-mutm-as-the-next-crypto-to-deliver-30x-returns/,"As the year draws to a close and crypto markets heat up, traders are asking a familiar question: What is the best cryptocurrency to buy before year-end? While Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate headlines, a growing number of analysts are pointing toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi project most likely to deliver outsized returns heading into 2026. With its presale price locked at just $0.035 and a confirmed listing at $0.06, investors are positioning early for what many expect to be a major breakout. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to launch with a fully functional DeFi product. Built as a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol, it incorporates both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending pools and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) agreements. This structure allows assets like ETH, USDT, and BTC to be supplied into shared pools while also enabling direct lending deals with tokens such as DOGE and PEPE. MUTM is now in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035, with over $14.75 million raised from 15,550+ holders and a confirmed exchange debut price of $0.06. Deposits are tokenized into mtTokens, which accrue interest over time, can be staked for MUTM rewards, or even used as collateral. By combining flexibility with utility from day one, analysts argue that MUTM is positioned for adoption far beyond its presale stage. From $0.035 to $1: investment examples At today’s presale price of $0.035, a $1,200 allocation secures roughly 34,300 MUTM tokens. By the time the token lists at $0.06, that same position would already be worth over $2,000. Longer-term predictions are even more compelling. When MUTM reaches $1 within its first major cycle, that same $1,200 allocation would climb to $34,300, marking a return of nearly 30x. Investors often reference early opportunities like Solana as proof that utility-focused DeFi platforms can reach this level of growth. Passive income opportunities beyond price growth Mutuum Finance provides a dual-revenue model, offering more than simple price appreciation. When users deposit assets, they receive mtTokens that grow in redemption value as interest accumulates. For example, depositing $2,500 worth of BTC into liquidity pools could generate an estimated 12–16% APY, depending on utilization. Those mtTokens can also be staked in the safety module to unlock additional MUTM rewards. This setup gives investors dual benefits, consistent yield and capital appreciation—something rarely seen in early-stage tokens. Stablecoin, beta launch, and community giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the market with a threefold advantage that enhances its utility and boosts investor appeal. The project’s first major expansion is an overcollateralized stablecoin, built to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US Dollar. Supported by on-chain collateral held within the Mutuum protocol, the stablecoin delivers transparency and long-term stability, providing users with a dependable medium for trading, lending, and borrowing across the ecosystem. Second, Mutuum Finance has confirmed that its beta platform will launch alongside the token listing, providing immediate access to core features such as lending, borrowing, and staking. This launch ensures investors gain immediate access to a live protocol from day one, strengthening both credibility and early adoption. Finally, to boost momentum and reward its early backers, Mutuum Finance has introduced a $100,000 giveaway. Ten winners will share the prize equally, further boosting community engagement while expanding visibility ahead of launch. This mix of real utility, instant product delivery, and strong incentives makes MUTM one of the most closely watched presales of 2025. Why investors are watching MUTM closely As 2025 draws to a close, the hunt for the best cryptocurrency to buy before year-end is intensifying. While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the giants, it is smaller-cap projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that hold the clearest potential for exponential returns. With its presale price at $0.035, a confirmed listing at $0.06, whale inflows, passive income mechanics, and a functional beta platform ready at launch, analysts see MUTM as a top contender for 30x growth before 2026. For those who missed out on Solana or Aave in their early days, this may be the opportunity that defines the next cycle.

His analysis uses the 2018 market peak and the 2020 market bottom as key reference points. According to his calculations, ETH’s 1.618 Fibonacci extension projects a target zone between $7,700 and $8,000. Using the same approach for XRP, he places its 1.618 Fibonacci extension in the range of $27 to $31. Egrag questioned why some technical analysts acknowledge ETH’s 1.618 Fibonacci target while rejecting the same projection for XRP. He emphasized that since both assets are measured using identical parameters, dismissing one while supporting the other reflects inconsistency and bias rather than objective technical reasoning. #XRP & #ETH Patterns: Fib 1.618 Insights Let’s take a closer look at the measured move from the 2018 high to the 2020 low: #ETH 's Fib 1.618 is around $7,700 – $8,000. #XRP 's Fib 1.618 is projected at $27 – $31.

The ETH chart marks the 2018 high and 2020 low, highlighting a head-and-shoulders formation that developed between 2021 and 2024. Alongside the structural analysis, several Fibonacci levels are outlined, including the 1.414 level near $4,405, the 1.0 level around $1,413, and the 0.702 retracement zone close to $623. The 1.618 extension level, positioned near $7,714 to $8,401, is presented as the major upside projection. For XRP , the chart shows a long consolidation pattern forming after the 2018 peak and the 2020 low. Within this structure, Egrag highlights the Fibonacci levels relevant to XRP’s potential future trajectory . The 1.0 level is positioned at $3.52, the 1.414 extension at $15.23, and the 1.618 extension between $27 and $31. The 0.702 retracement level, identified at $1.22, is also noted as a key technical marker. These visual references support the claim that both assets, when analyzed through the same mathematical process, point to substantial long-term upside targets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Timing Considerations and Market Cycles Egrag also addressed broader market cycles. He stated that he does not rule out the possibility of an extended cycle running into 2028, which could include a significant bear market phase in 2026. He further suggested that a major local peak could form in the fourth quarter of 2025, indicating that while Fibonacci targets remain intact, the path to reaching them may include both rallies and corrective moves. He contrasted his analysis with more aggressive projections from other commentators, some of whom claim ETH could reach between $15,000 and $20,000 within the next few months. Egrag’s stance focused instead on consistent technical measurement rather than speculative short-term forecasts. He concluded with a message to the XRP community, encouraging holders to remain steady and focused as the outlined technical targets continue to unfold over the coming years.

Why analysts are ranking MUTM at the top,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/25/next-crypto-breakout-after-xrp-why-analysts-are-ranking-mutm-at-the-top/,"Ripple (XRP) has long been one of the most recognized names in the cryptocurrency market. Currently trading near $3, XRP maintains a place among the top assets by market capitalization, largely supported by its cross-border payments network and institutional interest. Its early breakout years ago saw XRP climb from fractions of a cent to an all-time high of $3.84 in 2018, rewarding early believers with exponential returns. While its legal battles and regulatory scrutiny have slowed momentum, XRP continues to be viewed as a core holding in many portfolios. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) While XRP has proven its staying power, analysts are increasingly pointing to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next breakout candidate in DeFi. Unlike many low-cost tokens that rely heavily on hype, MUTM is entering the market with a utility-first model designed to drive real adoption. The protocol operates as a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity platform, offering two participation methods. Through Peer-to-Contract (P2C), users can supply assets like ETH, USDT, and MATIC into liquidity pools to earn yield. Alongside this, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system enables direct lending and borrowing of volatile tokens such as DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE without impacting larger pools. What separates Mutuum Finance from previous DeFi models is its mtToken mechanism. Every deposit is tokenized into mtTokens that automatically accrue interest. These mtTokens can be traded, used as collateral, or staked for MUTM rewards, giving participants multiple revenue streams beyond simple holding. Analysts argue that this structure strengthens long-term adoption by adding real functionality for both retail traders and institutional users. Investment scenarios and early entry advantage Mutuum Finance is now in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035 per token, with a confirmed listing price of $0.06. That means an early entry today has immediate upside once exchange listings go live. For instance, a $1,850 allocation at the current presale rate secures about 52,800 MUTM tokens. By launch, that same position would already be worth around $3,170. Analysts, however, are looking further down the line. With predictions placing MUTM at $1 within its first major cycle, the same entry would expand to $52,800, turning a relatively modest allocation into a life-changing return. Beyond appreciation, there’s also the element of passive income. MtTokens not only earn interest from platform activity but can be staked in the safety module to receive additional MUTM rewards. This dual-income model offers investors both compounding value and exposure to the project’s long-term roadmap. Expert outlook and whale activity Market analysts have started drawing comparisons between MUTM and early-stage projects like Aave and Solana, both of which entered at low valuations before climbing into the top tiers of crypto. The combination of a presale still under $0.04, an already confirmed launch price, and a product rollout scheduled alongside exchange listings gives MUTM a stronger setup than most tokens entering the market. Whale activity is also adding fuel to this momentum. Large wallet trackers have highlighted significant allocations being made in recent weeks, with Mutuum Finance already raising over $14.75 million from 15,550 holders. This is seen as a clear sign that institutional-scale investors view MUTM as undervalued at current levels. Historically, such inflows have preceded rapid growth phases, especially in tokens with robust utility backing them. Adding further visibility, Mutuum Finance recently announced a $100,000 giveaway campaign, designed to reward its growing community and draw new participants into the ecosystem ahead of launch. This initiative not only incentivises early adoption but also builds the kind of engagement that helps sustain long-term growth. Why analysts rank MUTM above other breakout candidates While XRP continues to hold relevance, its growth trajectory is expected to remain steady rather than explosive. Mutuum Finance, on the other hand, is entering the market with all the elements analysts look for in a breakout candidate: a low entry price, multiple layers of utility, strong tokenomics, and early whale validation. If it follows a similar trajectory to previous DeFi leaders, early adopters could be looking at returns exceeding 25x within the first cycle, with passive income adding further upside. This combination positions MUTM not just as another presale token but as a strong contender for the next big crypto breakout. The next big opportunity As traders search for the next project capable of replicating early XRP-like returns, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is increasingly being ranked at the top of the list. With its confirmed launch price, strong presale momentum, dual-income opportunities, and growing whale interest, the project stands out as one of the most compelling opportunities of 2025. For those who missed XRP’s early surge, Mutuum Finance offers a second chance — but the presale window won’t remain open for long.

Traders say MUTM at $0.035 is the next big opportunity,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/25/missed-sols-1-days-traders-say-mutm-at-0-035-is-the-next-big-opportunity/,"Solana is one of the most well-known examples of what early entry into a strong project can achieve. In its early days, SOL traded around $1, a level that gave investors a chance to secure positions before its explosive rally. By 2021, Solana soared to an all-time high of $260, cementing itself as one of the top cryptocurrencies in the world. Today, Solana trades near $180, maintaining its status as a leading smart contract platform, even after market corrections. Its success story continues to inspire traders who seek the next asset capable of delivering exponential returns. For many, that search has recently turned toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance’s presale advantage Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has drawn attention because it’s entering the market with utility from day one. The project is in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035 per token, having already raised over $14.75 million from 15,550 holders, with a confirmed listing at $0.06. This pricing model ensures early buyers are already positioned for gains ahead of the exchange launch. For example, a $1,400 entry today would secure around 40,000 MUTM tokens, which would be valued near $2,400 at launch. Looking ahead, when MUTM hits the $1 target analysts predict for its first cycle, that same allocation would grow to $40,000, delivering a 28x return. Passive income through mtTokens What sets Mutuum Finance apart from many low-priced tokens is its built-in revenue model. Instead of relying solely on token appreciation, the protocol offers users mtTokens when they deposit assets like ETH, USDT, or MATIC into liquidity pools. These mtTokens: Accrue interest automatically over time. Can be staked to earn MUTM rewards. They are usable as collateral within the system. Remain transferable and tradable like standard ERC-20 tokens. This flexibility allows investors to earn passive income while holding, turning MUTM into more than just a speculative buy. Analysts argue this dual benefit — price appreciation plus ongoing yield — is what strengthens its long-term adoption case. Analysts see growth potential Experts compare Mutuum Finance’s setup to early breakout projects like Aave and Solana, both of which combined utility and timing to achieve rapid success. With DeFi demand projected to accelerate as markets move into the next bull phase, MUTM’s low presale price and exchange-ready platform give it strong positioning. Adding to confidence, whales have been actively securing large allocations during presale, signaling institutional-sized bets on the project’s trajectory. Traders often view whale activity as a sign of where long-term capital is flowing, and in MUTM’s case, the inflows are growing. Momentum has also been fueled by Mutuum Finance’s expanding community. The project announced a $100,000 giveaway campaign, rewarding early participants and bringing new holders into the ecosystem ahead of launch. This initiative has not only increased visibility but also reinforced confidence that MUTM is prepared to scale quickly once live. Why traders call MUTM the next big opportunity The combination of a low entry price, immediate DeFi utility, and a growth-driven tokenomics model positions Mutuum Finance as one of the standout presale opportunities of 2025. For those who missed Solana at $1, MUTM at $0.035 offers a second chance to capture early-stage upside before exchange listings go live. Solana’s $1 days are long gone, but its early rise shows what’s possible for investors who spot strong projects before the market fully catches on. With its $0.035 presale, passive income mechanisms, and whale-backed momentum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being hailed by analysts as the next big opportunity in DeFi.

Whales put MUTM in their top picks,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/25/which-crypto-will-lead-the-next-bull-run-whales-put-mutm-in-their-top-picks/,"Every bull market has its champions—tokens that rise from obscurity to become household names across the crypto space. Bitcoin and Ethereum have cemented their place as the giants, while projects like Solana and Aave once delivered exponential growth during their early cycles. As investors prepare for the next leg of the market, attention is shifting toward tokens with both utility and strong community traction. Among them, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being highlighted by analysts and whale investors as a contender to lead the charge. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): a presale that’s gaining momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035 per token, with a confirmed exchange listing set at $0.06. Having already raised $14.75 million from over 15,550 holders, this entry point is attracting strong interest as it gives early participants an immediate upside at launch. For example, a $950 presale allocation at the current price secures around 27,100 MUTM tokens, which will be valued at nearly $1,625 when trading starts. Passive income potential Mutuum Finance integrates mechanisms for passive income. Users who deposit assets are issued mtTokens, which increase in redemption value as interest accumulates. These mtTokens can also be staked in the safety module, unlocking additional MUTM rewards. This dual-revenue model means investors can benefit not only from capital gains but also from a consistent yield stream. For example, if an investor deposits $25,000 into the protocol and the system yields an average of 10% APY, the mtTokens would gain roughly $2,500 in redemption value over the course of a year. Analysts see clear growth trajectory Expert opinions suggest that MUTM’s combination of low entry price, presale traction, and real-world application gives it an advantage heading into 2026. The protocol’s dual structure—Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending for assets like BTC, USDT, and BNB, alongside Peer-to-Peer (P2P) markets for tokens such as DOGE and PEPE, ensures flexibility for both conservative and high-volatility strategies. This design, paired with tokenomics that recycle protocol fees back into buying and redistributing MUTM to mtToken stakers, is being called a sustainable driver of long-term value. Whale confidence backing the narrative Whale wallets have already taken sizable allocations in the presale, signaling conviction in the project’s tokenomics and roadmap. In fact, within the last 36 hours alone, over $125,000 in whale investments were tracked entering the presale. Historically, whale activity has acted as a strong signal of where momentum is building, and their early positioning is adding credibility to MUTM’s breakout potential. Further fueling momentum, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway campaign, with ten winners set to split the prize pool. This initiative is more than just a marketing move; it’s a way to onboard new users, deepen community ties, and reward early supporters before the platform’s exchange listing. Together with the upcoming beta launch, which will go live alongside MUTM’s listing, the project is aligning strong fundamentals with community-building strategies. A strong contender for bull market leadership As traders ask which cryptocurrency is best positioned to lead the next bull run, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is increasingly being put forward by analysts and whales alike. With its presale price locked at just $0.035, built-in passive income mechanics, whale participation, and a confirmed launch strategy, the project checks many of the boxes investors look for in a high-upside play. If projections of a $1 target within its first market cycle prove accurate, early backers could see life-changing returns. For those watching whale activity, the signal is already clear: MUTM is one of the tokens to watch before the next bull market takes off.

The token is up by 60% in the last 2 months , while CoinMarketCap shows an 11.7% increase in the last week alone. Trading volume is also up by 57% in the last day, showing significant investor attention. As sellers defend the $200 resistance level and buying pressure builds, we believe Solana is in for an imminent breakout. Technical analysis (like the RSI and MACD) shows a potential rally to $250 if positive sentiment remains stable. As a blue-chip crypto with immense market influence, Solana’s breakout could also rally top altcoins like Snorter Token ($SNORT) . Still in presale, the token has raised over $3.4M, with investors in a frenzy over the upcoming trading bot (the cheapest and fastest on Solana). Read our ‘What Is Snorter Token’ guide to learn more. Stick around to see why Solana is in the green and why a breakout is likely imminent, and discover the best move for you now. Jerome Powell’s Speech Reignites Solana’s Potential In his speech at Jackson Hole on August 22, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said: Nonetheless, with policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance. —Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Jackson Hole Speech The market interpreted this as a hint of upcoming interest rate cuts, and investors immediately priced in the bullish sentiment. Solana immediately pumped by 14% after the speech, with Ethereum hitting an ATH at $4,880 and Bitcoin soaring 5% to $117K. While the market has temporarily chilled, we believe the full impact of Powell’s speech is yet to be priced in. Interest rate cuts are infamously positive for crypto. As money essentially becomes cheaper, investors are more likely to redirect their funds to riskier assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Traders are already optimistic about Solana if it holds above $200. With the $212–$215 resistance levels ahead, a breakout there might point to a rally. Even X Trader Ali sees a $222 target next if $SOL can break through $211. And because good news often comes in pairs, VanEck filed an S-1 for a JitoSOL ETF that offers staking rewards. Fidelity, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton have already filed for one. This is a great time to hold Solana, but if you’re looking for fresher, even more promising investments, Snorter Token ($SNORT) could be up your alley. Let’s see why. Snorter Token Raises $3.4M for the Fastest & Cheapest Telegram Trading Bot Snorter Token ($SNORT) is a top crypto presale that plans to build a Telegram trading bot for sniping meme coins and altcoins. $SNORT wants to level the playing field for retail investors, who have long struggled with whales beating them to the punch. Here’s what the bot will offer once it goes live: Fast, secure token swaps with top-tier security and front-running protection Honeypot and rugpull detection to detect scam tokens Copy-trading for easy, profitable strategies Limit orders to protect your profits and schedule buys Automated token sniping with built-in tax handling for the best meme coins 0.85% fees, the lowest in the industry at the moment Initially, the bot will launch on Solana, but the upcoming expansion includes Ethereum, BNB Chain, and other EVM networks. So, this will be a multi-chain trading bot integrated seamlessly on a Telegram interface for the best accessibility. Joining the presale and buying Snorter Token (for just $0.1023 apiece) is the best way to get early access to the bot once it goes live. Investors have already bought over $3.4M , with the project becoming viral enough to attract whales – one bought $17,793 on August 19. No doubt, one of the most appealing prospects is staking $SNORT at over 100% APY (currently 131%, but it will drop as more people stake). Our Snorter Token price prediction forecasts a potential $0.94 by the end of 2025, an 819% increase from the current price. Only $500 invested now could turn into $4,595 by the year’s end, and considering the attention it’s getting now (plus its utility plans), we see $SNORT pumping after launch. Here’s how to buy Snorter Token , if you want to join the Snorter Bot movement! Solana More Likely to Pump than Dump Given the current bullish crypto climate and Solana’s technical analysis, we predict a continued upside in the mid-to-long term. Even with a retest of the $200 support level, the bulls should win in the end. If that happens, some of the best altcoins , like Ethereum, Cardano, BNB, and Snorter Token , could start a rally. Institutions keep building Bitcoin and Ether strategies, ETF filings keep coming, and worldwide adoption is increasing by the day. How can future prospects not be bullish?

Key Takeaways: SBI partnered with Chainlink to develop crypto tools for banks in Japan and the Asia-Pacific region. The collaboration will focus on tokenized RWAs, stablecoin verification, and cross-border transactions. It marks SBI’s fourth crypto deal in a week, alongside partnerships with Circle, Ripple, and Startale. In a statement on Sunday , SBI said the collaboration will focus on multiple use cases, with initial efforts centered on the Japanese market. The companies plan to explore tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), such as onchain bonds, and apply Chainlink’s technology to provide onchain verification of stablecoin reserves. SBI Strikes Fourth Major Crypto Deal in a Week The deal marks SBI’s fourth major crypto partnership in recent days, following agreements with stablecoin issuer Circle , Ripple Labs , and Web3 infrastructure firm Startale . Together, these moves underscore SBI’s push to cement its role in Japan’s growing digital asset sector. As part of the Chainlink partnership, SBI will deploy the firm’s blockchain interoperability protocol to support RWA tokenization, foreign exchange services, and cross-border transactions. Chainlink’s data feeds will also be used to bring net asset value (NAV) data onchain for tokenized funds. “I am excited to see our great work move towards a state of production usage at a large scale,” said Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov, noting his company has already collaborated with SBI on stablecoin settlement and fund tokenization use cases. SBI Holdings CEO Yoshitaka Kitao added that the partnership aims to “power compliant cross-border transactions using stablecoins, that accelerate the widespread adoption of digital assets in Japan and the region.” We’re excited to announce a strategic partnership between Chainlink and SBI Group one of Japan’s largest financial conglomerates with the USD equivalent of over $200 billion in total assets. https://t.co/ZNyq7bVvUb SBI Group and Chainlink will focus on powering several… pic.twitter.com/tdbLXOkUnW — Chainlink (@chainlink) August 25, 2025 The timing coincides with a regulatory shift in Japan, where the Financial Services Agency (FSA) is preparing to approve the country’s first yen-denominated stablecoin, with fintech firm JPYC leading the rollout as early as next month. SBI’s wider crypto strategy also involves promoting Circle’s USDC and Ripple’s Ripple USD (RLUSD) in Japan. SBI VC Trade, its crypto subsidiary, expects to list RLUSD before March 2026, while it also plans to support USDC adoption domestically. Meanwhile, its partnership with Startale will build an onchain trading platform for tokenized stocks and RWAs, offering 24/7 trading similar to services launched by Kraken and Robinhood. Asian Family Offices Boost Crypto Exposure Amid Market Rally Wealthy Asian families are stepping up their crypto investments, with family offices moving from small allocations to more advanced strategies. Singapore-based NextGen Digital Venture raised over $100 million in months for its new crypto equity fund, while UBS reported that overseas Chinese family offices plan to raise exposure to around 5% of their portfolios. The surge in interest has been fueled by Bitcoin’s rally past $124,000, favorable regulation such as Hong Kong’s stablecoin framework, and the U.S. GENIUS Act. UBS noted that second- and third-generation heirs are increasingly driving crypto adoption, with wealth managers calling digital assets an essential component of modern portfolios. Wealth managers across Singapore and Hong Kong said clients are not only buying Bitcoin ETFs and tokens directly but also experimenting with arbitrage and basis trades. Fidelity’s Giselle Lai added that Bitcoin is now being treated as a hedge against macroeconomic risks, citing its low correlation with stocks and bonds.

Zschach described the collaboration as “commendable work,” specifically noting the inclusion of industry leaders such as Ripple , Hedera, and Cardano. Zschach’s comments were attached to a GBBC announcement regarding the release of the first draft of its Capital Markets Risk Mitigation Framework (RMF). The initiative will help regulated financial institutions assess and address non-financial risks associated with the use of public blockchains. The framework will provide practical guidance for safe and sustainable blockchain adoption at scale, with GBBC inviting industry participants to provide feedback before October 3. SWIFT Chief Innovation Officer Tom Zschach praised the GBBC’s collaboration with Ripple, Hedera, and Cardano, calling it “commendable work.” See for yourself. https://t.co/2cRS8AGJet pic.twitter.com/UPHEAfVGo4 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 23, 2025 Community Reactions to SWIFT’s Recognition SMQKE’s post on X drew attention to Zschach’s acknowledgment of Ripple, Hedera, and Cardano’s role in the GBBC collaboration. One X user responded , “Interesting to see SWIFT acknowledging blockchain progress!” Another, identified as “just a cartoon dog,” remarked , “This is significant – it varies his previous comment regarding Ripple wasn’t sarcasm.” This response referenced earlier coverage by Times Tabloid, which reported on SMQKE’s analysis of a LinkedIn exchange following Ripple’s $200 million acquisition of Rail , a company specializing in stablecoin infrastructure. At the time, Zschach commented on the development, calling it “another ‘checkmate’ moment” while also clarifying that the competition in cross-border payments was “nowhere near over.” His use of quotation marks around “checkmate” led some observers, including an X user Nietzbux, to suggest that the comment may have been made in a sarcastic context, reflecting the frequent use of the phrase by online commentators rather than a literal endorsement. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Shifting Tone on Ripple and Blockchain Adoption The new recognition of the GBBC collaboration, however, has been interpreted by some community members as a shift in tone from the SWIFT Chief Innovation Officer. While previously his remarks left room for debate on whether Ripple’s acquisition signaled a decisive advantage, his latest statement clearly highlights the importance of Ripple, alongside other blockchain entities, in shaping frameworks designed for institutional blockchain adoption. For observers, the fact that SWIFT’s innovation head has openly supported GBBC’s work and named Ripple, Hedera, and Cardano as part of this “commendable” effort is viewed as an important signal of how traditional financial infrastructure providers are engaging with blockchain initiatives. SMQKE’s report underscores how such recognition may reflect an evolving perspective within SWIFT on blockchain’s role in the future of global finance.

Whales Are Frantically Selling BTC and Buying ETH! What Does It Mean for ETH?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-roles-have-reversed-whales-are-frantically-selling-btc-and-buying-eth-what-does-it-mean-for-eth/,"Bitcoin (BTC) failed to capitalize on the rally it experienced on Friday following Fed Chair Jermoe Powell's subdued speech in Jackson Hole. That rally reversed over the weekend, with the price falling to $112,000. While the upward trend in BTC weakened, Ethereum (ETH) reached a new ATH over the weekend, and it is stated that giant whales are behind this rise in ETH. At this point, analysts said that Bitcoin OG whales are selling BTC and buying ETH, which is shifting capital to Ethereum and creating volatility in the market. WhaleWire CEO Jacob King said Bitcoin's price crashed due to whale selling. According to Jacob King, the drop Bitcoin (BTC) experienced earlier today was triggered by a single whale selling over 24,000 BTC to buy Ethereum (ETH). The analyst stated in his post that he sold more than 24,000 BTC, including BTC that he had not moved for more than five years, and sent more than 12,000 BTC to the Hyperunite platform today alone. The analyst noted that this was part of a broader sell-off that has already seen 18,000 BTC ($2 billion) sold, with most of the money moving into Ethereum. According to the analyst, $2 billion was bought and $1.3 billion was staked. According to Lookonchain's post, the Bitcoin OG whale, who bought 100,784 BTC (worth $642 million at the time, now $11.4 billion) 7 years ago, is frantically swapping his BTCs for Ethereum. Accordingly, over the last five days, the giant whale deposited 22,769 BTC ($2.59 billion) into Hyperliquid for sale. With this money, he purchased 472,920 ETH ($2.22 billion) from the spot market and opened a 135,265 ETH ($577 million) long position. No Single Whale Can Be Responsible for Bitcoin's Decline! However, speaking to The Block, Kronos Research CIO Vincent Liu said that it is difficult to pinpoint a single culprit for the Bitcoin price drop. “Bitcoin's rise after Powell's speech was driven by a lack of liquidity, not by any lasting belief. Once the leverage was unwound, momentum quickly faded and BTC fell below key levels again. “Furthermore, the drop is more likely to be the work of multiple whales or an exchange with a significant stake, rather than a single individual. Large-scale transactions like the recent drop typically require institutional investors or coordinated action.” Liu also highlighted the growing interest in Ethereum, saying, “With Ethereum ETF staking approval on the horizon, expect ETH performance to further improve with increased staking activity and a potential altcoin season. Ethereum is expected to take center stage.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Bitcoin and Ethereum Roles Have Reversed! Whales Are Frantically Selling BTC and Buying ETH!

Chainlink and Litecoin are showing technical setups that could lead to notable rallies, while newer altcoins like Remittix (RTX ) are capturing attention for potential explosive growth. Chainlink’s latest updates point toward bullish targets Currently trading around $25.46, Chainlink has broken through a long-term consolidation pattern. Chainlink’s latest updates reveal a full-fledged symmetrical triangle and support above $23.00, confirming bulls in charge.

Since 2015, Bitcoin has managed only a 40% win rate in September, with an average return of -2.5%, according to data from charting platform TrendSpider shared on August 25. Bitcoin seasonality chart.

In contrast, months such as February and October have delivered outsized gains, boasting win rates of 82% and 90% respectively. BTC’s new bearish sentiment Notably, the statistic emerges at a time when Bitcoin is grappling with fresh bearish sentiment, as whale selling and exchange-traded fund outflows weigh on investors’ confidence. To this end, analysts have laid out several scenarios for the flagship cryptocurrency. In this line, according to pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst BitBull, Bitcoin has once again rebounded from its 50-day Exponential Moving Average ( EMA ), a level that has served as a reliable support throughout the current bull cycle.

Historically, Bitcoin has dipped below the 50-EMA, triggering capitulation and shaking out overleveraged traders before resuming its uptrend. Based on this pattern, a potential move toward the $106,000 to $108,000 range remains possible. While painful in the short term, such a retracement could act as a final bear trap before Bitcoin begins its next leg higher, according to BitBull.

Over the weekend, Dogecoin spiked from $0.209 to $0.24 before pulling back to its current price.

With four specialized funds, UNIL is gaining attention as one of the best altcoin opportunities for 2025. Unilabs Finance Offers Stability as DOGE and PEPE Swing As DOGE and PEPE continue to swing sharply over the weekend, investors are searching for more reliable alternatives.

The rocket, the most powerful ever built, was scheduled to launch on its 10th test mission from the South Texas site, known as Starbase. The flight window began at 6:30 p.m. local time. The cancellation came as SpaceX faces rising pressure following several explosive setbacks earlier this year. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk had suggested earlier in the day on X that he would deliver an update on Starship. That briefing never happened. Instead, Musk later posted that engineers discovered a leak of liquid oxygen on the ground systems. He said the issue would be fixed and another launch attempt would follow on Monday. Ground side liquid oxygen leak needs to be fixed. Aiming for another launch attempt tomorrow. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 25, 2025 The test flights are part of an effort to prove that Starship can eventually carry satellites, and later, people, to orbit and further in space. But the program has faced serious challenges recently. Earlier Starship flights ended up in explosions The first 2 Starship flights in 2025 ended in explosions within minutes of liftoff. A third flight failed when the rocket lost control after not deploying test satellites. In June, another Starship blew up on the ground during fueling. These repeated failures have raised doubts about whether the rocket can live up to Musk’s ambitions. Bloomberg reported that about 20% of SpaceX’s Falcon rocket engineers have been temporarily reassigned to support Starship testing and improve reliability. SpaceX has long described setbacks as part of the learning process. Engineers say that each failed attempt gives the company data to refine the vehicle. Still, the repeated mishaps have added pressure for the upcoming mission to show progress. Industry analysts say the next flight could be a turning point. “A successful test would almost kind of erase the challenges of the last year,” Carissa Christensen from BryceTech said. “An unsuccessful one is just going to add to that scrutiny and that sense of what’s going on.” Starship is central to Musk’s vision of creating a Mars settlement . The rocket is fully reusable and more powerful than any vehicle ever flown. Musk has said it will replace SpaceX’s Falcon 9, the company’s current workhorse, and serve as the main carrier for launching satellites along with people into space. The long-term plan is for Starship to carry astronauts and cargo to both Mars and the moon. But those goals remain years away. SpaceX must prove Starship can reach orbit first For now, SpaceX’s focus is on proving Starship can reach orbit, release satellites, and return safely to Earth. Two flights so far have demonstrated that the rocket’s lower stage, called Super Heavy, can separate and attempt controlled maneuvers. The delayed test is just the latest step in a long process to prove Starship’s design. Engineers will now work to fix the liquid oxygen leak and prepare for another launch attempt. Success on the next test would mark a milestone toward its eventual use in satellite launches and, further down the road, in crewed missions to the moon and Mars.

Jacob King, CEO of WhaleWire, suggested the sell-off was sparked by a single large holder liquidating over 24,000 BTC, worth more than $2 billion: “Bitcoin flash crash today, which wiped out $310M in long positions, has been traced to a SINGLE Bitcoin whale dumping BTC for ETH. The whale sold 24,000+ BTC, including coins that hadn’t moved in 5+ years.” The effects of the sell-off were felt across the broader crypto market , which lost $130 billion from its total capitalization. Total crypto market capitalization. Source: TradingView Coming just a couple of days after a brief boost triggered by comments from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, the downward trend continued on Monday, August 25, with over 147,500 traders being liquidated in the past 24 hours, losing a total of $717 million. JUST IN: 147,580 traders were liquidated in the past 24 hours. Total losses hit $717 million. — WhaleWire (@WhaleWire) August 25, 2025 Ethereum capitalizes on the Bitcoin crash The 24,000 BTC sale cited by King, routed through decentralized exchanges ( DEXs ) like Hyperliquid ( HYPE ), led to nearly $2 billion converted into Ethereum ( ETH ). More precisely, around 275,500 ETH, worth $1.3 billion, was staked, while 135,263 ETH, around $620 million, was leveraged into long positions. As a result, Ethereum was briefly pushed to an all-time high of $4,953, underscoring its growing role as a yield-bearing alternative to “digital gold.” However, volatility is likely to remain high for both assets until the federal rate cuts have been clarified, as evidenced by Ethereum already being down 3.89% since yesterday at the time of writing, trading at $4,594. Of course, Bitcoin’s resilience could also be tested by its ability to absorb large-scale whale activity such as that seen over the weekend.

Trading will begin on September 18 at 1 PM UTC, with an initial listing price of $0.10. The debut of $MVRK represents a significant step in Mavryk’s broader vision to bring over $10 billion in RWAs on-chain, and to establish a fully interoperable ecosystem at the intersection of tokenization, decentralized finance (DeFi), and lending. To date, Mavryk has secured notable milestones, including: Funding: Raised $5.2 million from prominent venture capital firms such as Ghaf Capital, Big Brain, and Draper Goren Holm. Partnership with MultiBank Group: Mavryk’s white-label tokenization infrastructure will underpin MultiBank’s upcoming RWA platform for regulated primary and secondary market trading, slated for launch in 2025. $10 Billion Tokenization Agreement: In collaboration with MAG Lifestyle Development and MultiBank, Mavryk will tokenize luxury real estate assets, including Dubai’s Ritz-Carlton Residences and Keturah Reserve. Fireblocks Integration: The platform is now accessible to Fireblocks users, enabling institutions to build customized RWA platforms using Mavryk’s technology. Testnet Activity: Mavryk’s testnet has processed over 110 million transactions, with 2.2 million+ funded wallets and 1.2 million+ smart contracts deployed. Live metrics are available on Mavryk Explorer . The $MVRK token will have a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $100 million and will serve multiple functions within the network: covering gas fees, enabling delegation, powering co-staking (liquid staking), and serving as collateral for lending and borrowing protocols. At the token generation event (TGE), 5.6% of the token supply will be in circulation, while over 45% is allocated for ecosystem growth, staking incentives, and community participation. “Mavryk is pioneering a new chapter for real-world assets where tokenization, DeFi, and lending converge into one seamlessly interoperable economy,” said Alex Davis, Founder & CEO of Mavryk. “The launch of $MVRK sets the stage for a new era of finance; it opens a gateway that removes barriers and unlocks a world of bespoke financial opportunities for investors everywhere.” Upon launch, Mavryk will support features such as delegation and co-staking from day one, offering high APYs aimed at encouraging long-term ecosystem involvement. Its institutional-grade SaaS product, Equiteez, is already white-labeled by MultiBank Group to facilitate compliant tokenized asset trading. Looking ahead, Mavryk aims to scale its on-chain asset portfolio to $40 billion by 2030, expand its ecosystem through strategic partnerships, and deploy a comprehensive DeFi infrastructure. Upcoming features include Mavryk Wallet, Maven Finance, a DEX, perpetual trading, Layer-2 integrations, and mobile interfaces. The roadmap also includes consumer-facing tools such as a tokenized ETF minter and launchpad. For further information on the $MVRK token launch and the Mavryk Network, visit www.mavryk.org .

Analyst Reveals the Hidden Factors,https://cryptopotato.com/why-is-bitcoin-crawling-this-cycle-analyst-reveals-the-hidden-factors/,"Bitcoin’s current upward movement feels unusually slow compared to past cycles. Experts attribute the current sluggishness in the market to the OG whales. Willy Woo, for one, believes this cohort of early investors has slowed BTC’s growth, as the market struggles to absorb their massive profit-taking. Bitcoin’s Sluggish Uptrend In his latest post, prominent on-chain analyst Willy Woo explained that a significant portion of BTC supply is concentrated in the hands of early whales who accumulated heavily around 2011, when Bitcoin was trading at $10 or less. These long-term holders are now sitting on massive unrealized gains, and whenever they sell, the market requires significant new capital inflows – over $110,000 for each BTC – to absorb their sales without driving prices down. This creates resistance in price appreciation, as the market must constantly counterbalance the selling pressure from these original whales, making Bitcoin’s climb slower and more gradual in this cycle. “This differential in cost basis, the supply they hold and their rate of selling has profound impacts on how much new capital that needs to come in to lift price. You can look at this as BTC going through growing pains until these 10,000x gain investors are absorbed.” One major example of this whale activity comes from a Bitcoin OG now moving heavily into Ethereum. Lookonchain’s latest findings revealed a massive move by the whale who originally received 100,784 BTC seven years ago, worth $642 million then and over $11.4 billion on August 25th. In just the past five days, this early holder has been rapidly rotating out of Bitcoin into Ethereum. They deposited around 22,769 BTC, which is around $2.59 billion, to Hyperliquid for sale, and used the proceeds to buy 472,920 ETH ($2.22 billion) on spot markets while simultaneously opening a 135,265 ETH long position worth $577 million. The scale and speed of these transactions indicate aggressive profit-taking on BTC and a strong, highly leveraged bet on Ethereum’s upside. Beyond these structural whale-driven headwinds, short-term volatility also plays a role in Bitcoin’s trajectory, especially during weekends. Structural Weakness Bitcoin’s sharp drop this weekend is not random but a result of structural weaknesses in the market. Weekends typically see thinner liquidity, as both spot and derivatives volumes decline, which leaves order books vulnerable to manipulation by large players, according to CryptoQuant. On-chain data shows that BTC exchange reserves often rise before these weekend dips as sell pressure increases, while excessive long positioning in derivatives creates the conditions for liquidation cascades. At the same time, metrics like SOPR reveal short-term holders taking profits, which further amplifies volatility. As such, these factors form what CryptoQuant calls a “liquidity trap,” where whales exploit weak market conditions to trigger stop-loss clusters and fuel sharp moves.

MUTM Could Be the Top Performer With 2000% Left to Go,https://timestabloid.com/looking-for-the-best-2025-altcoin-mutm-could-be-the-top-performer/,"Every crypto cycle creates a new group of standout projects, and 2025 looks set to be defined by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . With early investors eyeing an upside of 2000%, this project combines real utility, strong presale traction, and high-profile listing potential, giving it the right ingredients to outperform the broader market. In a market shaped by crypto prices, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as more than just speculation—it is building a foundation for long-term adoption. A Lending Protocol With Next-Gen Utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not a token without substance. The project is delivering a decentralized, non-custodial lending ecosystem that supports both P2C (peer-to-contract) and P2P (peer-to-peer) models. In the P2C system, lenders provide liquidity into shared pools, and borrowers can draw from those pools at dynamic interest rates tied to utilization. The P2P option allows direct negotiation of loan terms between individuals, creating flexibility for different needs. This dual-model design is amplified by Layer-2 integration, which will make borrowing and lending faster and cheaper compared to many current DeFi competitors that are still reliant on slower, costlier Layer-1 solutions. With Mutuum Finance (MUTM), investors and users are preparing to engage with a product that is designed for scalability and efficiency from the ground up. The beta launch is expected to arrive at the same time as token listing, a critical advantage that eliminates the common waiting game that usually follows a new token release. From the very beginning, users will be able to deposit bluechip assets, borrow against them, or stake mtTokens in smart contracts to earn rewards in MUTM. This immediate availability of core functions is exactly what sets it apart from many other presale projects that lack tangible application at launch. Another major part of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap is its decentralized stablecoin, created when users borrow against collateral and burned when loans are repaid or liquidated. Governance will manage borrowing rates to help maintain its peg close to $1. This stablecoin will be an additional demand driver, creating constant activity within the ecosystem and giving MUTM a deeper level of real-world utility. Presale Momentum and the Road Ahead Right now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale, with tokens available at just $0.035. Over $14.83 million has been generated already, more than 15,650 holders have joined the community, and 25% of the tokens in this phase are gone. Once Phase 7 begins, the price rises 15%, making this the final window to secure MUTM at its current entry level before the next surge. Confidence in the project is reinforced by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s CertiK audit, which delivered a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78. Add in a $50,000 bug bounty program rewarding severity-based findings, plus a $100,000 giveaway designed to grow awareness, and it’s clear the team has invested in both security and community trust. Looking forward, liquidity and exposure are set to expand dramatically. Expected listings on exchanges such as Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, MEXC, and Kraken will introduce MUTM to a global audience. These listings, combined with the project’s buy-and-distribute mechanism where lending and borrowing revenue is used to purchase MUTM from the open market and distribute to stakers, are powerful catalysts for long-term demand. Final Words When looking at crypto charts and past cycles, the lesson is clear: the largest returns have always gone to those willing to step into projects before they break into the mainstream. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned to be one of those rare opportunities. While crypto crash narratives dominate headlines, seasoned investors know that every downturn also sets the stage for the next explosive wave. In the world of crypto predictions, MUTM is already separating itself from the pack by offering both security and real utility while still in its presale stage. As 2025 approaches, the race to find the best-performing altcoin is intensifying. With a working beta expected at listing, Layer-2 scalability, a decentralized stablecoin, and high-visibility exchange listings on the horizon, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is aligning all the right factors. The presale is nearing the halfway mark, and once the window closes, latecomers risk watching from the sidelines as early buyers reap the rewards of one of the most promising projects of the year.

Rising leverage and debt-driven corporate buying introduce fragility, making the ecosystem vulnerable to cascading liquidations if prices slip. Quantum computing poses a real, near-term threat to Bitcoin's security, with protocol upgrades likely to be logistically and technically challenging. At $114k, remaining upside is limited and risks are underappreciated; I'd rather forgo more gains than risk a sharp drawdown at these levels. Co-Authored by Noah Cox and Brock Heilig Investment Thesis I am lowering my rating on iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) from a strong buy to a hold. A big reason for this double downgrade is because of the fact that Bitcoin’s price has already surged roughly 600% from its cycle low of ~$16k to about $114k, which validated much of my earlier bull case. It’s clear to me that most tailwinds I previously identified - rapid money supply expansion, favorable U.S. policy, and growing institutional adoption - have materialized and now appear fully baked into Bitcoin’s valuation. In my last article , I projected a price target of $148k for Bitcoin, assuming another 50-100% upside. At $114k, I believe those catalysts have largely run their course (while not pushing the price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency to the level I had hoped for). I’ve also noticed that global liquidity conditions, which once propelled Bitcoin, are beginning to shift (Bitcoin’s price is no longer tracking as closely with the increase in the M2 money supply). On top of this, there appears to be growing leverage within the Bitcoin ecosystem, especially debt-driven corporate purchases, which I believe introduces fragility for Bitcoin. Bitcoin has been in a 4 year boom-bust cycle basically since its inception. My fear is that we are at the peak of this cycle. Normally, the adage for Bitcoin would be to hold till the next bull run. My fear is that this might be the last bull run. Technological threats like quantum computing were not central to my prior thesis, but they now cast a really longer-term shadow over Bitcoin’s core security. When we take into account all of these factors, it means that at $114k per Bitcoin, investors face significant downside if conditions deteriorate. With this, shares are double downgraded from a strong buy to a hold. Why I’m Doing Follow-Up Coverage The biggest reason for my follow-up coverage of IBIT is because of what I think are red flags that have risen since the last time I wrote on the Bitcoin ETF. The market has shifted from predominantly spot-driven accumulation to heavy debt-funded buying from treasury companies, which changes the risk profile. On-chain data also suggests that a price slip could trigger cascading liquidations, unlike the earlier, more organic demand phase. Another red flag I’ve seen come about is that companies are betting the balance sheet. Public firms like GameStop, MicroStrategy, Bit Digital, and Block have increasingly financed Bitcoin purchases via debt. For example, GameStop’s $1.3 billion convertible bond issuance in March was a big sign of euphoria, prompting a 25% drop in the company’s stock once risks became clear. My previous article was contingent on the thesis that there were assumed strategic, unlevered Treasury allocations, not this level of corporate speculation. The shift from organic to leveraged demand means the easy money from holding Bitcoin (and by extension IBIT) has been made and that further gains would come on borrowed capital and potentially borrowed time. Leveraged Risk One of the best-case studies in Bitcoin’s risk is MicroStrategy. The company holds over 600,000 Bitcoin - which is nearly 3% of the total supply. This Bitcoin is financed by roughly tranches of convertible bonds and preferred shares that now pay cash dividends . I wrote about this with Strategy ( MSTR ) but this does not feel sustainable. This financing has set MicroStrategy up with more than $8 billion in debt and interest obligations that hinge on Bitcoin’s price remaining elevated. While shareholders enjoyed ~167% stock gains as Bitcoin rose, a downturn could really hurt the company and trigger a forced sell-off, risking broader market contagion. It’s true that none of the Bitcoin that Strategy in particular is secured to debt, but at the end of the day, if any of their obligations default (such as a convertible bond or preferred stock preferred dividends), that could become a cascading issue. Marathon Digital ( MARA ) is a different story. Marathon and other miners took high-interest loans secured by Bitcoin or mining rigs to expand operations. Because of this, a meaningful Bitcoin decline could lead to distressed collateral sales. In bull markets, leverage acts like rocket fuel. In bear markets, it becomes gasoline on a fire. Quantum Hacking Problems Quantum hacking is starting to become a huge threat to Bitcoin’s cryptography. Bitcoin relies on the ECDSA (elliptic curve digital signature) algorithm, which conventional computers cannot break (requiring ~ 2^128 operations ). However, a powerful quantum computer running Shor’s algorithm could solve this in polynomial time (exponentially less time than a classical computer). This means they can derive private keys from public keys within minutes. Once a Bitcoin address’ public key is revealed, I believe a quantum owned by an attacker will compute the private key and steal funds. This would be devastating for the cryptocurrency. My concern looks like it will be real. There have been recent warnings that quantum computing breakthroughs may arrive sooner rather than later. In May, Dr. Elena Orlova (researcher at Google) suggested error-corrected qubits capable of breaking ECDSA could appear some time between 2027 and 2030 - years earlier than prior forecasts. The implication is that the Bitcoin ecosystem may need to transition to quantum-resistant algorithms within the next 5-7 years, not decades. This would also show up just as Bitcoin starts its next bull run cycle. This could kill the next bull run. With no new bull run, there is really no long-term reason to own Bitcoin. Even if we don’t talk about quantum brute force hacking the whole blockchain, core legacy Bitcoin wallets are often vulnerable. Estimates suggest that over 60% of Bitcoin resides in vulnerable addresses from legacy addresses. When quantum computers reach critical capability, attackers could (and will) empty wallets using pure mathematics, undermining trust in the network. These wallets will have to be upgraded. This is the core problem. Defending against these quantum attacks requires a fundamental protocol upgrade. Really, this will be a logistical nightmare (coordinating updates across miners, exchanges, wallets, etc.) There are also technical trade-offs, a timing dilemma, or really (because let's face it) hard fork implications. Think about Satoshi Nakamoto’s wallet. Even the mysterious founder’s wallet is exposed since it used the older “ pay-to-pubkey ” architecture that exposed the wallet's public key during transactions. This could be one of the biggest forks in the history of Bitcoin. I really don’t think this will go well. Some proposals indicate that there is a huge chunk of the blockchain that will have to be essentially frozen so that quantum computers don’t hack these wallets and dump this Bitcoin on the open market. Valuation I believe Bitcoin's recent range of $112k to $124k in recent weeks represents euphoria, which is roughly 7-8x above the bear-market low of $16k. At $114k, Bitcoin’s market cap is about $2.4 trillion . It's one of the top 10 largest assets on the planet. Historical cycles show post-peak drawdowns of 70-80%. Treasury companies could be the catalyst that kicks off that downside. Bitcoin’s price is closely tied to the global M2 money supply. While M2 surged through 2024 and 2025, forecasts project a global liquidity peak by mid-2026 . As of today, in mid-2025, I think the easiest liquidity-driven gains are behind us. Any pivot toward liquidity tightening will be bad news for Bitcoin. I also think cycle timing will play a big factor here. Each halving is a known catalyst to drive Bitcoin's price upward. Historically, peaks occur about 12-18 months post-halving. As of the time of this writing, we are about 16 months past the halving. Without a fresh fundamental catalyst, the odds favor a plateau or a pullback. As I mentioned earlier in this article, my former Bitcoin price projection was $148k. However, at this point, a run from ~$114k to $148k (~29.8% further upside) would require either a liquidity surge or a new narrative drawing sidelined capital. With this, I view ~$124k as a de facto ceiling for Bitcoin in this cycle, barring any major developments. Since I am a hold, I don’t know what the fair value of Bitcoin is at this point. I don’t think the remaining upside potential is worth it. Bull Thesis A quick note on the Bitcoin community’s main counter point. Bitcoin enthusiasts all the way up to Strategy’s own Michael Saylor state that the core financial system will be faced with these same quantum threats. Their core logic is the following: Legacy finance will face the same quantum threats we will…. …so why are we singled out? The key difference between Bitcoin and legacy finance: legacy finance is regulated and centralized, which makes upgrades to cryptography related to quantum easier. Already key cybersecurity agencies like NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) have identified Post Quantum Algorithms for widespread usage to upgrade legacy IT networks in banking, Web 2 internet, etc. On top of this, many post quantum encryption methods are more bandwidth intensive to encrypt each packet of data. Some estimates indicate that this could mean up to 10x more bandwidth is needed. In a centralized network, this is manageable (but costly). On the Bitcoin side? Decentralized and unregulated. You can’t force anyone to comply with quantum upgrades. On top of this, each node in the Bitcoin network will need to upgrade its hardware to handle post-quantum bandwidth needs. That’s a big ask. I don’t know if the blockchain will survive. Takeaway While Bitcoin has had an incredible run, I am double downgrading my stance on IBIT from a strong buy to a hold. I believe that the easy gains have been booked, and the balance of factors is now really net neutral (or even cautious). At $114k per Bitcoin, chasing the rally from here is risky. Much of the bull case is already baked in, and I think rising risks are underappreciated. Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals remain intact only if they can figure out how to perfect encryption against quantum. Perfect timing of a cycle top is nearly impossible. There is a chance Bitcoin could spike to $130k before reversing course yet again. This hold rating means I’m not trying to time the top, but I am recognizing the fact that the number of risks is growing. In the end, at these levels, I’d rather forgo some upside than risk getting caught in a sudden drop.",MSTR|MARA|STRC|STRF|STRK|IBIT|IBIT:CA,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|FORKS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-25 10:00:31

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Even though Bitcoin surged nearly 4% after Powell’s encouraging speech last Friday, where he hinted at a possible September rate cut, the token has since lost all of those gains (and then some), continuing its short-term bearish trend. That said, Bitcoin is now testing support at the 100 EMA, which has prompted investors to start ‘buying the dip.’ Why? Because the last time $BTC touched the 100 EMA – on June 22 – it went on to rally more than 25% in just a couple of weeks, hitting fresh all-time highs. Even better, the current price level also aligns with a major support area for Bitcoin. The last time $BTC traded in this region, it rallied over 11%. And a similar move this time around could once again propel Bitcoin into uncharted territory, aka new ATHs. Strategy’s Michael Saylor Eyes More Bitcoin in August, Hyping Up Bitcoin Hyper’s $12M Presale August 25, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Michael Saylor hinted at a new Bitcoin purchase in a suggestive X post , with the simple message of ‘Bitcoin is on sale.’ Strategy already bought Bitcoin twice this August , for a total investment of $69M, bringing its reserves at 629,376 $BTC, worth over $73B. A third purchase would send a strong buy signal, rallying the market and pushing Bitcoin Hyper to even higher numbers. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is Bitcoin’s Layer 2 upgrade that promises faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions with the help of tools like the Canonical Bridge. The presale is getting ready to break $12M. You can learn how to buy $HYPER right here. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee: Bull Cycle Just Getting Started as Bitcoin Hyper Presale Nears $12M August 25, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Tom Lee believes that the bull cycle hasn’t even started yet in 2025. He bases his assessment on data showing that 82% of people hold no cryptos in 2025. Only 12% of people have declared to own Bitcoin, in free-fall since 2023’s 53%. This shows that, on the one hand, the interest for Bitcoin has shifted from retail to institutional. On the other hand, people haven’t started buying yet, which means we haven’t entered the bull zone yet. When that happens, Bitcoin will start pushing again, with projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) breaking through another presale milestone. $HYPER’s presale is now nearing the $12M mark, following a surge in investor interest over the past two months.

In 2025, Dogecoin stands shoulder-to-shoulder next to Bitcoin. One is the first cryptocurrency, while our doggo friend is widely recognized as the first meme coin. Launched in 2013, $DOGE is up by over 38,000% today, looking at a price of over $0.21 and a trading volume in the billions of dollars. If anything, Dogecoin proves that ‘anything is possible’ in crypto, and even underdogs can become industry giants. With endorsements from industry moguls like Elon Musk and official investment vehicles like the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, $DOGE seems to be going nowhere but up.

Today’s Dogecoin Technical Analysis Dogecoin, like most major cryptos, reacted positively to Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s Friday speech, which sparked fresh optimism in the market after he hinted at a potential September rate cut. $DOGE rallied nearly 12% on the day, bouncing right off a critical technical level – the 50% Fibonacci retracement on the weekly chart. This confluence shows how Dogecoin’s technical strength is starting to align with the broader bullish sentiment in crypto, creating the perfect recipe for the top meme coin to push higher. Adding to the optimism, the 10, 20, and 50 EMAs on the weekly chart are fanning out while staying stacked in bullish order, hinting that the next leg up may be just around the corner. That said, confirmation will depend on the current weekly candle closing above the 20 EMA at the very least. If it fails to do so, $DOGE may face another 10-14 days of sideways or bearish action before attempting another breakout. From Meme to Mechanism: Dogecoin’s Shift and Maxi Doge’s Ascent August 25, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Dogecoin’s proposed pivot to a hybrid proof-of-stake (PoS) model via Project Sakura signals a major shift from mere meme coin to scalable payment infrastructure. With projected 1,000x throughput and reduced attack risks, the idea has institutional interest in Dogecoin surging, backed by $500M in treasury inflows and live testing on Dogebox. Cue Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , a fit-for-purpose Doge-themed ERC-20 token built using Ethereum’s energy-efficient PoS model. Its presale has raised $1.53M, with tokens priced at a low $0.000254, offering a low-cap, faster alternative for investors seeking upside without legacy PoW baggage. As Dogecoin evolves, Maxi Doge is steps ahead with a flexible protocol already aligned with future energy-efficient consensus models. Find out how to buy Maxi Doge. As Dogecoin Pumps 11% in August, $MAXI Presale Crosses $1.5M August 25, 2025 • 10:00 UTC In a bullish turn for the meme coin market, whale accumulation has driven Dogecoin’s price up by 10–11% in August, signaling renewed investor confidence. As Dogecoin inches closer to the $0.25 breakout zone, traders are eyeing the next high-leverage opportunity, and Maxi Doge is stealing the spotlight. Maxi Doge is designed for ultra-high-risk, high-reward trading: no stop loss, no exit plan, just full send. With over $1.52M already raised, $MAXI is priced at just $0.000254; but the countdown is on, with just two days left before the next price hike.

50648170,https://timestabloid.com/?p=80057,1756116174,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst: Everyone Is Wrong About XRP. The Truth They’re Not Showing You,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-everyone-is-wrong-about-xrp-the-truth-theyre-not-showing-you/,"In his latest YouTube commentary, crypto analyst StephIsCrypto shared his perspective on the current state of the XRP market, highlighting both encouraging signs and potential risks. He began by pointing to on-chain data showing a significant accumulation of XRP by large holders. Specifically, wallets containing between 10 million and 100 million XRP have been steadily increasing their positions over the past week. He described this as substantial investment activity, distinct from retail buying, and argued that historically such accumulation has preceded strong rallies. Based on this data, he expressed optimism for further short-term upward price movement and indicated that he would provide clear price targets for XRP in the near term. Market Cycles and Historical Patterns StephIsCrypto then shifted his focus to broader market cycles, comparing XRP’s chart with Bitcoin’s halving cycle indicator. He noted that each previous bull market top in the cryptocurrency space has aligned with Bitcoin’s halving cycle windows, including the 2017–2018 and 2020–2021 rallies. According to his analysis, the current cycle also falls within such a window, suggesting that the peak of this market could arrive between October and November 2025. While acknowledging arguments that fundamentals such as utility, institutional adoption, and potential ETF approvals could change historical dynamics, he cautioned against dismissing market cycles. In his view, ignoring past data could be risky, as cryptocurrencies have consistently demonstrated cyclical behavior. Indicators of Market Risk The analyst also discussed signals that suggest caution may be warranted. He highlighted that more than 90 percent of XRP holders are currently in profit, which historically has preceded market tops. He referenced the stochastic RSI indicator on the monthly chart, pointing out that in previous cycles it peaked ahead of the price, which then made a higher high while the indicator showed a lower high, forming a bearish divergence. According to him, this pattern appeared in 2017 and 2020, both of which preceded major corrections. He suggested that a similar setup could now be forming, with the stochastic having peaked months ago while the price continues to climb. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Price Targets and Timing Turning to specific price expectations, StephIsCrypto stated that on the weekly timeframe, XRP has followed a clear five-wave structure to the upside. He argued that the structure may not be complete and that another push higher could still occur in the coming weeks. He placed possible targets around $4 to $5, while emphasizing that reaching those levels would require close monitoring of indicators, on-chain metrics, and whale activity. He also noted that bearish divergence has already been confirmed on the MACD momentum indicator, which he believes signals that the market may be nearing a critical point. He further observed that the duration of the current cycle already resembles previous XRP bull runs , which lasted between 365 and 396 days. With the ongoing rally now extending beyond 400 days, he suggested that the market could be approaching the timing typically associated with major cycle peaks. While not declaring a definitive top, he underscored the importance of risk management, advising traders and investors to remain cautious of signs of a reversal.

Lookonchain shared two screenshots of the hacker’s transactions on X Sunday, which showed that they used DAI to purchase USDC, bridged funds to the Solana network, and bought 38,126 SOL tokens at an average price near $209. The purchase was valued at roughly $7.95 million, but has already declined by over $200k in value, as Solana trades around $200 at the time of this publication. Coinbase attackers buy Solana months after adding Ether holdings Just two months ago, the hackers offloaded 26,762 Ether for about $69.25 million, a trade that Lookonchain had spotted and linked to the alleged Coinbase exploit. The hacker who stole $300M+ from #Coinbase users bought 38,126 $SOL ($7.95M) at $209 in the past 2 hours. https://t.co/AUBIKUuNND https://t.co/s9rRYnK7M8 https://t.co/GlDgWxZ5T2 pic.twitter.com/AIc0hLEpxQ — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 24, 2025 The blockchain transaction monitoring platform tracked at least two purchases of Ethereum from the same address. On July 7, the wallet acquired 4,863 ETH for approximately $12.55 million at an average price of $2,581. Less than two weeks later, on July 19, it added another 649 ETH for $2.3 million, paying an average of $3,562 per token. Data shared by Arkham on Sunday shows transactions of more than $3.3 million in USDC routed through deBridge Finance and swaps executed via CoW Protocol. In total, transfers over the past 48 hours include single trades ranging from $500,000 to over $3 million, often split between DAI and USDC. As reported by Cryptopolitan, blockchain investigator ZachXBT estimated in May that the total losses tied to the event reached $330 million. Around 97,000 Coinbase accounts were affected after hackers bribed external contractors and offshore support staff to access sensitive personal information. According to ZachXBT, the attack wasn’t a conventional cyber intrusion that exploits back-end vulnerabilities, but the perpetrators were in direct communication with Coinbase employees and rogue insiders. After the community went into panic mode when Coinbase announced there was a breach on May 15, the exchange insisted that login credentials were not compromised, but names, email addresses, and other personal details were exposed. Moreover, CEO Brian Armstrong shared a letter from the attackers demanding a $20 million ransom, which the company reportedly refused. Crypto firms fight off social engineering attacks Coinbase is among several crypto businesses that have suffered losses from data breaches in the last 3 years. In 2022, digital bank Revolut confirmed the theft of 50,000 sets of customer data. One year later, Robinhood reported a breach exposing up to 5 million email addresses. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fined Robinhood $45 million for securities violations, including $2 million related to the data leak. Per the BBC, a Revolut customer lost £165,000 (about $220,000) in 2023 following the breach, while the bank’s internal systems prevented £475 million in fraudulent activity. Radiant Capital, a cross-chain lending protocol, was breached in mid-October 2024, when attackers drained $58 million from its deployments on BNB Chain and Arbitrum. Last Wednesday, a crypto wallet linked to the exploit purchased 4,913 Ether before selling 4,131 Ether on Saturday, securing a profit of $2.7 million. Lookonchain noted on X that the hacker’s original $49.5 million haul has now grown to more than $105 million, an increase of roughly 114%. Proceeds from the attack were initially swapped into Ether, with the breacher holding around 21,957 ETH valued at approximately $103 million as of August 14. Binance and Kraken have confirmed several attempts by hackers in 2025 using similar social engineering tactics, but they supposedly repelled the efforts without losses.

Scarce assets bring focus. They also create a sense of permanence in an environment where everything else can feel volatile or uncertain. By building bridges between established frameworks and new asset classes, we can support a broader, more inclusive definition of investing — one that reflects the full spectrum of value in a changing world. As Millennials and Gen Z face barriers to traditional wealth building, they’re embracing crypto and collectibles, finding value in scarcity, digital ownership, and cultural significance. We’re watching a quiet shift unfold in the financial world. It’s not driven by policy changes or institutional mandates, but by how younger generations are rethinking the role of money, ownership, and value. Millennials and Gen Z are entering an economy where many of the traditional paths to building wealth don’t feel as accessible as they once were. Real estate is out of reach for many. Public markets feel increasingly abstract or dominated by large institutions. And inflation, while rarely headline news anymore, continues to chip away at purchasing power in a way that’s hard to ignore. That doesn’t mean this generation is disengaging from the markets. It just means they’re looking for alternative options. Among the more interesting trends are two areas that might seem unrelated at first: crypto and collectibles. They share something important. Both rely on scarcity, carry strong cultural meaning, and offer a level of ownership that feels more direct and personal. Wealth on Their Own Terms It’s not that younger investors are anti-finance. They’re just playing a different game based on the hand they’ve been dealt. For many, wage growth hasn’t kept up with asset prices. Buying a home, especially in major cities, has become far more difficult. Private investment opportunities are still limited to accredited investors. And even with index funds or ETFs, the market often feels distant or detached from real life. So the shift we’re seeing is practical. People are looking for assets that are easier to access, more transparent, and better aligned with how they live and operate day to day. That’s what makes crypto and collectibles so appealing. They offer flexibility, portability, and, in many cases, they live in the same digital environments that these generations already spend most of their time in. Scarcity Continues to be a Signal of Value Scarcity has always been part of the investing story. It’s what gives value to fine art, rare wine, or classic cars. What’s different now is how younger investors are applying that same thinking to a broader mix of assets. A limited-edition trading card, a pair of collectible sneakers, or a fixed-supply token offers something you can’t easily replicate. It stands in contrast to a world that feels increasingly saturated — whether it’s liquidity, data, or content. Scarce assets bring focus. They also create a sense of permanence in an environment where everything else can feel volatile or uncertain. Blending Digital Scarcity and Physical Ownership Blockchain technology made something possible that didn’t really exist before. For the first time, you could verify ownership of a digital item without needing a third party to vouch for it. That simple shift opened the door to all kinds of possibilities. Suddenly, a digital item could be treated like a physical collectible, with transparent provenance, fixed supply, and access to global markets. We’ve seen this play out in multiple ways: NFT IP Expansion : Pudgy Penguins , which began as a profile picture (PFP) NFT project, has grown into a full-fledged IP powerhouse — expanding into toys, licensing deals, and mainstream culture. It shows how digital-native communities can evolve into brands with staying power. Luca Schnetzler, Pudgy Penguin CEO, speaking at VanEck’s Web3 Takeover event. “Phygital” Collectibles : Companies like Orange Cap Games have taken Pudgy IP as one example, a step further by creating a trading card game that bridges physical and digital. It’s not just a product; it’s a new kind of collectible experience, where ownership, gameplay, and blockchain verification all intersect. VanEck Promo Card from Orange Cap Games. Tokenized Assets : Beyond IP, tokenized real-world assets now allow people to invest in trading cards, watches, or art without needing to physically custody them. NFTs tied to tangible goods provide built-in authenticity and ownership tracking. Digital scarcity doesn’t replace physical ownership. It expands what’s possible, creating hybrid experiences that are both cultural and investable. Assets Represent More Than Financial Value What’s often overlooked in these conversations is that crypto and collectibles also carry cultural weight. A rare card or a unique NFT can say something about who you are, what you value, or the communities you belong to. A wallet can function as both a portfolio and a social signal. That might feel unusual from a traditional finance perspective, but it’s second nature to people who grew up online. Value isn’t only measured in return on capital. It’s also about meaning, relevance, and participation. Acknowledging Risks, Yet Advancing Forward Like any nascent market, there are risks. Volatility, fraud, and speculation are all part of the landscape. Not all platforms are equal, and not every project is built to last. But that doesn’t mean the space isn’t evolving. We’re seeing real progress in areas like custody, compliance, authentication, and regulation. Professional infrastructure is starting to support these markets in a more serious way. It’s easy to focus on the noise, but beneath it is a clear signal. There is genuine demand for assets that blend scarcity, utility, and cultural relevance. That demand is unlikely to fade anytime soon. Traditional Finance’s Role in a Changing Market At VanEck, we see this trend as an opportunity, not a challenge. Potentially in the future, it could be interesting to help connect investors to the assets and strategies they care about, with the same level of trust and infrastructure they’ve come to expect from traditional financial markets. There’s a generation coming up that wants access to scarce, verifiable, globally tradable assets. They want ownership models that reflect how they live, communicate, and build. They are not abandoning the financial system. They’re just choosing to engage with it on their terms. That’s why we’ve begun experimenting in this space ourselves: SegMint: Originally launched as a collectibles marketplace, SegMint is now being developed into a backend infrastructure project designed to power the tokenization, authentication, and trading of real-world collectibles. Social Collectibles App (coming early 2026): On the consumer side, we’re building a social-first platform where collectors can scan, showcase, and trade their items more seamlessly — with digital binders, trade matching, and community features that make collecting more connected and rewarding. By building bridges between established frameworks and new asset classes, we can support a broader, more inclusive definition of investing — one that reflects the full spectrum of value in a changing world.

Google’s new AI mode extends the function of its AI Overviews — summaries that often remove the need to click into source pages. 50% of media firms saw a drop in search-driven traffic Immediate Media’s chief executive, Sean Cornwell, admitted that AI Overviews have already taken a toll on his company, reflecting a worry shared across the industry. He warned that AI is advancing quickly and thus believes drop-offs will only accelerate in the next few years. Enders and the Professional Publishers Association disclosed that media companies were deprived of visibility and value in May, as their content is used without fair compensation . Per its report, roughly half of media firms had seen a drop in search-driven traffic over the past year. It further attributed AI Overviews to cutting into publishers’ traffic, noting that 80% of users rely on “zero-click searches” for at least two out of every five queries. According to recent research by Pew and Authoritas, Google users clicked on fewer links when AI summaries were present in search results. The tech giant, however, responded by criticizing the studies, saying they were based on “fundamental flaws” in methodology. Another survey conducted by Digital Content Next, the US media industry group, showed that in May and June, median referral traffic from Google Search to premium publishers had declined by 10% compared with the corresponding period last year. Moreover, according to Sajeeda Merali, chief executive of the Professional Publishers Association, some publishers that count on Google to drive readers to their content have already seen a decline in UK “click-throughs” since the arrival of AI Overviews. Merali also argued that AI Mode and Overviews are absorbing some of the traffic lifestyle publishers once drew from guidance-driven content — for example, recommendations or gardening tips. According to the PPA, one automotive publisher saw a 25% fall in traffic to first-ranked articles, despite enjoying a 7% gain in search visibility. She remarked, “Given the tool is offering fewer links, I think that can only be a bad thing [for publishers]. AI Mode is just an extension of the problem.” Nonetheless, People Inc. chief executive Neil Vogel, who heads America’s biggest digital and print publisher, described “Google Zero” as the company’s guiding strategy in shaping future plans for how readers will reach its journalism. He further noted that Google search referrals had been declining for years, falling from about 65% to close to 30% of traffic even before the launch of AI Overviews and AI Mode. Google stated that cumulative organic clicks from Search have remained stable According to participants, Google told publishers in a July meeting that search referrals from AI Overview pages were “higher quality,” since those users typically spent more time on-site. Then again, this month, the tech giant claimed that total organic clicks from Search have held steady over the past year, with users showing deeper engagement. Liz Reid, head of Google Search, commented, “While overall traffic to sites is relatively stable, the web is vast, and user trends are shifting traffic to different sites, resulting in decreased traffic to some sites and increased traffic to others.” Nonetheless, publishers are preparing for a future less dependent on Google, whatever the eventual impact of Overviews and AI Mode. Piers North, who leads Reach, told reporters that change is underway in how search traffic operates. He said his company is conscious of the need to adapt to “Google Zero,” or a future that contrasts sharply with the search-centric system that has shaped online content for the last 25 years.

The firm’s crypto stash has grown to over $8 billion, placing it in second position, trailing only Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which holds $71 billion in BTC. The company’s press release , shared earlier today, reads that its crypto + cash holdings have skyrocketed to $8.82 billion. However, these calculations were made from yesterday’s prices, which were higher than the current market valuations following the Sunday evening crash . BitMine now holds almost 1,714,000 ETH, 192 BTC, and “unencumbered cash of $562 million.” As such, the firm remains the world’s largest Ethereum treasury entity. It launched its strategy in late June this year and has a substantial lead over SharpLink, which is the second in the Ethereum chain with over 740,750 ETH in its bags. BitMine had a big last week, as the PR reads about a massive purchase of $2.2 billion worth of ETH and other cash holdings. This meant that it had added 190,500 ETH to bring its total to the current 1,713,899, while the remaining is still cash. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, who is also BitMine’s Chairman and has made some massive ETH price predictions in the past, said the following: “We continue to believe Ethereum is one of the biggest macro trades over the next 10-15 years. Wall Street and AI moving onto the blockchain should lead to a greater transformation of today’s financial system. And the majority of this is taking place on Ethereum.” ETH’s price jumped to a new all-time high of roughly $4,950 yesterday, but the market-wide crash drove it south by $400. Still, the asset is up by over 25% since the start of August.

Held at Nuanu Creative City, Bali, on August 21-22, Coinfest Asia 2025 welcomed over 10,000 attendees from more than 90 countries, making it one of the largest blockchain gatherings in Asia and beyond. During the event, CoinW presented its investment product ecosystem offline for the first time, featuring key products such as PropW, GemW, DeriW, and WConnect. The showcase provided participants with an overview of CoinW’s product portfolio and strategic priorities, highlighting its approach to developing diversified financial services.

Representing CoinW as a speaker was its Chief Strategy Officer, Nassar Ackchar. On the event’s second day, he was invited to join the “Behind the Pump: The Stack That Moves Money” panel discussion. The insightful dialogue was moderated by event organizer Indonesia Crypto Network’s Head of Partnerships, Stanley Suhadi. Nassar Ackchar said, “Users in emerging markets are increasingly treating stablecoins as a parallel financial system—using them for remittances, savings, and even everyday payments—and that demand is showing up in our volumes.” Coinfest, themed “Full Moon,” symbolizes a new dawn for Web3 technologies emerging into mainstream adoption. This made it the perfect platform for CoinW to share its vision of innovation and collaboration in the crypto industry. The event offered CoinW an exceptional opportunity to engage with industry leaders and the broader blockchain community while reinforcing Indonesia’s tokenization potential in the digital economy.

The move represents a 2% daily loss and extends a 1% decline on the week, with the token now down more than 7% over the past month. XRP 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold The pullback highlights a sharp reversal in sentiment. Despite growing optimism around a potential spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) and lingering momentum from Ripple’s legal victory in August, price action has failed to sustain. Instead, traders are confronting the reality of fading catalysts, profit-taking, and unresolved regulatory questions. XRP price market data Market data shows that XRP underperformed the broader crypto market’s 2.88% decline over the past 24 hours, falling 2.36% during the same window. Analysts attribute the weakness to three overlapping drivers: heavy profit-taking after the initial ETF filing buzz, technical rejection at the $3.06 resistance zone, and whale distribution flows exceeding $90 million in recent days. Regulatory developments have only added to the uncertainty. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed decisions on seven XRP ETF applications until October 2025. While the Ripple-SEC case dismissal in August removed a major legal overhang, the extended timeline for ETF approval has created a “sell the news” effect. Without the immediate prospect of institutional inflows, estimated between $4.3 billion and $8.4 billion, the bullish narrative has been pushed further out. XRP technical analysis Technically, XRP’s rejection at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level ($3.06) from its July high of $3.38 to its August low of $2.75 has deepened bearish momentum. Indicators confirm the breakdown: the MACD histogram at –0.0199 signals accelerating downside pressure, while failure to hold above $3 suggests weak conviction among bulls. Analysts are now eyeing $2.99 as the next key support at the 61.8% Fib retracement, just 2.3% below current levels. Looking ahead, traders will be closely watching the SEC’s commentary at the Digital Asset Summit (September 9–11) for hints of regulatory direction. Until then, XRP’s trajectory remains vulnerable to further volatility, with short-term sentiment skewed bearish despite long-term optimism over ETF approval and institutional adoption.

Based on a recent post on X, Schwartz signaled a development that could soon move beyond testing and into production. To accompany his update, he shared performance charts that provide a glimpse into how the system has been running in the past few days. Ripple CTO Prepares XRPL Hub For Production David Schwartz revealed on the social media platform X that the XRPL Hub server he has been testing is close to being ready for production. Schwartz explained that the past three days of performance have been encouraging, and stability levels are now high enough for the hub to be considered for wider rollout next week. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Says Next Project Is ‘Production Ready’, What Is It? Schwartz had previously revealed his plans to create a high-performance hub that sets aside special connection slots for UNL validators, important nodes, and servers that run XRPL-based applications. The hub is designed to strengthen XRPL’s connectivity by improving reliability for peers and validators, while also providing developers with a consistent gateway into the network. In his update, Schwartz noted that the server has been stable since its restart five days ago. According to the metrics he shared, the hub has been maintaining a peer count that has steadily increased from around 300 connections earlier in the week to over 357 peers at the most recent check. This consistency indicates that the server is successfully handling traffic across the XRPL ecosystem. What’s Next For The Hub? Schwartz noted that the system had shown strong performance over the last three days, enough for him to consider transitioning it into production as early as next week. However, the monitoring data showed occasional latency spikes, which Schwartz linked to higher outbound bandwidth usage. These spikes did not occur every time bandwidth rose, and this makes the pattern somewhat puzzling but not alarming. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Says XRP Ledger Has Been Battle-Tested To Power World’s Financial System On the other hand, latency stayed well below levels that would impact real-world performance, with the 10% latency line never exceeding 33 milliseconds since the restart. The broader latency averages are comfortably within acceptable ranges. Even at peaks, the bandwidth usage is within safe capacity. Peer disconnections, which saw spikes earlier in the week, have since normalized to an average around 17 per interval. Together, these metrics underline that the system is stable and capable of supporting a wider role within the XRPL ecosystem as Schwartz prepares for the next stage. Reactions to Schwartz’s update on X show that the XRPL community is closely tracking the hub’s development, and many XRP enthusiasts have welcomed the prospect of a production-ready rollout. If all goes well, Schwartz should be able to give a definitive update regarding production next week. Schwartz had clarified that this hub is a personal project he has been building independently, separate from his work as CTO at Ripple.

They warn that the blockchain-based products pose fresh risks to investors. In a letter sent to the US SEC’s Crypto Task Force, the European Securities and Markets Authority, and IOSCO’s Fintech Task Force, the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) urged policymakers to tighten oversight over such stocks. This comes in as SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, in June, stressed that tokenized securities remain subject to existing securities law. However, the crypto market is still in its early stages of gaining regulatory clarity globally. WFE flags tokenized stock risks “We are alarmed at the plethora of brokers and crypto-trading platforms offering or intending to offer so-called tokenized U.S. stocks,” wrote WFE. It is noted that many of the tokezised stocks are being marketed as near-equivalents to equities when in reality they are not. Meanwhile, the group declined to single out firms by name. Robinhood this summer began offering tokenized equities in Europe. Coinbase is seeking permission to launch similar products in the US. They argue that stock coins will slash costs, draw new users, and cut trading frictions. On the other side, the WFE believes that these products mimic the look of shares without conferring the same rights or safeguards. It added that issuers of the underlying stocks could suffer reputational damage if the tokens fail, the report mentions. Crypto Mom cautions while Coinbase goes all-in In June, the US crypto task force Peirce had stated that “Tokenised securities are still securities.” She asked the market participants to comply with federal rules when issuing or trading them. While her remarks are not formal SEC policy, her influence at the agency gives them weight. Known as “Crypto mom,” she was appointed during President Trump’s first administration. The return of Donald Trump to the White House had already sent the digital assets market booming. The cumulative crypto market cap breached the $4 trillion mark as Bitcoin (BTC) went on to register its fresh all-time high of above $124k. Even Ethereum posted its new ATH , closing in on $5,000. Ethereum has managed to outclass Bitcoin in this cycle. ETH price surged by more than 77% over the last 90 days, while it’s running up by 18% on a YTD basis. BTC, which led the market in the first quarter, grew by just 2% over the last 90 days and is up by 18% on YTD. Amid all the proceedings, Coinbase confirmed last month it is working on an expansion of its core trading app into what it calls an “everything exchange.” It aims to bring all assets, including stocks, derivatives, real-world tokens, prediction markets, and even early-stage token sales, on-chain. This puts Coinbase directly against Robinhood, Gemini, and Kraken, all of which are experimenting with tokenized equities abroad.

The world’s first crypto is starting to act a lot more grown-up. The crazy price swings that it was famous for are now a thing of the past. For years, Bitcoin’s wild price fluctuations scared potential investors. But it now seems less jumpy than a big tech stock. According to recent data, Bitcoin’s volatility has been lower than even Wall Street giants like Nvidia since 2022. This shift shows a big change in how the market sees Bitcoin. Popular crypto analyst Lyn Alden even thinks this current bull run will be ‘less extreme’ and last longer. We might see more steady climbs and periods of instability instead of the usual ‘to the moon and then crash’ pattern, she explains in a recent interview for CryptoSlate. Bitcoin is finally settling down and acting like a legitimate financial asset. This maturity will see projects upscaling the OG digital asset, like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , get more attention from investors looking to diversify. Why Bitcoin is Calming Down So, why is Bitcoin suddenly so chill? A big reason is the launch of the spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. back in early 2024. These new, regulated products, offered by major players like BlackRock and Fidelity, made it super easy for everyday people and big institutions to get into Bitcoin. With more people and more money flowing in, the market became a lot more stable, smoothing out those wild price swings. Another factor is that you can now put Bitcoin in your 401(k) retirement account . As big-money players like pension funds and insurance companies start adding Bitcoin to their portfolios, the asset becomes less vulnerable to short-term speculators. This means less drama and more stability. Bitcoin is also starting to move in sync with the broader stock market, which is another huge sign that it’s officially part of the mainstream. For both casual investors and institutions, this lower volatility means less risk and a smoother ride. It proves Bitcoin is officially leaving its rebellious teenage phase behind and settling into its role as a key player in the financial world. To keep up with the demand, though, it needs an upgrade. This is exactly what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) brings to the table. Its promising blockchain upscaling soltuion and an explosive presale nearing $12M are the main reasons why we think it’s one of the best crypto presales in 2025. Why Bitcoin Needed an Upgrade like Bitcoin Hyper The team behind Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) saw the many challenges faced by $BTC and decided to build a powerful new layer to upgrade the OG. Bitcoin is a legend, but it’s got some major hang-ups. While it was a revolutionary idea, it was never built for the lightning-fast, high-tech world we live in now. Its transactions are painfully slow, it’s not programmable for modern protocols like you see on Ethereum and Solana, and the fees can get pretty high when the network’s busy. Enter Bitcoin Hyper’s Layer-2: fully programable for DeFi thanks to integrating the Solana Virtual Machine ; maintaining trustless cross-chain transfers and secure settlement on Bitcoin’s network. Their goal? To transform Bitcoin from a simple digital asset into a full-blown platform for innovation, all while keeping that rock-solid security that Bitcoin is famous for. With such a daring promise and its devnet already live, it’s no surprise the $HYPER presale is booming. So far, the project has raised nearly $12M from thousands of investors. Right now, the token sells for $0.012795. However, our $HYPER price prediction sees a potential $0.32 high by the end of 2025. Check $HYPER to lock 2,400% potential ROI. Bitcoin Hyper’s Secret for Unmatched Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to solve Bitcoin’s bottlenecks, but it’s not the first L2 project to attempt this. So, what makes it unique? It’s the Solana Virtual Machine integration. This add-on basically brings the insane speed and low latency of Solana to the Bitcoin world. It’s a simple but powerful change that brings Bitcoin up to modern standards. This means developers can finally create super-fast, scalable dApps on a network that’s still backed by Bitcoin’s security. That’s how Bitcoin Hyper acts as a high-performance Layer 2 chain, handling transactions at warp speed and then settling them on the main Bitcoin network later. This setup keeps costs low and speed high without clogging up the original chain. Another staple is the Canonical Bridge . It’s a decentralized bridge that lets you move your Bitcoin from the main chain to the Layer 2 easily and securely. Once your $BTC is on the new layer, you can use it for virtually everything, from quick payments to DeFi protocols and NFT platforms. Thanks to this new system, Bitcoin is becoming a dynamic platform ready for the future. Our full guide to What is Bitcoin Hyper covers its roadmap and features in even more detail. Visit the Bitcoin Hyper presale for 93% APY. Maturity Takes Time Bitcoin’s story is about growing up. It’s moving on from being that wild, rebellious teenager to a more stable and serious adult in the financial world. A major part of it is thanks to big-time players getting involved with things like ETFs and retirement accounts. The fact that $BTC is less volatile now, combined with new tech upgrades like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) coming its way, shows just how much the OG crypto is changing. With Hyper’s help, Bitcoin isn’t just ‘digital gold’ you stick in a vault anymore. It’s becoming a versatile platform ready to power a whole new wave of apps.

A recent high-profile case involving billionaire heiress Taylor Thomson has captured attention, highlighting the volatile nature of digital assets and the perils of unconventional investment advice. Thomson is currently embroiled in a legal battle after losing over $80 million in crypto, allegedly based on guidance from a psychic and her former friend. What Led to This Massive Crypto Loss ? This dramatic saga began during the exhilarating 2021 crypto bull run. Taylor Thomson entrusted over $140 million to her former friend, Ashley Richardson, for managing her cryptocurrency investments. Richardson, it is alleged, also introduced Thomson to a psychic whose advice reportedly influenced investment decisions. However, the market’s sharp downturn in 2022 led to a staggering crypto loss , wiping out a significant portion of Thomson’s portfolio. This turn of events forms the crux of the legal dispute, raising serious questions about investment strategies and accountability. It highlights how quickly fortunes can change in the fast-paced crypto market, especially when personal advice is involved. What Are the Allegations Behind This Crypto Loss ? Following the substantial crypto loss , Thomson initiated a lawsuit against Richardson. Her claims include allegations of unauthorized trades, misrepresentation of facts, and a breach of fiduciary duty. Thomson asserts that Richardson acted beyond her authority and did not adequately protect her investments. The lawsuit seeks to recover the lost funds, emphasizing the trust that was allegedly broken in their business relationship. This case underscores the critical importance of clear agreements and due diligence in high-stakes financial dealings. Specifically, Thomson’s claims point to several key issues: Unauthorized Trading: Richardson allegedly made trades without Thomson’s explicit consent. Misrepresentation: Information regarding risks or investment strategies might have been misleading. Breach of Fiduciary Duty: Richardson, as a manager, was expected to act in Thomson’s best financial interest. How is Richardson Responding to the Crypto Loss Claims? In response to Thomson’s lawsuit, Ashley Richardson has vehemently denied any wrongdoing. She has filed a countersuit, asserting that Thomson was fully aware of and approved all investment decisions. Richardson’s defense suggests that the crypto loss was a result of market volatility, a risk inherent in cryptocurrency investments, rather than any mismanagement on her part. This counter-allegation paints a picture of a consensual investment relationship where both parties understood the risks involved. The legal proceedings will likely scrutinize communications, transaction records, and the extent of Thomson’s involvement in investment decisions. Such cases often hinge on proving the scope of authority and the transparency of financial dealings. Therefore, documentation and clear communication are paramount in preventing similar disputes. What Can We Learn from This Crypto Loss Case? This unfortunate incident serves as a stark reminder for anyone navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Whether you are a seasoned investor or new to the market, several lessons emerge from this crypto loss saga: Due Diligence is Crucial: Always research and verify the credentials of anyone managing your investments. Avoid Unconventional Advice: Base investment decisions on sound financial analysis, not psychic predictions or unverified sources. Clear Agreements: Ensure all investment mandates, risk tolerances, and responsibilities are clearly documented and understood by all parties. Understand Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are inherently risky; be prepared for significant price swings. Monitor Your Portfolio: Actively track your investments and question any discrepancies or unclear actions. The case of Taylor Thomson and her significant crypto loss illustrates the potential pitfalls when personal relationships intertwine with high-stakes financial ventures. It’s a compelling narrative that underscores the need for professional oversight and a healthy dose of skepticism in the unpredictable crypto market. Conclusion: Navigating the Perils of Crypto Loss The ongoing legal battle between Taylor Thomson and Ashley Richardson is more than just a personal dispute; it’s a cautionary tale for the entire cryptocurrency investment community. It highlights the profound consequences that can arise when trust is misplaced and investment decisions are influenced by unconventional sources rather than solid financial principles. As the crypto market continues to evolve, investors must prioritize robust strategies and clear communication to safeguard against potential financial setbacks and avoid a devastating crypto loss . This case serves as a powerful reminder that even in the pursuit of immense gains, vigilance and prudence remain your best allies.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrps-double-bull-flags-emerge-heres-the-significance/,"Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a prominent analyst on X, published a weekly chart of XRP that demands close attention. The post displays a prolonged corrective channel that resolved upward, forming the first bull flag. The pattern was followed by a more compact weekly consolidation resembling another bull flag . The analyst’s presentation emphasizes the weekly timeframe and frames the recent price action as continuation-oriented rather than the start of a sustained reversal. #XRP Bull Flag after Bull Flag! pic.twitter.com/NlOvVFLA4N — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 23, 2025 XRP’s Bull Flags On the chart, the asset’s price action shows an extended corrective channel that contained volatility for several months before a decisive weekly close above the channel’s upper boundary. That breakout represents the first confirmation point. The subsequent pattern is a smaller bull flag that is angled slightly downward while maintaining higher lows relative to the breakout level. It began forming immediately after XRP hit a new all-time high of $3.65 in July. Immediate technical support is visible near the $2.4 area on the chart with the small flag’s lower trendline and intraday lows clustered slightly above that level. Short-term resistance is defined by the small flag’s upper trendline and recent swing highs near the $3.4 mark. The consolidation has kept the asset’s price contained between those levels on the weekly timeframe. XRP Targets and Risk Management If the pattern unfolds as a textbook continuation, a measured move projection derived from the flagpole indicates material upside potential. Applying the flag-measure technique to the visible move into the original consolidation produces a target that could reach above $5. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 That projection should be treated as conditional. It assumes the consolidation resolves to the upside on a weekly close with follow-through on higher timeframe volume. Traders should monitor the $2.4 support and the small flag’s lower trendline. A decisive weekly break below those levels would undermine the bullish case and shift the focus to risk control. Additionally, macro liquidity conditions and broader market sentiment remain relevant and can affect the pattern’s outcome. External catalysts, such as the recent conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), could significantly alter XRP’s trajectory as the sentiment of market participants shifts. The chart presents a favorable technical setup for continuation, but the pattern’s implications depend on confirmation and disciplined risk management.

Nasdaq-listed Sharps Technology (ticker: STSS) has announced a truly significant move that could reshape perceptions of institutional crypto adoption. The company plans a massive $400 million private placement to fund its ambitious Solana investment strategy , according to a recent PR Newswire press release. This bold step highlights a growing confidence in digital assets from traditional financial players. What’s Driving This Bold Solana Investment Strategy? Sharps Technology’s decision to dedicate such substantial capital to a Solana investment strategy is a clear indicator of its belief in the blockchain’s future potential. The $400 million raised through this private placement will not just sit idle; it has a clear purpose. These funds are earmarked for several key activities: Open-Market SOL Purchases: The company intends to acquire Solana’s native token, SOL, directly from the open market. This can potentially create significant buying pressure. Long-Term Holding: Sharps Technology isn’t looking for quick profits. Their strategy involves holding SOL for an extended period, signaling a long-term bullish outlook on the asset’s value. Operating Expenses: A portion of the proceeds will also cover operational costs associated with managing this new venture, ensuring the strategy’s sustainability. This move is more than just an investment; it’s a strategic pivot for a company traditionally known for its medical device innovations. The Mechanics of Sharps Technology’s Solana Investment Strategy A private placement is a unique way for a company to raise capital by selling securities directly to a limited number of investors, rather than through a public offering. For Sharps Technology, this method allows them to secure significant funding specifically for their Solana investment strategy without the complexities of a public market launch for this particular venture. Furthermore, the commitment to open-market purchases suggests that Sharps Technology views SOL as a fundamental asset, similar to how traditional firms might hold gold or other commodities. This direct approach to acquiring and holding SOL could set a precedent for other publicly traded companies considering similar forays into the crypto space. However, investors should always consider the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. While the potential for gains is significant, so are the risks. Why is Solana an Attractive Investment for This Strategy? Solana has emerged as a formidable player in the blockchain ecosystem, known for its high transaction speeds and low costs. These technical advantages make it an attractive platform for various decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Sharps Technology’s Solana investment strategy likely hinges on these core strengths. Here are some reasons why Solana stands out: Speed: Solana can process thousands of transactions per second, far exceeding many competitors. Scalability: Its architecture is designed to handle a growing number of users and transactions without compromising performance. Ecosystem Growth: Solana boasts a rapidly expanding ecosystem of developers and projects, fostering innovation and utility. This institutional endorsement could further bolster Solana’s reputation and potentially attract more mainstream attention and development to its network. Potential Impact and Considerations for This Solana Investment Strategy Sharps Technology’s venture into a dedicated Solana investment strategy could have ripple effects across both the traditional financial and cryptocurrency markets. On one hand, it validates crypto as a legitimate asset class for publicly traded companies. On the other, it introduces new dynamics regarding corporate treasury management and digital asset exposure. This bold move could encourage other Nasdaq-listed firms to explore similar strategies, potentially driving further institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. However, companies must navigate regulatory uncertainties and market fluctuations. Due diligence and a clear understanding of risk management are paramount for any firm embarking on such a significant crypto endeavor. Ultimately, this development signals a fascinating intersection of traditional business and the burgeoning digital economy, with Solana at its core. Conclusion: Sharps Technology’s decision to launch a $400 million Solana investment strategy marks a pivotal moment for institutional engagement in the crypto space. This strategic move by a Nasdaq-listed company not only underscores the growing confidence in Solana’s potential but also sets a compelling precedent for how traditional firms might integrate digital assets into their long-term financial planning. It’s a powerful testament to the evolving landscape of global finance, where blockchain technology is increasingly recognized as a vital component of future growth.

Under the partnership, the company will utilize Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interaction Protocol (CCIP), SmartData, and Proof of Reserves to support cross-chain tokenized real-world assets. Chainlink Co-Founder Sergey Nazarov commented on the partnership: “The SBI team was great to work with. They are one of the most forward-thinking and technically advanced groups in the blockchain industry. We've been building some pretty advanced fund tokenization and stablecoin DvP use cases with SBI for a while now, and I'm excited to see our great work progress into production use at scale.

According to Bloomberg, the firms are in advanced talks with potential backers and have tapped Cantor Fitzgerald as the lead banker for the deal. Solana’s Corporate Treasuries Set to Expand With $1B Reserve Plan The plan centers on creating a new digital asset treasury company, which would be formed by taking over an undisclosed publicly traded entity. If completed, it would mark the largest single treasury dedicated to Solana, more than doubling the size of the biggest existing reserve. BREAKING: @galaxyhq , @jump_ and @multicoincap are reportedly seeking $1B to purchase $SOL , according to Bloomberg. pic.twitter.com/XBaR268XEG — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) August 25, 2025 According to the Bloomberg report, the transaction has received the backing of the Solana Foundation and is expected to close in early September. None of the firms involved have publicly commented on the talks. Solana , currently the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has staged a sharp rebound this year. After dropping to multi-month lows in April, SOL has more than doubled and now trades near $200, up 6.6% over the past 30 days. The surge has been fueled by renewed network activity, rising developer interest, and a wave of corporate entities adding Solana to their treasuries. Until now, the largest institutional holder of Solana has been Upexi Inc., a supply chain management company that pivoted in April to focus on building a SOL treasury. Upexi has accumulated more than 2 million tokens worth about $415 million at current prices. Early in August, DeFi Development Corp expanded its Solana holdings by adding 110,000 SOL, worth about $22 million at the time, to its holdings. In July, the company closed a $122.5 million convertible debt raise led by Cantor Fitzgerald. Proceeds have been used to bolster its SOL position and expand operations. Bitcoin mining firm Bit Mining recently announced plans to raise between $200 million and $300 million to create its own Solana reserve. However, that month, the company entered the market, purchasing 27,191 SOL for $4.5 million and launching its own validator to generate staking yields. Against this backdrop, the proposed $1 billion purchase by Galaxy, Jump, and Multicoin would dwarf the competition, instantly establishing the largest Solana corporate treasury to date. Bitcoin pioneered the model, most visibly through Strategy’s aggressive accumulation strategy that has built a $70 billion BTC reserve. Ethereum has seen similar momentum, with digital asset treasury companies accumulating around $20 billion worth of ETH . Analysts say these vehicles have the potential to drive supply squeezes, tightening liquidity in spot markets and amplifying price movements. For Solana, the creation of a billion-dollar reserve would add fresh momentum to a recovery that began after the collapse of FTX in 2022, when the token’s future was thrown into doubt. Multicoin and Jump have both been active backers of Solana’s ecosystem, while Galaxy Digital previously helped raise more than $600 million to buy SOL from the FTX estate last year. If successful, the deal could have market-wide implications. A billion-dollar Solana grab would represent a substantial portion of liquid supply, with potential knock-on effects for price volatility and staking yields. Institutional Treasuries, Buybacks, and dApps Fuel Solana’s $208 Rally Solana extended its rally this week, climbing 8.1% to $208 with daily trading volumes above $6.6 billion. At a market capitalization of $112.5 billion, the sixth-largest cryptocurrency is once again testing a major resistance level that could determine its next breakout. Institutional interest continues to play a pivotal role. According to the Strategic SOL Reserve tracker , nine entities now collectively hold 6.05 million SOL, worth about $1.21 billion, representing 1.05% of the circulating supply. The concentration is significant, with the top five holders, including Upexi, DeFi Development Corp, Mercurity Fintech, and iSpecimen, controlling 97.5% of tracked reserves. Ecosystem activity further supports Solana’s momentum. Data shows that Solana-based decentralized applications generated over $27 million in revenue between August 18 and 24. Axiom and Pumpdotfun dominated with over $18 million combined, representing two-thirds of the total. REPORT: @Solana DApps generated $27M+ revenue over the past 7 days. •⁠ ⁠Axiom Exchange: $9.19 million •⁠ ⁠Pumpdotfun: $9.08 million pic.twitter.com/1PgsM4vlbb — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) August 25, 2025 Other contributors included Phantom Wallet, Photon, and Raydium, highlighting strong activity across trading, wallet transactions, and DeFi infrastructure. Although revenue remains well below the peaks seen earlier in 2025, the figures highlight ongoing usage across DeFi, wallets, and trading platforms. On-chain dynamics add another layer. Weekly protocol buybacks have surged industry-wide, with Solana’s share climbing sharply. Solana Data Insights – @Solana Projects Now Account for 40% of Weekly Token Buybacks Across Crypto @ario_57_ Key takeaways: • Weekly token buybacks jumped from $14.5M to $46.8M in just two weeks (+158%). • Solana protocols now account for 40% of weekly buybacks, up… pic.twitter.com/OZ8SOv668P — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) August 22, 2025 Buyback volumes across Solana protocols rose more than 300% since June, reaching $17.8 million last week and accounting for nearly 38% of total cross-chain buybacks. The trend reduces circulating supply and reflects growing treasury strategies within Solana’s ecosystem. The network also continues to outpace competitors. July marked the tenth consecutive month Solana led Ethereum in decentralized exchange volume, hitting $124 billion, 42% higher than Ethereum.

The tone, however, flipped sharply post-symposium after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell struck a dovish balance, sparking a short squeeze across digital assets that lifted majors and restored market confidence. Ethereum outperformed, surging to fresh all-time highs, reaching $4958.70 on Sunday, reinforcing its emerging role as a key liquidity driver for institutional demand, while continued BTC consolidation signals a pause rather than structural weakness. Flows remain the central driver of price: US spot ETFs saw their heaviest week of outflows since April, with Bitcoin ETFs seeing $1.18bn of net outflows while Ethereum ETFs lost $197m in a single day. Yet treasury accumulation has stepped in to absorb supply, keeping net structural demand resilient . With global liquidity still trending higher and ETH corporate treasury balances expanding beyond $10B, the long-term backdrop remains constructive. BTC looks set to trade range-bound in the near term, while ETH leads rotation and altcoins await broader vehicles to unlock sustained inflows later in the cycle. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole speech boosted markets with expectations of a September rate cut. Still, he stopped short of firm commitments that he would do so, stressing the Fed’s balancing act between inflation and employment. While Treasury yields fell and equities rallied, Powell signalled a more cautious stance than in past cycles, suggesting cuts may be limited. Meanwhile, the US housing market showed resilience with a July rebound in multifamily construction, though permits fell to a five-year low, reflecting builder caution. Mortgage rates have eased slightly but remain elevated, keeping affordability strained. Beyond housing, stronger business activity in both manufacturing and services suggests economic momentum, but rising input costs and higher consumer prices point to persistent inflation pressures. In parallel, the crypto industry saw significant moves: Thailand launched a pilot crypto-to-baht programme to boost tourism, SharpLink Gaming expanded its Ethereum holdings past 740,000 ETH, and the CFTC widened its “ Crypto Sprint ” to advance US digital asset regulation in coordination with the SEC.

Проект строит свою концепцию на иронии и ностальгии по раннему интернету. Оформленный в стиле Windows 95 и “охраняемый” мультяшным дельфином, TOKEN6900 продолжает успех SPX6900. Вам предлагается еще больше хаоса, мемов и уникальной атмосферы. Для многих пользователей именно такие проекты становятся ответом на вопрос какую криптовалюту купить, если хочется нестандартного подхода к инвестициям. Неважно, относите ли вы себя к опытным инвесторам или просто хотите понять, в какую криптовалюту инвестировать, это руководство покажет вам, как безопасно войти в пресейл TOKEN6900. Но будьте осторожны – криптовалютный рынок полон мошенников, поэтому используйте только официальный сайт проекта . Как купить TOKEN6900 – краткий обзор в 4 шага Зайдите на сайт пресейла: перейдите на официальный ресурс TOKEN6900. Если оформление не напоминает атмосферу интернета 2000-х – значит вы попали не туда. Подключите криптокошелек : подключите лучший криптокошелек, например Best Wallet, который удобен для участия в пресейле. Выберите способ оплаты: можно использовать ETH, USDT, BNB или банковскую карту, указав сумму покупки. Подтвердите сделку: нажмите “Купить TOKEN6900” и завершите транзакцию. Токены будут доступны для получения после TGE. Основные характеристики TOKEN6900 Дата запуска и платформа: 30 июня 2025 года, стандарт ERC-20 на Ethereum. Токеномика: общий объем – 930,99 млн; маркетинг – 40%; фонд разработчиков – 15%; ликвидность – 10%; стейкинг – 5%; аирдропы и сжигание – 5%; прочее распределение – 24,9993%; резерв разработчиков – 0,0007%. На предпродаже собрано более 150 млн рублей. Стоимость токена сейчас около 0,55 рубля. Оплатить можно ETH, BNB, USDT или картой. Проект предлагает получать пассивный прибыль на стейкинге. Доходность впечатляющая: до 35% годовых. Уже застейкано более 134 млн токенов. Ключевые особенности TOKEN6900 можно собрать в такой список: первый “некоррумпированный” токен, отсутствие фальшивой утилитарности и “псевдо-AI”, ставка на мемы и сообщество, узнаваемый символ – клипарт-дельфин. Миллениалы и дети интернета 90-00-х точно оценят такой подход. Долгосрочное видение проекта следующее. Происходит переосмысление финансовых рынков через иронию и коллективный энтузиазм. Многие аналитики включают TOKEN6900 в список “перспективные криптовалюты” 2025 года. Дорожная карта также проста и прозрачна. После запуска и аудита предполагается рост сообщества и листинг. Далее идет выход в массовый сегмент и закрепление статуса “популярная криптовалюта”. Что такое TOKEN6900 TOKEN6900 (T6900) позиционирует себя как первый в мире “некоррумпированный токен” – и это не шутка. Это ERC-20 токен, который не обещает решить мировые проблемы или революционизировать цепочки поставок. Он полностью погружается в абсурд современного криптовалютного рынка и финансов. Предлагает нулевую утилитарность и абсолютную честность. Технологическая сторона TOKEN6900 надежна Проект полностью проверен аудиторами SolidProof и Coinsult. Для инвесторов это означает безопасность, невозможность создания новых токенов и абсолютную прозрачность. Этот токен создан для “пикового безумия финансов”, что делает его интересным вариантом для тех, кто задумывается, на какую криптовалюту обратить внимание. TOKEN6900 не притворяется тем, чем не является. В отличие от проектов, которые наполняют свои whitepaper модными терминами вроде DAO, интеграции метавселенной или AI-инструментов, которые никогда не будут реализованы. TOKEN6900 не делает подобных обещаний. Такая открытость является ключевым фактором его привлекательности для инвесторов, которые ищут перспективные криптовалюты без скрытых уловок. Почему именно 6900? Возможно, это отсылка к SPX6900 (SPX). TOKEN6900 буквально превзошел SPX6900, установив лимит выпуска на 930 993 091 токен. На один больше, чем у SPX. Этот один дополнительный токен символизирует превосходство – мемкоин позиционирует себя как “на 1x лучше” SPX6900, что соответствует его абсурдному и ироничному характеру. SPX6900 сам по себе – это токен на Ethereum, созданный как сатирический проект против традиционных финансов и индекса S&P 500 с девизом “$SPX: переворачиваем фондовый рынок”. Он известен резкими колебаниями цены и огромной доходностью. TOKEN6900, добавив один токен, не только иронизирует над SPX. Он демонстрирует символическое превосходство. Напомним, это не просто цифра – это концепция, показатель силы и оригинальности проекта, что делает его привлекательным для тех, кто ищет, какую криптовалюту купить. Цель TOKEN6900 – сделать 6900 универсальной единицей стоимости, превращая цифровое безумие скроллинга в торгуемый тикер. Вдохновленный успехом SPX6900, мемкоин идет дальше, высмеивая Wall Street и переусложненные DeFi-проекты, строя сообщество вокруг мемов и атмосферы. Где купить криптовалюту TOKEN6900 пошагово Если вы хотите узнать, как купить криптовалюту TOKEN6900 на этапе предпродажи, вам понадобится мобильный кошелек для криптовалюты и средства в ETH, USDT или BNB. Также можно оплатить банковской картой, если вы пока используете традиционные деньги. Обязательно заранее пополните баланс ETH для оплаты комиссии за транзакции, ведь сделки на предпродаже проходят в блокчейне. Мы разберем процесс на примере Best Wallet – это удобный кошелек для криптовалюты, который отлично подходит для новых проектов и мемкоинов и полностью совместим с WalletConnect. Очень важно использовать только официальный сайт предпродажи TOKEN6900. В сети много копий, которые пытаются обмануть инвесторов. Всегда проверяйте адрес страницы: ошибки в домене часто означают мошенничество. Шаг 1: Перейдите на официальный сайт предпродажи TOKEN6900 Зайдите на проверенный ресурс предпродажи TOKEN6900 . Если дизайн сайта напоминает старый интерфейс Windows 95 – значит, вы находитесь там, где нужно. Шаг 2: Подключите кошелек для криптовалюты Выберите вариант оплаты – “Купить за криптовалюту” или “Купить с помощью карты”, затем нажмите “Подключить кошелек”. В списке выберите Best Wallet. Чаще всего он отображается первым, а также появляется при использовании WalletConnect. Отсканируйте QR-код со своего смартфона, следуйте простым инструкциям и подтвердите соединение. После этого вы попадете в личный кабинет предпродажи, где сможете обменять свои средства на новые токены. Шаг 3: Выберите способ оплаты Определитесь, каким способом будете оплачивать: ETH, USDT, BNB или банковской картой. Введите сумму покупки. Шаг 4: Подтвердите транзакцию и купите Нажмите “Купить TOKEN6900”. Подтвердите сделку в своем кошельке для криптовалюты. Готово – ваши токены T6900 будут зарезервированы и станут доступны для получения после старта TGE. ПЕРЕЙТИ К ПРЕСЕЙЛУ Советы по покупке и хранению TOKEN6900 – инвестиции в криптовалюту Приобретение TOKEN6900 – процесс достаточно простой. Но сможете ли вы сохранить свои средства в безопасности? Здесь важно быть внимательным, ведь цифровые активы могут быть непредсказуемыми. Этот раздел – ваш своеобразный “цифровой ремень безопасности”. Используйте надежный кошелек. Работайте только с проверенными сервисами, такими как Best Wallet или Zengo. Избегайте сомнительных расширений для браузера и случайных ссылок в Telegram. Проверяйте сайт. Добавьте в закладки официальный ресурс TOKEN6900 . Если страница выглядит подозрительно – перед вами фишинговая схема. Проверяйте адрес контракта. TOKEN6900 пока не торгуется на крупнейших биржах, и любой токен с таким названием, предлагаемый в продаже, является подделкой. Уточняйте адрес только через официальный сайт или соцсети. Оценивайте риски. Возможно, вы приобретаете претендента на звание самая перспективная криптовалюта, которая принесет рост в 1000 раз, а может – ничего. Несмотря на прозрачность TOKEN6900, вы должны быть готовы потерять вложенные средства. Инвестируйте только ту сумму, которую не страшно потерять. Остерегайтесь поддельного стейкинга. Участвуйте в стейкинге исключительно через официальный сайт. Ждите TGE. Ваши токены станут доступны только после запуска TGE. Следите за новостями в официальных аккаунтах TOKEN6900 в социальных сетях. Почему мы выбираем TOKEN6900 – прогноз криптовалюты Причина популярности проста – честность. TOKEN6900 не обещает невозможного и именно этим выделяется на фоне других проектов. В условиях, когда многие стартапы завлекают “революционными технологиями” и остаются без результата, такой подход выглядит свежо и привлекательно. Фиксированный объем предложения – 930,993,091 токенов, отсутствие эмиссии и проведенный аудит контрактов делают TOKEN6900 надежным выбором в глазах трейдеров. Особенно в сравнении с сомнительными проектами. На предпродаже до 80% токенов выделено для участников, а гибкий APY по стейкингу позволяет зарабатывать с первого дня. Культурный фактор – еще один драйвер роста. С учетом того, что мемкоины уже показали взрывной рост с 2023 года, именно они могут быть в списке перспективные альткоины 2025. TOKEN6900 отражает недоверие к традиционной финансовой системе и привлекает сообщество своим ироничным образом. Активность в соцсетях, узнаваемый символ дельфина и вирусное распространение мемов превращают проект в потенциального лидера среди новых токенов. Некоторые аналитики и известные блогеры предвещают рост до 10x, основываясь на сильном сообществе, бычьем рынке и росте популярности криптовалют. Токеномика TOKEN6900 – инвестирование в криптовалюты Токеномика TOKEN6900 предельно проста и максимально прозрачна. Всего лишь фиксированный объем предложения, открытая предпродажа и намеренное отсутствие какой-либо “полезности”. Это анти-модель, и именно в этом ее уникальность. Характеристика Процент Общий объем выпуска 930,993,091 Собрано на предпродаже более 162 млн рублей Ликвидность (Vibe liquidity) 10% (93,099,309) Маркетинг (Marketing blitz) 40% (372,397,236) Фонд разработки (Vibe-coding dev fund) 15% (139,648,964) Награды за стейкинг 5% (46,549,655) Бонусы/аирдроп/сжигание 5% (46,549,655) “Does anyone have a dolphin?” 24.9993% (232,741,373) Dev moon bag 0.0007% (6,900) Да, категория “Does anyone have a dolphin?” действительно существует. Ее невозможно объяснить – это часть особого стиля проекта. Благодаря уже доступному стейкингу (на данный момент доходность составляет около 35% APY) и отсутствию функции дополнительной эмиссии, модель токеномики делает акцент на ранних инвесторах и доверии сообщества. Для тех, кто интересуется какие криптовалюты существуют, TOKEN6900 может стать примером нового подхода. “Дорожная карта” или ее полное отсутствие – как выбрать альткоин для инвестиций Проект TOKEN6900 не использует стандартную дорожную карту. “Дорога” подразумевает заранее заданное направление, а здесь такого нет. Однако для тех, кто предпочитает хоть немного структуры, команда выделила три условные и намеренно абсурдные фазы. На практике это больше похоже на график настроений, чем на классический план. Conception (Зарождение): запуск сайта в стиле Windows 95, аудит смарт-контрактов, включение стейкинга, появление первых мемов. Consciousness (Сознание): активность в соцсетях, листинг токена на площадках, рост сообщества. Vibes (Энергия): вирусное распространение, превращение TOKEN6900 в культурный символ, “замеченные дельфины” и искажение привычной реальности. TOKEN6900 не претендует на разработку dApps или “умных городов”. Его миссия – разрушать ожидания и играть на хаосе интернета. Для одних это вызовет скепсис и вопрос – безопасно ли инвестировать в альткоины, для других же именно в этом и проявляется потенциал проекта. Стоит ли покупать TOKEN6900 – самая перспективная криптовалюта Решение о покупке всегда остается за вами. Однако важно понимать: TOKEN6900 отличается от большинства проектов. У него нет продукта, нет фиктивной дорожной карты. Это не обещание будущих технологий – это мемкоин с манифестом. В условиях современного рынка именно такой подход может выделить его среди множества однотипных токенов. TOKEN6900 демонстрирует прозрачность, которой многие проекты лишь имитируют. Все благодаря фиксированному предложению, отсутствию функции дополнительной эмиссии и полностью прошедшим аудит смарт-контрактам. Добавьте сюда яркий бренд, сплоченное сообщество и отсутствие искусственной “полезности”, и вы получите токен, который заметно выделяется в перенасыщенном мире предпродаж. ПЕРЕЙТИ К ПРЕСЕЙЛУ Лучшие предпродажи этого года – самая перспективная криптовалюта среди новичков Если вам близка ироничная подача и атмосфера “ретро-хаоса”, TOKEN6900 может стать самым честным токеном в вашей коллекции. В противном случае стоит обратить внимание и на другие проекты с более традиционной структурой и реальной утилитой. Snorter Token (SNORT) – Telegram-бот для торговли на Solana и Ethereum с мгновенными сделками, низкой комиссией (0,85%) и возможностью стейкинга Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) – первый полноценный Bitcoin Layer-2 на SVM, предлагающий быстрые и дешевые транзакции BTC и кроссчейн DeFi Best Wallet Token (BEST) – токен для доступа к предпродаже и дешевым транзакциям в Web3-кошельке с поддержкой Fireblocks. TOKEN6900 лучшая криптовалюта или нет? TOKEN6900 не обещает построить будущее – он отражает настоящее, с его хаосом и иронией. И именно этим проект резонирует с аудиторией. Он прозрачен, ограничен в предложении и создан для тех трейдеров, кто понимает, что иногда сам мем и есть продукт. Фиксированный объем выпуска, отсутствие риска инфляции, живой стейкинг и даже своеобразная “хаотичная” дорожная карта делают TOKEN6900 устойчивее, чем многие другие мемкоины. Он может повторить успех SPX6900 и использовать силу коллективного мем-движения. Но важно подчеркнуть: это не фундаментальный проект, а токен, основанный на эмоциях и культурном тренде. Заключение Если вы ищете серьезный токенс реальной полезностью, лучше присмотреться к другим вариантам. Но если хотите оказаться в числе первых участников громкого ироничного проекта, который теоретически может вырасти в 10 раз и более, то TOKEN6900 может стать вашим шансом. Как всегда, этот материал не является финансовой рекомендацией. Предпродажи несут высокий риск, поэтому перед вложениями стоит тщательно изучить проект и принять решение самостоятельно. FAQs 1. Является ли TOKEN6900 хорошей инвестицией? TOKEN6900 не является утилитарным токеном или DeFi-протоколом. Это мемкоин, построенный на иронии и полной прозрачности, без лишних обещаний. Если вам близка концепция “нет полезности, нет дорожной карты – только атмосфера”, и вы понимаете риски раннего инвестирования в мемкоины, этот проект может оказаться интересным. Но если вы ищете фундаментальные показатели или долгосрочную практическую ценность, TOKEN6900 вряд ли станет вашим выбором. Всегда проводите собственное исследование, прежде чем принимать решение. 2. Можно ли стейкать TOKEN6900? Да, токены TOKEN6900 можно стейкать сразу после покупки через официальный сайт. На данный момент доходность составляет около 35% годовых, однако со временем она будет снижаться по мере роста числа участников. Вознаграждения распределяются из расчета 17,71 T6900 за каждый блок Ethereum. Здесь нет централизованных платформ – все работает напрямую через смарт-контракт, что повышает уровень прозрачности. 3. Как я могу приобрести TOKEN6900? Перейдите на официальный сайт предпродажи, чтобы получить TOKEN6900. Чтобы совершить покупку, вам потребуется криптовалютный кошелек, такой как Best Wallet, а также средства в ETH, USDT или BNB. Если вы пока используете фиатные деньги, вы можете использовать банковскую карту. Вы должны подключить свой кошелек, выбрать способ оплаты, указать сумму и подтвердить транзакцию. После TGE токены будут зафиксированы за вами и доступны для получения. 4. Является ли TOKEN6900 легитимным проектом? Да, TOKEN6900 полностью легитимен, хоть и подан в ироничной форме. Смарт-контракты прошли аудит у SolidProof и Coinsult, а общее предложение зафиксировано и не подвержено инфляции. Распределение токенов прозрачно и открыто для проверки. Проект изначально не обещает революций в финансах – он честно заявляет, что является мемкоином, и в этом его суть. Если для вас критерием доверия служат открытость и прямота, TOKEN6900 соответствует этим ожиданиям. Тем не менее, это мемкоин, поэтому важно понимать риски и самостоятельно оценивать проект. 5. Почему у TOKEN6900 на один токен больше, чем у SPX6900? Ответ прост – потому что это смешно. Если SPX6900 ограничил предложение на уровне 930,993,090 токенов, то TOKEN6900 выпустил 930,993,091. Это своеобразная “цифровая ирония” и способ заявить о превосходстве, не меняя сути. В культуре мемкоинов иногда именно такие мелочи становятся частью большого шутливого наследия. TOKEN6900 демонстрирует, что даже символическое отличие может стать фактором узнаваемости.

DeFi Development Corp. (Nasdaq: DFDV) recently announced a monumental $125 million equity deal, specifically aimed at fueling its Solana treasury expansion . This strategic move is poised to significantly bolster DFDV’s holdings in the high-performance Solana ecosystem, drawing considerable attention from investors and market watchers alike. What is Driving This Solana Treasury Expansion? DeFi Development Corp. confirmed it has entered into definitive agreements for a substantial equity offering. This offering totals an impressive $125 million, with shares priced at $12.50 each. The deal, which includes approximately 4.2 million shares and pre-funded warrants for roughly 5.7 million shares (at an exercise price of $0.0001), is set to close on August 28, pending customary conditions. This information was reported by Business Insider, citing a Globe Newswire press release, lending credibility and transparency to the announcement. The core objective behind this massive capital injection is clear: to strategically enhance DFDV’s position within the Solana ecosystem. By securing this funding, the company aims to strengthen its financial foundation and expand its operational capabilities, particularly concerning its Solana asset base. How Will DeFi Development Utilize the Funds? The proceeds from this $125 million equity deal will be deployed in a targeted manner. DeFi Development Corp. plans to receive these funds in a mix of cash and locked SOL. This dual approach allows for flexibility and direct investment into the Solana network. Specifically, the company intends to use these proceeds to: Acquire spot SOL: Purchasing Solana tokens directly from the market. Buy discounted locked SOL: Investing in Solana tokens that are subject to a vesting schedule, often available at a lower price. This strategy is designed to be highly beneficial for DFDV’s financial metrics. The company expects these acquisitions to be ""accretive to NAV per share"" and, importantly, to its ""Solana per Share"" metric. Essentially, this means the deal is anticipated to increase the net asset value per share and the amount of Solana tokens held per share, offering a clear advantage to shareholders. DeFi Development’s Current Solana Holdings: A Strong Foundation for Expansion Before this significant deal, DeFi Development Corp. already held a substantial amount of Solana. The company currently boasts approximately 1.42 million SOL tokens in its reserves. At current market valuations, this holding is valued at an impressive $273 million. This existing foundation provides a robust starting point for the new Solana treasury expansion . The decision to further invest in Solana highlights DFDV’s confidence in the blockchain’s future and its role in the broader DeFi space. By increasing its Solana holdings, DFDV is not just accumulating assets; it is also deepening its commitment to and involvement in one of the fastest-growing blockchain ecosystems. Impact on Investors: What Does This Mean for DFDV? For investors, this $125 million equity deal represents a strong signal of growth and strategic foresight. The company’s focus on expanding its Solana treasury indicates a clear path toward enhancing shareholder value through direct exposure to a leading cryptocurrency. Key takeaways for investors include: Increased Asset Base: A larger Solana treasury directly translates to a more robust asset base for DFDV. Potential for Value Appreciation: As Solana’s ecosystem continues to mature and gain adoption, DFDV’s increased holdings could see significant appreciation. Enhanced Shareholder Metrics: The anticipated accretion to NAV per share and ""Solana per Share"" suggests a positive outlook for investor returns. Strategic Positioning: This move solidifies DFDV’s position as a significant player deeply integrated into the Solana network. This strategic capital raise and subsequent investment in Solana are designed to position DeFi Development Corp. for sustained growth and increased influence within the dynamic DeFi sector. Summary: A Bold Move for Solana Treasury Expansion DeFi Development Corp.’s $125 million equity deal marks a pivotal moment for the company and its ambitious Solana treasury expansion . By strategically acquiring more SOL, both spot and locked, DFDV aims to enhance its net asset value and ""Solana per Share"" metric, ultimately benefiting its shareholders. This move underscores the company’s commitment to leveraging the power of the Solana blockchain for future growth and solidifies its presence in the rapidly evolving decentralized finance landscape. Investors and market observers will undoubtedly be watching closely as DFDV executes this significant strategy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is DeFi Development Corp. (DFDV)?

Whales added $1.6B ETH this week, with demand zones aligned at $4,590–$4,760 Fibonacci cluster. Historical data shows September pullbacks often follow strong August gains, leaving ETH vulnerable below $4,500. Ethereum Price Action Ethereum surged to a new all-time high of $4,950 on August 24 before losing momentum. The token has since pulled back to around $4,550, down 4.5% over the past 24 hours, though still up 8% on the week. Since early August, ETH has climbed 26% and remains more than 220% above its yearly low. Meanwhile, the reversal came during a wave of liquidations across the market. More than $720 million in positions were wiped out in the last day, with nearly $500 million tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum longs. The rejection near $4,950 triggered much of the flush. Source: X Liquidity Grab and Support Levels Analyst Lennaert Snyder said Ethereum “took liquidity above $4,880 and flushed leveraged longs.” He added that ETH is “currently testing ~$4,500 support, but it doesn’t look strong.” Snyder pointed to $4,693 as the key range low for bulls to reclaim quickly. A recovery above that level could open another move toward $4,880. If $4,500 fails, the chart suggests ETH could slide to $4,300, which marked the start of its last impulse higher. $ETH took liquidity above $4,880 and flushed leveraged longs. Currently testing ~$4,500 support, but is doesn’t look strong. Best case scenario for the bulls is to reclaim $4,693 rangelow asap. If we lose here, Ethereum will probably retest the $4,300 start impulse. pic.twitter.com/Mkl4BtFizy — Lennaert Snyder (@LennaertSnyder) August 25, 2025 The $4,880 zone now acts as immediate resistance, while $4,500 remains under pressure. Whale Buying and Institutional Flows Large players have been active in recent sessions. Wise Crypto noted that whales added more than $1.6 billion worth of ETH this week, even as volatility increased. They described $4,590–$4,760 as a demand area that aligns with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement at $4,780. Wise Crypto highlighted $4,950 (0.618 Fib) as the resistance to clear. A break above that line could set a path toward $5,500, with checkpoints at $5,190 and $5,500. At the same time, CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost pointed to continued whale accumulation on Binance. “Since July, we have seen a significant increase in demand coming from Binance whales,” they wrote. According to the analyst, their activity shows a preference for building positions after explicit trend confirmation, which could provide extra support if ETH attempts another push toward $5,000. Source: CryptoQuant Ethereum’s rally in August has been strong, but historical trends indicate that September often brings corrections after a profitable August. Data from CoinGlass suggests the same could apply this year. For now, ETH sits between critical levels: $4,690 on the upside and $4,500–$4,300 on the downside. A reclaim could reignite momentum toward $5,000, while failure may reinforce seasonal weakness.

Last week, the Ethereum network saw a remarkable 3.8 million active addresses. While this figure represents a slight dip from its early-August peak, it’s crucial to understand that this level of activity remains significantly higher than what was observed in previous bull markets, according to blockchain analytics firm Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock). What Do Ethereum Active Addresses Really Tell Us? When we talk about Ethereum active addresses , we are referring to the number of unique wallet addresses that have participated in a transaction on the network within a specific timeframe. This metric serves as a vital indicator of network utility and user engagement. It shows us how many unique participants are sending or receiving ETH, interacting with smart contracts, or using decentralized applications (dApps). A high number of active addresses often suggests a healthy, vibrant ecosystem. It indicates that people are actively using Ethereum for various purposes, from trading and investing to engaging with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Therefore, the sustained 3.8 million Ethereum active addresses is a powerful testament to the network’s ongoing relevance. Why Are Ethereum Active Addresses Still So Elevated? The sustained high level of Ethereum active addresses , even after a slight ease from peak activity, can be attributed to several factors. Ethereum continues to be the foundational layer for a vast majority of decentralized applications, driving continuous user interaction. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): The DeFi sector, largely built on Ethereum, continues to attract users seeking lending, borrowing, and yield farming opportunities. New protocols and innovative financial products constantly emerge, drawing in fresh participants. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): Despite market fluctuations, the NFT space remains a significant driver of network activity. Artists, collectors, and gamers continue to mint, trade, and interact with digital assets on Ethereum. Layer 2 Solutions: The growth of Layer 2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon (which uses Ethereum as its base layer) offloads some transaction volume but ultimately expands the reach and usability of the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Users interacting with these solutions often still touch the mainnet at various points. Ongoing Development: Ethereum’s continuous evolution, including the transition to Proof-of-Stake and future upgrades, maintains developer interest and user confidence, encouraging sustained engagement. Navigating the Peaks: Understanding Ethereum Active Addresses Trends Observing trends in Ethereum active addresses offers valuable insights into market sentiment and network adoption. While the recent 3.8 million mark is off its absolute peak, its elevated position compared to previous market cycles is particularly telling. During past bull markets, activity levels, though high, did not consistently reach the sustained numbers we are witnessing today. This suggests a maturing network with a more robust and sticky user base. What does this mean for the future? Sustained high active addresses could indicate a stronger fundamental base for Ethereum. It implies that a significant portion of users are not just speculative traders but are deeply integrated into the network’s utility. This resilience can be a positive sign for long-term growth and stability, showcasing Ethereum’s enduring appeal as a platform for innovation. Understanding these trends helps investors and enthusiasts alike gauge the health and adoption of the network. It’s a reminder that beneath the price movements, a vibrant community is actively building, transacting, and innovating on Ethereum. In conclusion, the 3.8 million Ethereum active addresses figure, though slightly down from its recent high, underscores the network’s profound and lasting impact on the digital economy. This sustained activity points to a resilient ecosystem driven by diverse applications and a growing user base, cementing Ethereum’s role as a cornerstone of the decentralized future. It’s a compelling indicator of strength that speaks volumes about the platform’s utility and potential. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are Ethereum active addresses? A1: Ethereum active addresses refer to the number of unique wallet addresses that have sent or received transactions, or interacted with smart contracts, on the Ethereum network within a specific period, typically a week or day. Q2: Why is the number of Ethereum active addresses important? A2: It’s a key metric indicating the health and adoption of the Ethereum network. A higher number suggests greater utility, user engagement, and a more vibrant ecosystem, driven by DeFi, NFTs, and other applications. Q3: How does current Ethereum active addresses compare to past bull markets? A3: The current 3.8 million active addresses, even if slightly off peak, remains significantly higher than the sustained levels seen in prior bull markets, indicating a more robust and integrated user base. Q4: What factors contribute to the elevated number of Ethereum active addresses? A4: Key factors include the continuous growth of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), the expansion of Layer 2 scaling solutions, and ongoing core development and upgrades to the Ethereum network. Q5: Does a decrease from a peak in Ethereum active addresses mean the network is declining? A5: Not necessarily. Fluctuations are normal. The important aspect is the baseline. If the “off-peak” number is still significantly higher than previous market cycles, it suggests overall growth and resilience rather than a decline. Share Your Insights on Ethereum’s Activity!

Officials warned the pace would cool for the remaining part of 2025 now that the tariffs have taken effect. Customs data showed exports grew 11 percent in July from the previous year, topping a Reuters poll that put the rise at 9.6%, though the increase slowed from June’s 15.5%. Over the initial seven months of 2025, shipments, a key engine of growth, were up 14.4 percent from a year before. The ministry kept its full-year projection for export rise at 2 percent to 3 percent, while noting the outcome could be higher because of the solid beginning. U.S. tariffs pull demand forward Importers brought in goods earlier to avoid higher costs once the United States tariffs began, said Poonpong Naiyanapakorn, director of the Trade Policy and Strategy Office. “Achieving double-digit export growth for the year is unlikely,” he told a news briefing . By destination, sales to the U.S, Thailand’s biggest market, rose 31.4 percent in July versus a year ago. Exports to China increased 23.1 percent, ministry figures showed. Washington set a 19 percent tariff, a rate lower than the 36 percent previously announced and broadly matching levies on other regional exporters. There is still uncertainty over how the United States will treat goods transshipped through Thailand from 3rd countries, officials said. The U.S was Thailand’s top buyer last year, taking 18.3 percent of total shipments worth $55 billion. Imports increased 5.1 percent in July compared with a year earlier, above a projected increase of 4.90 percent. The trade balance swung to a surplus of $0.32 billion in July, compared with an expected deficit of $0.5 billion. Thailand’s economy slowed in the second quarter on weak demand Thailand’s economy lost momentum in the April-June quarter as soft household spending offset firm export gains. Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy was expected to grow 2.5% year on year in Q2, according to an August 12-15 poll of 21 economists. Individual forecasts ran from 1.6% to 2.9%. The economy expanded 3.1% in the first three months of 2025, and the government will publish the second-quarter release on August 18. On a quarter-on-quarter, seasonally adjusted basis, gross domestic product was seen up 0.3%, a smaller sample of economists indicated, easing from 0.7% in Q1. Exports posted double-digit increases in every month of the first half except April, as many firms hurried shipments ahead of higher U.S. tariffs. The United States was Thailand’s biggest export market last year, taking 18.3% of total shipments worth $55 billion. To support domestic demand, the central bank on Wednesday lowered its key policy rate by 25 basis points to 1.50%, a three-year low. That marked the fourth cut in 10 months overall. “We expect GDP growth to slow to 1.7% in the second half of 2025. Headwinds are piling up. Exports will slow as frontloading fades,” said Erica Tay, director of macro research at Maybank. A separate Reuters survey in July projected growth of 1.3% in Q3 and 0.9% in Q4.

Despite the sharp move, the stock remains down 98% year to date, though it has gained 45% over the past week. Why STSS stock is rallying The rally followed news of a private placement of more than $400 million , structured as a private investment in public equity (PIPE). The deal involves the sale of common stock and warrants at $6.50 per unit, with attached warrants exercisable for three years at $9.75, roughly 50% above the unit price. Closing is expected around August 28, pending customary conditions. Proceeds from the offering will primarily be used to acquire Solana tokens. Sharps Technology, a medical device and pharmaceutical packaging firm, has also entered into a non-binding agreement with the Solana Foundation to purchase $50 million worth of SOL at a 15% discount to its 30-day time-weighted average price, subject to certain requirements. The financing round attracted major institutional and digital asset investors, including ParaFi, Pantera, Monarq, FalconX, Phoenix Capital, Bastion Trading, RockawayX, Syncracy, Borderless, Republic Digital, Arche Capital, CoinFund, Arrington Capital, Quantstamp, CoinList Alpha, Primitive Ventures, Avenir, and Hypersphere. New leadership To advance its strategy, the company appointed Alice Zhang as Chief Investment Officer and board member, while also bringing on James Zhang, co-founder of Jambo and a well-known figure in the Solana ecosystem, as a strategic advisor. They will work alongside asset managers such as Monarq Asset Management, ParaFi, and Pantera to build and oversee the treasury. The move aligns Sharps Technology with a growing number of traditional companies venturing into cryptocurrency, following the example of pioneers like Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR).

50656177,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=791899,1756129792,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50656177.jpeg,Switzerland to pause all U.S.-bound shipments from August 26 over tariffs,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/switzerland-suspends-all-u-s-shipments/,"Switzerland will stop shipping parcels to the United States starting August 26, after new U.S. tariff rules stripped a key exemption that had allowed small foreign packages to enter the country duty-free after President Donald Trump’s decision to end the de minimis exception. That rule, which had allowed shipments worth less than $800 to avoid import taxes, will be scrapped on August 29, according to a statement . The new U.S. policy targets every country, not just China or Hong Kong, where the restrictions first began. Trump announced last month that packages from anywhere in the world will now be subject to import levies. Swiss Post responded by pausing all standard parcel services to the U.S., citing legal and logistical problems with the abrupt rollout. “The new rules affect all postal companies worldwide and are being introduced at very short notice,” the agency said in a statement. It added that many issues, especially around liability, haven’t been sorted. Trump imposes highest tariff rate on Switzerland Under the new U.S. customs system, importers have two choices. They can pay a percentage tax tied to a new “reciprocal” tariff table, or opt for a flat fee ranging from $80 to $200 per item for the first six months. For Switzerland , the reciprocal tariff rate was set at 39%, the highest rate assigned to any developed country. That figure was reached after recent trade negotiations between the two countries ended without progress. Swiss officials pushed back. The government made another offer to Washington in hopes of securing better trade terms, but nothing has changed. The tariff shock landed hard. Swiss Post said its decision to halt packages is based on “US customs clearance regulations,” which, according to them, “differ greatly from the Universal Postal Union’s previous regulations.” That discrepancy made it impossible to continue parcel shipments under the current setup. Standard shipments are suspended, but document and express consignments to the U.S. will still go through. These are usually handled with more paperwork and tighter tracking, making them easier to adapt to the new American rules. Other postal services across Europe, including Austria and Belgium, have also announced suspensions in response to the same requirements. Before the change, the de minimis threshold helped move about 4 million small parcels into the U.S. every day. These packages were rarely inspected and often landed straight at consumers’ doors without delay. That system is now over. All shipments will go through customs and face taxation, slowing down deliveries and increasing costs. Switzerland blocks tariff dodging through Liechtenstein With the 39% tariff in place, some companies tried to find a way around it. One idea floated was to route Swiss goods through Liechtenstein, a small country of about 40,000 people that shares a customs union with Switzerland. With the new U.S. tariffs, Liechtenstein only has a 15% duty, which is far below the rate Switzerland faces. Geographically, it looked simple since Liechtenstein sits on Switzerland’s eastern edge, and trucks from there can drive directly into Austria, which is part of the European Union . That made Liechtenstein a tempting channel for re-exporting goods at a cheaper tariff rate. But the Swiss economy ministry quickly shut it down. “For a product to be considered ‘originating from Liechtenstein,’ it must either be wholly produced in Liechtenstein or have undergone sufficient processing there,” a ministry spokesperson reportedly told Bloomberg in an email. They also explained that “simply re-exporting Swiss products via Liechtenstein or reloading them there does not change their origin, meaning that the higher US duties on Swiss goods apply.” The U.S. customs office has also signaled that it will be watching for such tactics and will not honor tariff reclassification attempts. That means any company hoping to sidestep the 39% rate by using Liechtenstein is still going to get hit with the full duty if the goods are clearly Swiss.

50656038,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=193156,1756129810,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/50656038.jpeg,Crypto Funds Outflows: Shocking $1.43 Billion Exodus Hits Digital Assets,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-funds-outflows-report/,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Funds Outflows: Shocking $1.43 Billion Exodus Hits Digital Assets The digital asset market recently experienced a significant shake-up, with crypto funds outflows hitting a staggering $1.43 billion last week. This marks the largest exodus since March, as detailed in CoinShares’ latest Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report. This massive withdrawal highlights a period of investor caution and market volatility, leaving many to wonder about the underlying causes and future implications for their digital asset holdings. What Triggered These Massive Crypto Funds Outflows? Investors are grappling with split views on U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) policy, which significantly influenced market sentiment. The ongoing debate about future interest rate hikes and the broader economic outlook created an environment of uncertainty, prompting many to de-risk their portfolios and contribute to the widespread crypto funds outflows . Moreover, this period of indecision pushed exchange-traded product (ETP) volume to an impressive $38 billion. This figure represents approximately 50% above its average, indicating heightened trading activity. Such high volumes often accompany major market shifts, underscoring the dynamic nature of current digital asset trading and the swift reactions of institutional and retail investors alike. Bitcoin and Ethereum: A Closer Look at Crypto Funds Outflows Breaking down the numbers, Bitcoin (BTC) funds bore the brunt of the recent sell-off, recording a substantial $1 billion in outflows. This significant withdrawal from the flagship cryptocurrency signals a notable shift in investor sentiment, as Bitcoin often acts as a barometer for the broader crypto market. Ethereum (ETH) funds also saw considerable withdrawals, totaling $440 million. These figures reflect a broad-based move by investors to reduce their exposure to major cryptocurrencies, suggesting a cautious stance across the board. However, the story isn’t entirely one-sided regarding these crypto funds outflows . Interestingly, there was a brief positive turn in the market. Following Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole speech, digital asset flows temporarily became positive, attracting $594 million in inflows. This short-lived rebound offered a glimpse of how quickly market sentiment can shift based on key economic announcements. Yet, for Bitcoin, this positive momentum was not sustained. Looking at month-to-date data, Ethereum shows a resilient $2.5 billion in inflows, contrasting sharply with Bitcoin’s continued $1 billion net outflows. This suggests differing investor sentiment and perhaps distinct investment theses between the two leading digital assets. Some analysts believe Ethereum’s ongoing network upgrades and its staking yield may be contributing to its relative strength. Understanding the Market’s Mixed Signals and Investor Behavior The recent crypto funds outflows demonstrate a complex interplay of macroeconomic factors and shifting investor strategies. While overall outflows were substantial, Ethereum’s month-to-date positive inflows suggest that some investors are selectively re-allocating or finding specific value in ETH. This could be due to its transition to Proof-of-Stake or anticipation of future developments. Conversely, Bitcoin’s sustained net outflows indicate that it remains highly sensitive to broader economic concerns and interest rate expectations. When traditional markets show signs of stress or uncertainty, Bitcoin often experiences a flight to safety, leading to withdrawals from investment products. These market dynamics require careful observation for anyone involved in digital asset investments, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of each asset’s unique drivers. What Should Investors Consider Amidst Significant Crypto Funds Outflows? For investors navigating these turbulent waters, several considerations are crucial to protect and potentially grow their portfolios: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on global economic indicators and central bank policies, as they directly influence crypto market sentiment and fund flows. Reputable reports, like those from CoinShares, offer invaluable insights. Diversify Wisely: Spreading investments across different assets, both within crypto and traditional markets, can help mitigate risks during periods of high volatility and significant crypto funds outflows . Adopt a Long-Term Perspective: Short-term fluctuations, even substantial ones like the recent $1.43 billion exodus, are common in emerging markets. A long-term strategy often helps weather market storms and capitalize on future growth. Understand the ‘Why’: Don’t just react to price movements. Investigate the underlying reasons for fund flows, market trends, and policy changes. Education is your best defense against impulsive decisions. In summary, the recent $1.43 billion crypto funds outflows underscore a period of heightened caution among investors, largely driven by macroeconomic uncertainty and Fed policy concerns. While Bitcoin saw significant withdrawals, Ethereum showed some resilience with month-to-date inflows, highlighting a nuanced market where different assets react distinctly to external pressures. Staying informed, diversifying strategically, and adopting a long-term approach are vital for navigating the evolving digital asset landscape successfully. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What caused the recent $1.43 billion crypto funds outflows? A1: The primary driver was investor uncertainty regarding U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) policy, particularly concerns about future interest rate decisions and the broader economic outlook. Q2: Which cryptocurrencies were most affected by these outflows? A2: Bitcoin (BTC) funds experienced the largest withdrawals, totaling $1 billion, while Ethereum (ETH) funds saw $440 million in outflows. Q3: Did any digital assets see positive inflows during this period? A3: Yes, flows briefly turned positive after Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole speech, with $594 million in inflows. Month-to-date, Ethereum also shows significant net inflows of $2.5 billion, despite its weekly outflows. Q4: What does “ETP volume” mean in the context of this report? A4: ETP stands for Exchange-Traded Product. ETP volume refers to the total value of these investment products (which hold digital assets) that were traded. A high volume indicates increased market activity and investor interest or shifts. Q5: How can investors navigate periods of high crypto funds outflows? A5: Investors should prioritize staying informed about market trends, diversifying their portfolios, maintaining a long-term investment perspective, and understanding the underlying reasons for market movements rather than reacting impulsively.

This initial dip, though modest, often sets the tone for the trading day and can influence investor sentiment across various asset classes, including the dynamic cryptocurrency market. Understanding these movements is crucial for anyone navigating the broader economic landscape. U.S. Stock Market Opens Lower: The Immediate Numbers The latest figures from the opening bell show a slight but clear downturn across major indices. This indicates that investor confidence began the day on a cautious note, reflecting a collective apprehension. S&P500: Dropped by 0.15% NASDAQ: Saw a decrease of 0.14% Dow Jones Industrial Average: Declined by 0.19% These percentages, while small, represent billions of dollars in market value. The S&P500 tracks 500 of the largest U.S. public companies, offering a broad snapshot of the economy. Meanwhile, the NASDAQ is heavily weighted towards technology stocks, and the Dow focuses on 30 significant industrial companies. A collective decline across these benchmarks suggests a widespread sentiment of apprehension in the U.S. stock market . What Factors Influence the U.S. Stock Market’s Early Performance? Several elements can contribute to how the U.S. stock market performs at the open. These often include a mix of pre-market news, economic data releases, and global events that unfold overnight. For instance, unexpected inflation reports or shifts in interest rate expectations from the Federal Reserve can quickly sway investor mood. Geopolitical tensions or significant corporate earnings announcements can also play a pivotal role. Investors constantly process new information, and their collective reaction is reflected in these opening numbers. Ripple Effects: How the U.S. Stock Market Impacts Other Assets When the U.S. stock market experiences a dip, it rarely operates in isolation. This movement can send ripples across other financial sectors, including the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Many traditional investors view digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum as “risk-on” investments. Consequently, when there’s a perceived increase in risk within the traditional market, capital sometimes flows out of these assets. Conversely, some argue that crypto can act as a hedge against traditional market instability, though this relationship is complex and evolving. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights for Savvy Investors A lower opening in the U.S. stock market should prompt investors to review their strategies, but not necessarily to panic. Understanding the broader context is key. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on economic news and company announcements that could explain market movements. Diversify Your Portfolio: Spreading investments across different asset classes, including a thoughtful allocation to digital assets, can help mitigate risks. Long-Term Perspective: Short-term fluctuations are normal. Focusing on long-term goals often helps to weather market volatility. For those interested in the crypto space, observing how Bitcoin and altcoins react to traditional market shifts provides valuable insights into market correlation and investor behavior. In conclusion, today’s lower opening in the U.S. stock market serves as a reminder of the continuous ebb and flow of financial markets. While the initial dip is modest, it underscores the importance of staying informed and adopting a well-considered investment approach. For both traditional and crypto investors, understanding these interconnected movements is paramount for making informed decisions in an ever-changing economic environment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does “U.S. stock market opening lower” mean? It means that the major stock market indices in the United States, such as the S&P500, NASDAQ, and Dow, began the trading day with a decline in their values compared to their closing prices from the previous day. This often indicates a cautious or negative investor sentiment at the start of trading. Which indices are most affected by a U.S. stock market dip? Typically, all major indices like the S&P500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones Industrial Average are affected. The S&P500 represents a broad market view, NASDAQ is tech-heavy, and the Dow focuses on industrial giants, so their collective movement gives a comprehensive picture of the U.S. stock market’s health. How does U.S. stock market performance affect cryptocurrency? While not always directly correlated, a significant dip in the U.S. stock market can sometimes lead to a “risk-off” sentiment, where investors move away from perceived riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. However, some also view crypto as a potential hedge, so the relationship is dynamic and complex. What factors can cause the U.S. stock market to decline? Many factors can cause a decline, including negative economic data (e.g., high inflation, poor job reports), rising interest rates, geopolitical tensions, company-specific news, or a general shift in investor confidence. These elements collectively influence market direction. Is a lower opening always a sign of a prolonged downturn? No, a lower opening is not necessarily a predictor of a prolonged downturn. Markets often experience daily fluctuations based on immediate news and sentiment. It’s essential to look at the broader economic context and longer-term trends rather than reacting solely to short-term movements in the U.S. stock market.

Buyers and sellers are locked in a tight battle, and the market appears to be standing on the edge of a potential breakdown. BTC Price Technical Side By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily chart, Bitcoin has recently slipped below the large ascending channel that had been driving its uptrend over the past few months. The failure to hold above $120K is a bearish signal, and with the $110K support and the 100-day moving average now at risk of breaking, the market could be heading for a sharp drop toward the $100K zone, where the 200-day moving average also resides. The RSI is holding below 50, further confirming bearish momentum and strengthening the case for continued downside. At this stage, only a strong wave of buying pressure could prevent a deeper decline and stabilize the market. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart shows a clear fake breakout and rejection around the $116K resistance, signaling that even the anticipation of lower interest rates has not been enough to spark a new rally. This is a bearish sign, as markets failing to react positively to good news often suggest underlying weakness. Currently, the $111K support is breaking down, which could pave the way for a swift decline toward the critical $100K zone. While the previous accumulation between $105K and $110K may generate some buying interest and temporary support, the overall market structure points to a higher probability of further downside. On-Chain Analysis Miner Reserve (30-Day Moving Average) Bitcoin miners have been consistently selling their holdings over the past couple of years, mainly to cover operational costs. While expected, this steady outflow adds extra selling pressure to the market, which can weigh on price performance. In recent days, the decline in miner reserves has accelerated, signaling an increase in selling activity. This surge in supply is likely one of the factors contributing to the recent downturn following Bitcoin’s new all-time high a few weeks ago.

Built on a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, CratD2C delivers high-performance infrastructure for decentralized applications, real-world utility, and a robust token ecosystem. At its core, CratD2C is engineered to process an impressive 100,000 transactions per second with near-instant finality, enabling a seamless user experience for developers and participants alike. This scalability is coupled with low-latency performance, ensuring that applications in e-commerce, real estate, and luxury lifestyle sectors can operate efficiently on-chain without compromising speed or security. The platform’s native token, $CRAT, underpins all network activity, fueling transactions, governance, and ecosystem growth while unlocking tangible benefits for its holders. One of CratD2C’s most innovative aspects is its biennial 8-Layer Zig-Zag Supply Mechanism, a unique distribution model designed to ensure fairness, sustainability, and long-term community engagement. This system encourages active participation from stakeholders while preventing the concentration of token ownership. Complementing this is a revolutionary staking mechanism that offers competitive rewards and flexible terms, allowing users to contribute to network consensus while earning from their participation. The CratD2C ecosystem is designed to go beyond traditional blockchain use cases. Through its Coin-IP Asset Value Linkage model, the value of $CRAT is intrinsically connected to the intellectual property assets of the ecosystem, ensuring that token holders share in the tangible success of the network’s ventures. This combination of blockchain innovation and asset-backed value sets CratD2C apart as a project with both visionary technology and real-world relevance. The Launchpad for CRAT on ProBit Global will be conducted in three rounds, each offering tokens at progressively increasing prices. Round 1 begins on August 29, 2025, at 08:00 UTC at a price of 0.75 USDT per token, followed by Round 2 starting September 3, 2025, at 0.77 USDT, and Round 3 beginning September 10, 2025, at 0.79 USDT per token. The phased structure allows early supporters to secure CRAT at preferential rates while providing momentum for the project’s market debut. To promote this one-of-a-kind project, ProBit Global will be hosting a plethora of events on their platform . To start things off, there is an ongoing Airdrop with 6,600 $Crat tokens up for grabs, with another one scheduled for round 2 of the Launchpad. There will be multiple AMAs hosted on the ProBit Global telegram and X accounts. Also, there will be a Learn & Earn event where users can earn $Crat tokens for answering questions about the CratD2C project. And let’s not forget about 2 Trading Competitions coming in mid-September (after the official listing). By bringing CratD2C to its global audience, ProBit Global reinforces its commitment to showcasing projects that are pushing the limits of blockchain capability. With its high-throughput architecture, innovative economic models, and diverse real-world applications, CratD2C is positioned to become a cornerstone platform for developers, enterprises, and crypto users seeking both performance and utility.

50656442,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=809600,1756130403,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/50656442.jpeg,"Ethereum Whale Demand Surges On Binance As Price Nears $5,000",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-whale-demand-surges-on-binance-as-price-nears-5000/,"Ethereum has once again taken center stage in the crypto market after surging to a new all-time high above the $4,900 level on Sunday. The rally, which pushed ETH into uncharted territory, highlighted the strength of bulls after weeks of steady institutional accumulation and market momentum. However, the price did not hold these highs for long. Ethereum has since retraced, dropping back to the $4,600 region, where bulls are now attempting to establish support before the next move higher. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces High-Risk Setup: Leverage-Driven Rallies Signal Volatility This pullback has sparked debate among analysts. Some view the retracement as a sign of a potential local top, cautioning that ETH may require a period of consolidation before another breakout attempt. Others, however, remain firmly bullish, pointing to strong fundamentals and growing institutional interest as signals that Ethereum’s rally is far from over. Adding weight to the bullish case, key on-chain data reveals that Binance whales continue to position themselves heavily in Ethereum. Large spot and futures orders attributed to these players have been flowing consistently, particularly after ETH confirmed its positive trend. This steady accumulation suggests confidence in Ethereum’s long-term trajectory, even as short-term volatility continues to shape the market’s direction. Binance Whales Accumulate Ethereum According to top analyst Darkfost, Ethereum’s Average Order Size on Binance chart provides clear insight into the behavior of different cohorts, distinguishing between retail investors and whales. Since July, a significant shift has taken place: whale activity on Binance has surged. This reflects a growing trend of large-scale accumulation, with whale-sized spot and futures orders continuing to flow into the market as ETH edges closer to the $5,000 mark. What makes this trend particularly noteworthy is the timing of whale participation. Unlike retail investors, who often try to buy early and ride potential upside, whales tend to prefer entering once a bullish trend has been confirmed. Darkfost highlights that this pattern is evident now, as whale orders began accelerating only after Ethereum reversed its earlier downtrend and regained strong bullish momentum. This validates the idea that large players seek reduced risk and clearer confirmation before allocating capital at scale. With both retail and institutional participants aligning, the coming weeks could be decisive in determining whether ETH firmly breaks into new price discovery. If whales continue to buy at this pace, Ethereum’s rally could extend far beyond its 2021 highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Upper Realized Band Signals Market Heat: Profit-Taking Zone Ahead? Testing Critical Support Level Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $4,598 after a sharp retracement from its new all-time high near $4,900. On the 4-hour chart, the structure shows that ETH is still maintaining a bullish trend, although momentum has cooled after last week’s explosive rally. The 50 SMA ($4,455) and 100 SMA ($4,435) are now converging just below current price levels, acting as immediate dynamic support. This cluster strengthens the bullish outlook as long as ETH can remain above it. A deeper drop toward the 200 SMA ($4,068) would signal a broader correction phase and potentially extend the consolidation before another push higher. Related Reading: Ethereum Open Interest Jumps 10% As $3.18B In New Positions Flood In The recent pullback shows that sellers are active near the $4,900–$5,000 region, which now forms a critical resistance. A breakout above this level would open the path to uncharted territory and likely accelerate momentum, with targets potentially stretching toward $5,200 and beyond. On the downside, failure to hold the $4,450–$4,400 support area could shift sentiment bearish in the short term, with traders eyeing $4,200 as the next key demand zone.

Michael Saylor Predicts 2 Decades Of 30% Gains,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-forever-michael-saylor-predicts-2-decades-of-30-gains/,"According to remarks made on CNBC, Michael Saylor, co-founder and executive chairman of Strategy, repeated a bold forecast: Bitcoin may grow 30% annually over the next 20 years. He framed the view around Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins and its global availability. Short statement. Big claim. Saylor’s Long-Term Case Saylor has pushed Strategy into heavy Bitcoin custody since 2020, and that strategy is on public display. Based on reports, the firm now holds over 226,000 BTC. On X, Saylor posted “Bitcoin is on Sale” alongside Strategy’s acquisition chart, a move that many investors read as a hint at another purchase. His point is simple: scarcity plus wider adoption could keep upward pressure on price. Some people call that convincing. Others call it risky. MICHAEL SAYLOR SAYS LIVE ON CNBC THAT #BITCOIN WILL GO UP 30% A YEAR FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS JUST THE BEGINNING pic.twitter.com/Cr847NVPU6 — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) August 24, 2025 Mixed Reactions From Analysts Not everyone agrees on the size of the upside. According to one public analyst named Bitcoin Hopium, gains could be far higher — a claim of 100% a year was floated. That forecast sits well outside mainstream estimates and would produce astronomical returns if it came true. Skeptics point to volatility, regulatory questions, and the challenge of predicting markets two decades out. Supporters say large corporate treasuries and wider institutional use would help stabilize demand. Possible Strategy Move The X post and the chart were quickly picked over by investors. Historically, Strategy has bought more Bitcoin after similar signals. If the company follows through, the purchase would add to a corporate holding already described as the world’s largest. Some buying has been done quietly in the past. Other buys were announced after the fact. Either way, Strategy’s moves are closely watched and can influence market mood. Metaplanet’s Big Buy Reports have disclosed a separate development in Japan. Tokyo-listed Metaplanet bought 103 BTC for about $11.7 million, at an average of roughly $113,491 per coin. The company now holds 18,991 BTC, bought at an average price of $102,712. That level of accumulation has pushed Metaplanet into public lists and helped it gain attention on indices. It’s a noteworthy move from a firm that began piling up Bitcoin in April 2024. Bottomline In short: a high-profile executive made a long-term, highly bullish prediction. A market signal was posted on social media. A separate public company added more Bitcoin. The takeaway for readers is clear — these are moves that will shape investor talk. How prices respond will depend on actual buys, broader demand, and events that are still to come.

Many have rushed to sell or ignore them, but some signals hint at a possible turnaround. These tokens, left behind by most, might become the focus as the market shifts. Attention to forgotten assets could be the key as the bull run gains speed. Toncoin’s Road Ahead: Fast Rails, Big Dreams, Bold Prices Toncoin powers The Open Network, an online rail first built by Telegram in 2018. After a court halt in 2020, volunteers renamed it and kept coding. The coin now runs on a stake-based system that speeds up checks and cuts power use. Users can send cash-like transfers in seconds and pay only tiny fees. Plans reach far beyond payments: cloud storage, friendly names, private surfing, and small apps can all sit on the same chain. This wide vision gives Toncoin a lively, growing crowd of fans and builders. Price watchers see wide moves ahead. Models that follow bitcoin’s halving rhythm place Toncoin near $6.45 at the low and $30.30 at the high in 2025, a jump of over threefold from today. Later years swing, with lows of $5.39–$16.27 and highs of $12.04–$40.52 through 2030, yet the top calls stay well above current levels. In a market where older coins fight to stay fresh, TON’s fresh code and busy updates stand out. If the network keeps adding tools, those bold targets may look less like dreams and more like milestones. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price: $0.0001 Price Now: $0.005 Next Stage: $0.01 Final Presale Price: $0.02 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries. So far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Hyperliquid: The Gas-Free Highway for Perpetual Crypto Trading Hyperliquid is a new base network built only for fast money apps. Its secret sauce is a fresh way for computers to agree, so trades lock in almost at once. All orders sit on the chain, not on side lists, so anyone can check them. Because the team controls the whole stack, they cut fees to zero. You pay no gas to place or close a trade. Behind the code stand builders from Harvard, Caltech, and MIT who left big tech and Wall Street to chase a bold idea. In a market that loves speed, Hyperliquid could steal users from giants like Ethereum, where busy days still cost a few dollars per click. It also rivals Solana’s pace while offering full openness in its order book. Fresh coins that solve pain points often run hard when the wider crypto cycle turns up, and many watchers see early signs of that turn now. If volume keeps rising and the zero-fee promise holds, the token may ride the next wave with energy. As always, buyers should look past buzz and watch real use grow. Mantle (MNT): A Lean Rollup Riding the New Wave of Ethereum Growth Mantle is a new helper chain that works with Ethereum. It bundles many steps into one, so moves and trades happen fast and cost less. The chain is made of parts that can be swapped without harm. This helps builders create apps that feel smooth. Users can lock their ETH through Mantle’s staking plan and earn extra coins while still using their money. A big pool of funds backs the project. People who hold the MNT coin vote on how that money and the tech are used, so all plans stay open to the public. Speed, clear rules, and deep pockets make Mantle stand out. Many helper chains focus only on code, yet few give everyday users a loud voice. Money is now flowing back to fast chains that also bring in fees, like Arbitrum and Optimism. Mantle’s coin still trades cheaper than those rivals even though its fund is larger. If more action shifts to side chains and coin locking stays hot, need for MNT may grow. Still, success hangs on builders picking the chain and on voters guiding the fund with care. Conclusion TON, HYPE, and MNT still hold strong upside, yet the spotlight now shifts to XYZVerse (XYZ), the first all-sport memecoin targeting 20,000% gains through a vibrant, community-driven ecosystem.

Despite periods of consolidation and volatility, its price movements within defined ascending channels continue to provide a basis for positive future projections. Market observers often debate XRP’s potential, but recurring signals on long-term charts point to consistent targets. Prominent crypto analyst CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) recently outlined a compelling projection for XRP’s future, drawing attention to the asset’s price trajectory over the years, and setting a $25 price target for the current bull cycle, despite recent bearish momentum . This target aligns with the asset’s established growth channel and reflects the same historical structure that has guided its past rallies. According to him, this level is the “most logical price target for XRP this bull run” based on this data. $25 is the most logical price target for #XRP this bullrun! pic.twitter.com/I8UEqmtS0o — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) August 24, 2025 Reviewing XRP’s Trajectory The chart presented by CryptoBull places strong emphasis on XRP’s long-term monthly trajectory. Key historical points are highlighted to demonstrate a consistent pattern. The first major peak identified occurred in 2014, when XRP reached a notable high relative to its early trading history. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The second significant point arrived in 2017, preceding XRP’s surge to its previous all-time high in January 2018. The most recent point the analyst highlighted occurred in 2021, carrying the asset to $1.96 before retracing. Each of these points, circled on the chart, sits within an ascending channel that frames XRP’s long-term price behavior. The pattern indicates that after each consolidation phase, XRP has historically advanced into higher ranges within the same channel. By following this trajectory upward, the analyst projects the next major peak to occur around the $25 level . The XRP $25 Price Target As of now, XRP trades at approximately $3.04. While this price is far below the proposed target, the asset remains well-positioned within the lower portion of the long-term channel. The gap between the current value and the projected $25 target is a 722.3% climb, highlighting the potential upside if XRP repeats its historical cycles . The long-term channel analysis suggests that XRP has not deviated from its established trajectory. Each major rally has respected this pattern, leading to successively higher peaks.

Ethereum, Solana, XYZVerse (XYZ), and Chainlink stand out with strong moves and rising chatter. Big changes could be on the horizon as these coins hint at a possible surge in September. Readers may want to learn why experts expect these names to make waves. Ethereum (ETH) Source: TradingView Ethereum traded between $4245 and $5136 this week. The coin is up 4.94% in 7 days, 26.08% in a month, and 88.36% over six months. The 10-day average sits at $4740.59, just above the 100-day line at $4593.48. That steady climb keeps eyes on the next move. Energy is cooling. RSI at 40.22 shows demand has dipped, Stochastic at 12.33 points to oversold ground, and MACD is negative at −14.27. These signals hint at short pauses rather than panic. As long as buyers defend 4245, the longer trend that added almost 90% in half a year stays alive. If ETH lifts through $5136, the first test waits at $5492, about 16% above the 10-day average. A clear break could open $6383, nearly 35% higher. Failure to hold $4245 risks a slide to the main support at $3710, roughly −22%, and in a harsher shakeout $2819, about −41%. The past month’s 26% jump suggests momentum favors another run, yet the chart warns that patience may be needed before the next leg. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone XYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of web3. Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms. Notably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ, the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.005, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.01. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Solana (SOL) Source: TradingView SOL keeps climbing. The token added 6.77% in the past week and 9.28% in the past month. The 6-month gain is a strong 41.54%, lifting price into the $183-$220 range. Buyers are still in control, but the move is calmer than March’s surge. The 10-day average stands at $206 while the 100-day line is $196, so short and long trends point up. RSI near 46 shows neither overbought nor oversold pressure, and a low stochastic at 31 hints at fresh demand. If bulls push above $220, the next ceiling sits at $234. A break there could open a run toward $270, about 22% above today’s high. On the downside, $161 offers the first safety net, roughly 12% below the current low. A slip under that could drag price toward $126, trimming value by about 32%. Given the steady higher lows, a move through $234 looks more likely than a dive to $161, but volume must rise to confirm it. For now, the bias stays mildly bullish with room for a 6%-22% advance if resistance cracks. Chainlink (LINK) Source: TradingView Chainlink is switching between $23.52 and $28.00 after a slow but steady week. Price rose just 1.29% in 7 days, yet the monthly chart shows a strong 42.12% jump that pushed the token above both its 10 and 100 day averages near 26. During the past 6 months, holders enjoyed a solid 69.87% run. Momentum has cooled. The RSI sits close to 52, right in the middle, while the stochastic reading at 42 hints at no clear trend. The moving averages are almost equal, telling us bulls and bears are locked. The MACD is barely above zero, signaling only mild buying pressure. Traders are watching whether the coin can build fresh energy. If LINK breaks the nearby 30 resistance, the door opens to 34.65. That path would add about 20% from today’s range high. Failure to clear 30 could push the price back to $25, then $21.21, slicing roughly 10% to 25% off recent levels. Long-term charts favor another leg up, but in the short run the coin may consolidate until volume returns. Conclusion ETH, SOL , and LINK look strong for the September surge, but XYZVerse (XYZ), first all-sport memecoin uniting fans, eyes 20,000% gains via community GameFi, media allies, and active presale.

Galaxy, Jump, and Multicoin Make $1 Billion Solana Move This initiative demonstrates the rapidly growing institutional interest in the Solana ecosystem, with major players increasingly aggressively positioning themselves in the space. Solana, in particular, has recently attracted investor attention thanks to its high transaction capacity, low-cost infrastructure, and growing decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT ecosystem. Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, previously stated that Solana is “one of Ethereum’s strongest competitors.” Jump Trading and Multicoin Capital have long been among the early-stage investors in Solana projects. Therefore, the planned $1 billion acquisition is expected to have a strong catalytic effect not only on the price but also on the development of the ecosystem. Analysts say such a large-scale investment could increase Solana's market liquidity and attract further institutional investor interest in the long term. However, they also emphasize that such demand could increase price volatility in the short term. If the funding plan goes through, this move could go down as one of the most notable corporate investments for Solana in 2025. *This is not investment advice.

Yesterday, $ETH hit $4,953, a brand-new all-time high. The second-largest crypto by market cap is now closing in on the big $5,000 mark. Ethereum Is Outperforming & Beating Bitcoin “Ethereum is showing a stronger picture compared to BTC recently. The rise in CME OI and the fact that retail has not yet joined suggest that this difference may continue in the short to medium term.” – By @cryptometugce pic.twitter.com/8gsClmpRzl — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) August 25, 2025 But the rest of the market? A bloodbath. The crypto market fell 3% in the past 24 hours. That slide wiped out $807 million in liquidations. A brutal $642 million came from long positions alone. Most major altcoins sank 4–6%. Quick numbers: $BTC: $111,347 ▼ -3.02% $ETH: $4,548 ▼ -3.61% Ethereum still looks stronger than Bitcoin. Ethereum vs Bitcoin: The Big Shift Ethereum is beating Bitcoin across multiple fronts. Analysts point to rising CME Open Interest on ETH contracts. Retail traders haven’t even piled in yet. That suggests ETH’s outperformance could continue in the short to medium term. The blockchain data backs this up. Last week, active Ethereum addresses hit 3.8 million. Yes, that’s down from the early August peak. But activity remains way above previous bull cycles. Ethereum’s network stays busy even when the broader market cools. Institutional players are loading up. Bitmine just added 190,000 $ETH last week. Their total stash? 1.71 million Ethereum. That’s massive. Tom Lee from Bitmine explains: “At BitMine, we are leading our crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV per share and by the high trading liquidity of our stock.” Numbers don’t lie. NAV at Bitmine was $22.84 in July. Now? $39.84. That’s nearly doubled in just months. And there’s more coming. Every sell-off gives treasuries cheaper ETH to scoop up. They’re not slowing down. ETH hitting new highs is one thing. Treasuries grabbing 5% of supply and staking it? That’s another level of bullishness. Analysts say that would create strong risk-reward setups for investors looking at Ethereum’s next run. Right now, ETH treasuries are gaining momentum fast. As one trader put it: “If Ethereum keeps outperforming, these asset classes are going to capitalize on the momentum. It’s incredible to see this space unfold.” The number of active Ethereum addresses reached 3.8 million last week. Although a continued decline from the early-August peak, activity remains well above levels seen during previous bull markets. pic.twitter.com/kUdWkAoNmJ — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) August 25, 2025 Ethereum’s fundamentals and institutional demand seem to be feeding off each other. $5,000 in Sight For Ethereum With ETH already brushing against $5,000, traders see the next breakout as inevitable if momentum holds. Short-term pullbacks? Treasuries and whales are buying them all. The current dip gave big players a discount window. Retail hasn’t even fully stepped in yet, another bullish sign. $BMNR Bitmine now holds 1.71M Ethereum after adding 190K $ETH last week. Tom Lee: ""At BitMine, we are leading our crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV per share and by the high trading liquidity of our stock."" NAV was $22.84 in July, now is $39.84.… pic.twitter.com/n0yQfSumpl — amit (@amitisinvesting) August 25, 2025 For now, Ethereum’s price action, on-chain activity, and institutional accumulation are setting it apart from Bitcoin. Ethereum now sits at the center of the crypto conversation. Bitcoin remains the king by market cap. But Ethereum? It’s showing the stronger chart, the busier network, and the deeper institutional interest. The road to $5,000 might see more volatility. More dips. More liquidations. But if history and the current data rhyme, Ethereum could be leading the market into its next big chapter. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Husky Inu (HINU) Rises To $0.00019979 Husky Inu (HINU) registered the latest price increase of its pre-launch stage, rising from $0.00019921 to $0.00019979. The price increase is part of the project’s pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. The pre-launch phase aims to empower the Husky Inu community and continue its fundraising efforts as its launch date draws closer. The pre-launch phase is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. The project adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, allowing it to increase the HINU token’s value every two days. This has been instrumental in the project’s fundraising efforts, helping it cross key fundraising milestones. It has also helped Husky Inu raise funds while maintaining a favorable price for its fledgling community, rewarding early adopters of the project while promoting transparent growth. The latest price increase is also significant because the next jump will see the value of the HINU token cross $0.00020, rising to $0.00020037. The $900,000 Milestone Husky Inu (HINU) is also closing in on a major fundraising milestone, and could reach $900,000 by the end of the month. The project has raised $883,157 so far thanks to a dynamic pricing strategy. Husky Inu adopted this strategy during the pre-launch phase, increasing the price of the HINU token every two days. This has allowed the project to raise funds quickly while maintaining favorable pricing and empowering its growing community.

The project crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached its latest milestone in record time, crossing $850,000 on July 25. Crypto Market Starts Week In The Red Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency markets have started the new week in bearish territory, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other cryptocurrencies trading in the red. BTC lost momentum over the weekend after Friday’s impressive rally. With sellers in control, the flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 3% over the past 24 hours, trading around $112,200. ETH registered a bigger decline after setting a new all-time high on Sunday, and is down nearly 4%, trading around $4,645. Ripple (XRP) is down over 2%, while Solana (SOL) is down over 5%, trading around $197. Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial declines.

The price action followed a Friday night AMA (Ask Me Anything) with Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson, who expressed long-term optimism for Cardano’s prospects, pointing to the upcoming Midnight Network — an initiative aimed at improving data privacy on the blockchain—as a major unlock for activity. He noted that incorporating bitcoin (BTC) into the Cardano ecosystem could expand its use cases and investor appeal. Hoskinson also discussed the market's macro events and catalysts during his AMA. He said he expects two potential catalysts to shape crypto markets in the coming months: a likely interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September and the possible passage of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (CLARITY). ADA's price action Overnight from Sunday to Monday, ADA began trading near $0.901 before surging to an intraday high of $0.963 on a spike in volume, with 333.34 million tokens exchanged during the rally, according to CoinDesk Research's data. But that momentum reversed. ADA dropped nearly 10% to a session low of $0.862 before stabilizing around current levels. Support emerged around $0.856, a level where buyers stepped in at above-average volumes, the data showed. ADA's Volatility spiked to 10.48% over the session, reflecting shifting market sentiment and heightened sensitivity to macroeconomic cues. The move coincided with the broader market as bitcoin price fell sharply on Sunday after a large whale dumped the digital assets. The broader market gauge, CoinDesk 20 Index, also fell more than 3%. While ADA is still up 125% from a year ago, the token is down more than 70% from its all-time high of $2.90, reached in August 2021. For now, though, ADA and the broader crypto market may remain range-bound as institutional investors and retail traders alike watch how regulators and central banks shape the next phase of the crypto cycle.

This trailblazing startup is poised to redefine the landscape of on-demand delivery with its innovative self-driving robots. This move signals a profound shift, promising not just convenience but also a revolutionary cost structure that could shake up established players like DoorDash and Uber Eats. For those who appreciate efficiency and groundbreaking technology, Robomart’s latest announcement presents a compelling vision for the future of urban logistics. Introducing Robomart’s Game-Changing Delivery Robot: The RM5 Robomart , a Los Angeles-based startup, has officially unveiled its latest innovation: the patented Robomart RM5. This isn’t just any vehicle; it’s a level-four autonomous delivery robot designed with a singular, ambitious goal – to make on-demand delivery truly profitable. The RM5 boasts an impressive capacity, capable of carrying up to 500 pounds of goods. Its ingenious design features 10 individual lockers, specifically engineered for batch ordering. This allows a single robot to handle multiple deliveries concurrently, maximizing efficiency and minimizing operational costs. This advanced robotics solution represents a significant leap forward in automated logistics, moving beyond simple package transport to a sophisticated, multi-order system. The Astounding $3 Flat Fee: How Robomart Challenges Food Delivery Apps One of the most compelling aspects of Robomart’s new model is its straightforward pricing structure. Customers will pay a flat $3 delivery fee, a stark contrast to the often-complex and accumulating charges typical of existing food delivery apps . Ali Ahmed, Robomart’s co-founder and CEO, highlights this as a key differentiator. Traditional platforms often include multiple service fees, surge pricing, and markups, in addition to tips, which can significantly inflate the final cost for consumers. Robomart aims to provide a transparent and attractive alternative, believing that this simplicity and affordability will resonate deeply with both customers and retailers. This aggressive pricing strategy is set to directly challenge the profitability models of industry giants. The Vision of an Autonomous Marketplace for On-Demand Delivery Robomart isn’t merely introducing a new vehicle; it’s building an entirely new ecosystem. Ahmed describes it as an “ autonomous marketplace for on-demand delivery using self-driving robots.” In this model, retailers will partner with Robomart to establish their own digital storefronts within the Robomart app, mirroring the operational framework of popular platforms like UberEats or DoorDash. The crucial distinction lies in the underlying logistics, which are entirely automated. This unique approach empowers businesses to leverage cutting-edge robotics without the extensive overheads associated with maintaining their own delivery fleets or relying on human drivers, fostering a more efficient and cost-effective retail environment. Cracking the Code of On-Demand Delivery Profitability The pursuit of profitability in the on-demand delivery sector has long been a challenge, especially when relying on human drivers. Ali Ahmed’s prior experience as the founder of Dispatch Messenger, an on-demand delivery platform in the U.K., gave him firsthand insight into these economic hurdles. He noted that human-driven models struggled to maintain profitability due to high labor costs. Robomart’s solution, centered on automation, directly addresses this. Ahmed confidently states that their robots reduce delivery costs by up to 70%. This dramatic reduction is achieved by eliminating the significant expenses associated with human labor, such as hourly wages, benefits, and vehicle maintenance, paving the way for a truly sustainable and scalable delivery service. From “Store on Wheels” to a Delivery Powerhouse Robomart’s journey began in 2017 with a different, yet equally innovative, concept: an autonomous “store on wheels.” These mobile stores, piloted in 2020, brought goods like pharmacy items and ice cream directly to customers upon request. Ahmed views the transition to a dedicated on-demand delivery model as a natural and planned progression, stating that the company always intended to tackle the broader delivery market. Despite its ambitious goals, Robomart has achieved remarkable progress with relatively modest funding, raising less than $5 million from investors including Hustle Fund, SOSV, and Wasabi Ventures. This lean approach underscores the team’s efficiency and dedication in developing five generations of robots and launching this groundbreaking autonomous marketplace . The Road Ahead: Austin Launch and Beyond The immediate future for Robomart involves onboarding retailers in its inaugural market, Austin, Texas, over the coming months. The full delivery service is slated to launch later this year. While the on-demand delivery sector is indeed crowded with formidable legacy players, Robomart believes its unique product and compelling price point will attract both retailers and consumers. The proposition of a flat $3 fee, devoid of hidden markups or additional charges, is designed to be incredibly attractive, fostering a new standard of transparency and affordability in local logistics. A New Era for Logistics and Consumer Convenience Robomart’s innovative approach to on-demand delivery , powered by its advanced delivery robot and revolutionary $3 flat fee, marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of logistics. By leveraging an “ autonomous marketplace ” model, the company aims to disrupt the status quo of food delivery apps , offering a more profitable solution for retailers and a more affordable, transparent service for consumers. As Robomart prepares for its launch in Austin, Texas, the industry watches to see if this audacious startup can truly revolutionize how goods are delivered, setting a new benchmark for efficiency and accessibility in the automated age.

He believes cryptocurrencies can play a role in diversified portfolios if safeguards are in place. Speaking at the WebX2025 digital assets forum in Tokyo, Kato expanded on this vision. He acknowledged the risks linked to digital currencies, including extreme volatility. However, he argued that these risks can be controlled if the right investment frameworks are introduced.“Cryptocurrencies could be part of diversified investments,” Kato said. He added that clear rules and a supportive ecosystem would help investors adopt them with greater confidence.He also warned against excessive restrictions that could block innovation and discourage entrepreneurs. According to Kato, the ministry’s goal is to design a framework balancing safety, innovation, and global competitiveness.Debt Burden Adds Urgency to Alternative InvestmentsKato’s remarks came at a time when Japan is dealing with a debt-to-GDP ratio surpassing 200%. This is one of the highest levels among developed nations. Economists fear that the burden could trigger financial repression, where governments manage debt using inflation, low interest rates, or currency depreciation.Such conditions hurt returns on traditional safe assets such as government bonds and savings deposits. For many investors, this strengthens the case for alternative holdings such as cryptocurrencies, which provide potential real returns and portfolio diversification.Regulatory Push: Japan Approves Yen-Backed StablecoinJapan has also made progress on regulation. The Financial Services Agency (FSA) recently approved the issuance of the first yen-denominated stablecoin . The coin, issued through Tokyo-based fintech JPYC, is expected to play a significant role in the domestic and international markets.Analysts say yen-backed stablecoins can simplify cross-border settlements and attract institutional investors. Additionally, they can enhance liquidity for government bonds by serving as reliable collateral.“Yen stablecoins can boost efficiency and build trust among institutions,” said Jamie Elkaleh, CMO at Bitget Wallet.Taxation and Policy Reforms Under ReviewJapan’s crypto investors currently face heavy taxation, with realized gains taxed at a maximum rate of 55%. Policymakers are now considering major reforms, including a separate taxation bracket that would lower the rate to 20%, aligning it closer with equity investments.Meanwhile, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has proposed reforms to prevent insider trading in digital assets. These measures would apply rules similar to those in the stock market, ensuring that malicious actors cannot profit from confidential information.Such reforms are seen as crucial steps toward making Japan’s crypto market safer, fairer, and more attractive to both local and international investors.Global Leaders Converge at WebX2025The WebX2025 forum, held on August 25–26 in Tokyo, highlighted Japan’s growing importance in the global digital assets sector. The event confirmed the presence of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato, and Tokyo’s Governor, along with many influential figures from the global crypto community.Prominent industry leaders such as Changpeng “CZ” Zhao of Binance, Justin Sun of Tron, Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz, and Arthur Hayes of Maelstrom were also in attendance.U.S. Business Interest: Trump-Linked Crypto ExpansionInternational business interest in Japan’s crypto market is also increasing. According to recent reports, Eric Trump is expected to attend the Metaplanet Shareholder Meeting in Tokyo next month, where new capital-raising options will be debated.In addition, American Bitcoin, a company backed by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., has announced expansion plans in Japan and Hong Kong. Industry experts say the move signals growing foreign confidence in Japan’s evolving digital asset framework.Japan’s approach to digital assets reflects both caution and ambition. By advancing reforms while fostering innovation, the country is building a stronger framework for a more resilient and globally competitive cryptocurrency market.",Market,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-08-25 15:35:27

A wall of sell orders hits the tape. Price drops more than 3% in minutes. Traders blink. Then scramble. The move is clean and brutal. BTC slides from $114,790 to $110,680 in a blink, a 3.58% cut inside 15 minutes. Liquidity thins on a weekend. Order books gap. Stops cascade. The market turns red.

The… pic.twitter.com/SCxTtHu9eJ — TheCryptoBasic (@thecryptobasic) August 25, 2025 Dormant coins moving is a tell. It spooks the street. As those coins hit exchanges, sellers gain courage. Bids fade. The slide accelerates. One wallet. One decision. Global impact. And the whale isn’t just exiting Bitcoin. They rotate into Ethereum. On-chain watchers track roughly $2 billion scooped in ETH. Another $1.3 billion heads straight into staking contracts soon after. Rotation trades like this can flip intraday sentiment. It did. Even after the sale, the whale remains massive. Control still sits at six figures, 152,874 BTC, north of $17 billion at current prices. Size still matters. The sequence stings because it lands into an Ethereum breakout. ETH tags a new cycle high near $4,950 over the weekend, brushing the symbolic $5,000 line for the first time. Excitement spikes. Then Bitcoin slips. Correlations bite. ETH gives back the move fast, down 6.56% to $4,646 within hours. Momentum stays linked to BTC’s stability, even on Ethereum’s best days. ETH’s new all-time high at $4,945.60 on Aug. 24, 2025. Zoom out one notch and you still see relative strength. On the week, ETH outperforms. Roughly +9% into Monday, even with the pullback. The rotation tailwind is real. Where BTC and ETH Prices Sit Now As Massive Institutional Accumulation Rages On At press time, Bitcoin trades around $111K. Volatile. Heavy volume. Still digesting the whale event. CoinMarketCap shows BTC near $111,400 with 24-hour volume above $80B. Intraday range: $110,943–$114,827. Ethereum hovers near $4,630. It printed an intraday high close to $4,951 before the fade. Turnover stays elevated versus recent weeks. Leverage takes the first hit. Liquidations spike as price snaps through local support. Weekend micro-structure magnifies the damage: fewer standing bids, wider spreads, faster gaps. It’s a reminder that whales still steer the ship when they move size through thin liquidity.

One wallet can erase a week’s worth of grind in a quarter hour. That’s the risk. The other side is conviction capital from corporates. They keep stacking. They frame weakness as opportunity. For traders, the read is simple: Respect weekend liquidity. Track dormant-coin activity. Watch ETH strength, but anchor to BTC flows. Expect rotation to snap back if Bitcoin wobbles. For long-term holders, little changes. Supply stays capped. Corporate treasuries keep accumulating. Volatility is the toll. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

According to the latest CoinShares report, this marked the largest weekly outflow since March. Despite the downturn, ETP trading volumes surged to $38 billion, about 50% above this year’s average. This reflects heightened investor activity amid shifting U.S. monetary policy signals.Bitcoin Faces Heavy OutflowsSpecifically, investment products tied to Bitcoin led the market downturn, with $1 billion in outflows last week. Investor caution was amplified early in the week when fears about the Federal Reserve’s rate stance triggered withdrawals totaling $2 billion.Although sentiment later improved, Bitcoin still ended the week deep in negative territory. Year-to-date, Bitcoin inflows represent just 11% of assets under management (AUM).Ethereum Shows Stronger ResilienceMeanwhile, Ethereum stood out with a sharper mid-week recovery, limiting its weekly outflows to $440 million. ETH is fast emerging as the preferred institutional play, with $2.5 billion in inflows month-to-date, compared to Bitcoin’s $1 billion in net outflows.

XRP-based investments attracted $25 million inflows for the week, bringing the month-to-date inflow to $173 million. The year-to-date inflow rose to $1.26 billion, with assets under management at $2.75 billion.Solana investments also performed well, with $12 million in inflows last week. Month-to-date, Solana has attracted $211 million, with year-to-date inflows totaling $1.06 billion. Solana-based products now have an AUM of around $2.9 billion.Cronos-based products saw $4.4 million in weekly inflows, bringing the year-to-date figure to $62 million and AUM to $92 million. Other crypto asset investments that recorded inflows last week included Cardano, Chainlink, and Litecoin.On the other hand, Sui (-$12.9 million) and Toncoin (-$1.5 million) experienced outflows. Nevertheless, Sui’s year-to-date inflow remains strong at $121 million, with an AUM of $322 million.Fed Policy Shifts Drive Market VolatilityThe week’s outflows and late recovery were closely tied to U.S. monetary policy. Initial pessimism surrounding the Federal Reserve’s stance drove heavy selling. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole address sparked renewed inflows of $594 million toward the end of the week.Regional Flow BreakdownRegionally, the United States recorded the largest outflow for the week, with over $1.3 billion in withdrawals.

However, sentiment shifted following Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks at the Jackson Hole Symposium, which were perceived as more dovish than expected. This reversal sparked inflows of $594 million later in the week, partially offsetting the earlier losses. Bitcoin Bears the Brunt Bitcoin products bore the majority of the pain, recording $1 billion in outflows for the week. The world’s largest cryptocurrency continues to face headwinds, with investors cautious about near-term price performance amid macroeconomic volatility. Month-to-date figures show this divergence: Bitcoin has posted net outflows of $1 billion, reflecting waning confidence, while Ethereum has managed to sustain inflows despite the broader risk-off sentiment. Year-to-date inflows for Bitcoin stand at just 11% of its total assets under management (AUM), lagging behind Ethereum. Ethereum Shows Relative Resilience Ethereum weathered the storm more effectively, with outflows limited to $440 million. Mid-week buying momentum helped offset initial pessimism, driving month-to-date inflows of $2.5 billion, compared with Bitcoin’s losses. Ethereum’s rebound was reflected in its performance relative to AUM. CoinShares reported that inflows represented 26% of total Ethereum AUM, showing stronger institutional conviction in the asset’s long-term potential. The relative resilience suggests that investors may view Ethereum as better positioned to benefit from dovish monetary indications and its evolving role in decentralized finance and staking markets. Altcoins Deliver Mixed Results Flows into alternative digital assets were varied, reflecting polarized investor appetite. XRP recorded the strongest gains, attracting $25 million, followed by Solana with $12 million and Cronos with $4.4 million. These inflows indicate selective confidence in high-cap projects with active ecosystems and institutional traction. On the other hand, emerging tokens struggled. SUI suffered the steepest losses, with $12.9 million in outflows, while TON products shed $1.5 million. The contrasting performance illustrates a market increasingly focused on established projects over speculative plays during times of macro uncertainty.

This impressive liquidity has enabled Chainlink bulls to believe LINK can reach its 2021 all-time high of $52.88, which is about 120% higher than current prices. The recent partnership with SBI Group , one of Japan’s largest financial companies with over $200 billion in assets, has made LINK bulls more confident.

Amidst this turbulence, BTC wallet cohorts are showing mixed signals, with $105K emerging as the strongest structural support level. All Eyes on $105K Support Zone BTC’s recent pullback from its all-time high of $124K has drawn attention to $105K as a potentially decisive level in the ongoing correction, according to the latest analysis shared by CryptoQuant. Wallet behavior across cohorts pointed to a mixed but telling picture of accumulation and distribution patterns. The smallest holders (0-0.1 BTC) distributed heavily at the peak but quickly returned to accumulation as prices declined. This indicates their tendency to follow rather than shape the market. Wallets holding 0.1-1 BTC, however, began accumulating at ATH levels and have maintained steady buying. Meanwhile, 1-10 BTC holders stopped distributing around $107K and have been accumulating. On the other hand, 10-100 BTC wallets shifted from accumulation at $118K into distribution, reflecting a cautious stance by this cohort. The 100-1K BTC cohort appears most crucial as they show a balance of accumulation and distribution around $105K, which means that this level is a structural support zone. Larger wallets, particularly 1K-10K BTC and 10K+ BTC holders, remain in distribution, though selling pressure has noticeably slowed as the correction deepened. Overall, distribution outweighs accumulation, but the intensity is waning. If Bitcoin revisits $105K, CryptoQuant stated that this level will be tested as a critical “last stronghold.” A breakdown below could spark increased fear and accelerate selling, while strength could mean that the asset is poised for a stronger recovery. While wallet cohorts reveal cautious accumulation and distribution patterns, the derivatives market has already flushed weak hands through a major long squeeze. Weak Hands Flushed? Bitcoin’s plunge has triggered millions in long liquidations, wiping out late buyers who had piled in with excessive leverage. The event, known as a long squeeze, unfolded as forced sell orders cascaded through the derivatives market, which collapsed open interest and dragged Binance’s cumulative net taker volume to -$1 billion. While the violent move rattled sentiment, it also performed a structural “reset” – overextended positions were flushed, leverage was reduced, and weak hands were shaken out. This cleanup leaves the market leaner and less vulnerable to further forced selling, but experts stated that with open interest reset and speculative froth drained, conditions now resemble a healthier foundation for upside.

The token made a session high of $4.80 and a low of $4.38, initially advancing to $4.80 before declining sharply to $4.43 by morning hours, then consolidating around $4.45 with modest recovery indicators in the final trading hour, the model showed. Significant volume-backed support materialized around the $4.38-$4.41 price zone, where institutional buying emerged, with the final hour demonstrating recovery momentum toward $4.45, suggesting potential market stabilization following the 9% decline from peak to trough, according to the model. The drop in APT came as the wider crypto market also fell, with the broader market gauge, the Coindesk 20, down 3.2%. In recent trading, Aptos was 3.7% lower over 24 hours, trading around $4.43. On the news front, the EXPO2025 digital wallet, powered by Aptos, had half a million new accounts and 4.4 million transactions, according to a recent post on X . Meanwhile, DeFi lending protocol Aave r ecently launched on Aptos . This marked Aave's first-ever deployment on a non-EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible blockchain. Technical Analysis: Exceptional trading volume of 6.6 million during 19:00 hour supported initial rally, followed by sustained volume support around $4.38-$4.41 price zone. Clear ascending channel formation with successive higher lows at $4.39, $4.42, and $4.45 levels during the recovery phase. Three distinct volume-driven rallies during the final hour breakout above $4.41 resistance level. Strong institutional buying interest emerged at $4.38-$4.41 zone, establishing key support following 9% decline from peak. The next psychological resistance level was identified at $4.50 following a successful breakout above $4.41.

Market sentiment turned sour with the crypto fear and greed index dipping back deep into neutral territory to 47, as traders switched back into risk-off mode. At press time, total crypto market capitalization had dropped over 2% in the past 24 hours to $3.96 trillion. Altcoins showed little resistance, with most large-cap tokens swimming in red amid the broader market unease. Why is the Bitcoin price going down? Bitcoin dropped under $110K after a major whale dumped 24,000 BTC on the market, which in turn triggered an avalanche of liquidations. The size of the sell-off—worth over $2.6 billion at the time—unleashed a wave of forced selling that liquidated more than $550 million in leveraged long positions. This sharp move erased weeks of slow upward momentum and caught many traders off guard. The abrupt liquidation cascade didn’t just hit speculative positions—it also rattled confidence across the broader market. As price briefly fell below the key psychological support near $110,000, traders began trimming risk exposure, opting to sit on the sidelines rather than try and catch a falling knife. Volatility surged, and trading desks reported elevated funding rate swings across major exchanges. Adding to the pressure, institutional flows also reversed course. Global crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) saw $1.43 billion in net outflows last week, according to CoinShares—snapping a two-week inflow streak that had pulled in $4.3 billion. Bitcoin bore the brunt of that reversal, with investors rotating out of spot exposure as the asset failed to hold above the $116K level it reached just days earlier. While the price has recovered slightly to hover around $111K–$112K, the market remains on edge. All eyes are now on whether BTC can build a base above $112K or if another leg down awaits. Will Bitcoin price crash? Right now, the $112K level has emerged as a fragile line of defence in the short term. On August 25, BTC already dipped below this mark during intraday action, suggesting that the bulls are struggling to regain firm control. If price fails to hold above this zone over the next few sessions, it could confirm a bearish breakdown and open the door to further losses, according to some market watchers. See below. Merlijn The Trader @MerlijnTrader · Follow THE BITCOIN REALITY CHECKEveryone loves the pump.But the chart is screaming: Double Top.$112K is the last stand.If it breaks, $BTC won’t dip… it will cascade.Weak hands get liquidated.Strong hands reload.Survive this wipeout, and you’ll come out a true legend. 1:30 pm · 25 Aug 2025 705 Reply Copy link Read 84 replies Data from CoinGlass’ 24-hour liquidation heatmap reveals significant concentrations of bid liquidity stacked in the $110,500 to $109,700 range. These heat zones—highlighted in brighter green—point to areas where large buy orders could temporarily stabilise price or serve as magnet zones for liquidity sweeps. But the pressure may not stop there. The heatmap also shows deeper bid walls building down toward $108,000, a sign that some traders expect the price to revisit lower supports before any meaningful bounce. In essence, the market may be bracing for one final liquidity flush to absorb remaining leverage and set the stage for a recovery. Such a move wouldn’t be unusual in a post-liquidation environment. When large clusters of long positions get wiped out, the price often seeks out remaining pockets of liquidity below support to complete the shakeout. That means Bitcoin could still drift lower in the coming hours or days, even if temporarily, before sentiment resets. For now, BTC remains stuck in no man’s land between weak support and heavy resistance, with the liquidation footprint hinting that another test of the lower ranges is not off the table. Whether bulls step in at $110K or wait until $108K may determine how quickly Bitcoin finds its footing again. A break below these levels would mean a visit towards “100k’s” according to pseudonymous analyst Dentoshi, who added that the market was in a “wait & see” mode. Dentoshi @Dentoshi · Follow $BTC imo you doom post BELOW support, not at support, but maybe that’s just me. lose 109k’s and we can talk 100k’s, for now it’s just a wait & see. 7:53 pm · 25 Aug 2025 134 Reply Copy link Read 21 replies Some more bad tidings came from fellow market watcher AlejandroBTC, who flagged a multi-month head and shoulders pattern, a classic bearish reversal setup, which now appears to be breaking down. BTC/USD 12h price chart. Source: AlejandroBTC Based on a BTC/USD 12h price chart, the analyst speculated a massive drop to lows around $50k. On the contrary, some commentators expect a much less severe correction and a gradual recovery back towards previous highs in the coming months. See below. Johnny @CryptoGodJohn · Follow $BTC plan for next 4-6 weeks 8:21 pm · 24 Aug 2025 2.0K Reply Copy link Read 383 replies For now, a short-term recovery may only be expected if BTC manages to stabilise above $112k, unless a major bullish catalyst hits the market. When writing, Bitcoin was hovering just above the $112k mark with over 2% losses on the daily timeframe. Altcoin prices today In the past 24 hours, the altcoin market cap fell 1.7% to $1.69 trillion. Ethereum (ETH), the largest altcoin by market capitalisation, declined 3.4%, ending its rally shortly after reaching an all-time high of $4,900, where it faced resistance at the $5,000 level. The dip in ETH price also coincided with $370.6 million in liquidations, including $314.2 million from long positions, erasing much of the gains driven by Powell’s dovish signal on potential Fed rate cuts in September during the Jackson Hole rally. Other major altcoins like XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), Tron (TRX), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) experienced losses ranging between 2-5% respectively. Within the top 100 altcoins, Hyperliquid (HYPE), BitTorrent (BTT), and VeChain (VET) recorded the day’s comparatively better performances, although their gains remained modest against the broader market downturn.

The firm filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking approval for the Canary American-Made Crypto ETF. According to the company’s S-1 filing submitted last Friday in Delaware, if the product is cleared, it would track the so-called Made-in-America Blockchain Index and would trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange under the ticker “MRCA.” Moreover, the crypto investment vehicle would hold a portfolio of cryptos that meet at least one of three criteria: the asset was originally created in the US, the majority of tokens were minted domestically through native validation methods such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, or the protocol’s core operations are US-based. Examples of eligible tokens include Uniswap (UNI), Chainlink (LINK), and Solana (SOL), although the exact composition will depend on index methodology. Get ready for ETF combos, Bloomberg ETF analyst says Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, who first reported the filing on social platform X on Monday, noted that an approval could spur creativity in crypto ETF proposals, and the market will see funds that are very different from the currently approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. “ As we’ve predicted, thanks to the category’s success, get ready for ETFs to try every combo imaginable ,” Balchunas wrote. I’m not even totally sure what would make it in this and what wouldn’t. Maybe easier to ask: what major coins wouldn’t be in for sure? — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 25, 2025 However, he admitted that there’s an uncertainty over which tokens would definitively qualify. “I’m not even totally sure what would make it in this and what wouldn’t. Maybe easier to ask: what major coins wouldn’t be in for sure?” he posted. The Canary American Made Crypto ETF, which is dubbed a Delaware statutory trust, will issue shares that represent beneficial interests, are continuous, and registered under the Securities Act of 1933. It is different from mutual funds or ETFs governed by the Investment Company Act of 1940, meaning investors will not receive protections typical of regulated investment companies. Alongside passively tracking the Made-in-America Blockchain Index, the trust could seek secondary rewards by participating in network validation activities where possible, the filing read. According to an August 23 Cryptopolitan report , Canary Capital also submitted a revised S-1 form for another spot vehicle, the Canary XRP ETF. That fund would directly hold Ripple’s native token XRP, using the CoinDesk XRP CCIX New York Rate as its benchmark, and listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Institutions are more optimistic about XRP fund approvals after the SEC officially dropped its remaining appeal against Ripple in early August, closing a legal dispute that began in December 2020. Judge Analisa Torres had issued a split decision on the SEC’s case against Ripple in July 2023, ruling that XRP qualified as a security when sold to institutional investors, but not when traded on public exchanges. About a year later, she imposed a $125 million fine on Ripple. After Donald Trump’s reelection as the 47th President of the United States, a more crypto-friendly SEC joined Ripple in asking Torres to lift the injunction and reduce the penalty to $50 million. Federal Judge Torres rejected the request, stating that neither party had demonstrated “exceptional circumstances” that would outweigh the public interest in enforcing her earlier ruling. Her ruling has kept the injunction and the $125 million fine in force. “ Accordingly, if jurisdiction were restored to this court, the court would deny the parties’ request to vacate the injunction and reduce the civil penalty ,” she told the two entities’ attorneys. Canary’s filings follow more proposals that have been sent to the SEC, including one from rival asset manager Grayscale Investments which submitted a registration statement to convert its existing private Avalanche Fund into a publicly traded trust.

Such a development could transform DOGE’s market dynamics, attracting institutional capital and fueling a significant price rally. But how likely is ETF approval, and what can investors realistically expect? Why a Dogecoin ETF Matters More Than Ever ETFs have become the bridge between traditional finance and crypto markets. When the first Bitcoin ETF launched in Canada and later in the U.S., it opened the gates for institutional investors who had previously been sidelined by regulatory uncertainty. Dogecoin’s ETF would follow this blueprint, making the asset easily accessible on regulated exchanges for mutual funds, pension plans, and retail investors. According to Crypto Fund Research, the total assets under management in crypto ETFs grew by over 120% in 2024 alone, signaling soaring investor appetite for regulated crypto products. Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa recently noted on Twitter, “A Dogecoin ETF isn’t just hype anymore. The SEC is warming up to altcoin ETFs, and DOGE stands a real shot in 2025. The question isn’t if but when.”. What Are the Chances of Approval? The SEC’s regulatory stance has shifted from outright rejection to cautious acceptance. In 2024, the SEC approved several Bitcoin futures ETFs and hinted at the possibility of altcoin ETFs in the near future. Dogecoin’s unique challenge is that it’s considered a “meme coin,” which historically made regulators wary of its volatility and speculative nature. However, growing institutional interest and Dogecoin’s improved network fundamentals are softening this stance. Legal expert and crypto regulatory consultant Jake Chervinsky commented in Forbes. “While the SEC remains cautious, recent statements suggest altcoin ETFs, especially for coins with significant market caps like DOGE, are becoming more plausible. The market should prepare for a potential approval in late 2025.” Analysts estimate the probability of a Dogecoin ETF approval within the next 12-18 months at around 60-70%, factoring in the regulatory environment and market demand. Expected Market Impact: Realistic Gains or Overhyped? When the first Bitcoin ETFs launched, BTC saw a rapid price appreciation of 40-60% in the months following approval, driven largely by fresh institutional money. Dogecoin’s market cap is smaller but growing steadily, currently hovering near $10 billion. This makes it attractive for investors looking for high-beta altcoin exposure. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone projects that a Dogecoin ETF could trigger a 50-150% price increase in the first year, especially if it coincides with a broader altcoin rally. Moreover, the ETF could drive Dogecoin’s adoption beyond crypto-native investors, as it becomes part of standard investment portfolios and retirement accounts. However, experts warn against expecting a repeat of Dogecoin’s historic parabolic runs without considering wider market trends and macroeconomic factors. Risks Investors Should Not Ignore Even with positive momentum, risks persist. The SEC could delay decisions, or impose conditions that limit the ETF’s impact. Additionally, Dogecoin’s price has been historically volatile, with large swings driven by social media trends and influencer endorsements. Market strategist Lyn Alden noted in her recent newsletter, “ETF approval alone won’t guarantee a sustained rally if macroeconomic headwinds remain strong or if crypto sentiment turns bearish.” What Should Investors Do Now? Given these factors, investors might consider positioning for a potential Dogecoin ETF approval with a balanced approach: Start Small: Accumulate DOGE gradually rather than all at once to manage volatility risks. Follow Regulatory News Closely: ETF approvals hinge on regulatory updates, so staying informed is key. Consider the Bigger Crypto Cycle: Dogecoin will likely perform best if the altcoin season aligns with ETF momentum. Final Takeaway The possibility of a Dogecoin ETF approval in 2025 is no longer just speculative chatter—it’s a tangible event with meaningful market consequences. Analysts and regulatory insiders estimate a solid 60-70% chance the SEC will approve the ETF within the next year or two. For investors, this could mean a rare chance to get in early on a regulated, mainstream crypto product that offers both exposure to the meme coin phenomenon and access to institutional capital inflows. Still, caution is warranted. ETF approval could spark a major rally—but it is just one piece of a complex market puzzle.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-25 15:57:05

Existing investors can expect a minimum of 300% ROI on listing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has smashed over $14.83 million and has surpassed 15700 investors so far. While Cardano (ADA) languishes in waits at the top and experts warn of a potential correction to $0.70, Mutuum Finance is forging its own path with innovative decentralized lending mechanisms and increased investor interest. Cardano (ADA): Overview Cardano (ADA) trades at around $0.93, with subdued trading in a tight intraday range of between about $0.82 low and about $0.94 high, consistent with the general market’s risk-off sentiment. An established Layer-1 blockchain, Cardano is moving slowly but surely, with addition of features like the Basho era scaling and the Voltaire era to be introduced that will introduce on-chain governance and treasury features. Meanwhile investor’s focus is now beginning to shift towards new opportunities, such as Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Stage 6 Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in presale round six and sells for $0.035 per token. Once the round is finished, the price rises 14.29% to $0.04 as demand spikes and early adopters have faith in the project. The presale has already gained over 15,650 investors and over $14.82 million in funding, with signs of early strength and investor demand. A USD-Pegged Stablecoin on Ethereum Mutuum Finance will launch a USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain for the purpose of having a stable, secure, and transparent store of value. The stablecoin will serve as a stable digital currency for everyday transactions, decentralized applications, and long-term portfolio stability. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins, which have always been prone to market volatility, this asset is designed with the intention of reducing speculation and not being held back by the limitation of high volatility. Dual-Lending: Future-Proof DeFi Infrastructure Mutuum Finance provides a dual-lending architecture through which automation converges with user-defined control to create a highly effective and adaptive decentralized finance ecosystem. Peer-to-Contract lending is made possible through self-executing smart contracts that permit lending and borrowing without intervention. Automatically adjusting interest rates in real time based on supply and demand in the marketplace, and it is an open and autonomous process. Peer-to-Peer lending takes it one step further by permitting the negotiation of borrowers and lenders with one another. In this case, the intermediaries are bypassed and users are given greater control to negotiate and set terms and transactions, offering convenience of platform and access. By using this two-pronged approach, Mutuum Finance is a future-proofed, secure infrastructure that functions to enhance financial inclusion, achieve stable returns, and create opportunity for retail and institutional players alike. Its focus on security, transparency, and scalability lays the groundwork for a sustainable and growth-oriented DeFi ecosystem. Mutuum Finance Provides Stability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) announced the official Bug Bounty Program with the reward pool valued at $50,000 USDT. Four severities will be chosen by the project: critical, major, minor, and low. The project is also conducting a $100,000 giveaway for the project community. 10 investors have opportunities to win $10,000 Mutuum Finance tokens. Cardano (ADA) is at around $0.93, with the warning of a correction to $0.70 before any meaningful breakout. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining unstoppable traction in the DeFi space, trading at $0.035 in phase 6 of the presale. During phase 7, the price will increase by 14.29% to $0.04, with over $14.82 million already funded and 15,650+ investors signed up. Get your MUTM tokens now and get ahead of the next DeFi wave.

50660882,564444,1756137601,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50660882.jpeg,"Crypto News: Trump’s Attention Shifts As Powell Turns Dovish, Threatens To Fire Fed Governor — Details",https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-news-today/,"US President Donald Trump is once again turning his attention to the Federal Reserve (FED) as Chair Jerome Powell adopts a more dovish tone on monetary policy. Trump has openly threatened to dismiss FED Governor Lisa Cook, escalating political pressure on the central bank at a time when markets are already rattled by shifting rate expectations. FED Governor Under Fire Over Trump Fraud Claims Trump’s ongoing clash with the Federal Reserve has intensified, with his latest focus shifting toward Cook, a Biden appointee. Trump has openly declared that if Cook does not resign from her role as the FED Governor, he will move to fire her, citing allegations of mortgage fraud. CNBC’s Sara Einstein revealed that Cook allegedly misrepresented primary residences during her tenure at the FED. Reports further claim that Cook listed an Atlanta property as her primary residence while simultaneously offering it for rent, raising questions about potential misconduct. The controversy quickly escalated after Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte referred the FED Governor to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for criminal investigation. DOJ Special Attorney Ed Martin is now said to be reviewing the matter. Under Section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act, the President can dismiss a FED governor with cause. This means that if evidence substantiates Trump’s claims, Cook’s role could be in jeopardy. However, CNBC’s Steve Liesman argues that this situation appears to be politically motivated. Liesman stressed that foreign and former central bankers view the new focus on Cook as part of Trump’s wider strategy to consolidate influence over the Federal Reserve, rather than an isolated misconduct case. He observed that had it not been Cook, the administration would likely have directed similar scrutiny toward other FED officials in a broader push to exert pressure on the institution. While some see the allegations as a political attack on the Federal Reserve’s independence, Einstein maintains that if Cook indeed violated housing and mortgage laws, the matter deserves full legal attention. For now, Cook remains in her position as FED Governor, but the mounting pressure from the White House signals that the dispute between Trump and the Federal Reserve is far from over. Possible Rate Cuts Put Crypto In Focus Notably, Trump’s threats toward Governor Cook come after Powell struck a more cautious and accommodative tone at the annual Jackson Hole conference this month. The FED Chair signaled that rate cuts could be warranted given the slowing economy and difficulties in the labor market. While he did not explicitly confirm an upcoming monetary easing, Powell emphasized that the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) decisions would remain guided by economic data and not political influence. Interestingly, the FED Chair’s new dovish stance has sparked discussions across financial markets. For the crypto sector, the implications could be particularly significant. Historically, rate cuts and lower borrowing costs have driven liquidity into riskier asset classes. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum typically benefit from the increased capital inflows and bullish sentiment that follow such decisions.",Crypto News|Bill Pulte|bitcoin|CNBC|crypto|department of justice|DOJ|Donald Trump|Ed Martin|Ethereum|Federal Housing Finance Agency|federal open market committee|Federal Reserve Act|FOMC|Jackson Hole|Lisa Cook|Sara Einstein|White House,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|FIAT|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-25 16:00:01

Since early August, PEPE has dipped over 18% , yet it continues to hold firm above the key $0.00001010 support level. In the past 24 hours, trading volume has surged, initially spiking past $500 million before climbing to over $1.1 billion at the time of writing – a sign that momentum may be shifting. $PEPE this trendline is key to hold above for now. Strong zone at .00001000-.00001050 Volume above 1 billion. #memecoin pic.twitter.com/Nk5vVM3LSL — Pepe Whale (@pepeethwhale) August 25, 2025 This volume surge aligns with historical patterns that previously drove the frog-themed memecoin to a massive 798% breakout. The bullish pennant formation during Ethereum’s strong rally creates a perfect setup for PEPE to make its move. Pepe Price Prediction: Bullish Pennant Reveals Incoming 798% Pump PEPE is currently consolidating within a long-term ascending triangle, with price hugging the lower trendline while holding above the key $0.00001010 support zone. The chart shows a clear resistance band just above $0.00002300 , which has capped multiple previous rally attempts. A confirmed breakout above this level could trigger a massive upside move, with the projected target extending toward $0.00009345 – a potential gain of over 790% from current levels. However, the RSI sits around 40 , suggesting weak short-term momentum, while the MACD histogram shows mild positive divergence. The structure remains bullish as long as the ascending support line holds. If bulls defend the base and break resistance with volume, PEPE could enter a steep rally phase toward new highs. The last time Pepe formed a bullish pennant in November 2023, prices surged 225% within 14 days after the breakout. I can’t get over how good $pepe looks in this bullish pennant. #pepe pic.twitter.com/eepGRm2e1Q — Chandler (@ChandlerCharts) November 17, 2024 It looks like PEPE whales are waking up again to repeat history. A legendary PEPE trader has returned after 5 months of inactivity to buy $2 million worth of PEPE. According to Arkham Intelligence data , the whale still holds 1.31 trillion PEPE at an average cost of $0.00001683. The top 80 PEPE wallets continue increasing their holdings, meaning buyers are outpacing sellers significantly, which is a key requirement for a bullish pennant breakout. Source: Bubblemaps Snorter Bot Presale Mimics Early Pepe Vibes Top meme coins like Pepe are showing signs of life and retail traders are now shifting focus to early-stage projects with 100x potential . One standout presale is Snorter Bot (SNORT) , which gives holders access to a powerful Telegram trading bot designed to automatically detect and buy trending meme coins before they take off.

50660925,https://timestabloid.com/?p=80083,1756137627,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top Crypto Presales Turning Heads Right Now,https://timestabloid.com/top-crypto-presales-turning-heads-right-now/,"Entering the market early can be the game-changer for anyone looking at explosive upside. A top crypto presale gives the advantage of buying at a fraction of the future launch price, locking in potential for major returns. The key is finding projects that combine strong narratives, credible development, and active ecosystems. Mid-August 2025 has seen a handful of presales stand out from the crowd, each for different reasons, from unique token utility to strong branding that resonates with the community. Among these, Cold Wallet has made significant noise with its aggressive growth strategy and well-defined ecosystem. Maxi Doge leans into meme coin culture with bold marketing, Bitcoin Hyper pushes for technological breakthroughs on Bitcoin’s scalability, and TOKEN6900 proves that raw community hype can drive huge early-stage growth. Each has unique strengths that make them contenders in the top crypto presale space this month. 1. Cold Wallet – Utility at the Core Cold Wallet is in Stage 17 of a 150-stage top crypto presale , with each stage increasing the token price. Right now, CWT trades at $0.00998, with $5.9 million already raised and over 703 million tokens sold. The launch price is fixed at $0.3517, meaning current buyers are looking at around a 37× potential return. Those who got in at Stage 1’s $0.007 could see up to 50× gains, and projections suggest there’s room for even more as the platform scales. The project’s listing on CoinMarketCap boosts its credibility, making it one of the most-watched presales right now. Its real strength lies in its live mobile app available on Android and iOS, offering cashback in CWT for gas fees, swaps, on/off ramps, and more, all without requiring lockups. The acquisition of Plus Wallet for $270 million instantly brought 2 million active users to the ecosystem. With active referral programs paying in USDT and CWT rewards, Cold Wallet is positioned as a functional, widely usable product that’s ready for mainstream growth. It’s not just a hype token; it’s a real platform with traction in place before launch, making it a front-runner among top crypto presale picks. 2. Maxi Doge – Meme Muscle with Market Momentum Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has been crafting its own lane in the top crypto presale space by fusing meme culture with a bold, gym-inspired brand identity. Priced at $0.111784, its presale has moved fast, hitting $500K early in August, then blasting past $750K by mid-month, and crossing $800K shortly after. This pace suggests the $1M mark is in sight. The supply is set at 150.24 billion tokens, with funds split between marketing, liquidity, development, and a Maxi Fund aimed at expansion. What’s made Maxi Doge stand out is its unapologetic approach to targeting high-energy traders who want more than the typical meme coin. With trading contests and leaderboard competitions planned, it’s not just selling a story; it’s building engagement loops to keep users involved post-launch. Analysts have tipped it as a potential 100× play, thanks to its strong early numbers and branding that cuts through the noise. The combination of aggressive marketing allocation and community buzz puts it firmly among the top crypto presale names of August. 3. Bitcoin Hyper – Bitcoin’s Layer-2 Evolution Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) takes a more technical approach to the top crypto presale game. Positioned as the first true Layer-2 for Bitcoin built on the Solana Virtual Machine, it’s tackling Bitcoin’s speed and scalability issues head-on. The presale price sits at around $0.012675, with over $9M raised and a string of high-value whale buys, including one worth $161K. The token allocation prioritizes development, treasury reserves, marketing, rewards, and exchange listings. The platform enables users to lock BTC and mint wrapped versions on its L2, supporting everything from DeFi to payments. With ZK-proof security and periodic settlement on Bitcoin’s base layer, it’s combining scalability with safety. Analysts see big upside potential, with some forecasting up to 2,434% gains by year-end if adoption moves quickly. In a market often dominated by hype over substance, Bitcoin Hyper is appealing to those who want a strong technical foundation alongside the growth potential of a top crypto presale . 4. TOKEN6900 – Pure Meme Power TOKEN6900 ($T6900) proves that even without traditional utility, a meme coin can dominate the conversation in the top crypto presale circuit. With over $1.6M raised so far and a hard cap of $5M, it’s moving quickly through its 30-stage pricing plan, currently around $0.00695 per token. Eighty percent of the 930,993,091 total supply is allocated to presale buyers, with tokenomics geared heavily toward marketing, liquidity, and development. The project thrives on absurdity, branding itself as offering “nothing” except community-driven hype. This approach taps directly into the viral meme coin playbook, where identity and humor are as important as price action. Analysts suggest it could reach $0.05–$0.08 long term, with even more optimistic scenarios for 2026 and beyond. While it’s a high-risk option, TOKEN6900’s rapid funding and strong online presence make it an undeniable contender in the current top crypto presale landscape. Summing Up While each project in this top crypto presale roundup offers something unique, from Maxi Doge’s cultural punch to Bitcoin Hyper’s technical vision and TOKEN6900’s viral energy, Cold Wallet blends all the right elements for long-term impact. It’s already functional, has an existing user base in the millions, and a launch price that gives current buyers a massive potential upside. The combination of working tech, strong financial backing, and clear utility makes Cold Wallet the one to watch closely before this presale moves too far ahead. For those looking to secure a position before the market catches on, this is a window that’s still open, but not for long.

However, despite the bullish price action, warning signs are flashing on the technical front as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a rare divergence. With price pushing higher but momentum indicators losing steam, ETH now faces a critical test on its path toward the much-anticipated $5,000 milestone. Ethereum Breaks Record With Weekly Close Above $4,600 GrayWolf6, in a recent post on X, highlighted that ETH has achieved a significant milestone by closing the weekly candle above $4,600. This level had previously marked the highest weekly close, and as anticipated, ETH went on to set a new all-time high (ATH) last week. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Squeezed In Falling Channel – Bulls Eye Rebound To $4,788 If This Support Holds Currently, ETH is trading within the upper resistance zone of the $3,900–$4,800 range. This region is historically challenging and could invite selling pressure as traders look to secure profits. GrayWolf6 noted that his outlook is for ETH to attempt a push beyond the $5,000 mark. Such a move would not only confirm strong bullish momentum but also open the door for further upside targets as buyers maintain control of the trend. He added that the $5,100 level is especially critical to watch in the coming days. GrayWolf6 concluded by stating that he will be monitoring developments closely throughout the week and sharing updates accordingly. Choppy Price Action Likely As Market Tests Momentum Another analyst, Cryptonite, recently shared an update highlighting the mixed signals currently appearing on Ethereum’s chart. He noted that the chart is presenting a rare and somewhat messy pattern, where price has been making higher highs while the RSI has printed lower highs, a classically bearish divergence. However, the RSI is also showing higher lows, which signals that the downside momentum may not be as strong as it initially appears to be. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Crash: $2 Billion In Losses Is Waiting For Traders At This Level This unusual setup has left ETH in a rather complex position. Cryptonite explained that as long as the RSI maintains these higher lows, the long-term outlook remains favorable for the bulls, despite the short-term volatility. This makes sense given that ETH is currently trading around its all-time high levels, a zone that naturally attracts both profit-taking and renewed buying interest, leading to unpredictable price swings. Another factor worth watching, according to Cryptonite, is trading volume. Despite ETH recording higher highs in price, volume has been declining, which could be a warning sign of weakening momentum. Until stronger participation returns, ETH’s next major move may remain uncertain, with volatility likely to dominate in the short term.

In the tweet, the user stated that it now takes 2,486 XRP to be positioned within the top ten percent of all accounts. The post was accompanied by a table outlining percentile thresholds and account balances, as well as a pie chart providing a visual representation of the distribution. WOW! #XRP RICH LIST UPDATE: It now takes 2,486 $XRP to rank in the TOP 10% of holders The bar keeps rising… are you in? pic.twitter.com/sE4WTzdBdA — XRP Governor (@xrpgovernor) August 25, 2025 Breakdown of the Data According to the figures shared, the top ten percent of accounts, representing 663,301 wallets, each hold at least 2,486 XRP. Moving higher, the top five percent, or 331,651 accounts, maintain a minimum balance of 8,758 XRP. The threshold for the top four percent is 11,033 XRP, spread across 265,321 accounts. For the top 3%, 198,990 accounts hold at least 16,299 XRP, while the top 2%, covering 132,660 accounts, require holdings of 25,639 XRP or more. The one percent threshold shows 66,330 accounts with a minimum balance of 50,637 XRP. The half-percentile level is set at 100,000 XRP across 33,165 accounts. For the highest levels of concentration, 0.2 percent of accounts hold 200,099 XRP or greater, 0.1 percent hold at least 369,080 XRP, and the top 0.01 percent consists of just 663 accounts holding no less than 5,730,534 XRP. Visual Representation The pie chart included in the post segments these percentile groups, giving a clearer picture of distribution across the XRP ledger . The chart shows the bulk of accounts concentrated in lower balance ranges, with each narrowing percentile requiring increasingly higher amounts of XRP. The highlighted focus remains on the top ten percent, which, according to the post, has now crossed the 2,486 XRP threshold. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications of the Update While no direct comparison to past data was included in the tweet, the claim that the “bar keeps rising” suggests an upward adjustment from previous reports of distribution levels . This implies that wallet balances in the higher percentile ranges may be consolidating further or that smaller accounts are being outpaced as accumulation continues among a portion of holders. The latest update from XRP Governor describes a higher entry point for the top 10% of XRP holders , now set at 2,486 XRP. While the post does not clarify its source or methodology, it reinforces the narrative that concentration among larger holders continues to play a defining role in XRP’s overall distribution.

50661114,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=791998,1756137765,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50661114.jpeg,Software stocks lose steam as AI shifts investor bets,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/software-stocks-struggling-ai-expectations/,"Software’s long streak as a Wall Street favorite is wobbling as artificial intelligence resets expectations. Salesforce Inc., Adobe Inc., and ServiceNow Inc. are among the S&P 500’s weakest names this year, each down at least 16%, wiping out roughly $160 billion in combined market value. Investors pulled money from the software and services group for two consecutive months through June after just one monthly drawdown in the prior 18. “Tech obsolescence can come out of nowhere,” said Robert Ruggirello, chief investment officer at Brave Eagle Wealth Management. “There’s good reason people are growing cautious.” Not all software stocks are suffering Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp., and Palantir Technologies Inc., all software makers, are among the year’s top performers in the S&P 500. What separates them, in many investors’ eyes, is that they are playing offense with AI rather than just defending existing franchises, as the largest tech companies spend tens of billions of dollars to roll out products and add capacity for AI computing. Meta Platforms Inc. is seeing accelerating revenue growth as its AI efforts improve ad targeting and user engagement. Palantir’s AI products are expected to help fuel sales growth of 45% this year. Cybersecurity names such as CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. have also thrived, backed by the view that AI cannot easily replace their core offerings. The strain is not limited to the U.S. SAP SE, Europe’s biggest company by market value, fell alongside smaller peers such as Sage Group Plc and Dassault Systèmes SE after Monday.com’s warning. With OpenAI’s ChatGPT now boasting roughly 700 million weekly users, Ruggirello likens software vendors to “an energy company waking up and realizing there’s now a company the size of Exxon it’s competing with.” That worry shows up in valuations. The Morgan Stanley software basket traded this month at 23 times projected earnings, half the average of the past decade and the lowest level in Bloomberg data back to 2014. By comparison, the Nasdaq 100 changes hands at just under 27 times forecast earnings. Some on Wall Street see opportunity in the selloff. Strategists at UBS said earlier this month that the selloff in parts of software could open doors, recommending that investors look at internet and software firms that have lagged the AI craze. “While AI revenue growth has yet to match the industry’s aggressive spending, rising monetization and AI adoption trends have been encouraging,” strategists led by Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer Americas and global head of equities, wrote in a note. Even so, wariness is hard to miss. In the two decades before the 2021 market peak, no S&P 500 industry group lifted its weight as much as software and services, climbing from less than 6% to nearly 14.5%, even after Google, Facebook, and Amazon.com were moved to other sectors in 2018. The group’s share now sits around 12% and has been eclipsed by semiconductor companies benefiting from surging demand for computing hardware. If not for the outperformance of Microsoft, Oracle, and Palantir, the sector’s weight would be lower. “The perception is that risk has gotten much higher, and we’re not going to get clarity anytime soon,” Ruggirello said. “All we can really say right now is that a few companies like Meta and Microsoft seem to be winning, and they keep winning. It certainly isn’t everyone.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The token is now testing a key resistance level that could determine its next major move. A wave of strong protocol developments and economic upgrades is creating new utility and demand for the token. While the outcome remains uncertain, the combination of solid fundamentals and technical strength suggests this rally has substance beyond short-term speculation. Source: Coingecko HIP-3 and stHYPE: Builders, Staking, and Liquidity Deepen $HYPE Demand Hyperliquid’s $HYPE is the native token of a high-throughput Layer-1 blockchain that powers perpetuals DEX using a fully on-chain Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) and supports smart contracts through its integrated EVM (HyperEVM). $HYPE is used for gas, staking, and governance. With HIP-3 , builders can deploy permissionless perp markets by staking 1M $HYPE tokens as a security bond and share fees with backers, further tightening token and product alignment. On fundamentals, Hyperliquid routes protocol fees into its Assistance Fund and HLP, which programmatically buys back $HYPE. Analyses and on-chain data indicate that protocol revenue is split between the Assistance Fund and HLP is 54% and 46%, respectively. According to DefiLlama , $HYPE has a TVL of about $686M, $5.4M in 24-hour fees, and $104M in 30-day fees — reflecting steady cash flow that supports the token. The ecosystem shows sizable traction, with on-chain activity reaching over 44,000 daily active addresses in June , averaging around 33,000 in the first half. Growth is supported by the addition of liquid staking via stHYPE and further strengthened by Valantis’ acquisitions. Valantis has acquired the @stakedhype protocol. Re-Introducing $stHYPE , the Modular LST: pic.twitter.com/An6t9v6smG — Valantis Labs (@ValantisLabs) August 19, 2025 Furthermore, HyperEVM, the Ethereum-compatible smart contract layer launched in February 2025, quickly gained traction— reaching nearly $2 billion in TVL as of mid‑July , ranking it among the top ten Layer-1 blockchains in DeFi. Its integration with HyperCore via the July 5 CoreWriter release enabled seamless DeFi composability, further driving ecosystem expansion. These factors provide significant distribution and liquidity advantages for the $HYPE token. $HYPE Builds Momentum as Bullish Pennant Resolves on Rising Demand The latest breakout on $HYPE reveals a technical setup that’s beginning to unfold with increasing bullish intent. Early signs of accumulation emerged through subtle but steady buying activity across recent hourly sessions, as shown in the footprint chart. The total buy volume gradually outpaced sell volume even during periods of price consolidation, hinting that bulls were absorbing offers rather than chasing the asset’s price. What this buildup does is that it creates a foundation of demand beneath the surface — and now, price appears to be reacting. $HYPE/USDT price chart, August 25 (Source: TradingView) Looking closely into the 1-hour timeframe, $HYPE has formed a classic bullish pennant, where the token’s price tightened between higher lows and lower highs after a strong impulse leg from $42 to $47. That consolidation allowed momentum to cool off just enough for a reset, supported by a rising 20-period simple moving average (SMA), which recently crossed back above the longer-term 100-period SMA, a shift that often signals trend re-acceleration. These SMAs now sit near $45.75 and $43.70, respectively, and could act as dynamic support zones on any retest. We can also confirm the pennant breakout from the volume data attached here. Not only did we see an increase in raw volume on the breakout candle, but a glance at the volume footprint chart shows multiple green deltas stacking around the $45–$46 region. While there was some initial profit-taking, evidenced by minor negative delta bars shortly after the breakout, bulls maintained control without a significant retreat. Interestingly, sellers failed to gain momentum even during attempts to push the price back below $45; those efforts were met with quick absorption. Momentum indicators are playing along, too. The RSI crisscrossed around neutral during the consolidation period, but it has begun to tilt upward. The MACD, on the other hand, tells a different story. The MACD has crossed above the signal line and may be gearing up for another leg higher. These shifts reflect a market transitioning from uncertainty to conviction. With $HYPE now trading just above the former pennant resistance, the path toward the projected target near $50 appears technically supported. As long as volume remains healthy and the price continues to respect the moving averages, bulls could keep the upper hand.

Recently, a prominent investor, often referred to as an ETH whale , made a series of moves that sent ripples across the industry. This individual’s strategic decisions involved hundreds of millions in Ethereum, captivating observers and highlighting significant market conviction. What Just Happened? An ETH Whale’s Masterful Trade A longtime Bitcoin investor, now operating as a substantial ETH whale , executed a remarkable trade. They successfully closed 130,564 ETH long positions, valued at an impressive $612.6 million. This strategic move occurred at an average price of $4,692 per ETH. The investor secured a substantial profit of $42.5 million from these positions. Closing a ""long position"" simply means selling assets that were bought with the expectation their price would rise, effectively locking in gains. This demonstrates astute timing and market insight. However, the story does not end there. Immediately after securing these profits, the same investor turned their attention back to Ethereum, but with a different strategy. Why Did This Strategic ETH Whale Accumulate Billions? Following the profitable closure of their long positions, the ETH whale began a significant accumulation phase. This involved purchasing a substantial amount of Ethereum through spot trades. Initially, the investor bought 33,381 ETH in spot trades, totaling $155 million. This was merely the start of a much larger campaign. Over a concentrated period of just six days, this individual amassed a staggering total of 544,977 ETH. The total value of this new accumulation reached an astounding $2.55 billion. Such a massive acquisition signals a profound conviction in Ethereum’s long-term potential and future growth trajectory. What Does Staking This Massive ETH Whale Haul Mean for Ethereum’s Future? Perhaps the most telling aspect of this entire saga is the subsequent action taken by the ETH whale . The investor chose to stake the entire accumulated amount of Ethereum. Staking involves locking up cryptocurrency to support the operations and security of a blockchain network, particularly Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake system. By staking, the investor earns rewards for contributing to network validation. More importantly, it signifies a deep, long-term commitment to the Ethereum ecosystem. This is not a short-term trade; it reflects a profound belief in the network’s stability and sustained value. This action also removes a significant amount of ETH from immediate market circulation, potentially influencing supply-demand dynamics and market stability. Decoding Whale Behavior: What Can We Learn from This ETH Whale ? Observing the actions of large investors, often termed ""whales,"" offers valuable insights into broader market sentiment and potential trends. Their substantial capital allows them to make moves that can influence price, but these decisions are often backed by extensive research and strategic foresight. This particular ETH whale first capitalized on existing positions, securing significant profits. Then, they reinvested and committed a colossal sum to the network’s future through staking. This serves as a powerful example of: Active portfolio management and risk assessment. Strong conviction in a digital asset’s long-term value. Strategic engagement with blockchain technology, beyond mere trading. Understanding these behaviors can help smaller investors gauge market confidence and potentially inform their own strategies, though it is crucial to conduct personal research. The recent actions of this prominent ETH whale provide a fascinating glimpse into high-stakes crypto trading and long-term investment strategies. From securing massive profits to accumulating billions in Ethereum and then staking it all, this investor has demonstrated a profound belief in ETH’s enduring potential. Such significant moves often resonate throughout the crypto community, sparking discussions about market direction, investor confidence, and the evolving landscape of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an ETH whale ? An ETH whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Ethereum (ETH). Their substantial holdings mean their transactions can significantly impact market prices and sentiment. What are ETH long positions? ETH long positions refer to an investment strategy where a trader buys Ethereum with the expectation that its price will increase. If the price rises, they sell their ETH for a profit. Closing a long position means selling the ETH to realize those gains. Why would an investor stake such a large amount of ETH? An investor would stake a large amount of ETH to earn rewards (like interest) for helping secure the Ethereum network. More importantly, it signals a strong, long-term belief in Ethereum’s future and a commitment to its ecosystem, as the staked ETH is locked up for a period. How does whale activity affect the crypto market? Whale activity can significantly affect the crypto market due to the sheer volume of their transactions. Large purchases can drive prices up, while massive sales can cause prices to drop. Their moves are often watched closely as indicators of market sentiment and potential trends.

In an official statement, the company reported that it had $8.82 billion in crypto and cash assets as of August 24. The company stated that it holds 1,713,899 Ethereum, 192 Bitcoin, and $562 million in cash, worth $4,808 per token. The company's holdings added more than 190,500 Ethereum, up $2.2 billion from the $6.6 billion reported the previous week. BitMine's cryptocurrency holdings rank it the number one Ethereum treasury firm and the second global crypto treasury firm after Strategy (MSTR), which holds 629,376 BTC worth $71 billion. BitMine President Tom Lee said: “Last week, BitMine increased its crypto and cash holdings by $2.2 billion to $8.8 billion. Last week, the company added more than 190,500 tokens, from 1.52 million tokens to 1.71 million tokens. This is the second straight week that BitMine has been able to raise capital from institutional investors at this pace, as it continues to support its goal of purchasing 5% of the ETH supply. At BitMine, we lead our crypto treasury competitors with the high trading liquidity of our shares.” As BitMine continues to purchase ETH to reach its Ethereum target, the company continues to receive support from a group of leading institutional investors, including Cathie Wood of ARK, MOZAYYX, Founders Fund, Bill Miller III, Pantera, Kraken, DCG, and Galaxy Digital. *This is not investment advice.

Over the past 8 days, large XRP wallets have added more than $758 million worth of tokens. According to Santiment , wallets holding between 10 and 100 million XRP increased their combined holdings from 7.51 billion to 7.76 billion tokens – a notable 3.3% rise in a short timeframe. At the same time, XRP trading volumes have doubled in the past 24 hours , now reaching $7.5 billion , which is nearly 5% of the circulating supply . On Friday, volumes hit $10 billion as XRP briefly surged to $3.10 . While it pulled back from that level, the price reclaimed it on Sunday, showing resilience near this key resistance. The 1-hour chart shows strong selling pressure at the $3.10 zone, but with whales consistently buying below the $3 psychological threshold , momentum appears to be building for another breakout. With deep-pocketed investors positioning early, XRP may be gearing up for its next leg higher . XRP Price Prediction: Confirmed Breakout Above $3.4 Would Kick Off Rally to $10 The daily chart shows that XRP has been consolidating for months as the price has been bouncing up and down in a range between $2 and $3.4. Consolidation patterns occur after big moves like the rally we saw in November-January, triggered by President Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. Presidential election and a favorable ruling that marked the beginning of the end of a long-standing legal case against Ripple. Market conditions are favorable at the time, as the current administration has pushed forward multiple supportive initiatives for the crypto industry, like the passing of the Genius Act. In this environment, Ripple’s vision of becoming the preferred decentralized solution for cross-border payments will keep making progress. The chart shows that a break above $3.4 could set in motion a massive rally toward $10 as it would confirm the continuation of the uptrend we saw during November-January.
