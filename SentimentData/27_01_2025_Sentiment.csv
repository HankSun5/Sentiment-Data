39546568,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=379766,1737927777,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/39546568.jpeg,Ethereum Foundation Launches Multisig Wallet for DeFi Participation,https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-foundation-launches-multisig-wallet-for-defi-participation/,"The Ethereum Foundation (EF), a non-profit supporting the Ethereum blockchain network, has established a multisig wallet to participate in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. In line with this, the organization has initiated a transfer of 50,000 ETH worth approximately $165.3 million into the wallet. The New Multisig Wallet According to a January 20 X post by Hsiao-Wei Wang, recently appointed to a leadership role at the entity, the wallet uses a 3-of-5 multisig configuration and is managed via Safe, previously known as Safe Gnosis. The announcement described Safe as having proven to be secure while also providing “a great user experience.” An initial test transaction has also been sent to Aave, one of the largest lending protocols within the Ethereum ecosystem. This development comes as the foundation faces longstanding concerns regarding its lack of transparency, particularly in its treasury management. Frequent ETH sell-offs by the EF, ostensibly to cover expenses and operational costs, have also drawn criticism for contributing to pressure on the asset. This has resulted in suggestions that the non-profit should explore alternatives, such as staking or deploying a portion of its ETH holdings on-chain to generate returns and meet its financial needs. Participating in the DeFi ecosystem could offer a pathway to boost the establishment’s treasury, which, over the past three years, has shrunk by 39% to $970.2 million as of October 31, 2024. A financial report released last year revealed that $788.7 million, or 81.3% of its total treasury, is held in cryptocurrency, with 99.45% of that amount in ETH. Despite these significant holdings, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin disclosed that the organization has refrained from staking its ETH to earn staking rewards due to concerns about regulatory implications, maintaining neutrality, and the potential challenge of taking sides in the event of a network hard fork. Leadership Reforms In recent weeks, several prominent crypto commentators raised fresh issues, pointing to Ethereum’s market underperformance and increasing competition from Solana as factors justifying scrutiny of the foundation’s leadership. Buterin has acknowledged these concerns, confirming that major changes are underway to reshape the group’s leadership structure. He explained that the planned reforms aim to enhance the technical expertise of the foundation’s senior leadership, strengthen communication and collaboration with key participants in the Ethereum ecosystem, and provide more active support for application developers. He also stressed that the EF does not intend to undergo an ideological shift, aggressively lobby regulators, or move toward a highly centralized governance model. Additionally, Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin proposed a dual-leadership structure for its future direction. He suggested Ethereum developer Danny Ryan and Jérôme de Tychey, President of Ethereum France, as candidates to balance technical proficiency with business strategy.

If you’ve been watching closely, Floki Inu is making headlines with its bold leap into Web3 innovation, and Brett is riding a wave of cultural significance on the Base Chain. But the real star of the show? BTFD Coin, which is taking the crypto market by storm, thanks to its $5.7M presale , staking rewards of up to 90% APY, and its bullish community, the Bulls Squad. Meme coins have transitioned from being lighthearted digital jokes to serious investment opportunities. The rise of projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu has paved the way for the next-gen meme coins with real-world use cases. Among the best new meme coins to invest in for short term , BTFD Coin, with its P2E game (launched in full on January 1, 2025), robust staking ecosystem, and unmatched FOMO potential, is not just riding the wave—it’s creating one. Let’s dive into why BTFD is the bull leading this herd and why Floki Inu and Brett also deserve a spot in your portfolio. BTFD Coin: The Bull’s Time to Charge Are you ready to own the dip? BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a movement. With over $5.7M raised in its presale, BTFD is storming through Stage 14 , offering its holders unique opportunities to ride the bull run to wealth. Among the best new meme coins to invest in for short term, BTFD stands out with its innovative approach and bullish momentum. The Bulls Squad, BTFD’s vibrant community, stands out as the backbone of this project. They’re not just investors—they’re part of a movement that combines financial strategy, gamified engagement, and the power of collective momentum. This community-driven energy is propelling BTFD to unprecedented heights, and the latest announcement of burning unsold tokens from Stage 13 has tightened the token supply, increasing demand and value. Let’s break it down: At its current price of $0.00016 in Stage 14, investing $3,000 could net you 18,750,000 tokens. With the predicted listing price of $0.0006, that investment could grow to $11,250. And if the moonshot prediction of $0.006 comes true, you’re looking at a staggering $112,500 . This is the kind of ROI dreams are made of! How do you get in? It’s simple: Set up your wallet, load it with ETH, BNB, or USDT, and head to the presale page . Use the bonus code LAUNCH100 to double your tokens during Stage 14 . Yes, you read that right—double! The clock is ticking, and this offer won’t last.

Floki Inu: More Than Just a Meme Floki Inu has come a long way from its meme coin origins. Named after Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu pup, “Floki,” this project has transitioned into a serious player in the Web3 ecosystem. Its focus on decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and metaverse integration demonstrates that it’s more than just a playful token. The Floki community, often referred to as the “Floki Vikings,” has shown incredible loyalty and enthusiasm. With projects like the FlokiFi Locker (a DeFi platform offering secure token storage) and plans for Floki’s metaverse, Valhalla, the coin is carving out a unique space in the crypto world. While Floki remains firmly rooted in its meme culture, its development roadmap is packed with real-world applications. Whether it’s NFT marketplaces or its educational initiative, Floki University, this project is laying the foundation for long-term value. With its strong community and evolving utility, Floki Inu is proving that meme coins can be fun and functional at the same time. It’s no wonder investors are keeping a close eye on this one! Brett: The Base Chain Mascot Making Waves Brett ($BRETT), inspired by Matt Furie’s iconic “Boys’ Club” character, has become the Base Chain’s official mascot. This meme coin taps into a nostalgic, cultural niche while delivering serious crypto appeal. With a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens, Brett’s scarcity is a key factor driving its value. Unlike many meme coins that flood the market, Brett’s limited supply ensures a tighter, more valuable token economy. Its ties to the Base Chain, known for low transaction fees and high-speed transactions, add another layer of appeal for crypto enthusiasts looking for efficiency and speed. Brett’s cultural significance also plays a major role in its popularity. The connection to Matt Furie’s work gives it a sense of authenticity and community that resonates with collectors and crypto traders alike. With a strong, supportive community rallying behind it, Brett is solidifying its position as one of the standout meme coins of 2025. The Bottom Line Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin, Floki Inu, and Brett are lighting up the crypto world in their own unique ways.

This bold project focuses on using blockchain technology throughout Petrobras’ operations. The goal is to improve efficiency and reduce carbon impact. The project focuses on blockchain applications alongside Bitcoin mining, aligning with the company’s shift towards a low-carbon future. The Power of Blockchain: More Than Just Bitcoin Mining While Bitcoin mining is one of the key components of this R&D project, it is far from the only focus. Petrobras plans to explore multiple blockchain applications that could revolutionize its operations. The company plans to explore how blockchain can simplify processes, including tokenization and consensus systems. It also aims to improve transparency and change business models. The project will include research teams from Petrobras, such as the Cenpe Center and Petrobras University. Working with Ledger Labs at PUC-Rio’s Business School will boost the research, creating a strong environment for new ideas. The aim is to use blockchain technology to lower the carbon footprint and improve business operations. Petrobras’ Blockchain Initiatives Petrobras has been using blockchain in several projects, including a biomethane marketplace developed with GoLedger. This aligned with Petrobras’ broader goal of adopting blockchain to improve operational transparency and collaboration. In late 2023, Petrobras signed an agreement with the Cardano Foundation to offer employee blockchain training. It also issued 500 dynamic Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to provide access to these resources. This marked the company’s first use of a public blockchain, underscoring its forward-thinking approach to digital innovation. A 2021 study by PUC-Rio and Petrobras also identified 41 blockchain use cases in the oil and gas sector. The study highlighted blockchain’s potential to foster collaboration in an often fragmented industry. Petrobras Joins a Growing Trend in the Oil Industry Petrobras is not the only oil company exploring Bitcoin. In Argentina, companies like Tecpetrol, Plus Petrol, and YPF Argentina use crypto mining, taking advantage of wasted gas from oil exploration. For instance, Russia’s Gazpromneft is working with mining companies like BitRiver to turn its excess gas into electricity for Bitcoin mining. Petrobras and others are contributing positively to the Bitcoin ecosystem by using this unused energy. At the same time reducing waste and improves energy use. Notably, Petrobras’ move into the Bitcoin mining sector is part of its broader sustainability and technological progress goal.

This includes the Toncoin (TON) Blockchain’s expansion through its partnership with Telegram, the Stellar (XLM) price gearing up for a significant breakout, and BlockDAG (BDAG) preparing for a robust multi-front rollout. The Toncoin Blockchain is enhancing Telegram’s mini apps and offering financial incentives for project transitions, setting the stage for increased adoption. Meanwhile, the Stellar price is recovering from a recent downturn, raising questions about its ability to break past historical highs. Furthermore, BlockDAG’s ambitious roadmap positions it as a potentially top trending crypto, with a comprehensive strategy that includes a mainnet launch and significant partnerships. The forecasted 30,000x ROI has placed BlockDAG squarely in the sights of forward-looking traders. Toncoin Blockchain Secures New Backing The Toncoin (TON) blockchain is broadening its scope through a strategic collaboration with Telegram and the TON Foundation. This expansion will see the Toncoin blockchain powering Telegram’s innovative mini apps, enhancing user interaction with games like Hamster Kombat and Notcoin, and offering up to $50,000 in ad credits to support projects transitioning by February 21, 2025. This initiative is poised to expose the Toncoin blockchain to Telegram’s 950 million monthly users, significantly boosting its adoption potential. Early indications suggest that user engagement could see a substantial increase as more projects leverage these newly integrated features. Is Stellar Price Poised for New Peaks? The Stellar (XLM) price is challenging a long-standing resistance trend line that has persisted for over 2,500 days. Despite a previous 600% surge to $0.56, Stellar currently trades at $0.41 and may require further momentum to overcome this historical barrier. A symmetrical triangle pattern on the short-term charts suggests potential consolidation before any significant upward movement. After recouping 40% of its value in 2025 following a pullback, the Stellar price is supported at around $0.40. Market speculators are keenly watching for a potential breakthrough that could propel the token to new record highs, with the market positioned for unexpected bullish trends. BlockDAG’s Strategic Roadmap Toward Industry Leadership BlockDAG is on a bold path to make a significant mark in the industry. Priced at just $0.0248, it has already raised over $185 million in its presale, with more than 18 billion coins snapped up by eager buyers. These early backers have enjoyed a whopping 2,380% ROI, sparking predictions from experts that a staggering 30,000x ROI could be on the horizon. Looking ahead to 2025, BlockDAG is gearing up for a major mainnet launch and plans to be listed on 10 additional crypto exchanges (CEXs). This will make the coin more accessible to a broader audience. The project’s partnerships with big names like Inter Milan and HackerEarth show a strategic push to engage diverse groups and expand its community. What really sets BlockDAG apart is its cutting-edge DAG-tech, offering ultra-fast transactions, unlimited scalability, and superior security compared to many existing blockchain networks. Observers are keenly watching BDAG, predicting it will rise as a top trending crypto . With strong presale momentum and an active leadership team pushing for broader recognition, BlockDAG is poised for monumental success, drawing traders and enthusiasts to what could be a transformative journey ahead. Identifying the Top Trending Cryptos As these projects progress, they collectively capture the market’s imagination, each poised for significant milestones. Market watchers are optimistic that the Toncoin blockchain will gain from Telegram’s extensive user base, while Stellar’s price may soon attempt to surpass its previous highs. Meanwhile, BlockDAG’s multifaceted rollout strategy, which includes high-profile partnerships and an ambitious presale strategy, is projected to yield a staggering 30,000x ROI. Enthusiasm is mounting among early supporters, and traders who were previously on the fence are now eagerly participating in BDAG’s offerings, setting the stage for a potentially transformative year for BlockDAG and the broader crypto market.

In a desperate and direct tweet on Jan. 26, Roger said, “Mr. President, I am an American, and I need your help. Only you, with your commitment to justice, can save me @realDonaldTrump.” Mr. President, I am an American, and I need your help. Only you, with your commitment to justice, can save me @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/WhVTZ1M1GB — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) January 26, 2025 Roger had renounced his US citizenship in 2014. He’s now facing federal charges that could see him sent to prison for over a century. The entrepreneur who became “Bitcoin Jesus” Roger was born on January 27, 1979, in San Jose, California, and his entrepreneurial journey began at just 19. While still in college, he founded MemoryDealers.com in 1999, a company that sold computer components. It became a huge player in the market, thriving under his leadership. By 2005, Roger launched Agilestar.com, a company specializing in optical transceivers, which found clients among Fortune 100 firms. The wild successes of these early ventures set the stage for what came next: Bitcoin. In 2011, Roger discovered Bitcoin while it was still priced under $1. “It was like nothing I’d ever seen before,” he said in a past interview. He said he was captivated by its potential to disrupt traditional financial systems. Roger wasted no time, pouring his energy and money into Bitcoin and quickly incorporating it into his businesses. He also personally invested over $1 million into early Bitcoin startups, including now-giant companies like Blockchain.com, Kraken, and Ripple. Trump, who has already made waves by enacting crypto-friendly policies, now finds himself at the center of a plea from one of Bitcoin’s earliest advocates. Trump has already pardoned the community’s favorite hero, Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht. From Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash Roger’s journey through the crypto industry took a dramatic turn in 2017 when he moved his allegiance from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash (BCH). The fork of Bitcoin promised faster transactions and lower fees, addressing what Roger said he saw as critical flaws in the OG crypto. In multiple interviews, Roger criticized Bitcoin’s community for abandoning its original ethos. “Bitcoin isn’t about holding and hoping the price goes up. It’s about making financial systems better than PayPal or Visa,” Roger said. Can’t argue with that if you’ve ever actually read the Bitcoin whitepaper. When Roger renounced his US citizenship, he became a citizen of Saint Kitts and Nevis through its citizenship-by-investment program. He often speaks about the importance of having a second passport, calling it a safety against government overreach. Interestingly, Roger once described Bitcoin as “a pyramid scheme” and criticized Bitcoin maximalists for their lack of understanding about gold’s industrial uses. “It’s amazing how many BTC maximalists don’t even know that gold has uses beyond being a store of value,” he said in one of his many fiery tweets. While some hail him as a visionary, others see Roger Ver as an opportunist who undermined Bitcoin to promote Bitcoin Cash. President Trump signed an executive order for crypto in the Oval last week. It’s not that far fetched to expect Roger’s return to America within February.

According to CoinMarketCap, JUP went from $0.899 earlier today to a peak of $1.262. JUP’s recent rally is tied to announcements by the Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX) at its first-ever community conference, Catstanbul. The DEX, which is one of the biggest protocols on Solana, has unveiled several new features, products, and partnerships at the event in Istanbul. According to Jupiter, it is remaking its web and mobile platforms with the addition of new features such as Ultra Mode, Organic Scoring, Jupiter Shield, and RTSE. The exchange said that some of these features are first of their kind and plans to roll them out in the coming weeks. Most of these new features improve Jupiter’s user experience, which the DEX calls a reinvention of the protocol. For example, the Ultra Mode is expected to make the platform cheaper and better with real-time slippage estimation, optimized transaction landing, and dynamic priority fees. Organic Score also lets Meanwhile, the DEX plans to upgrade its manual mode to become customizable while launching a new UX for its spot platform. Although most of the upgrades will first be available on the Jup.ag web platform, the DEX plans to implement it in the mobile version later. Jupiter reveals new products and partnerships Beyond the platform upgrades, Jupiter has also revealed its full acquisition of on-chain portfolio tracker Sonar Watch. With the acquisition, Jupiter is launching a Solana portfolio tracker integrated into its protocol. This marks its second acquisition in the past few days after buying a majority stake in Moonshot. Meanwhile, the DEX has also proposed borrowing USDC with JLP deposits as collateral, noting that this could increase the use of USDC to give more yield to JLP holders. It said: “This can drive higher utilization rates for USDC, and improve APY for JLP holders. Liquidations will be done by redeeming JLP natively, releasing their collateral against the pool.” Jupiter founder Meow also announced other upcoming products, including Jupnet, an omnichain network that will aggregate “all of crypto into a single decentralized ledger.” The product, which is still in the early testnet phase, is expected to make all chains and cryptocurrencies accessible from one account. Jupiter to buy back tokens with 50% of fees With today’s performance, JUP has been up 12% in the last seven days while gaining more than 40% in the year to date. Despite these gains, the token continues to trade below its all-time high of $2.043, which it reached back in January 2024. However, the token could see a further rise in value, especially as the team now wants to make JUP the GOAT of tokens. In its effort to drive value to the JUP, Jupiter announced today that it will start spending 50% of all fees on buying back JUP tokens. The project went further by burning 3 billion JUP tokens, reducing the total supply from 10 billion tokens to 7 billion tokens. Many believe that this is a massive development for the token and could drive substantial price gains in the future.

While major tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) , and Ethereum (ETH) have strong use cases, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN sets itself apart as the most exciting opportunity for exponential value creation. Here’s why this token is dominating the conversation. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Stands Out 1. Limited Supply Creates Scarcity With a total supply capped at 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN ensures scarcity that fuels long-term value. Unlike BTC and LTC, which have slower growth due to high circulation, this token’s deflationary model guarantees increasing demand. 2. Exclusive Availability Unlike UNI and DOT, which are available on multiple exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity gives early adopters an edge and keeps the token’s growth stable and controlled. 3. Unparalleled Growth Potential Analysts project that THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN could deliver returns of up to 2,000%, thanks to its early-stage momentum and community-driven development. While Bitcoin and Polkadot are well-established, they can’t match the rapid trajectory of this groundbreaking token. 4. Investor Demand at Record Levels Raising $1,000,000 within minutes of its presale launch, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven its appeal. Investors recognize its potential to redefine the market, driving interest far beyond what UNI, BTC, or LTC have recently seen. How THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Compares Uniswap (UNI): A strong DeFi platform but lacks the exclusivity and demand-driving scarcity of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Polkadot (DOT): Reliable for interoperability but cannot match the early-stage explosive growth seen here. Bitcoin (BTC): A store of value, yet its market maturity limits growth opportunities compared to THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Litecoin (LTC): Known for efficiency, but it hasn’t captured the market excitement that this new token has.

Backed by advanced technology, a robust ecosystem, and user-centric governance, Web3Bay has already raised $920,000 in its presale, currently in stage 4, with a token price of $0.004562625. Early supporters are eyeing potential returns exceeding 6000%, making this project a promising opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on high-growth blockchain projects. Scalability Through Layer-2 Solutions Web3Bay is designed to handle high transaction volumes while maintaining speed and efficiency, key factors for any emerging crypto with high return potential . By integrating Layer-2 scaling solutions such as rollups, the platform ensures that users can transact seamlessly, even during periods of peak activity. These solutions not only reduce transaction fees but also significantly enhance processing speeds, creating a smooth experience for buyers and sellers alike. For small businesses and entrepreneurs, scalability is an enabler. Web3Bay’s architecture guarantees reliable transaction processing even during high-traffic scenarios. This focus on scalability ensures the platform can meet the demands of a growing global user base, which is essential for any emerging crypto with high return potential . Building a Sustainable Ecosystem with 3BAY Tokenomics At the heart of Web3Bay’s ecosystem is its native token, 3BAY, which powers transactions, rewards engagement, and facilitates governance. These features solidify 3BAY as a cornerstone of an emerging crypto with high return potential , offering both utility and financial rewards. Presale Allocation (40%) : 2 billion tokens are available across 28 stages, with incremental price increases rewarding early adopters. Ecosystem Development (30%) : 1.5 billion tokens are allocated for partnerships and growth initiatives. Liquidity (20%) : 1 billion tokens ensure smooth trading experiences. Post-Launch Initiatives (5%) : 250 million tokens are reserved for future integrations and expansion. Team Allocation (5%) : Locked for two years to demonstrate long-term commitment. This structured tokenomics model ensures that Web3Bay’s growth is balanced and sustainable, which is a hallmark of any emerging crypto with high return potential . Users who transact with 3BAY enjoy a 5% discount on purchases, while token holders can influence the platform’s future through governance voting. Empowering Small Businesses and Entrepreneurs Web3Bay aims to address the challenges small businesses face in traditional e-commerce, further cementing its status as an emerging crypto with high return potential . Centralized platforms often impose high transaction fees, restrictive policies, and limited control over data, leaving small vendors at a disadvantage. Web3Bay disrupts this model by providing a decentralized marketplace that prioritizes fairness and inclusivity. Through blockchain technology, Web3Bay eliminates intermediaries, significantly reducing transaction fees. This allows small vendors to retain more of their earnings, fostering a supportive environment for growth. Additionally, decentralized governance ensures that users—not corporations—shape platform policies, creating a marketplace that adapts to its community’s needs. By supporting cryptocurrency transactions and integrating traditional payment systems like PayPal, Web3Bay bridges the gap between Web2 and Web3 commerce. This dual approach expands its appeal, attracting both crypto enthusiasts and newcomers to the platform. Such inclusivity further enhances its status as an emerging crypto with high return potential . Why Web3Bay Stands Out Web3Bay’s presale performance demonstrates its strong foundation and widespread investor confidence. With $920,000 raised and the current token price at $0.004562625, early supporters recognize the platform’s potential. Analysts predict a potential ROI exceeding 6000%, driven by its scalable design, user-friendly interface, and community-focused approach. What makes Web3Bay a standout emerging crypto with high return potential is its commitment to decentralized governance. Once non-team tokens are distributed, Web3Bay will transition to a fully decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), giving users full control over critical decisions. This transparent governance model ensures the platform evolves in line with its community’s needs, fostering trust and long-term engagement. The Opportunity for Early Investors Web3Bay is more than just a decentralized marketplace—it’s a platform reimagining global e-commerce through blockchain technology. As an emerging crypto with high return potential , the ongoing presale provides an excellent entry point for investors. With only 24 stages remaining and token prices set to increase incrementally, now is the perfect time to secure 3BAY tokens at an attractive rate. The combination of scalability, inclusive governance, and user empowerment positions Web3Bay as a leader among emerging cryptos with high return potential .

A $965.5 price tag for a strategic reserve,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-xrp-eliminate-the-us-national-debt/,"Cryptocurrency analysts and advocates suggest adding tokens like XRP to a crypto stockpile as the U.S. administration under Trump signals support for digital assets. President Trump has already ordered the creation of a working group that will develop a framework for digital assets and future reserves within the next six months. If the working group considers adding XRP to the virtual asset stockpile, the token will require a higher valuation to offset the US national debt. Trump sparks debate on including XRP and Solana in a US digital asset stockpile During his campaign, Donald Trump advocated for a strategic Bitcoin reserve, claiming it could help clear US debts. With Trump paving the way for talks of a digital asset stockpile, some analysts have speculated that the administration could focus more on “ Made in America” tokens besides Bitcoin, putting XRP and Solana among the top considerations. Some analysts are supporting a multi-asset crypto stockpile, including Max Avery , an entrepreneur who commented on X: I think having a strategic crypto reserve with multiple digital assets is a great idea. BTC and the XRPL can both win. Max Avery However, XRP and Solana are nowhere near Bitcoin’s prices, raising the question of how high they should rise to help offset the US national debt if chosen to make up the country’s crypto reserves. Ripple’s escrow holdings could form the basis of a US XRP reserve The US government can simply acquire XRP tokens from Ripple’s escrow and create an XRP reserve without having to pay for them. Ripple has almost $38 billion of XRP in escrow, which is about 37.7% of the total token supply as of now. If the government is serious about starting an XRP reserve, some have suggested that Ripple should hand over its escrow holdings to support the creation of the token’s national reserve. XRP is trading close to $3.12 on the price chart, maintaining the above-important moving averages. Even with this comparatively solid position, the asset still faces crucial resistance at $3.30.

Trump Conquers Canada (TRUMPCAN), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump Conquers Canada can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Conquers Canada could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Conquers Canada launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Conquers Canada on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Conquers Canada by entering its contract address (CA) – HiPRoUXHrovHyJPB5StmSF2XwERbh78iLEfaxtpjVHJC – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCAN.

Similar Yet Predicted for Bigger Gains by 2025,https://bitzo.com/2025/01/shiba-inu-shib-faces-stiff-competition-from-emerging-meme-coin-panshibi-similar-yet-predicted-for-bigger-gains-by-2025,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) is an OG player. Back when it launched, it went on a historic run but now a new meme coin with a similar name is set to repeat it! This new meme coin is called Panshibi($SHIBI) and it is expected to bring much higher gains than SHIB in 2025! Shiba Inu's tactics are falling short Shiba Inu is a major player in the crypto arena, but SHIB is now up against intense competition from a new contender. The challenge becomes even more daunting for SHIB when considering the token's size, leaving it with limited potential for expansion. Shiba Inu investors are becoming aware of this situation. Many holders have been contemplating an exit for some time. However, Shiba Inu introduced its burning strategy, aiming to cut supply and drive up prices. This announcement gave hope to those considering leaving, persuading them to remain. Unfortunately, the SHIB token-burning approach hasn't yielded the desired results. Despite months of burning tokens, there's been no significant price boost. Some events, like Trump’s election victory and other broader market factors, did lift SHIB’s price temporarily. But on its own, SHIB has struggled to gain momentum. Now, a large number of Shiba Inu investors are growing dissatisfied. Many have sold off their holdings, causing SHIB’s price to fall. The price of SHIB has dropped over 10% in a week and 6.45% in the past 30 days, despite favorable market conditions recently. This suggests a weakening of Shiba Inu's position. Due to this and the intense competition, analysts predict further declines for SHIB. Interest in Shiba Inu is waning, which might lead to an additional 30% drop. Meanwhile, the new meme coin Panshibi is poised to take over SHIB’s spot. Panshibi has already created a buzz in the market and shows substantial growth potential. Consequently, experts consider Panshibi a much more attractive investment opportunity than SHIB! Panshibi: The market's upcoming star Panshibi is an exciting new meme coin set to run for 60 days. Blending three major communities - Asia, pandas, and meme coins - Panshibi has a wide appeal. Yet, its allure isn't the only reason experts predict it as the next big player in the market! Panshibi boasts a strong growth-focused roadmap and tokenomics, which are expected to drive its expansion over the coming years. Furthermore, Panshibi offers one of the fairest launches in the market, ensuring everyone has a fair shot at investing! In terms of its roadmap, Panshibi aims to create value and foster a loyal community. With this goal, Panshibi plans to launch and then engage in charity events supporting panda conservation. In addition, Panshibi’s tokenomics are designed to further develop the ecosystem. 60% of the total $SHIBI supply is allocated for presale, with another 15% set aside for community rewards and staking. Additionally, Panshibi’s liquidity pool will be locked for 10 years, while the team’s tokens are locked for 2 years. This ensures that no one can manipulate the $SHIBI price, unlike many other meme coins. Panshibi holders will enjoy high APYs for staking and gain access to NFTs, as well as an exclusive VIP members club. Thus, Panshibi is not only bringing a fun and viral meme coin to the market but also offering utility that promises long-term benefits! Join the $SHIBI presale now and invest in the most promising new meme coin! Right now, the $SHIBI presale is at Stage 1, where $SHIBI is priced at just $0.002. This gives you the chance to invest in $SHIBI at an exceptionally low price, allowing you to capture all the potential gains not just during the presale but also in the years ahead! As the presale progresses through its stages, the price of $SHIBI will rise, reaching new heights with each stage. Once launched, $SHIBI will debut at $0.026. Any unsold presale tokens will be burned, further enhancing $SHIBI’s value. After its launch, experts anticipate $SHIBI to become a highly popular meme coin among the public. Consequently, they predict $SHIBI's price could soar by at least 145,000% shortly after its debut! However, this is just their initial target for $SHIBI! They foresee this meme coin climbing even higher in the coming months and years!

This new meme coin is called Panshibi($SHIBI) and it is expected to bring much higher gains than SHIB in 2025! Shiba Inu’s strategies aren’t working Shiba Inu is a crypto giant, however, SHIB is facing fierce competition from a new player. The competition gets even tougher for SHIB once we consider the size of this token, as it leaves SHIB little room for growth. And Shiba Inu investors are catching on to this notion. Many Shiba Inu holders wanted to leave a while ago. However, then, Shiba Inu announced its burning strategy, with the goal to decrease supply and boost the price. So, the Shiba Inu investors who wanted to leave stayed with high hopes. However, the SHIB token-burning strategy hasn’t really been working. Shiba Inu has been burning tokens for months now, but this is yet to boost the price. However, a few events that did boost the SHIB price recently included Trump’s election victory and other market-wide factors. So, on its own, the SHIB price has really been struggling to move. Now, most Shiba Inu investors are fed up. Many of them have sold, which has caused the SHIB price to dip. The SHIB price is down by over 10% in a week and 6.45% over the last 30 days, despite market conditions being generally good over the last few weeks. This indicates that Shiba Inu is losing strength. Because of this and the fierce competition it has, experts see the SHIB price dipping even further. Interest in Shiba Inu just isn’t there anymore, and this may cause a further 30% dip. Meanwhile, the new meme coin Panshibi is gearing up to take SHIB’s place. It has already caused a buzz in the market, and it has definite potential for huge growth. As such, experts see Panshibi as a much more promising investment than SHIB! Panshibi: The market’s next big runner Panshibi is a great new meme coin that will run for 60 days. As a meme coin, Panshibi combines three huge communities - Asia, pandas, and, of course, meme coins. However, its huge appeal is not the only reason why experts see it as the market’s next big runner! Panshibi also has a great growth-centered roadmap as well as tokenomics, which will result in it growing over years to come. Also, Panshibi has one of the fairest launches in the market, giving everyone an equal chance to invest! As for its roadmap, Panshibi focuses on creating value and a loyal community. With this in mind, Panshibi plans to launch and then participate in charity events for panda conservation. Also, Panshibi’s tokenomics are focused on growing the ecosystem further. 60% of the total $SHIBI supply is allocated to the presale and another 15% for community rewards and staking. Furthermore, Panshibi’s liquidity pool will be locked for 10 years, while the team’s tokens for 2. So, no one will be able to manipulate the $SHIBI price as is the case with alot of meme coins. Panshibi holders will get high APYs in return for staking, and they’ll also get access to NFTs as well as an exclusive VIP members club. So, Panshibi is not just here to bring a fun and viral meme coin to the market. It’s also here to provide utility, which will be extremely beneficial in the long run! Join the $SHIBI presale now and invest in the best new meme coin available! At the moment, the $SHIBI presale is in Stage 1 where $SHIBI is available for only $0.002. This allows you to invest in $SHIBI extremely early at a super low price, therefore catching all the gains it’ll bring in not only the presale but in the years to come! As the presale persists through each of its stages, $SHIBI will increase in price, jumping to new heights with every new stage. Then, $SHIBI will launch at $0.026. If there are any presale tokens left unsold, they’ll be burned, which will only boost $SHIBI’s price further. After the launch, experts see $SHIBI becoming a very popular meme coin among the masses. So, they say that $SHIBI’s price will rise by at least 145,000% shortly after launch! However, this is just their primary target for $SHIBI!

Per the Russian state-run news agency TASS , Rosseti is ready to position itself as an “operator for hosting mining infrastructure.” Rosseti: Growing Crypto Keen? The move would be a major departure for Rosseti, which has spent much of the past few years hunting down illegal and “grey” miners in parts of the country . Rosseti engineers. (Source: Rosseti/VK/Screenshot) The power firm says it wants to focus its attention on “power supply centers with low utilization prospects.” TASS quoted the company as stating: “The Rosseti Group is the largest grid company in Russia. We can act as the operator that coordinates the placement of crypto mining infrastructure.” The development appears to confirm an earlier report from the media outlet Kommersant , which late last week claimed to have seen a letter sent to Russian Prime Minister and de facto energy chief Mikhail Mishustin from the Rosseti Group head Andrei Ryumin. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin. (Source: kremlin.ru) Prime Minister to Rule on Rosseti Request? Ryumin reportedly wants Mishustin to grant Rosseti official permission “to coordinate the placement of mining centers in Russian regions.” Rosseti officials stated that the company was “also interested in developing [crypto] mining, since this will facilitate the use of [spare or idle] capacity.” It will also “increase the load of power supply centers and increase the company’s tariff revenue,” Rosseti said. And the firm stated that all this would help “boost the development of the Russian economy” and “bolster tax revenues.” Ukraine launched multiple drone attacks on three areas of Russia including the Ryazan region, home to one of the country’s largest oil refineries, according to officials in Moscow https://t.co/W3kyqQH5UE — Bloomberg (@business) January 26, 2025 Incentivized Crypto Mining The power provider said it was discussing the use of “various tools” to incentivize “power centers with low potential loads” to turn to crypto mining. These could involve “separate types of tariffs,” Rosseti said. The company moved to explain that its affiliates “have the ability to control electricity consumption.” They can thus reportedly use “operational data on the availability of free capacity and loads” to “ensure the reliability of electricity supply” to Russia’s regions. “Our entire electrical grid infrastructure has switching tools and other equipment that will help manage the load from [crypto] mining facilities.” Rosseti spokesperson Last year, the state-run oil and gas firm Gazprom launched a crypto mining subsidy.

New coins pop up, and old ones continue to hold their ground. Analysts are currently excited about three specific tokens that could see big gains this February. Ethereum, Trump Official, and the presale token, Remittix (RTX) are drawing attention from traders and crypto fans. Each one has its own strengths, making them some of the best coins to buy right now. Let’s dive into what makes these coins stand out and why they’re being talked about so much. Ethereum: The Classic Giant in the Crypto World Ethereum has continued to be a good investment option. As the second-biggest crypto project, it is known for its ability to support smart contracts and dApps. These features allow developers to create everything from games to financial tools. This has kept Ethereum relevant over the years. Ethereum has witnessed success over the years and now stands at $3,299.86. Analysts believe it might cross $4,000.00 soon if market conditions improve. Many people still view it as a safe choice because of its strong history and consistent updates. While other coins offer exciting opportunities, Ethereum remains a top pick for investors who prefer established projects. Trump Official: A Coin That Stirs Conversation Trump Official (TRUMP) is different from most other cryptocurrencies. It gets its name from the political world, which has helped it grab attention. The coin has a strong community that supports it, often combining humor and passion to promote the token. The coin is currently priced at $28.51, making it accessible for new investors. Some analysts predict it could rise in February, especially if the community continues to grow. Events and announcements from the team could also help boost its price. However, Trump Official is seen as more of a short-term option. It lacks the kind of long-term development plans that make coins like Ethereum stand out. While it might offer quick gains, investors should think carefully before committing large amounts of money to it. Remittix: A New Star with Real-World Use Remittix is quickly becoming a name to know in the crypto space. Unlike many other coins, Remittix focuses on solving a specific problem. Sending money across borders often comes with high fees and long delays. However, Remittix offers a very impressive solution. What makes Remittix special is its clear goal. By targeting the global payments market, it sets itself apart from meme coins and general-purpose cryptocurrencies. Businesses and individuals who frequently send money abroad are showing interest in this project. The RTX presale is already catching the attention of investors. Early buyers are excited about its potential to deliver massive returns. Experts believe Remittix could increase its value by up to 50 times after it launches on major exchanges. This could make it one of the best coins to buy right now. The project also has strong plans for future growth. The team is working on partnerships with international payment companies and financial platforms. These moves are expected to boost the DeFi coin price of RTX in the coming months. Another key reason for its popularity is its focus on decentralized finance. The DeFi sector is growing fast, and Remittix is positioned to benefit from this trend. With its clear purpose and growing support, RTX is shaping up to be a standout token in February. Ethereum, Trump Official, and Remittix each offer something unique. Ethereum is the reliable choice, with years of success and steady growth. Trump Official is a fun option that could bring quick profits, but it carries higher risks. Remittix stands out as the best option for those looking for both real-world impact and high returns. Its focus on making international payments better gives it a clear advantage. Early investors are already seeing the potential for huge gains, and the project’s roadmap shows it has long-term promise. Remittix's presale token, RTX, currently sells for $0.0324. This is quite affordable and people are rushing the opportunity. So far, the ICO has raised over $6.6 million from sales. This shows massive adoption. If you’re searching for the best coins to buy this February, Remittix should be at the top of your list. With its low presale price and plans for growth, it could deliver the kind of results every investor dreams about.

Analysts are presently enthusiastic about three particular cryptocurrencies that might experience significant gains this February. Ethereum, Trump Official, and the presale token Remittix (RTX) are capturing the interest of traders and crypto enthusiasts alike. Each token has its unique strengths, marking them as top buys at the moment. Let's explore what makes these cryptocurrencies stand out and why they are generating substantial buzz. Ethereum: The Timeless Powerhouse in Cryptocurrency Ethereum remains a solid investment choice. As the second-largest cryptocurrency project, it is celebrated for its support of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). These capabilities enable developers to build a range of applications, from games to financial tools, keeping Ethereum relevant over the years. Having enjoyed consistent success, Ethereum is currently valued at $3,299.86. Analysts suggest it could surpass $4,000.00 soon if market conditions become favorable. Its strong track record and ongoing improvements make it a reliable option for many. While other cryptocurrencies might offer thrilling prospects, Ethereum continues to be a top contender for those who favor well-established projects. Trump Official: A Cryptocurrency That Sparks Discussion Trump Official (TRUMP) sets itself apart from other digital currencies. Drawing its name from the political realm has helped it garner attention. The token boasts a dedicated community that often uses humor and enthusiasm to advocate for it. Priced at $28.51, it is an accessible option for new investors. Some analysts anticipate a price increase in February, particularly if its community continues to expand. Team announcements and events could further elevate its value. Despite this, Trump Official is better suited for short-term investment. It lacks the long-term development plans that make coins like Ethereum appealing. While it may provide quick profits, investors should weigh the risks before making substantial investments. Remittix: An Emerging Leader with Practical Applications Remittix is rapidly gaining recognition in the crypto world. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, Remittix aims to address a specific issue. Cross-border money transfers are often expensive and slow, but Remittix offers an impressive solution. What distinguishes Remittix is its focused mission. By targeting the global payments sector, it sets itself apart from meme coins and all-purpose cryptocurrencies. Businesses and individuals who frequently need to send money internationally are taking notice of this project. The RTX presale is already attracting investor interest. Early adopters are excited about its potential for substantial returns. Experts predict Remittix could increase in value by up to 50 times once it launches on significant exchanges, making it a promising investment. The project also has robust plans for future expansion. The team is actively pursuing partnerships with international payment firms and financial platforms. These initiatives are expected to enhance the DeFi coin price of RTX in the coming months. Another major factor contributing to its popularity is its emphasis on decentralized finance. With the rapid growth of the DeFi sector, Remittix is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. Its clear goals and increasing support suggest RTX will be a standout token in February. Ethereum, Trump Official, and Remittix each bring something distinct to the table. Ethereum is a reliable choice, marked by years of success and steady growth. Trump Official presents a fun, albeit riskier, option for quick returns. Remittix, however, is ideal for those seeking both practical impact and high returns. Its focus on enhancing international payments gives it a competitive edge. Early investors are already recognizing its potential for significant gains, and the project’s roadmap indicates long-term viability. Currently, Remittix's presale token, RTX, is available at $0.0324, a price that is drawing many buyers. The ICO has already raised over $6.6 million, reflecting widespread adoption. If you're on the lookout for the best cryptocurrencies to invest in this February, Remittix should be high on your list.

Why 1FUEL’s Solutions Are Attracting Savvy Investors,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/pepes-fame-waning-why-1fuels-solutions-are-attracting-savvy-investors,"Occasionally, PEPE has been one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy owing to its cultural appeal. However, times are changing, paving the way for utility-driven altcoins that deliver consistent yet explosive growth, such as 1FUEL . With a low entry of $0.017, 1FUEL has sold nearly $1.5 million worth of OFT tokens in three stages of its presale. In this article, we uncover why investors are backing 1FUEL to deliver 100x returns after its public launch and why they believe OFT will outperform PEPE as the best crypto to buy in 2025. PEPE holders suffer 20% losses in January The PEPE price has caused significant investor losses, having dumped 15% in the past month. Like many altcoins, PEPE capitalized on Bitcoin’s recent bull charge, soaring to $0.00002082 on January 17. However, PEPE has since lost momentum. According to CoinGecko, PEPE exchanged for $0.00001593 in the final week of January, which represents a 20% decline on its 7-day chart. PEPE’s trading volume has also plunged 51% to $1 billion, reflecting weak trading interest. Massive decline of crypto meme coins In the past, PEPE has been successful at creating a cultural buzz. For instance, PEPE witnessed meteoric growth soon after its launch, reaching a market cap of $1 billion within weeks. However, PEPE now faces challenges, largely because investors now demand more than hype. For years, PEPE has struggled to prove its real worth beyond community-driven popularity, so now its appeal is fading away. Is 1FUEL the best presale crypto? At its core, 1Fuel offers cross-chain interoperability, allowing users to make seamless one-click transactions across multiple blockchains. Using the 1FUEL cold wallet, you can forget about holding countless crypto tokens or paying excessive fees. Just select your trading currency, specify the asset you want to own (no matter the network), and then sit back and relax as 1FUEL handles all the technical aspects of trading for you. These capabilities make 1Fuel as essential tool for the future of decentralized applications and decentralized finance.

As it currently stands, Shiba Inu has grown too big to be able to repeat such a run. However, Panshibi ($SHIBI) can take its place! Panshibi is a brand new meme coin following the same early trends as SHIB did. As such, $SHIBI is set to go on a huge rally in the 2025 bull run! Shiba Inu’s burning efforts have yet to payoff Shiba Inu was one of the market’s best performers as the token went on a massive run that has placed SHIB as the 17th largest coin in the whole market! With such a large standing, Shiba Inu doesn’t have as much room for growth as other new meme coins. The only other meme coin that’s bigger than Shiba Inu right now is DOGE, which means it would be unheard of for both tokens to make millionaires at the levels they are trading at today. The team at Shiba Inu knows this, so they’ve been trying other ways to boost the price. One thing Shiba Inu does is to burn tokens to boost the price, a practice that has been going on for months, but SHIB’s price has yet to really budge. SHIB’s price has only risen in the past few months due to market-wide bullish events. Other than that, Shiba Inu has failed to reach their goal with the token burn and now, Shiba Inu investors are starting to lose faith. Experts believe that there is not much new interest in Shiba Inu at the moment, which is another bad sign and is likely why Shiba Inu has failed to keep any momentum long term. Right now, SHIB’s price is down over 12% in just the last 7 days and experts see more dips in store as they don’t see the token burning working or new interest in SHIB spawning. This has resulted in predictions that state the SHIB price might decrease by another 30% soon. The only positive outlook they have is if Shiba Inu catches momentum during the bull run. In this case, they see Shiba Inu’s price rising by around 100%, which is not much for a bull run. On the other hand, the new meme coin Panshibi offers a much better future than SHIB. As a new meme coin, Panshibi has a long way to go. Also, the bull run can push it even further, allowing it to repeat the massive run SHIB had a few years ago! Panshibi: One of the most promising investments for this bull run Panshibi $SHIBI is a brand new meme coin that will launch in the heat of the bull run. As for now, Panshibi is still in its presale, but it’s already following the same early trends as SHIB did before its run. So, what makes Panshibi better than other new meme coins? For one, Panshibi encompasses three massive communities - Asia, pandas, and meme coins which can have massive general appeal and reach for Panshibi. Thus, experts see Panshibi attracting millions of people once it starts trading on exchanges. Next, Panshibi is not just a regular meme coin. While most meme coins are here for the meme and nothing else, Panshibi isn’t. Instead, it’s focused on long-term growth and community-building. And it has the roadmap and tokenomics to back this up. 60% of the total $SHIBI supply is set aside for the presale, another 15% is allocated for staking and community rewards, whilst the rest is spread out for marketing, charity events, and listings. So, as you can see, $SHIBI has some of the best tokenomics out there! Furthermore, Panshibi’s roadmap shows a focused effort on building a loyal community and spreading the word. After the launch, Panshibi will start joining charity events and efforts for panda conservation. It’ll also provide a lucrative staking system to holders, giving them high APYs in return for staking their $SHIBI tokens. Panshibi holders will also get access to NFTs, which further lists the utility that this meme coin offers. With all this in mind, experts see Panshibi as the best meme coin you can invest in during the bull run! They also see it outperforming SHIB and many other major players as it goes! Join the $SHIBI presale now for huge gains in Q1 of 2025 and beyond! $SHIBI is currently in Stage 1 of its public presale. This gives you the chance to invest in it very early and reap all the rewards it’ll bring. As for the presale, it will be done in 15 stages, after which $SHIBI will launch at a fixed price of $0.026. Right now, $SHIBI’s is priced at $0.002, meaning that Stage 1 investors will get 1,200% of presale gains alone. All the $SHIBI tokens that aren’t sold in the presale will be burned, which will only drive $SHIBI’s price up. Even more exciting, the 1,200% presale gains will be nothing compared to what $SHIBI will bring in the longer term with experts seeing $SHIBI going on a massive rally after its launch. Fueled by the bull run and its fun memes it is easy to see a 100x price rise for $SHIBI by Q1 of 2025, and even more as the bull run really heats up!

This Latest Meme Coin Adventure Has Already Raised Over $480K,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-dogecoin-this-latest-meme-coin-adventure-has-already-raised-over-480k/,"In 2013, Dogecoin began as a joke—a parody of Bitcoin featuring the lovable Shiba Inu meme. At the time, few took it seriously. Its trading price was infinitesimal—fractions of a cent. But for the savvy few who believed in Dogecoin’s potential, the results have been staggering. Early Dogecoin investors saw their holdings skyrocket as the meme coin phenomenon caught fire, turning tiny investments into life-changing fortunes. Fast forward to today, and it’s hard not to wonder: “What if I’d bought Dogecoin back then?” If you’re kicking yourself over missing that opportunity, here’s your second chance to jump in on what could be the next big meme coin: Arctic Pablo Coin . This fresh-faced project is already making waves in the cryptocurrency world and is shaping up to be one of the top new meme coins to invest in January 2025. The Dogecoin Story: From Meme to Millions Dogecoin’s journey is the stuff of legend. Born as a humorous take on cryptocurrency, it gained traction thanks to its friendly community and meme-centric appeal. You could snag millions of Dogecoins for mere dollars in its earliest days. Over the years, as crypto adoption grew, Dogecoin rose to prominence, even gaining the attention of high-profile figures like Elon Musk. Today, those same Dogecoins, once purchased for next to nothing, have generated life-changing returns for early adopters. Imagine buying a few hundred dollars’ worth of Dogecoin in 2013 and waking up a millionaire during its 2021 bull run. Hindsight, as they say, is 20/20—but the next opportunity is always just around the corner. Enter Arctic Pablo: A New Meme Coin with Explosive Potential If Dogecoin’s rise taught us anything, it’s that timing and faith in innovation matter. Arctic Pablo, the latest entrant in the meme coin space, is your chance to get in early on what could be 2025’s breakout star. This unique project isn’t just about memes—it’s about adventure. Arctic Pablo is on a thrilling journey, moving through iconic locations, each unveiling exclusive treasures for investors. Currently in the El Dorado phase—its sixth stop —Arctic Pablo’s presale has been nothing short of extraordinary. Each phase was designed to last a week, but the demand has been so overwhelming that Arctic Pablo is zipping through locations in just 3 to 4 days! From the vibrant Atlantis to the serene El Dorado, this presale has already raised over $480,000 , a testament to its growing popularity as one of the top new meme coins to invest in January 2025 . At present, Arctic Pablo’s token price is a mere $0.000038. To put that into perspective, the potential return on investment (ROI) from this phase to its listing price of $0.008 is a staggering 20,000%. Yes, you read that correctly—20,000%! This could be the kind of low entry point that Dogecoin’s early investors can relate to. Why Arctic Pablo Stands Out So, why is Arctic Pablo catching fire? It’s not just the treasure hunt or the meme-driven branding—it’s the way it’s rewarding early adopters: Staking Rewards : During the presale, investors can stake APC tokens and earn an impressive 66% APY. Why wait for returns when you can start earning now? Referral Incentives : Spread the word and earn additional rewards. Sharing Arctic Pablo with friends could be more rewarding than you think. Community Competitions : Active participation pays off with opportunities to win APC tokens or even cash rewards in USD. Arctic Pablo is more than a meme—it’s a community-focused project designed to reward participation and engagement. It’s no surprise it’s being hailed as one of the top new meme coins to invest in January 2025. Why Snowy Chores is the Perfect Entry Point The El Dorado phase offers a golden opportunity to join this explosive presale before Arctic Pablo enters its next location and the token price increases. With demand driving rapid sellouts, there’s no telling how long the current price of $0.000038 will last . If history repeats itself, this phase could close out in just a few days—don’t let this slip through your fingers. Think back to Dogecoin. Wouldn’t it have been incredible to get in at those early prices? Arctic Pablo is offering a similar chance, and with an ROI exceeding 20,000% , the potential upside is enormous. But timing is everything—securing APC tokens at this stage could make all the difference. Conclusion: Don’t Let Arctic Pablo’s Presale Slip Away Dogecoin’s story reminds us that life-changing opportunities in crypto often come disguised as “just another project.” Arctic Pablo is far from just another project—it’s already proving itself to be one of the top new meme coins to invest in January 2025. Arctic Pablo is a rare gem in the crypto world with its exciting treasure hunt, generous rewards, and lightning-fast presale phases. The El Dorado phase is happening now, and at $0.000038 per APC , the price is as low as it’ll ever be. Don’t be the one regretting this missed opportunity a few years down the line. The time to act is now. Arctic Pablo is blazing a trail. Will you follow the treasure map or let this adventure pass you by?

Observers say crypto traders abandon Trump meme coins for Remittix, lured by its cross-border payment angle and a fast-moving ICO. Below is a closer look at how the once-popular Trump tokens fell off, why Remittix(RTX) might be the new favourite, and what this shift suggests for meme coins in general. Trump Meme Coins Lose Steam For a while, Trump-themed meme coins captured attention thanks to flashy marketing, political endorsements, and short bursts of hype-driven gains. But every meme token depends on ongoing buzz, and that spark now appears to be missing. Prices of these Trump and Melania tokens have slumped dramatically, with traders questioning whether the initial frenzy was just a passing fad. As the hype died down, big holders likely decided to cash out, leaving smaller investors holding the bag. This meltdown shows how quickly meme coins can crash if new money doesn’t keep flowing in. Enter Remittix(RTX) While Trump coins fade, Remittix(RTX) has soared, raising $7,000,000.00 so far and selling 340,318,363.91 tokens at $0.0350. The token is set to jump to $0.0364 next, fueling the idea that the altcoin might see a dramatic price run. Some say crypto traders abandon Trump meme coins for Remittix because they want more than a political gimmick. Remittix(RTX) offers cross-border remittances, a real-world use case that could lure mainstream adoption. Investors love the idea that someone in a developing country might easily convert crypto to fiat, all powered by this new altcoin. Why Remittix(RTX) Is Different Unlike purely meme-driven tokens, Remittix(RTX) positions itself as a PayFi solution. The project’s roadmap aims to reduce fees and hassles for people sending money abroad. Instead of paying hefty wire costs or waiting days, holders of Remittix(RTX) could swiftly transfer funds. Naturally, sceptics point out that it must compete with more established networks. However, fans believe if Remittix(RTX) can sign up big remittance providers or partner with financial services, its price might skyrocket. The altcoin’s presale success hints that many see a huge upside in a coin that solves actual problems, rather than just trying to ride a political wave. Trump Tokens vs. A Utility-Driven Coin Another factor in the shift from Trump meme coins to Remittix(RTX) is the difference in user bases. Political meme coins rely heavily on jokes, fleeting buzz, and a divisive figure for marketing. Remittix(RTX), by contrast, targets practical outcomes, appealing to everyday crypto users fed up with slow and expensive cross-border transactions. If the project launches as planned and adoption spreads, the altcoin could soar even without celebrity endorsements. That’s an attractive proposition for those wanting a more stable path to potential gains—even if “stable” is relative in the volatile crypto arena. Conclusion For now, it seems the Trump and Melania tokens are suffering from a hype hangover, while Remittix(RTX) rides high on its ICO success. Observers note how crypto traders abandon Trump meme coins for Remittix, hoping a real-world use case can drive sustained growth rather than fleeting attention. Whether Remittix(RTX) lives up to the hype remains to be seen, but the token’s presale milestones suggest many buyers believe it could. If the altcoin’s cross-border payment idea takes off, the demise of Trump meme coins may become just another cautionary tale in the fast-paced crypto landscape. That, at least, is the bet thousands of new Remittixinvestors appear to be making.

Many experts note that crypto traders are drifting away from Trump-themed meme coins, drawn instead to Remittix's focus on cross-border payments and its rapidly progressing ICO. Let's delve into the reasons behind the drop in popularity of Trump tokens, the rise of Remittix (RTX), and what this trend might mean for meme coins overall. Trump Meme Coins Are Losing Their Appeal Trump-themed meme coins once grabbed headlines with bold promotions, political backing, and short-lived surges in value. However, these tokens rely heavily on ongoing excitement, which seems to have fizzled out. The prices of Trump and Melania tokens have plummeted, causing traders to wonder if the initial craze was merely temporary. As the excitement waned, major investors likely cashed out, leaving smaller traders to deal with the aftermath. This collapse illustrates how swiftly meme coins can decline if fresh investments stop coming in. Introducing Remittix(RTX) As Trump coins lose traction, Remittix (RTX) is making a remarkable ascent, having raised $7,000,000.00 and sold 340,318,363.91 tokens at a price of $0.0350 each. The next price point is set to increase to $0.0364, sparking speculation of a potential price surge for this altcoin. Observers suggest that traders are leaving behind Trump meme coins for Remittix because they seek more than just a political gimmick. Remittix (RTX) provides a practical solution for cross-border remittances, which could attract mainstream users. Investors are excited about the possibility that people in developing regions could effortlessly switch from crypto to fiat using this innovative altcoin. What Sets Remittix(RTX) Apart In contrast to purely meme-based tokens, Remittix (RTX) positions itself as a PayFi solution. Its roadmap is focused on minimizing fees and simplifying the process for people sending money overseas. Instead of enduring steep wire transfer costs or lengthy waits, Remittix (RTX) holders could enjoy swift transactions. Critics argue that it faces competition from established networks, yet supporters believe that if Remittix (RTX) secures partnerships with major remittance providers or financial services, its price could soar. The altcoin's successful presale indicates that many see significant potential in a coin that addresses real-world issues, rather than just exploiting a political trend. Comparing Trump Tokens and a Utility-Focused Coin Another reason for the shift from Trump meme coins to Remittix (RTX) is the difference in their target audiences. Political meme coins often rely on humor, fleeting excitement, and a polarizing figure for marketing. On the other hand, Remittix (RTX) aims for tangible results, appealing to crypto users looking for solutions to slow and costly international transactions. If the project launches as expected and gains traction, the altcoin could thrive even without celebrity endorsements. This prospect is appealing for those seeking a more reliable path to potential profits—even though ""reliable"" is a relative term in the unpredictable crypto market. Conclusion At present, Trump and Melania tokens seem to be dealing with the aftermath of their hype, whereas Remittix (RTX) is thriving on the success of its ICO. Analysts observe that traders are ditching Trump meme coins in favor of Remittix, hoping that its practical use case can fuel ongoing growth rather than just temporary interest. Whether Remittix (RTX) will meet expectations remains uncertain, but its presale achievements suggest many investors are optimistic. Should the altcoin's cross-border payment concept gain momentum, the decline of Trump meme coins might become yet another warning tale in the ever-changing crypto world. That's the gamble many new Remittix investors seem willing to take.

Data from the decentralized finance (DeFi) analytics platform DefiLlama shows that the network’s stablecoin market cap had reached $10.7 billion at the time of writing. Breaking Records Previously, the highest collective value of all the stablecoins on Solana was about $6.259 billion, achieved in June 2022. Between December 2022 and January 2024, the metric stayed below the $2 billion level, as the blockchain’s biggest rival, Ethereum, enjoyed figures as high as $101 billion. In that period, Justin Sun’s Tron also registered a higher market cap for its stablecoins, going from $31 billion in June 2022 to nearly $50 billion at the beginning of 2024. While the two networks have maintained dominance, Solana’s recent growth is remarkable. In the last seven days, Ethereum and Tron’s stablecoin values went up by slightly more than 1%. Meanwhile, Anatoly Yakovenko’s platform skyrocketed by a massive 77.45%, going past the $10 billion mark and setting a new record in the process. The blockchain’s technical capabilities are also being tested. It reportedly processes about 350 million transactions daily, generating $50 million in fees, which, when annualized, amount to $19.4 billion. Unlike Tron and Ethereum, where the most dominant stablecoin is Tether, at 98.3% and 56.3%, respectively, Solana’s biggest stablecoin is USDC, representing 77.2% of the market cap. The ecosystem saw $3.75 billion worth of the token issued over the past week, bringing its total to $8.26 billion. The value of USDT on the network is just slightly below $2 billion, with PayPal’s PYUSD a distant third at $150 million. Meme Coin Mania Behind Solana’s Performance According to analysts, the surge was driven primarily by meme coin trading pairs using USDC and USDT. It coincided with the launch of two tokens on the blockchain, one by U.S. President Donald Trump and another by First Lady Melania. The Official Trump (TRUMP) coin was the talk of the town last weekend, reaching an eye-watering market cap of $15 billion and momentarily eclipsing Pepe and Shiba Inu to become the second-largest meme coin in the market. However, the introduction of Melania Meme (MELANIA) rained on TRUMP’s parade, causing the President’s token to lose half its value in just a few hours. Right now, TRUMP is trading around the $36 level, with its $7.25 billion market cap placing it as the 29th largest cryptocurrency in the market. The other token is down 24% in the last 24 hours and is currently changing hands at $2.79. Incidentally, the frenzy accompanying the launch of the two meme coins pushed SOL’s price by 18%, helping it reach a new all-time high of $270.

Meanwhile, XRP appears primed for a massive run-up, supported by growing bullish momentum. However, analysts believe there's another emerging contender poised to rival XRP's potential growth 1Fuel (OFT) . With its strong early performance, 1Fuel is gaining attention and could be the next big opportunity for investors looking for high-upside projects. Already in its presale stage, experts predict it will grow 100x in 2025. This massive growth potential has attracted Celestia and XRP investors to the project, who now consider it a worthy rival to big and established players like XRP. TIA dropped off while XRP and 1Fuel headed for the moon Celestia launched on October 31, 2023, at a price of $2.30. Within the first three months of launch, it reached an all-time high of $20.85, almost 10x the investors' money. Since then, the Celestia price has gradually declined and sits below $5. Despite the initial hype, the token has failed to meet expectations, disappointing many investors. In contrast, XRP and 1Fuel have sustained investors' optimism. Despite facing a high-profile lawsuit from the SEC, led by Gary Gensler, for allegedly selling XRP, calling it an unregistered security. Ripple saw renewed bullish momentum after pro-crypto President Trump won the US election. News of a more crypto-friendly regulatory framework, including potential shifts or pauses in SEC enforcement actions, have further boosted market confidence. Currently trading at $3.14, XRP has skyrocketed by 600% from its $0.5 price point in November. Technical indicators suggest its upward trend could continue, particularly if the rumored Ripple ETF is approved this year, an event many believe could drive the coin even higher. Meanwhile, 1Fuel is gaining popularity with its third presale phase, priced at $0.017. This marks a 17x increase over the Stage 1 price of $0.001 and a 50% jump from the Stage 2 price of $0.012. Several crypto analysts predict that once 1Fuel lists on exchanges in 2025, it could deliver another 100x return for early participants. 1Fuel soars in early stages 1Fuel has made a name for itself with innovative and advanced technology, which focuses more on scalability and usability. Enabling 1Fuel to handle large transaction volumes while ensuring a user-friendly experience. One major feature is the one-click cross-chain transactions, eliminating the need for multiple wallets and network fees. You simply select the tokens you wish to trade, and 1Fuel handles the swaps in the background, making 1FUEL a valuable investment. Celestia (TIA) is declining in popularity, while 1Fuel is rising to the challenge and competing with XRP. The token has grown 17x in a short time, moving from its initial price of $0.001 to $0.017. 1Fuel (OFT) is in its third presale stage, and each OFT token costs $0.017. Over 155,000,000 tokens have been sold, raising over $1.5 million. The purchased tokens will be released immediately after the presale ends in April. 1Fuel can be purchased using various cryptocurrencies, including SOL, ETH, and BTC.

However, the latest developments might simplify this choice considerably. The Polkadot (DOT) crypto ecosystem has experienced a surge in stablecoin utilization, with USDC and USDT accumulating $114 million on its network. Similarly, the Litecoin price action indicates a positive shift, as LTC has escaped its previous downtrend, with forecasts now pointing towards a 24.49% possible increase. In the meantime, BlockDAG (BDAG) is emerging as a prominent force in Web3 innovation through its recent partnership with HackerEarth. This year-long agreement will see BlockDAG organizing four global hackathons, anticipated to gather between 10,000 to 15,000 developers to forge new solutions on the BlockDAG network. This update arrives as BlockDAG’s presale achieves remarkable success, already reaching $185 million and rapidly progressing towards its $600 million goal. Polkadot (DOT) Crypto Ecosystem Experiences Stablecoin Growth The Polkadot (DOT) crypto ecosystem has witnessed an increase in stablecoin adoption, with USDC and USDT amassing $114 million within the network. This surge underscores the growing confidence in the Polkadot crypto ecosystem’s framework, designed for scalability and security across its parachains, such as Moonbeam and Acala. As stablecoins like USDC continue to integrate into the Polkadot crypto ecosystem, the focus might increasingly turn towards its core token, DOT. Although DOT’s value has seen some swings, it currently stands at $6, after peaking at $10 in late November. Litecoin Price Action Indicates a Bullish Shift Litecoin’s market movement indicates a break from its recent slump, fostering hope for an uptick to $150. After trending downwards, its climb above the key resistance line hints at a momentum change, with its base at $118 holding firm. Projections suggest a 24.49% rise, aiming for $150. Observers are on the lookout for signs of heightened buying activity and market volume, which would confirm a sustained positive trend in Litecoin’s price action. Should this trajectory hold, Litecoin might hit the $150 mark, a crucial level for traders. BlockDAG’s Hackathons to Drive the Creation of 200+ Web3 Projects! The excitement within the developer community is palpable following BlockDAG’s new partnership with HackerEarth. This alliance will see the staging of four worldwide hackathons this year, drawing elite teams to develop decentralized apps (dApps) on its robust Layer 1 blockchain. With HackerEarth’s large network of 7.6 million developers promoting these events, the target is attracting 10,000 to 15,000 developers. The aim is to spawn over 200 fresh Web3 projects on the BlockDAG network, boosting its applicability. These hackathons will also provide teams with a stage to demonstrate their prowess and catalyze growth across various sectors, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to infrastructure and governance. This stride follows BlockDAG’s substantial presale success, now at $185 million and fast approaching its $600 million goal as the mainnet launch draws near. Given this remarkable growth, analysts foresee a potential 3932% ROI for those joining now, with BDAG priced at $0.0248 in batch 27 and an expected rise to $1 by 2025. This positions BDAG as one of the best crypto coins to buy now, with early participants from batch 1 already enjoying a 2380% ROI, showcasing BDAG’s vast potential. The recent partnership with HackerEarth has further fueled enthusiasm around the overall project, especially the presale. Additionally, HackerEarth will organize smaller, regional hackathons, further broadening BlockDAG’s worldwide impact and its contribution to Web3 growth. Overall, this initiative and optimistic outlook establish BlockDAG as a pivotal platform for both developers and traders, aiding them in maximizing value from the burgeoning blockchain domain. Summing Up! The Polkadot (DOT) crypto ecosystem’s increased stablecoin use signals a rising trust in its framework, though DOT’s price remains unstable. Meanwhile, Litecoin’s upward price action stirs expectations for a push toward $150, with the market eyeing continued positive momentum. However, BlockDAG stands out with its pioneering HackerEarth partnership and a potential 3932% ROI. This collaboration primes it for significant Web3 expansion, attracting leading talent and enhancing the network. Plus, with a projected price of $1 by 2025, it ranks as one of the best crypto coins to buy now, particularly for those entering at the current $0.0248 in batch 27. Ultimately, BlockDAG’s mix of innovation and growth renders it among the most promising crypto projects for 2025 .

Experts Think So!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-the-officialmagacoin-poised-for-a-50000-breakout-experts-think-so/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the standard for cryptocurrency investments, while Ripple (XRP) dominates cross-border payments. However, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is emerging as a potential game-changer, with analysts predicting a breakout of up to 50,000%. What Makes THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Stand Out? 1. Limited Supply for Maximum Value: With a total supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN leverages a deflationary model to ensure scarcity and drive demand. This gives it a major edge over tokens like Solana (SOL) and Kaspa (KAS), which have higher supply and more gradual demand growth. 2. Exclusive Sale Platform: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is only available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM , adding an exclusive appeal that many competitors lack. Unlike Solana or Optimism (OP), which are widely traded, this controlled distribution creates a sense of urgency for early investors. 3. Early-Stage Momentum: Raising $1 million within minutes, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven its market appeal. With predictions of a 50,000% increase, it’s capturing attention as a high-potential token for investors seeking exponential returns. How It Stacks Up Against the Competition Solana (SOL, $25.01): Known for speed and scalability, but it lacks the exclusive presale advantage and early momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS, $0.12): A rising star in blockchain, yet its growth doesn’t match the explosive potential seen in this new token. Optimism (OP, $1.72): A solid project for scalability, but it’s overshadowed by THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s unique market positioning.

Three coins stand out as lucrative investments: Toncoin, 1Fuel, and Tron. According to crypto watchers, these tokens under $10 might yield 10 - 100x in 2025. 1Fuel, in particular, is in its ongoing presale phase, offering an entry as low as $0.017. Toncoin (TON): A very strong contender Toncoin has been on a positive rally since the beginning of 2025. Despite market short liquidations, whale activity spiked by 104% early in January. Soon after, the 16th-largest crypto by market capitalization announced an exclusive deal with Telegram. Telegram, a messaging app with over 950 million users, will only use TON for its Web3 solutions. This is a key partnership as Telegram is the sixth most downloaded app globally and the major leader in Web3 integration for social apps. TON has recently reclaimed its $5 spot and is currently trading at $5.08. Technical analysis has shown a double bottom pattern on Toncoin, signaling a potential 40% breakout ahead. The future looks bright for the TON ecosystem, especially now that they are eyeing a US expansion under President Trump's pro-crypto administration. TRON (TRX): Possible ties with current US government TRX has gained by 13%, crossing $0.25 since President Trump'sTrump's inauguration on Monday. Its overall market gain outperforms the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that institutional investors have been stacking up a lot of TRX since the inauguration. Many suspect a link between Justin Sun and Donald Trump's crypto team, World Liberty Financial (WLFI). In November 2024, Justin Sun invested $10 million in WLFI. This week, WLFI purchased 19 million TRX tokens for $4.6 million. Within 24 hours of the announcement, whale demand surged 450%. Investors believe WLFI's investment mirrors President Trump's investment. Hence, there was a surge in TRX accumulation following the publicized purchase by Justin Sun. TRX offers a unique profit opportunity solely based on its fundamental analysis. If these ties run deep, we can expect a surge above $0.40. 1Fuel (OFT): The undiscovered gem 1Fuel offers the lowest entry point of the three, with its ongoing presale at $0.017. Starting in December 2024, 1Fuel has sold over 155,000,000 OFT tokens across thousands of unique holders. The hype around 1Fuel is not just tied to its low entry point. Its appeal is rooted in its unique value proposition for the modern crypto market. 1Fuel has two powerful features: an all-in-one crypto wallet and exchange and its one-click technology. With 1Fuel (OFT) , users won't need multiple tokens and processes to transact and convert across multiple chains; OFT handles all the conversions on the back end. This allows users to enjoy all these complexities and excess fees in one click. 1Fuel will also offer AI integration, enabling efficient management of investors' portfolios and assistance with filing tax reports. The OFT tokens are selling out fast. The current price of $0.017 is only available during this Stage 3 presale. After this stage, the price will increase slightly. If you're considering making a purchase, now is the time to act.

However, many investors overlooked the potential for increased market volatility that this could bring. As a result, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bitcoin (BTC) are experiencing uncertainty and are looking toward a new crypto exchange that is approaching its launch. This promising new exchange offers secure wallet features, including safe cold storage and one-click cross-chain transactions, which set it apart from competitors in the market. Additionally, its DeFi coin presale is selling out quickly, with only a few tokens remaining. Investors in DOGE and BTC are rushing to secure a stake in this new DeFi coin, anticipating potential gains of over 100x by 2025. More information about this rising trend is available here! Dogecoin rises as Department of Government Efficiency unveils its logo Dogecoin got its time in the spotlight when the Department of Government Efficiency (abbreviated as DOGE), led by Elon Musk, unveiled its website and logo on January 21, 2025. Not so surprisingly, the logo features the famous Dogecoin Shiba Inu, and for a moment, DOGE fans were over the moon as the token price soared past $0.40 . But the excitement vanished fast. As of January 25, DOGE has slid back to $0.35 . And this dip has left DOGE holders wondering if the token can turn things around. While experts think Dogecoin might bounce back to $0.620 by March, some investors aren’t sticking around. Instead, they’re shifting their focus to a hot new DeFi coin that’s being called the next 100x altcoin. The question is: will DOGE regain its bark, or has the spotlight already moved on? China dumps seized Bitcoins worth around $19.7 billion: What’s next for BTC? Bitcoin is riding a rollercoaster of wild price swings after China dumped 194,000 BTC (worth $19.7 billion) seized from the 2019 PlusToken Ponzi scheme. The massive sell off was quite shocking for the market. In fact, Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, called it a major event in state-crypto dynamics. Just ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration, BTC dropped below $100,000 but quickly rebounded to hit its ATH of $109,114 the same day. But what’s concerning is the fact that the BTC price has since cooled off and dropped to $104,623 as of January 25. While Bitcoin’s volatility continues to captivate investors, some are hedging their bets by exploring a new DeFi coin that’s widely tipped to be the next 100x altcoin. Market experts are still optimistic about BTC. They predict a potential climb to $150,000 by the end of Q1 2025 only if bulls remain in control. But diversification might be the smarter move for those looking for safer returns. DOGE and BTC investors are going all in on 1Fuel to dodge market volatility Crypto markets are wild.

The incredible stories of early backers of coins like Notcoin (NOT) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) who achieved staggering returns post their listings on Binance are testaments to the potential in these playful assets.

The Rise of Meme Coins: A Look at NOT and SHIB Meme coins have carved a niche for themselves in the crypto world by not just capitalizing on internet culture but by building substantial community support and demonstrating significant market resilience.

Its appeal lies in its ability to mock the very industry it thrives in, offering a fresh perspective that resonated with a broad audience, leading to its viral success and subsequent listing on major exchanges. Shiba Inu , inspired by the Dogecoin phenomenon, leveraged a similar thematic charm but introduced additional innovations such as a decentralized exchange, ShibaSwap, and various token burns, which enhanced its value and utility.

Kamala Sucks (KAMASUCK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because KAMASUCK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Kamala Sucks can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Kamala Sucks could become the next viral memecoin. Kamala Sucks launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Kamala Sucks on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Kamala Sucks by entering its contract address (CA) – KFywQqjGH3WdEQ4hR42oYQ17v4nSePom6AjyJc8TNfU – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like KAMASUCK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-27 00:32:15

This comes months after President Donald Trump advocated starting a national strategic Bitcoin reserve on his campaign trail at the Nashville Bitcoin Conference. Porter commented on X: I can confirm that at least 15 states will introduce ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’ legislation. Maybe even 16. As a reminder, only 3 months ago, this number was zero. Dennis Porter Bitcoin investors and enthusiasts are pleased with the reserve momentum among the US States Following Porter’s post, several Bitcoin enthusiasts supported the states’ decision, happy with the growing momentum. Jimmy Kostro, CEO of the Kostro Foundation in Thailand, encouraged other US states to do the same, hoping that at least half of the nation’s states would accept Bitcoin reserves. He added that he was proud of everything the US states had done so far. MDX ALGO, an algorithmic trading system, even called the Bitcoin reserve momentum “undeniable.” Earlier, Porter had predicted that at least one G7 and one BRICS country would establish Bitcoin reserves, and with more states in the US jumping the gun before a formal national decision, it’s looking good for the US. Moreover, Porter and his Satoshi Action Fund helped to draft legislation for the “Bitcoin Rights” bill in Pennsylvania and in 20 other states, in an attempt to educate lawmakers on the top cryptocurrency. Ohio joins the list of States proposing Bitcoin reserves Ohio’s State Representative Steve Demetriou, along with six others, pushed for a new house bill that would allow the state treasurer to allocate 10% of the state’s funds to buy digital assets, including Bitcoin, for a crypto reserve. Demetriou insisted that a reserve would protect the state’s funds from inflation and any economic uncertainties. Ohio legislation, like most other states, has maintained tech neutrality, using the general term “digital asset” instead of explicitly mentioning Bitcoin. However, even if it is passed, the bill will only qualify Bitcoin as a reserve asset so far. The legislation mandates that crypto assets kept in the state’s reserves should have an average market capitalization of at least $750 billion over the preceding 12 months. Bitcoin’s market cap stands at $2.07 trillion, the only digital asset meeting the market cap requirement so far.

Heritage’s new crypto coin Remittix (RTX) has gained investor focus because it demonstrates robust presale figures while building its community base at a rapid pace. Ethereum (ETH) Concerns Despite dominating the DeFi ecosystem Ethereum (ETH) marked a 4.94% decrease in market value during the previous week. Large holder entities may be conducting profit-based trades while Bitcoin version 2.0 and other base-level blockchains offer fierce competition. Ethereum's (ETH) failure to restore its market strength may result in an even higher descent. The network operates thousands of dApps alongside a vibrant NFT section which indicates a significant crash only occurs when the broader crypto market declines dramatically. Despite these negative indicators short-term traders need to pay attention because on-chain information might confirm additional assets leaving the system. Ripple (XRP) Under Pressure Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) is currently at $3.10, down 2.70%. If selling persists and buyers remain hesitant, XRP could plunge toward the key $2.45 support. Many traders anticipate a bounce at that level, but if demand doesn’t materialize, things could get ugly fast. Even so, if investor confidence returns—or if the market as a whole flips bullish—Ripple (XRP) might climb back toward its all-time high of $3.41. For now, though, the mood is cautious, and analysts remain watchful. This uncertainty is exactly why Smart money bets on Remittix over Ethereum and Ripple, with some viewing Remittix(RTX) as a safer bet for rapid gains. Why Remittix(RTX) Looks Promising So, what is Remittix(RTX), and why has it drawn so much interest? The project aims to streamline cross-border payments by converting crypto to fiat globally. Early birds find this concept appealing because traditional remittances often come with big fees and delays. By aiming to solve a real-life problem, Remittix(RTX) promises a broader user base than many other tokens. Remittix’s presale success says a lot: $7 million raised and 350 million tokens sold in just four weeks clearly demonstrates Remittix’s success as it continues to go from strength to strength. It’s no surprise that some backers of Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) have jumped ship, hoping to latch onto a newer project that might outdo both coins shortly. The PayFi Angle Remittix(RTX) calls itself a PayFi solution, aiming to blend DeFi concepts with everyday finance. Users could easily send money worldwide at a fraction of legacy fees, which might appeal to folks outside the usual crypto circles. This potential for mainstream adoption could, in theory, bolster RTX and shield it from the volatile meme coin market. Of course, skeptics argue that big networks like Ethereum (ETH) or solutions like Ripple (XRP) already offer payment capabilities. But fans of Remittix(RTX) say the token’s design is simpler and friendlier for non-crypto users, a factor that might drive further investments. Conclusion Though Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) have always been top picks for many crypto portfolios, experts now warn of upcoming drops that could rattle both assets. In the meantime, a growing number of traders believe Smart money bets on Remittix over Ethereum and Ripple, gravitating toward Remittix(RTX) for its real-world payment angle and presale success. Whether ETH and XRP bounce back or slump further remains unclear, but the current shift to Remittix(RTX) underscores how quickly market sentiment can change. Only time will tell if this new altcoin truly outperforms the giants—or if the big names reassert their dominance once conditions improve.

Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX), a new cryptocurrency by Heritage, is capturing investor interest with impressive presale performance and a swiftly expanding community. Concerns Surrounding Ethereum (ETH) Despite its leading role in the DeFi arena, Ethereum (ETH) saw a 4.94% drop in market value last week. Large investors might be engaging in profit-taking moves, as Ethereum faces increasing competition from Bitcoin 2.0 and other foundational blockchain technologies. If Ethereum (ETH) cannot regain its footing in the market, it risks further declines. The network supports thousands of decentralized applications and a bustling NFT market, suggesting that a major crash would likely occur only if the entire crypto market takes a severe hit. Nonetheless, short-term traders should stay alert as on-chain data could indicate more assets exiting the platform. Ripple (XRP) Faces Challenges Ripple (XRP) is currently priced at $3.10, reflecting a 2.70% decrease. Continued selling pressure and hesitant buyers could drive XRP down to the crucial $2.45 support level. Many traders expect a rebound at this point, but without sufficient demand, the situation could deteriorate quickly. However, if investor confidence returns or the market turns bullish, Ripple (XRP) might make its way back to its peak of $3.41. For the moment, a cautious sentiment prevails, and analysts are keeping a close watch. This uncertainty is precisely why smart investors are choosing Remittix over Ethereum and Ripple, seeing Remittix (RTX) as a potentially safer bet for quick returns. Reasons Remittix(RTX) Is Attracting Attention What makes Remittix (RTX) so intriguing? This project aims to revolutionize cross-border payments by enabling seamless crypto-to-fiat conversions worldwide. Those who invest early find this appealing, as traditional remittance methods often involve hefty fees and delays. By addressing a real-world issue, Remittix (RTX) is poised to attract a larger audience than many other tokens. The success of Remittix’s presale is telling: $7 million raised and 350 million tokens sold in just four weeks highlight its growing strength. It’s not surprising that some Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) supporters are shifting their attention to this new venture, hoping it might soon surpass both coins. The PayFi Proposition Remittix (RTX) brands itself as a PayFi solution, aiming to merge DeFi principles with everyday financial transactions. It offers users the ability to send money globally at a fraction of traditional fees, which could appeal to people beyond the usual crypto enthusiasts. This potential for widespread adoption could strengthen RTX and protect it from the volatile meme coin market. Critics may point out that established networks like Ethereum (ETH) and solutions like Ripple (XRP) already facilitate payments. However, supporters of Remittix (RTX) argue that its user-friendly design makes it more accessible to non-crypto users, potentially driving further investment. Conclusion While Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) have long been favorites in many crypto portfolios, experts now caution about potential declines that could impact both assets. Meanwhile, an increasing number of traders are betting on Remittix over Ethereum and Ripple, drawn to Remittix (RTX) for its practical payment applications and presale achievements.

With its record-breaking presale raising $1 million in minutes, it has captured the attention of both experienced and new investors. Analysts agree: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has firmly established itself as a standout token, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) in their early days. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is Ahead of the Pack 1. Unmatched Presale Success Few cryptocurrencies can claim the level of demand seen by THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . The presale’s $1 million milestone within minutes is a testament to its strong market position and widespread investor confidence. 2. Scarcity Drives Demand With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN ensures sustained demand through its deflationary model. Unlike ETH or MATIC, which face high token circulation, this scarcity gives investors a tangible advantage. 3. Exclusive Market Access Available only at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM , this token’s exclusivity gives early adopters an edge that other widely available cryptos like TRX and ARB can’t replicate. This controlled distribution solidifies its reputation as the go-to investment for those seeking proven opportunities. How THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Outshines Its Rivals Ethereum (ETH): As a leader in DeFi, ETH remains strong but lacks the explosive appeal of this newly dominant token. Polygon (MATIC): While MATIC focuses on scaling Ethereum, it hasn’t achieved the same market enthusiasm or record-breaking performance. TRON (TRX): Known for its content-sharing applications, TRX’s growth has been steady but cannot compare to THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s transformative impact. Arbitrum (ARB): Though a promising Layer-2 solution, ARB doesn’t command the same attention or investor trust. Are You In? THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven itself as the standout crypto of 2025, setting a new benchmark in the market with its record-breaking presale. Its limited supply, exclusivity, and overwhelming demand position it as the go-to choice for investors.

Trader Ali Martinez tells his 119,200 followers on the social media platform X that crypto whales gobbled up more than $3.80 billion worth of Ethereum in a two-day span. “Whales have bought over 1.14 million Ethereum $ETH in [48 hours!]” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $3,340.

Looking at the layer-1 protocol Aptos ( APT ), Martinez warns that the crypto asset appears to be forming a bearish reversal structure on the 12-hour chart. The trader says that APT has to spark rallies soon otherwise the altcoin might witness a severe corrective move. “Aptos APT appears to be forming a head-and-shoulders pattern, with a potential downside target of $4.30.

Additional investment funds are also expected to follow. Read on to discover why Ethereum holders chose to invest in Solana’s competitor, 1Fuel. Solana Breaks Out Of Crucial Resistance Level: What To Expect? Solana may still have some juice left, soaring after breaking out of a key price ceiling. This breakout sets the tone that SOL may be primed for another leg-up towards $300. Crypto expert World of Charts highlighted this development in an X post on January 24, 2025. He noted that SOL was breaking out of a bullish pennant pattern, indicating strong underlying momentum. Trading around $256, SOL executed a clean break from previous resistance levels, which now turned support and may be on the verge of a 17% rally to $300. With Solana buyers still active, SOL is expected to reach the identified target. Meanwhile, Solana’s competitor, 1Fuel, is making a name for itself among Ethereum fans and attracting capital into its ecosystem. In the meantime, SOL is up 2% this week, trading at $257. Ethereum Players Invest $15 Million In 1Fuel’s Web3 Wallet Imagine having not to juggle multiple wallets at once or pay extra fees on cross-chain transactions. Well, 1Fuel’s Web3 wallet aims to bring this imagination to life, and Ethereum investors are front-rowing with massive investments. 1Fuel’s Web3 wallet is a game-changer in on-chain interoperability solutions. Its one-click functionality will enable users to execute transactions seamlessly across numerous blockchains. The platform also offers users secure asset custody with its military-grade cold storage. This system secures users’ holdings offline, protecting them from unexpected online threats. Therefore, users can confidently store their assets on the platform, knowing they’re secure. Also, 1Fuel stands out in the area of privacy. With its integrated privacy mixer, transactions are anonymized by blending them with others, ensuring they’re only privy to the owner. This privacy solution ensures that users are protected from unwanted surveillance. As a result of these solutions, Ethereum investors are showing interest in 1Fuel, investing over $15 million in it in January alone. With them on the scene, 1Fuel’s popularity is widening. Experts Forecasts Big Move For Ethereum Carl Runefelt, a crypto analyst, took to X on January 24 to predict a potential Ethereum price rally, sparking excitement among investors and traders. According to him, ETH seems primed for a rebound after weeks of lackluster performances. Runefelt noted in the post that Ethereum formed a symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart, similar to the one that usually precedes a breakout. Although it is still unclear what direction ETH aims to follow, this setup teases a possible move upward. As ETH nears crucial levels within the triangle, market participants closely monitor its development. To Runefelt, a massive breakout upward could spark a bullish resurgence, while a breakdown could crash the asset. Amid this anticipation, Ethereum investors made a considerable investment in 1Fuel’s ongoing presale. Meanwhile, ETH is moving sidewards. OFT: New Crypto Receives Massive Investment Amid Presale OFT’s presale progress indicates strong interest from investors in the new cryptocurrency. Over $1.5 million has been invested, and 150 million OFT tokens are now in the hands of investors. Stages 1 and 2 of the presale have concluded, and we are currently in Stage 3. During this stage, investors can purchase OFT tokens for $0.017, with the potential to realize up to 500% return on their investment after the tokens are listed for exchange. Since OFT is unlikely to be available at this low price again, this is a call to action for potential investors to buy the new cryptocurrency as soon as possible. Additionally, experts predict an instant 10X profit once the token goes live on exchanges later this year.

According to analysts’s insights, 1Fuel's potential could exceed 100x following the massive traction it has gained in the past few weeks. FLOKI and WIF traders are intrigued by the rapid pace of its token sales, realizing it could be nearing the 2 million mark in a few days. This has pulled them to secure early slots in 1Fuel , which is currently being sold at a discounted presale price of $0.017. Read on to find out why these traders are eager to invest in 1Fuel. FLOKI investors seek alternatives following decline On the charts , FLOKI has formed a descending triangle pattern, a bearish pattern that reveals high selling pressure. This suggests that sellers are gaining momentum, backed by a high chance of FLOKI breaking below its critical support level of $0.0013. At press time, FlOKI is trading at this support level of $0.0013, reflecting a threatening price fall. This trend started on December 9, 2024, when FLOKI hit an all-time high of $0.0028. Since then, FLOKI has continuously formed lower highs and lower lows, solidifying a sustained decline in market sentiment. FLOKI'S market activity has led investors to close their market positions, focusing on one of the best cryptocurrencies, 1Fuel. Similarly, WIFUSDT charts reveal traders have started exiting their long positions also as it replicates a price decline, thus reflecting a wider shift towards profitable alternatives like 1Fuel. WIF faces intense selling pressure In the past 24 hours, Dogwifat (WIF) has declined by 9% per CoinMarketCap . Further analysis reveals that just like FLOKI, WIF has formed a descending triangle, suggesting investors are selling their assets massively. According to TradingView , WIF is trading at a support level of $1.3. WIF faces the risk of breaking below this key threshold as selling pressure continues to rise, with a high probability of more downward movement. Meanwhile, WIF investors are amazed at 1Fuel’s performance and have decided to invest, hoping to get massive returns on investments up to 100x as predicted by analysts. 1Fuel attracts savvy investors If there’s anything investors cherish, it’s getting massive returns and a constant increase in the value of their tokens. This is exactly what has pulled investors to 1Fuel, as it aims to introduce a passive earning system in the form of a staking program. Here, investors can earn up to 30% APR for every token staked on its platform. Also, 1Fuel will be introducing a cross-chain functional cryptocurrency wallet that allows the trading of different cryptocurrencies from varieties of blockchains. Users will no longer have to juggle multiple cryptocurrency wallets or pay exorbitant gas fees. In the bid to ensure users have a seamless experience, 1Fuel aims to introduce AI-powered features that will enable efficient trades, simplify tax reporting, and even help enhance the crypto portfolios of its users. Conclusion The market downturn has caused FLOKI and WIF traders to focus more on profitable tokens and secure early slots in 1Fuel . According to experts, investors could get up to 5,000x or more from 1Fuel’s ongoing presale, positioning it as one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy. At press time, 1Fuel sells at a discounted price of $0.017. Join 1Fuel now to get an instant 20% bonus on your purchase.

Some major ADA investors are already redirecting funds towards a “newer” competitor that is tackling real-world applications in a way Cardano has not fully achieved. Word is spreading that this emerging altcoin is eclipsing ADA and its presale has already garnered over $6.4 billion, suggesting a significant breakthrough is imminent. Some dismiss it as mere hype from early backers. Regardless, the buzz is increasing that Cardano’s struggle to break through critical resistance could drive investors to search for other options. So, what's driving this shift? The Bearish View on Cardano’s Price Stagnation Cardano (ADA) has slipped below key support levels, recently lingering around $0.97, as large holders have offloaded more than $73 million in tokens over the past two weeks. While loyalists claim the Hydra upgrade and ongoing DeFi growth could revive its momentum, critics see a blockchain bogged down by slow development. Although Cardano’s NFT market is still active, daily trading volumes have dropped 15% since last month, indicating waning user interest. Detractors say the network’s “research-first” approach delays real-world adoption, keeping ADA’s price stagnant. If the market doesn’t experience a broader bull rally soon, major stakeholders might look elsewhere, seeking better short-term returns. Remittix Presale Synergy: An Emerging Competitor With ADA facing challenges, many are turning to Remittix presale synergy for a fresh perspective. Unlike a purely conceptual vision, Remittix targets the $190 trillion global banking industry to streamline crypto-to-fiat money transfers, making them quick and affordable. The presale has amassed over $6.4 million, showing strong interest and offering locked liquidity for three years, with a post-presale contract renouncement to ease rug-pull concerns. The current token price is $0.0324, and approximately 320 million tokens have been sold. Should PayFi technology gain traction by 2025, some expect returns of 50x to 100x, significantly exceeding ADA’s conservative forecasts. Visit Remittix for presale details, or find their socials on Linktree . Is This New Altcoin Surpassing ADA? Both large investors and retail traders are intrigued by an altcoin that merges practical finance with cryptocurrency convenience—an area Cardano aimed to transform but has yet to dominate. ADA’s “slow and steady” strategy often disappoints those wanting quicker results, so hearing about a new player addressing everyday challenges is appealing. However, every presale carries risks, including possible adoption issues or unexpected market declines. But the move from ADA to Remittix indicates that even dedicated Cardano enthusiasts seek immediate potential, not just promises of future advancements. If Remittix successfully integrates global banking transfers, it might overshadow ADA’s cautious plans, at least for those pursuing rapid growth. Ultimately, it will depend on genuine user adoption and whether that momentum endures beyond the presale buzz. Will ADA’s Uncertain Future Drive Investors to Remittix? Given Cardano’s price stagnation, many holders are now questioning if the token can reach previous highs. While its dedicated community relies on Hydra updates and new partnerships, the cautious development pace and significant sell-offs by big players indicate a challenging near-term outlook. Meanwhile, Remittix presale synergy is gaining traction with its practical goal of reducing remittance costs, potentially leading to substantial gains if adoption meets expectations. Its locked liquidity and renounced contract contrast with Cardano’s ongoing complexities, appealing to those frustrated by delays and seeking tangible solutions. Whether Cardano makes a comeback or remains in the shadow depends on how quickly the network can realize its expansive DeFi and governance ambitions. For now, the narrative is that unsatisfied ADA supporters view Remittix as a simpler path to potential profits, underscoring the idea that slow progress might cost Cardano market share. Whether you choose ADA’s gradual progress or dive into the Remittix presale for possible 50x or 100x returns, time waits for no one, and patient investors often get restless when new prospects emerge.

Some big ADA holders are already shifting capital to a “fresher” contender that addresses real-world utility in a way Cardano has yet to deliver fully. Rumor has it this new altcoin overshadowing ADA whose presale has already brought in over $6.4 billion, is on the verge of a major breakthrough. Others claim it’s simply hype from early adopters. Either way, the whispers are growing louder that Cardano’s inability to vault past significant resistance may push investors to explore alternatives. So, what’s behind this pivot? Cardano’s Price Stagnation: A Bearish Outlook Cardano (ADA) has drifted below key supports—recently hovering near $0.97 with whale wallets offloading over $73 million worth of tokens in two weeks. While hardcore supporters say the Hydra upgrade and continued DeFi expansions might salvage momentum, skeptics see a chain stuck in slow development cycles. Cardano’s NFT market remains active, but daily volumes have dipped by 15% since last month, suggesting user engagement may be cooling. Critics argue the network’s “research-first” ethos delays tangible adoption, leaving ADA’s price stagnation in place. If a broader bull run doesn’t resurrect confidence soon, major players might rotate elsewhere, eager for stronger returns in the near term. Remittix Presale Synergy: A Rising Contender With ADA struggling, many look to Remittix presale synergy as a breath of fresh air. Unlike a purely theoretical vision, Remittix addresses the $190 trillion global banking sector to make crypto-to-fiat remittances fast and cheap. Over $6.4 million in presale funds reveals strong demand and locked liquidity for three years, plus contract renouncement post-presale, seeking to calm rug-pull fears. The token price currently stands at $0.0324, and about 320 million tokens have been sold so far. If PayFi tech gains real adoption by 2025, some predict 50x to 100x returns, far outpacing ADA’s subdued forecasts. Visit Remittix to check the presale details, or see their socials at Linktree . Is This New Altcoin Overshadowing ADA? Whales and retail investors alike seem intrigued by an altcoin that blends practical finance with crypto ease—an area Cardano promised to revolutionize yet hasn’t dominated. ADA’s “slow and steady” approach sometimes frustrates holders wanting faster results, so hearing about a newcomer who might tackle everyday problems resonates. Still, every presale runs risks, including potential adoption hurdles or unforeseen market downturns. But the pivot from ADA to Remittix suggests that even staunch Cardano fans want immediate potential, not just future upgrades. If Remittix truly integrated global bank transfers seamlessly, it could overshadow ADA’s cautious roadmap, at least for those chasing rapid growth. Of course, the final verdict depends on genuine user uptake and whether that momentum outlasts the presale excitement. Will ADA’s Uncertain Future Push Investors Toward Remittix? Given Cardano’s price stagnation, many holders now question if the token can challenge previous highs. While its strong community clings to Hydra updates and new partnerships, the cautious development cycle and whale sell-offs signal a rocky near-term outlook. Meanwhile, Remittix presale synergy captures attention with a real-world mission of lowering remittance fees, potentially netting huge gains if adoption follows hype. Its locked liquidity and renounced contract stand in contrast to Cardano’s lingering complexities, appealing to those tired of delays and wanting tangible solutions. Whether Cardano eventually rebounds or remains overshadowed depends on how swiftly the network can realize its grand DeFi and governance vision. For now, the story is that disgruntled ADA supporters see Remittix as an easier path to potential gains, reinforcing the notion that slow progress might cost Cardano market share. Whether you embrace ADA’s methodical ascent or venture into the Remittix presale for possible 50x or 100x returns, the clock is ticking, and patient capital often gets restless when new opportunities beckon.

Speaking aboard Air Force One en route to Florida on Jan. 25, Trump confirmed that multiple discussions are taking place with “substantial people” about buying TikTok’s U.S. operations. The President said a decision would likely be made within the next 30 days, though Congress has provided a 90-day window to finalize any deal. The White House is reportedly looking to resolve national security concerns tied to its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. Trump said last week that there is “great interest” in TikTok, adding, “If we can save it, I think it would be a good thing.” Oracle enters the spotlight in TikTok negotiations A Jan. 26 report from NPR says the Trump administration is considering a deal involving Oracle and a group of investors. ByteDance would retain a stake in the company, but Oracle would oversee important aspects like data collection and software updates to address security concerns. Oracle has a history with TikTok as it currently provides the app’s web infrastructure in the United States. The deal under discussion would extend Oracle’s role, making it responsible for safeguarding U.S. user data. But Trump has clarified that he has not personally spoken to Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, even though Ellison is a close friend of his. National Public Radio (NPR) reported that meetings between Oracle and White House officials have already taken place, with more discussions scheduled for next week. Oracle’s potential stake in TikTok could run into the “tens of billions” of dollars, according to the report. Big names compete for TikTok While Oracle is in the running, the list of potential buyers is packed with big names and deep pockets. Elon Musk has been floated as a possible contender, with some people even thinking the Chinese government might favor him as a buyer. Bloomberg reported on Jan. 23rd that Beijing sees Elon’s business ties and relationship with Trump as assets. Notably, Elon himself hasn’t publicly spoken about it, and he talks about quite literally everything on his X (formerly Twitter), like wanting to “bring back Vine.” Billionaire Frank McCourt, founder of Project Liberty, has also thrown his hat into the ring with a $20 billion cash offer. His proposal includes running TikTok on a decentralized social networking protocol overseen by the Project Liberty Institute. Meanwhile, YouTube sensation Jimmy Donaldson, known as MrBeast, has also expressed his interest in acquiring TikTok, even joking in a video that he might become its CEO. That bit is still running by the way, seeing as his TikTok bio still says “New CEO of TikTok?” And the financial stakes are huge. Analysts estimate TikTok’s valuation at $40 billion to $80 billion, meaning only the wealthiest players can afford to enter the bidding war. ByteDance’s current U.S. investors—General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), and Susquehanna International Group—are expected to play a huge role in funding the deal, per a Jan. 26 report from CNBC. Perplexity changes its proposal The negotiations have also brought forward creative proposals. Perplexity AI recently revised a merger plan involving ByteDance and TikTok’s U.S. assets. The proposal, which CNBC claims to have reviewed, outlines the creation of a new U.S. holding company, “NewCo,” with ByteDance contributing TikTok’s U.S. operations—excluding its recommendation algorithm. In this structure, the U.S. government could own up to 50% of NewCo after a future IPO. Funding for the deal would come from new third-party capital providers, and ByteDance investors would receive equity in the new entity. The proposal also includes a one-time dividend payment to ByteDance investors, simplifying governance and providing capital to help NewCo grow. But the Perplexity proposal faces a long road to completion. Trump, meanwhile, has temporarily restored TikTok’s operations in the U.S. as negotiations happen. ByteDance CEO Shou Zi Chew made a TikTok video the day he restored, saying, “I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Are You Making These Web3 Resume Mistakes? - Find Out Here",News|TikTok,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-27 01:43:27

Each of these currencies is experiencing shifts in their prices, with some on the rise while others encounter challenges. Whether it’s Solana’s strong market presence, Bonk’s buzz, or the meme frenzy around Trump Meme Coin and Dogecoin, these coins are influencing the crypto landscape in various ways. Stay informed with the latest updates and trends! Solana Price: Could It Reach $300 Soon? Solana (SOL) has had a dynamic start to 2025, reaching a new peak on January 19, before experiencing a 10% decline. However, in the last 24 hours, the price has seen a 5% increase, suggesting positive momentum. On the daily chart, Solana's price is surpassing key trendlines, hinting that its upward trend might continue. With a bullish MACD signal, the momentum appears solid. If Solana maintains its position above crucial levels, like $232, it might eventually target the $300 mark. Conversely, if Solana falls below $232, a dip to $170 could be on the horizon. Bonk Price Rebounds After Recent Dip Bonk (BONK) has experienced mixed movements in the crypto market. Currently priced at approximately $0.000031 per BONK, it has seen a slight decrease of about 2.30% over the past day. Despite this temporary drop, Bonk's market cap remains robust at $2.38 billion, reflecting ongoing investor interest. While the currency's price may seem unpredictable, meme coins like Bonk often undergo significant swings. Prior to this minor correction, Bonk displayed some positive momentum in recent weeks; if favorable market conditions persist, further gains are possible. Due to its volatility, traders and investors in meme currencies like Bonk should be prepared for risks, though it may offer high-risk, high-reward opportunities for those interested. Trump Meme Coin Experiences Fluctuating Momentum Recently launched, the Trump Meme Coin has garnered significant attention. Its current price is fluctuating around $33.12, reflecting a 5% decrease over the past 24 hours. If the crypto community backs this shift, it could be viewed as a temporary adjustment with potential for future growth. Although still in its early stages, the Trump Meme Coin has captivated many, especially those looking to capitalize on trends and public events. Should it overcome its present slump, prices could rise again, particularly if it continues to fascinate meme coin enthusiasts. However, investors should be cautious, given the notorious price volatility of meme coins. Dogecoin's Upward Movement Encounters Short-Term Setback Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently been on an upward path. Currently priced at $0.35, Dogecoin has seen a minor 1% decline over the past day. Despite this brief dip, Dogecoin remains one of the most actively traded cryptocurrencies, thanks to strong community backing. Dogecoin's positive momentum is bolstered by celebrity endorsements, including Elon Musk. In the long term, it still holds significant potential for notable price changes, especially if market sentiment shifts back in its favor. While investors should be mindful of short-term fluctuations, they should also consider Dogecoin's long-term sustainability as a leading meme coin. Understanding Remittix Presale Token Prices and Tokenomics Remittix (RTX) is attracting considerable attention in the crypto sphere for good reason! Currently, in its presale phase, the price of Remittix (RTX) tokens is set at $0.334, and many anticipate that this price could rise further. The platform aims to make remittances—money transfers—faster and more affordable globally, with RTX serving as the ecosystem's currency. Tokenomics refers to the allocation and utilization of tokens. Remittix has a fixed total supply of 1.5 billion RTX tokens, meaning no additional tokens will be created once all are distributed. This finite supply can create scarcity, potentially boosting value as demand rises. The ongoing presale offers early investors a chance to buy tokens before they are listed on major exchanges, which could yield profits if the token's value appreciates post-launch. While a portion of the tokens is reserved for the Remittix team, the majority are allocated to investors, platform users, and staking rewards. Staking allows participants to earn extra RTX tokens simply by holding them, incentivizing long-term investment. As Remittix expands, its token could experience significant price growth, making it a project worth watching!

Each of these coins is experiencing price changes, with some rising and others facing challenges. Whether it's Solana’s strong market position, Bonk's excitement, or the meme craze surrounding Trump Meme Coin and Dogecoin, these coins are shaping the crypto world in different ways. Keep up with the latest news and trends! Solana Price, Will It Hit $300 Soon? With its price hitting a new all-time high on January 19, then declining 10%, Solana (SOL) has had an interesting beginning to 2025. Still, the price has increased by 5% during the last 24 hours, indicating good momentum. Solana's price on the daily chart exceeds important trendlines, indicating that the rise may persist. Given a bullish MACD signal, the momentum is still clearly robust. Solana's price may finally approach $300 if it continues above significant levels, say $232. Solana's route to $300 may be delayed if it goes below $232, however; the price may drop to $170. Bonk Price Surges After Recent Decline The Crypto market has seen conflicting swings from Bonk (BONK). Its price right now is around $0.000031 per BONK, a little drop of roughly 2.30% in the last 24 hours. Bonk's market capitalization, at $2.38 billion, is maintaining strong despite this transient decline, however, which reflects the interest of investors. Although the price of the currency might look erratic, meme currencies such as Bonk can be prone to extreme fluctuations. Before this little adjustment, Bonk showed some increasing momentum in recent weeks; should the state of the market stay positive, there is a chance for further increases. Because of its volatility, traders and investors in meme currencies like Bonk should be ready for risk; nevertheless, for those seeking high-risk, high-reward possibilities, it might still provide possible returns. Trump Meme Coin Shows Mixed Momentum Launched lately, the Trump Meme Coin has attracted a lot of interest. Its price right now is varying about $33.12, down 5% over the previous 24 hours. If this change gathers support in the crypto community, it might be seen as a temporary fix with future possibility for expansion. Though it is still in its early years, the Trump Meme Coin has attracted a lot of attention, particularly from those trying to profit on trends and public events. Should it be able to overcome its current downturn, prices may climb once more, particularly if it keeps attracting the interest of meme coin aficiones. Nonetheless, investors should proceed carefully as meme coins' price volatility is infamous. Dogecoin's Bullish Trend Faces Short-Term Pullback Dogecoin (DOGE), has lately shown an upward trend. Dogecoin's price right now is at $0.35, which shows a little 1% drop over the previous 24 hours. With strong community support, Dogecoin is among the most traded cryptocurrencies despite this temporary drop. Thanks in part to its celebrity sponsors—including Elon Musk—Dogecoin's positive momentum remains intact. Long term, it still has great potential for notable price swings particularly if market mood turns back in favor of it. Though they should be vigilant to short-term swings, investors interested in Dogecoin should also take long-term viability into account as a top meme currency. Remittix Presale Token Prices and Tokenomics Explained Remittix (RTX) is gaining a lot of attention in the cryptocurrency world, and for good reason! The presale token price of Remittix (RTX) is currently at $0.334 in its current presale stage, and many believe this presale token price could rise further in the future. The platform is designed to make remittances—money transfers—faster and cheaper for people worldwide, and RTX is the token used within the ecosystem. Tokenomics refers to how the tokens are distributed and used. Remittix has a fixed total supply of 1.5billion RTX tokens, meaning no more will be created once they are all issued. This fixed supply helps create scarcity, potentially increasing value as demand grows. The presale of RTX is currently underway, allowing early investors to purchase tokens before they hit major exchanges, which could be an opportunity for profit if the token's value rises after launch. A portion of the tokens is reserved for the Remittix team, but the majority is being distributed to investors, platform users, and for staking rewards. Staking allows people to earn additional RTX tokens just by holding onto their coins, which is a great incentive for long-term investment.

Starting at $0.001, the token’s price has surged to $0.0248, marking an impressive 2,380% increase. These numbers highlight not just investor confidence but also the strong foundation BlockDAG is building for the future. With scalability, community impact, and expert insights driving its momentum, BlockDAG stands out as a top crypto presale ready to explode. The Role of Scalability in BlockDAG’s Projected Success One of BlockDAG’s key strengths lies in its scalability. The project leverages a unique directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure that allows transactions to occur simultaneously rather than sequentially, enabling faster and more efficient operations. This approach ensures the network can handle increased demand without congestion, making it future-ready for mass adoption. By addressing scalability early, BlockDAG is preparing to support a wide range of use cases, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and beyond. As blockchain adoption grows, the ability to process high transaction volumes quickly and affordably will be crucial. This scalability ensures BlockDAG continues to rank as a top crypto presale ready to explode , drawing interest from investors seeking a high-growth opportunity. Building a Global Decentralized Community BlockDAG’s presale success reflects its ability to attract a diverse global community. With participants from over 100 countries, the project has fostered a decentralized network of investors who share a common vision. This global reach is a testament to BlockDAG’s accessibility and appeal, offering an entry point for both seasoned investors and newcomers. More importantly, BlockDAG has empowered small investors by offering early-stage access to its tokens at affordable prices. By democratizing participation in its presale, BlockDAG has created opportunities for individuals who may not have had access to traditional investment vehicles. This inclusivity strengthens its community, building a loyal base of supporters for what many consider a top crypto presale ready to explode . Empowering Small Investors: Democratizing Wealth in Crypto While many crypto projects cater primarily to institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals, BlockDAG has taken a different approach. By structuring its presale with progressive price increases, the project has encouraged early participation without excluding latecomers. This inclusive model ensures that small investors have a chance to benefit from BDAG’s growth, leveling the playing field in an industry often criticized for its barriers to entry. The referral programs tied to the presale amplify opportunities for passive income, further democratizing wealth creation. By empowering small investors, BlockDAG strengthens its community and cements its reputation as a top crypto presale ready to explode into the mainstream market. Analyst Insights: Breaking Down the 2,380% Surge Market analysts have highlighted BlockDAG’s presale as one of the most significant success stories in recent years. The 2,380% price surge from $0.001 to $0.0248 has been driven by strategic pricing, growing investor interest, and the project’s scalable technology. Analysts are particularly impressed by the sustained demand across 27 presale batches, a clear indicator of market confidence in BlockDAG’s vision. Experts also point to the project’s upcoming listings on 10 major centralized exchanges as a catalyst for further growth. These listings will enhance BDAG’s visibility, liquidity, and accessibility, potentially driving its price higher. Projections suggest that BDAG could reach $1 by 2025, reinforcing its position as a top crypto presale ready to explode in value. Why Experts Are Betting on BlockDAG to Outperform in 2025 The combination of advanced technology, strong community engagement, and strategic market positioning has led many experts to view BlockDAG as a standout project. Its scalability ensures it can adapt to future demands, while its decentralized approach resonates with a broad audience. Additionally, the presale’s robust performance signals a strong foundation for long-term growth. As crypto markets evolve, projects that balance innovation with accessibility are expected to thrive. BlockDAG’s ability to empower small investors, foster a global community, and deliver consistent results positions it as a top crypto presale ready to explode , making it a compelling choice for those seeking long-term value. A Long-Term Investment Opportunity BlockDAG’s presale has not only set the stage for short-term gains but also laid the groundwork for sustained growth. With $185 million raised, over 18 billion coins sold, and a community that spans the globe, BlockDAG is well-positioned to capitalize on future opportunities. For investors seeking a top crypto presale ready to explode , the combination of scalability, community focus, and expert confidence makes BlockDAG a project worth considering.

A critical threshold of $109,000 looms in the near future for the market’s leading cryptocurrency, but the clock may be ticking as experts warn of an impending bear market that could emerge within just three months. Analyst Warns Of Imminent Bear Market For Bitcoin Market expert and technical analyst Ali Martinez raised concerns in a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), based on historical patterns observed following Bitcoin’s Halving events. Related Reading: Solana Active Addresses Surge To 832K Per Hour Outpacing Ethereum Amid TRUMP Meme Coin Hype The analyst suggests that Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market could enter a bear cycle approximately 90 days from now. This prediction is grounded in the cyclical nature of Bitcoin’s price movements, particularly during Halving years, which historically have been followed by significant corrections. As further seen in the chart above, Martinez points out that examining the total days of each BTC Halving cycle reveals a striking resemblance to the previous cycle between 2012 and 2016, which lasted 367 days before entering a bear market. As of now, Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market is at 276 days into this cycle, suggesting that a downturn may be closer than some investors anticipate. Will Prices Reach $200,000 Before The Drop? Further analysis from Martinez incorporates the Wyckoff Method, a technical analysis framework that identifies market cycles. According to this method, Bitcoin may be approaching its final leg up before entering the Distribution Phase, a period of consolidation before a price decline. In this phase, Ali Martinez predicts that the BTC price could trade between $140,000 and $200,000 before experiencing a significant drop back toward the $100,000 level. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Keep Buying As Price Struggles – Expert Discloses Massive Accumulation But despite these cautionary forecasts, Martinez also notes that there remains potential for growth in the short term. He draws comparisons to the 2015-2018 cycle, asserting that Bitcoin’s price action at this juncture shares striking similarities with that period, which eventually led to parabolic price increases. Additionally, the Mayer Multiple, a metric that gauges Bitcoin’s overbought conditions, is currently being scrutinized. Historically, the Mayer Multiple has indicated market tops when Bitcoin trades above the 2.4 oscillator. Presently, this level sits near $182,000, suggesting that Bitcoin still has room for growth before reaching a potential market peak this cycle.

Amid a sea of options, it’s tough to identify those that offer both affordability and genuine promise without merely being fleeting buzz. However, for those ready to look closer, these low-priced gems could unlock doors to extraordinary profits, offering a great start for both newcomers and seasoned folks in the crypto world. Here, we highlight five long-term cryptos that promise great value for your money and could form the foundation of your holdings. Web3Bay (3BAY): Transforming Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay stands out in decentralized e-commerce, creating a secure, transparent, user-focused marketplace via blockchain. Its token, 3BAY, powers this ecosystem, enabling transactions, rewarding members, and allowing governance. Currently, at just $0.004562 in its presale, 3BAY presents a prime opportunity for early participants to join a ground-breaking platform. Web3Bay is set to overhaul the trillion-dollar e-commerce sector by enabling global transactions free from traditional banking limitations. Unlike centralized giants like Amazon or eBay, Web3Bay gives users complete control over their data and assets, cutting out middlemen and slashing transaction fees. Web3Bay’s robust tech setup ensures it can handle large transaction volumes securely and efficiently. Using sophisticated blockchain layers, smart contracts, and decentralized storage via IPFS, every transaction on Web3Bay is transparent, secure, and unchangeable. The platform’s strategy to support interoperability with major blockchains like Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain boosts its attractiveness, allowing transactions across different ecosystems. Moreover, integrating common payment methods such as PayPal bridges Web2 and Web3, welcoming both crypto enthusiasts and newcomers. Cardano (ADA): A Leader in Sustainability and Scalability Cardano has remained a strong player in crypto due to its research-oriented approach. Even with its solid reputation, ADA is still under $1, offering an affordable, valuable pick for those interested. Cardano’s system uses a proof-of-stake model—energy-efficient and scalable. It supports smart contracts, decentralized apps, and DeFi platforms, demonstrating its versatility. With continuous network enhancements and real-world partnerships, Cardano is a smart pick for long-term holders. VeChain (VET): Enhancing Supply Chain Management VeChain excels by focusing on blockchain solutions for complex supply chains. It ensures transparent, unchangeable records critical for businesses. The VeChainThor blockchain is crafted for corporate use, allowing firms to monitor products, verify authenticity, and boost supply chain efficiency. VET, its token, is crucial for enabling smart contracts and governance. With VET still under $1 and partnerships with giants like Walmart China and BMW, its potential is vast as more companies turn to blockchain for supply chain solutions. Stellar (XLM): Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments Stellar aims to make international payments as easy and cheap as emailing. XLM, its token, facilitates swift, low-cost transactions, favored in the payment-centric crypto field. It connects banks, payment systems, and individuals, ensuring quick, secure, and affordable global money transfers. Its collaborations with major financial entities like IBM and MoneyGram cement its role as a top technology for cross-border payments. With XLM priced under $1, it’s a great entry point into a widely adopted project, with global remittances set to push its demand further. Harmony (ONE): Pioneering Cross-Chain Compatibility Harmony addresses a major industry challenge: interoperability. Focused on cross-chain compatibility and scalability, it enables smooth interactions between various blockchains, broadening possibilities for decentralized apps. Harmony’s efficient proof-of-stake mechanism and sharding technology ensure fast transactions at low costs, appealing to developers and users alike. Supporting Ethereum apps, Harmony serves as an ideal connector among major blockchain ecosystems. With ONE priced under $1, it’s a wise investment for those betting on the increasing need for interoperability solutions. As blockchain networks grow more intertwined, Harmony’s role could significantly boost its token’s value. Long-Term Cryptos— Final Call! Cryptocurrencies under $1 attract many due to their perceived affordability and potential for hefty growth. While a low price isn’t always indicative of quality, several tokens at this price point offer distinct applications and are built on robust tech foundations. For those aiming to maximize returns, spotting promising projects early is crucial. In assessing these tokens, consider the team, use case, scalability, and potential for adoption. Tokens like 3BAY and ADA aren’t just accessible; they also have strong fundamentals, positioning them as potential leaders for substantial future returns. These best long-term cryptos under $1 provide a budget-friendly gateway into sectors from decentralized commerce and supply chain management to international payments and blockchain scalability.

Market insiders are abuzz with predictions of massive ROI as the token’s presale gains momentum. For those who missed out on Dogecoin’s historic rise, 1FUEL presents an enticing chance to be part of what could be the next big crypto success story. Unlike meme coins riding on hype alone, 1FUEL is built on solid fundamentals and a vision to disrupt the industry. Analysts believe that it could beat Dogecoin’s fame as it offers a perfect blend of utility and profitability. If you’re looking for the next revolutionary crypto project, this is it! Massive ROI Potential: Why 1FUEL Leaves Dogecoin in the Dust 1FUEL isn’t just another token in the crowded crypto market—it’s a bold innovation that’s reshaping the game. Designed with cutting-edge features, 1FUEL eliminates the complications of traditional transactions with its seamless cross-chain functionality. This means users can transfer assets across networks without holding multiple cryptocurrencies, offering simplicity that projects like Dogecoin could only dream of. 1Fuel's magic is in its comprehensive ecosystem. Its privacy-focused mixer, AI-driven tools, and decentralized exchange are built for users who demand more from their crypto experience. Unlike Dogecoin, which relies heavily on its meme-driven appeal, 1FUEL delivers a robust utility that positions it for long-term growth and adoption. With over $1.49M already raised and nearly 150 million tokens sold , 1FUEL’s presale is a testament to what's to come and investors confidence is growing. While Dogecoin’s price soared largely on hype, 1FUEL offers something much more substantial which is a chance to secure massive ROI through a project built on functionality and purpose, not just popularity. As the crypto market evolves, projects offering real-world solutions like 1FUEL are becoming increasingly valuable. For investors, the choice is clear—1FUEL is where the smart money is heading. Dogecoin’s price action may have been impressive in the past, but 1FUEL is on course to do better than that by carving out a future defined by innovation and significant profit. Dogecoin Price Fluctuates as Investors Consider Better Investment Opportunities Hype alone will never be enough for a long-term sustainability in the crypto world and hype is the only thing Dogecoin’s price thrives on. Its lack of inherent utility and price volatility still raise questions and even developments like the news of a Dogecoin ETF is not enough to impress investors. Dogecoin’s price had gone down by over 10% over the last 7 days and now trades at around $0.0358 after a brief surge earlier this month. This volatility starkly contrasts with emerging projects like 1FUEL, which promise massive ROI through innovation rather than speculation. While Dogecoin’s price remains vulnerable to market whims, tokens like 1FUEL offer a more calculated investment opportunity that is backed by real-world utility. As investors shift their attention to projects with tangible usability, Dogecoin price fluctuations continue to mar its reputation. Conclusion While Dogecoin’s price continues to depend solely on hype, 1FUEL offers something far more substantial real-world utility and the potential for a massive ROI. The crypto market is advancing and so should your investment strategy. Don’t miss out on another opportunity for massive returns. Join the ongoing 1FUEL presale today and secure your place in the future of crypto before it takes off.

Hitler Musk (HITMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HITMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Hitler Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Hitler Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Hitler Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Hitler Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Hitler Musk by entering its contract address (CA) – GB5uSMr95szepTSfj6sbJHFxMaBHwwyBzUY6dPAWZCCH – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HITMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-27 02:15:06

DOGE Price Woes Continue in Trump Era,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/is-the-solana-tech-outdated-by-1fuel-doge-price-woes-continue-in-trump-era,"Solana originally gained revolutionary status through its ability to process transactions quickly but now attracts strong doubts regarding its future significance. The introduction of next-generation blockchain technology through 1Fuel (OFT) has presented new capabilities that challenge isolated Solana features which now prompts analysts to examine how Solana will survive. Dogecoin (DOGE), the well-known meme coin, continues to experience unstable market conditions due to the political turmoil associated with the Trump era. Does the changing market influence on DOGE indicate a diminishing value proposition? Let’s unpack the stories of Solana, 1Fuel, and Dogecoin to see how these tokens are faring in 2025’s crypto ecosystem. Solana: A Leader at a Crossroads Solana (SOL) achieves recognition for its fast and scalable operations through its ability to process more than 65,000 transactions per second using nearly free fees. The blockchain market has witnessed Solana continue to pull its weight at $247.10 in January 2025 even though it sits significantly below its peak value while maintaining its pull on developers and dApp creators. However, system vulnerabilities have begun to emerge. Solana falls short in today's blockchain connected ecosystem because its single-chain architecture fails to deliver the essential multi-chain connectivity which users require. 1Fuel serves as one of many platforms which create solutions to bridge this demand gap while attracting multiple user types. The reliance on single-point processing and frequent network outages of Solana creates problems regarding system reliability. Solana needs to resolve its current weaknesses because the industry demands enhanced connectivity alongside system resilience; therefore, the platform must adapt to these new market requirements. 1Fuel: A Challenger with Next-Gen Blockchain Technology 1Fuel’s next-gen blockchain tech focuses on solving two of the industry’s biggest challenges, which are cross-chain interoperability and privacy of transactions. This lets users move digital assets between different blockchains through a bridgeless mechanism which does not require separate wallets for every transfer. Multiple network engagement requires this functionality because users frequently need it for essential system operations. The priority dedication to privacy functions as one of its major impressive features. 1Fuel also delivers privacy mixers alongside its system to enable users to execute anonymous transactions, which answers the market need for secure private digital wallets. The blockchain-based cryptocurrency platform 1Fuel gained substantial market interest because its presale successfully raised $1.5 million through tokens offered at $0.017. This shows investors strongly believe in its delivery capabilities. Dogecoin: Stuck Between Popularity and Progress Dogecoin (DOGE) became a permanent crypto market stakeholder after Elon Musk backed its evolution with his passionate fanbase. The development of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under Musk's leadership triggered initial value gains, yet the token remains unstable because it depends on public attention driven by memes and Twitter activity alongside political events. The tipping capacity of Dogecoin and its status as a symbol exist, while next-generation platforms like 1Fuel present a superior interface through advanced blockchain technologies with multi-chain connectivity capabilities. Without technical progress, Dogecoin faces becoming obsolete because the cryptocurrency market prioritizes innovative features and capability. Conclusion 1Fuel has exposed increasing challenges which face the Solana platform. Solana continues to offer high blockchain performance, yet its single-chain operational structure fails to align with market demands for interoperable multi-chain systems. This failure to adapt to this new paradigm will let next-gen platforms like 1Fuel surpass Solana because they better address blockchain world requirements. Dogecoin experiences fluctuating market popularity because it has failed to deliver genuine breakthroughs, making it susceptible to long-term price drops. For investors, the choice is clear: Real-world problem solutions and cutting-edge technological approaches make 1Fuel, along with similar projects, the dominant forces of the future financial ecosystem. Now is the time to get involved and secure a stake in the next chapter of decentralized finance.

At last check, Bitcoin (BTC) traded at just above $101,000 Sunday night — down 3%. The Trump Factor Bitcoin enthusiasts were optimistic as Trump began his second term as president, anticipating a wave of pro-crypto policies. Yet, the inauguration speech lacked any nod to digital assets, and the market took notice. Investors who had bet on a crypto-friendly administration were left disappointed, prompting a wave of sell-offs. Adding fuel to the fire, a pair of meme coins tied to the Trump brand — dubbed Official Trump ( TRUMP ) and “Melania” — entered the market with a burst of enthusiasm, only to crash spectacularly. The Trump token halved in value just days after its debut, while the Melania coin fared even worse, losing 74% of its worth. These flashy but short-lived ventures added instability to an already jittery market.

While the strong performance of traditional markets offered reassurance to some investors, it also diverted capital away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. The interplay of these macroeconomic forces further compounded Bitcoin’s struggles. Glimmers of hope Despite the turbulence, Bitcoin still holds significant value, trading above $100,000—a level many would have deemed improbable just a few years ago. In the long term, optimism remains. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, and other crypto bulls and firms that offer exchange-traded funds (ETFs) envision a monumental surge. Fink predicted Bitcoin could soar to $700,000 as institutional investors deepen their foray into crypto. What’s Next? For now, the crypto market faces a crucial test of resilience. While Bitcoin’s downturn has shaken confidence, the broader community remains steadfast, seeing these fluctuations as par for the course. At press time, Bitcoin is valued at approximately $101,477.

This was their first conversation since Trump’s return to office, and both agreed to meet face-to-face “very soon.” Interestingly, Starmer had said before that his friendship with Trump will remain solid despite the fact that Trump’s best friend Elon Musk hates him. He constantly berates him for his actions on X (formerly Twitter) and mocks him by calling him “Two Tier Keir.” Meanwhile, Trump and Starmer’s conversation also came during a time of strained economic relations, with Trump’s plans to implement tariffs on February 1, targeting Canada, Mexico, and China. While the UK was not named as a direct target, the effects could easily affect the British economy via its exports. Middle East discussions and a ceasefire deal In their call, Trump and Starmer addressed the fragile situation in Gaza, where a ceasefire and ongoing hostages deal remain the focus of international attention. Both leaders agreed on the importance of collaboration and long-term security in the Middle East. “The United States and the United Kingdom share a commitment to regional stability,” Starmer reportedly told Trump, according to Downing Street. Just hours before the call, Trump imposed tariffs and travel bans on Colombia after the country refused to allow two planes carrying deported migrants to land on its soil. The phone call is seen as an attempt to find common ground despite clear ideological differences. Starmer, leader of the center-left Labour Party, entered office last year and has clashed politically with Trump’s right-wing stance. But the UK appears keen to maintain a productive relationship with its most important ally. Trade tensions and economic uncertainty Trump’s February 1 tariff deadline loomed heavily over the conversation. There are concerns in Whitehall that the US president’s actions could damage global markets, including key trade routes for UK exports. Trump’s “America First” agenda often puts his allies in difficult positions, and this situation is no exception. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Jan. 25, Trump said, “I like him a lot. He’s liberal, which is a little bit different for me. But I think he is a very good person. And I think he’s done a very good job thus far.” Starmer is expected to visit Washington in the coming weeks, following up on the discussions held during the call. It will be the second high-profile interaction between the two leaders. Last September, Starmer met Trump during a dinner in New York, which took place while Trump was campaigning for the presidency. At the time, Trump referred to Starmer as a “friend.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",Economy|USD,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ASIA|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-27 02:36:47

Trump Conquers Canada (TRUMPCAN), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump Conquers Canada can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Conquers Canada could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Conquers Canada launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Conquers Canada on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Conquers Canada by entering its contract address (CA) – HiPRoUXHrovHyJPB5StmSF2XwERbh78iLEfaxtpjVHJC – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-27 02:50:00

Currently, the market’s leading cryptocurrency is hovering above the critical $100,000 milestone, with analysts suggesting that further price increases could be on the horizon. Analyst Warns Of ‘Overly Bullish Sentiment’ In a detailed analysis by a market expert known on social media as Daily Crypto Trading, the Elliott Wave Theory is being employed to predict Bitcoin’s next moves. According to this analysis, the market could be witnessing a flat corrective wave, with a target in the range of $90,000. The analysis confirms that the recent flat ABC structure held firm at the 89-90k levels, indicating that wave 4 has completed. Related Reading: XRP Forms A Bullish Pattern In 4-Hour Chart – Analyst Expects $4.20 After Breakout The analysis highlights that while the sentiment surrounding Bitcoin’s future is “overwhelmingly bullish,” this can often serve as a cautionary sign. As Daily Crypto Trading notes, “Even though wave 4 is done, the sentiment is overly bullish, which is normally a red flag.” Investors are encouraged to approach the situation with caution, acknowledging that while the analysis is rooted in probability, it does not guarantee outcomes. The macroeconomic landscape is also crucial for understanding Bitcoin’s trajectory. Daily Crypto Trading has previously discussed the potential impact of an impending recession, suggesting that macroeconomic factors must be considered before diving into technical analysis. What A $130,000 Price Breach Means For Bitcoin? The Elliott Wave Theory, which has been notably accurate in previous predictions, is a key component of this analysis. It posits that markets move in predictable waves, and currently, the focus is on the final sub-wave of wave 4. The expert anticipates that if Bitcoin surpasses the critical level of $109,000, it will confirm the onset of impulsive wave 5, suggesting a bullish continuation. Should Bitcoin achieve a strong wave 5, projections indicate a potential price increase of 40-50% from the current levels, with Fibonacci extension levels suggesting targets of $113,000, $117,000, and even $121,000. However, there is a caveat: the wave could be truncated, leading to a double top formation and subsequent corrections, or it may fail to reach a new all-time high (ATH). Thus, surpassing the $109,000 mark is deemed a critical milestone for increasing the likelihood of a blow-off top reaching $120,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Eyes $4,000 With Rising Channel Pattern Conversely, if Bitcoin were to dip back to the $90,000 area, it would indicate the formation of a regular zigzag pattern, implying that wave 4 may not be complete. As a contingency, an invalidation point has been established at $130,000; a breach of this level could suggest an unforeseen bullish breakout toward a target of $170,000. Currently, BTC is trading at $104,300, recording losses of 1.4% in the 24-hour time frame.

While newer, hype-centered tokens like TRUMP and MELANIA fleetingly dominate the spotlight, Pepe is poised for a major potential comeback around late January to early February. In the meantime, Elluminex is emerging as a standout DeFi platform on the Toncoin blockchain. With cross-chain bridging, AI-driven tools, and user-focused features, it offers investors a rare early-stage opportunity to benefit from a low-cap presale gem early on. Read on to learn more. Pepe’s Prospects Remain Strong Both For The Short-Term And Long-Term Ahead Of Major Potential Rally The launch of the TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins has captured significant attention in the meme coin market, siphoning liquidity and hype away from established players like Pepe. Coupled with notable whale sell-offs, this has contributed to Pepe’s underwhelming start to 2025. However, tier-1 exchange listings including Coinbase and Robinhood, and frequent Pepe transfers to cold storage wallets have positioned Pepe for a major rally when extreme greed permeates the market as part of the fear and greed index Despite being overshadowed by the frenzy surrounding newer meme coins, Pepe remains a formidable contender for recovery. Notably, Pepe’s ardently loyal community and its history of rapid price surges during challenging market conditions highlight its impressive resilience. However, Pepe’s primary challenge in this bull run lies in overcoming its market cap constraints, which make replicating its explosive 2024 performance difficult. However, the expected altcoin season could provide the perfect environment for a resurgence, as influencers like Murad predict a meme coin supercycle in 2025. As retail investors flood back into the market and seek familiar names, Pepe’s accessibility on major platforms and its reputation as a meme coin pioneer will likely work in its favor, likely evolving to become a top three meme coin in the coming months over Shiba Inu. Looking ahead to the next bull run in 2029, Pepe could position itself as the next Dogecoin. With consistent visibility, strategic partnerships, and an active community, Pepe has the tools to secure its place as a leading meme coin in the long term. That being said, amassing good returns is unlikely with Pepe in 2025, though various bullish catalysts could cause Pepe to explode in value as the bull run progresses, and Pepe still harbors the potential to outperform most top 20 cryptocurrencies in the space. Get In Early To The New Potentially Parabolic Gem Elluminex Before Total 3 Breaks Out! Elluminex is poised to lead the decentralized finance space with its innovative all-in-one platform built on the TON blockchain. Taking advantage of Toncoin’s rising prominence, set for a major resurgence alongside Pepe in early 2025, Elluminex is expected to soar dramatically, offering investors a chance to get into a parabolic gem early on. The platform brings together essential DeFi features such as trading, staking, and asset management in one streamlined ecosystem. By offering a strong rewards system, Elluminex incentivizes token holders while fostering liquidity and creating sustainable growth for its user base, ensuring Elluminex’s sustainability. Another standout feature of Elluminex is its decentralized exchange, equipped with a cutting-edge cross-chain bridge that allows effortless transfers between blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Toncoin. With support for meme coins like Pepe and Dogecoin, Elluminex caters to a diverse audience of crypto investors, regardless of risk appetite or expertise. Elluminex also plans to introduce an educational initiative to demystify DeFi and empower users with the knowledge to confidently engage with blockchain technology. Built on the scalable TON blockchain, Elluminex offers significant growth potential as it prepares to capture attention ahead of its presale launch.

Here’s Why BTFD Coin Is the Meme Coin You Can’t Afford to Overlook,https://thecoinrise.com/124012-2/,"Meme coins have become the unexpected underdogs of the crypto world, defying all odds to generate hype, community loyalty, and massive returns. From Dogecoin’s early success to Shiba Inu’s meteoric rise, there’s no denying that meme coins have a special place in the hearts—and wallets—of investors. One such recent star, Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW), emerged in March 2024 on the Solana blockchain, challenging the dominance of dog-themed meme coins. With its creative concept and impressive surge in trading activity, many investors are kicking themselves for missing its ICO. But here’s the good news: if you missed out on Cat in a Dog’s World, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is here to give you a second chance at explosive gains.

With big players like Bitcoin Cash continuing to hold their ground, and newer contenders like Qubetics ($TICS) taking the spotlight, the excitement around these presales is palpable. Among the sea of presales currently underway, Qubetics stands out as a project that promises to solve real-life problems that have stumped earlier blockchain efforts. While Bitcoin Cash has been a reliable name in crypto circles, providing fast and low-cost transactions, the Qubetics presale is creating a massive stir. The platform focuses on real-world asset tokenization, making it a game-changer in how businesses and individuals approach investments. Unlike other altcoins, Qubetics is not just about speculative gains but about creating tangible value through its innovative approach to tokenizing real-world assets. This could be a huge breakthrough for various industries, and as the presale continues to raise funds, the potential for long-term growth is astronomical. Qubetics ($TICS) – The Altcoin Revolution You Didn’t See Coming Let’s dive deep into Qubetics and see why this presale could be one of the most exciting opportunities in the altcoin space right now. With over 441 million tokens already sold and more than $10.8 million raised in its ongoing presale, Qubetics has already proven to be a hit. The project is in its 18th stage, offering $TICS tokens at $0.0551 each, and analysts are already predicting that the price could skyrocket to $0.25 by the end of the presale. That’s a 353% return on investment (ROI), and the best part? This is just the beginning. Post-presale, the $TICS token could hit $1, offering a jaw-dropping 1713% ROI. But the real kicker? After the mainnet launch, we could see $TICS hitting $5, a staggering 8967% ROI, and even analysts are predicting it could surge to $10-$15. So, why all this hype? Well, Qubetics isn’t just another altcoin aiming to make a quick buck. It’s about solving real-world problems. At the core of Qubetics is its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace , which allows users to tokenize physical assets like real estate, fine art, and even gold. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities for businesses, professionals, and individuals alike. Let’s say you’re a small business owner who wants to expand but doesn’t have the capital. By using Qubetics, you could tokenize your business and offer a share of ownership to investors across the globe. Imagine being a real estate developer who can tokenize properties and make them more accessible to a wider range of investors. Or consider a freelance artist tokenizing their unique artwork for potential buyers who are looking for a slice of the art world but don’t have the cash upfront. Qubetics makes it all possible, providing liquidity and expanding access in ways that were previously unimaginable. Bitcoin Cash – The Classic Choice That Still Packs a Punch Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been around for a while, but it’s still very much a dominant force in the crypto world. Initially created to address Bitcoin’s scalability issues, Bitcoin Cash has been carving out its place as a faster and cheaper alternative to Bitcoin. With its focus on peer-to-peer transactions and a block size that’s much larger than Bitcoin’s, Bitcoin Cash provides quicker transaction speeds and lower fees, making it an ideal choice for everyday payments. Despite the rise of newer, more innovative altcoins, Bitcoin Cash remains a favorite for many investors. It’s stable, reliable, and is still one of the top altcoins in terms of market capitalization. So, if you’re looking for a presale that offers a bit more security, Bitcoin Cash might be the safer bet. In terms of long-term growth, Bitcoin Cash has already proven itself, but the potential for massive gains may be more limited compared to newer projects like Qubetics, which is still in its presale stage. However, analysts are still keeping an eye on Bitcoin Cash, with some predicting that it could reach new highs as adoption grows and more merchants start accepting it for payments. If you’re looking for a presale that is tried and true, Bitcoin Cash could be your go-to option, but don’t expect the astronomical returns that some of the newer altcoins might offer. Why Qubetics is Taking the Lead in This Altcoin Presale Race Here’s the thing: while Bitcoin Cash is solid, Qubetics brings something fresh to the table. By solving real-world problems with tokenization, Qubetics is not just a speculative asset—it’s building a bridge to real-world utility. This is what’s making the Qubetics presale so exciting. As more people understand the practical applications of tokenization, we can expect the $TICS price to rise steadily. In fact, with analysts predicting a $10 to $15 price point after the mainnet launch, it’s no wonder investors are flocking to buy $TICS tokens. The presale momentum is incredibly strong, and there’s still plenty of time to get in before the price shoots up. So, if you want to be part of the next big thing in altcoins, now might be the best time to buy in and ride the wave as Qubetics revolutionizes the way we think about assets and investments. Conclusion: The Future of Altcoin Presales is Here, and It’s Called Qubetics The altcoin presale space is hotter than ever, with Bitcoin Cash and Qubetics leading the charge. While Bitcoin Cash offers a reliable and proven option for investors, Qubetics presents an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a project that has the potential to change the way we interact with the world of assets. With its unique approach to real-world asset tokenization, Qubetics is already proving to be a major player in the altcoin presale game. And with predictions of huge returns on the horizon, this could be the investment opportunity you’ve been waiting for. So, don’t miss out on the top altcoin presale —get your $TICS tokens today before the price explodes. The future of crypto is here, and it’s more exciting than ever.

Among the most anticipated advancements is the upcoming Pectra Upgrade, expected to roll out in mid-March. This upgrade is being hailed as the largest in Ethereum’s history, marked by the introduction of numerous Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that promise to transform the network’s functionality and user experience. How Ethereum Validators Could Earn Even Higher Rewards Anthony Sassano, an independent Ethereum educator and angel investor, has been vocal about the potential impact of the Pectra Upgrade, emphasizing that this upgrade will significantly enhance Ethereum’s user transaction flow through account abstraction, primarily driven by EIP-7702. Instead of navigating the cumbersome approve-then-swap process, users will be able to execute these actions in a single transaction, substantially simplifying the user experience. Related Reading: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record Staggering $4.7 Billion In Seven-Day Inflow Streak — Details Another notable proposal, EIP-7251, is set to increase the maximum effective balance that validators can earn rewards on from 32 ETH to an impressive 2048 ETH per validator. This change means that validators will no longer need to wait to accumulate 32 ETH before they can start earning staking rewards. The upgrade will also allow for the consolidation of validators managed by a single node operator, thereby alleviating some of the network’s operational burden. Key EIPs To Optimize Network Performance EIP-7691 addresses scalability concerns by increasing blob throughput. Blobs have been near capacity for months, which has constrained the scalability of rollups and layer 2 solutions while driving up transaction fees for users. With the forthcoming increase from 3/6 to 6/9 blobs, the network is expected to accommodate more transactions, leading to lower fees and improved performance for users. The Pectra Upgrade also introduces EIP-7623, which raises the cost of using calldata for rollups. This measure encourages rollups to utilize blobs exclusively, optimizing resource allocation on the network. In addition, EIP-7002 will introduce a new mechanism that facilitates validator withdrawals at the execution layer. This innovation aims to create fully trustless staking pools, minimizing reliance on intermediaries for processing withdrawals and reward distributions. Related Reading: Ethereum Tests Massive Falling Wedge – Breakout Could Target $4K Cycle Highs EIP-7685 enhances communication between the execution and consensus layers of Ethereum, allowing smart contracts to interact directly with the staking layer. This development could reduce the need for intermediaries, such as trusted oracles, thereby improving efficiency. Furthermore, EIP-2537 will make cryptographic processes on the network more efficient, particularly benefiting zero-knowledge (zk) operations that are crucial for scalability and privacy. In addition to these prominent proposals, the Pectra Upgrade includes four more EIPs designed to streamline network operations. These encompass improvements such as serving historical block hashes from state and supporting validator deposits on-chain, which will further optimize Ethereum’s infrastructure. Despite these expected upgrades, the Ethereum price continues to hover around $3,200 and $3,300, showing a notable lack of catalysts that could boost the altcoin’s price.

While Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the DeFi space and Ripple (XRP) solidifies its position in cross-border payments, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven to be the standout investment. With $1 million raised in minutes during its presale, it has cemented its position as the ultimate opportunity of 2025. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Next Big Opportunity 1. Exceptional Market Demand In its presale, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN raised over $1 million almost instantly. This level of investor enthusiasm reflects the token’s high growth potential and positions it as the next major crypto to watch. 2. Deflationary Tokenomics With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN creates scarcity that directly drives value. Its deflationary model offers early investors significant advantages, surpassing the gradual inflationary nature of tokens like APT and INJ. 3. Exclusive Availability Unlike BTC and ETH, which are traded on virtually every platform, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity creates a controlled market environment, driving demand and making it an excellent choice for early adopters. How It Compares to Other Top Cryptos Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin may have hit $100K, but its market is mature, making THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN a stronger choice for exponential returns. Ethereum (ETH): A leader in smart contracts, ETH offers stability, but it lacks the exclusivity and early-stage growth of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Aptos (APT): Aptos focuses on scalability but hasn’t captured the same market excitement as this token. Injective Protocol (INJ): INJ excels in DeFi but cannot compete with the overwhelming momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Seize the Opportunity Now Bitcoin’s success paved the way for standout cryptos like THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN to dominate the market. With limited supply, overwhelming demand, and exclusive availability, it’s the ultimate choice for investors seeking the next big win.

In a tweet accompanied by a chart, he noted , “This is literally going to be the most hated 7-year breakout ever seen on Crypto Twitter.” The chart depicted XRP breaking through a long-term resistance level, marking a major milestone in the digital asset’s price trajectory. After years of consolidation, this breakout has sparked mixed reactions within the crypto community. While some celebrated the achievement, others remained skeptical, questioning whether this technical event would translate into sustained growth or widespread adoption. This is literally going to be the most hated 7-year breakout ever seen on Crypto Twitter. #XRP pic.twitter.com/Cn00nNUs2j — Blockchain Backer (@BCBacker) January 24, 2025 Community Reactions: Bitcoin vs. XRP Debate Resurfaces Blockchain Backer’s tweet reignited debates among crypto enthusiasts, particularly between supporters of XRP and Bitcoin. An X user, USA603, expressed frustration with the rivalry, commenting, “I hope so, seeing all the Bitcoin maxi’s whining like little babies is annoying. Why can’t people embrace both? They are very different. One is a commodity, and one has potential use cases for transactions.” USA603’s statement underscores the ongoing divide between Bitcoin maximalists and XRP proponents, who often argue about the assets’ differing use cases and market roles. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another user, VincentNY, took a more measured approach, stating , “I really couldn’t give a [care] about XRP being a US reserve. Would be great but I have been buying XRP since 2016 because I believed in what it will do. It still has that potential whether or not it is selected. Bitcoin needs inflows of liquidity to boost value; XRP needs adoption.” VincentNY’s perspective highlights the importance of adoption for XRP’s long-term success instead of speculative narratives about its potential use as a reserve currency. Significance and Challenges Ahead for XRP The seven-year breakout is a noteworthy development for XRP, particularly in light of its turbulent history. XRP has faced significant challenges, including prolonged market stagnation and regulatory battles. Part of Its legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), resolved in 2023 , brought clarity to XRP’s status but left lingering questions about its broader adoption. Proponents of XRP argue that its efficiency, scalability, and partnerships with financial institutions position it as a transformative solution for cross-border payments. However, critics often cite concerns over Ripple Labs’ influence and lingering regulatory uncertainty as potential obstacles. This breakout represents a technical victory for XRP, but its long-term success depends on more than price movement. Adoption, utility, and market perception will be critical factors in determining whether XRP can capitalize on this momentum.

This strong performance in fees, however, contrasted with ETH’s price, which underperformed expectations during the same period. All in all, Layer 1 and 2 blockchains collectively earned almost $6.9 billion from transaction fees last year. Ethereum Maintains Fee Dominance Despite Dencun Upgrade According to CoinGecko’s latest report , Ethereum’s fee revenue figure witnessed a 3% increase compared to the $2.41 billion earned in 2023. Despite the Dencun upgrade in March 2024, which lowered Layer 2 transaction costs and a continued shift of users from the main Layer 1 chain to Layer 2 scaling solutions, Ethereum maintained its dominance in fee earnings. CoinGecko found that the fees Ethereum earned fluctuated month by month. In 2023, it generated between $91.22 million and $448.70 million per month, with higher earnings during May’s meme coin frenzy and the market surge at the end of the year. In 2024, this range expanded significantly, with monthly earnings falling between $62.82 million and $606.77 million. Ethereum’s fee revenue reached $1.17 billion in the first quarter of 2024 and constituted nearly half of its annual total. This was the blockchain’s best-performing quarter in two years, owing to a surge in on-chain activity triggered by airdrop initiatives. Bitcoin and BNB Chain Lag Behind Tron became the second highest-earning blockchain and earned $2.15 billion in fees in 2024, a 116.7% rise from $922.08 million the previous year. The growth in Tron’s fees was largely driven by expanding stablecoin usage, with monthly earnings increasing from $38.36 million in January 2023 to $342.54 million in December 2024. Next up was Solana, whose annual fee earnings skyrocketed by 2,838%, jumping from $25.55 million in 2023 to $750.65 million in 2024. It was the most popular blockchain ecosystem of the year, with transaction volumes spiking to the point of network congestion in April 2024. Solana’s monthly fee earnings were steady in 2023 but rose unpredictably in 2024, starting at $15.54 million in January, reaching an all-time high of $197.5 million in November, and settling at $120.95 million in December. On the other hand, Bitcoin’s fee earnings grew by almost 16%, while BNB Chain saw an 8.7% rise, both showing more moderate increases. Bitcoin’s growth has been supported by greater activity from Ordinal NFTs, BRC-20, and Rune tokens, in addition to surging interest in developing on the Bitcoin blockchain.

The price dipped below $3.00 and is currently attempting to start a recovery wave. XRP price started a downside correction from the $3.20 zone. The price is now trading below $3.050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $3.120 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it stays above the $3.00 support. XRP Price Dips Just Below Support XRP price struggled to continue higher above the $3.20 resistance and reacted to the downside, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price dipped below the $3.15 and $3.12 support levels. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $3.120 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair even spiked below the $3.00 support. A low was formed at $2.940 and the price is now consolidating losses. The price is now trading below $3.120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a minor move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.207 swing high to the $2.940 low. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $3.050 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.207 swing high to the $2.940 low. The first major resistance is near the $3.150 level. The next resistance is $3.20. A clear move above the $3.20 resistance might send the price toward the $3.250 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.350 resistance or even $3.3650 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.450. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $3.050 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3.00 level. The next major support is near the $2.950 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.950 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.880 support. The next major support sits near the $2.750 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

Bitcoin (BTC) is now worth $104,987.99, showing a 10.7% jump this month. Some analysts think this could lead to a record-breaking climb. At the same time, Cardano (ADA) is launching its Plomin Hard Fork. This upgrade may make Cardano the first fully decentralized blockchain. Not to be outdone, Panshib ($SHIBI) is a fun but advanced memecoin that plans to make a splash by 2025. All three are moving forward quickly, so the coming year could be the most exciting for crypto. Bitcoin: Heading Toward 300K Crypto markets love to speculate, and few ideas have caused more buzz than a Bitcoin $300K Prediction by December. Some say that goal seems too high, but Bitcoin’s history of surprising people suggests it might still happen. Many factors are fueling the current optimism: big investors joining in, wider news coverage, and steady interest from everyday buyers. Of course, Bitcoin’s well-known price swings mean that sudden economic changes can shift trading in a heartbeat. Even so, Bitcoin’s 9.07% gain this month shows that belief in its growth is still going strong. Cardano’s Plomin Hard Fork: A Path to Full Decentralization While Bitcoin garners headlines with big price forecasts, Cardano (ADA) continues its steady evolution. Priced around $0.9929, Cardano has garnered praise for its scientific, peer-reviewed approach to blockchain technology. Now, with the Plomin Hard Fork upgrade on the horizon, ADA could see increased utility and market interest. This upgrade aspires to transform Cardano into the first fully decentralized blockchain in crypto history, a feat that has captured the imagination of developers and investors alike. It aims to enhance scalability, boost security, and even improve governance—an ambitious triad that could redefine blockchain standards if successful. Community backing for Plomin has been overwhelming, with a 96.30% participation rate in recent votes. Such a high approval metric highlights the eagerness within the Cardano ecosystem to push the project forward. By attracting more dev teams and potential partnerships, the upgrade could spark new dApp innovations and solidify ADA’s reputation as a cutting-edge platform. Although the short-term price implications remain unpredictable, many analysts foresee incremental, steady gains if the network delivers on its roadmap. While it may not boast the same moonshot goals as the Bitcoin $300K Prediction f, Cardano’s disciplined approach could offer a robust alternative for those seeking less volatile, research-backed opportunities. Panshibi: The Panda-Themed Disruptor for 2025 Amid Bitcoin’s sky-high projections and Cardano’s transformative upgrade, a new player called Panshibi is capturing the spotlight in its own unique way. This panda-inspired memecoin marries the playful energy of internet culture with a clear-cut roadmap that aims to turn heads in 2025. Featuring a 60-day presale organized into multiple stages, Panshibi is on track for a launch price of $0.026 having already attracted over $45,000 in its first day alone. Such early momentum speaks to the coin’s blend of fun branding and tangible utility, including AI-driven “social-fi” features and governance options that reward holder participation. Beyond its charming exterior, Panshibi prioritizes stability and investor confidence. Liquidity is locked for 10 years, team tokens remain locked for two, and a Coinsult audit ensures the contract meets key security benchmarks. Post-presale, ownership of the smart contract will be renounced, placing control in the hands of the community. The coin’s native $SHIBI also boasts staking returns up to 1,200% APY, making it tempting for risk-tolerant traders. If the project sustains its buzz, it could deliver the kind of dramatic gains that often elude older, more methodical tokens. For those who crave both high stakes and a dash of whimsy, Panshibi seems well-positioned to make waves in 2025. Conclusion Between the Bitcoin $300K Prediction, Cardano’s Plomin Hard Fork, and Panshibi’s meme-fueled ambitions, it’s clear that the crypto market shows no signs of slowing down. Each project targets a different segment of the investor base: Bitcoin’s scarcity and global brand appeal, Cardano’s methodical progress toward decentralization, and Panshibi’s vibrant community and high-reward potential. Whether you lean toward established giants or disruptive newcomers, 2025 seems poised to become a milestone year in cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped to the $101K level today, whereas Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Solana (SOL) cracked 4%-8%. Meanwhile, U.S. stocks also took a hit amid Chinese AI DeepSeek’s rise. So, let’s take a closer look at some of the leading crypto by market cap, their price action, and broader market trends on January 27. Cryptocurrency Prices Today: Market Tumbles Ahead of FOMC In light of the looming FOMC set to take place as of January 29, the broader crypto market reflects a substantially unsure investor sentiment. The global crypto market cap fell by over 3% intraday and was evaluated to be $3.47 trillion. However, the total market volume witnessed a 21% increase from yesterday to $106.54 billion. While BTC and top altcoins tanked notably intraday, leading meme coins Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu(SHIB), and others also mimicked a waning movement. Here’s a brief overview of some renowned cryptocurrency prices today. Bitcoin Price Down To $101K As Cryptocurrency Prices Take Hit BTC price cracked over 3% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $101,239. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $100,721.57 and $105,438.64, respectively. The waning price action aligns with the broader market trend, although Bitcoin’s dominance was up 0.36% intraday. Besides, leading crypto market analyst Ali Martinez has conversely maintained a bullish perspective on the asset’s future perspective, spotlighting a $122,000 price target looms. BTC saw over $57 million in liquidations, per recent Coinglass data , further aligning with the price drop. As mentioned above, the looming FOMC has appeared to have pushed traders to be cautious. Ethereum Price Tanks 5% ETH price pulled back 5% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $3,172. The coin’s intraday low and high were $3,161.93 and $3,359.31, respectively. Ethereum currently mimics the broader market trend, with nearly $30 million in liquidations recorded today. However, it’s noteworthy that weekly net inflows totaled $139,32 million for Ethereum ETFs as of Jan 24. The current market sentiment for the asset remains uncertain. XRP Price Drops 5% XRP price also fell by nearly 5% in the past 24 hours and is currently resting at $2.99. The crypto’s intraday low and high were $2.95 and $3.14, respectively. Notably, the Ripple-backed asset’s fall below $3 sparked severe concerns among investors. Meanwhile, XRP recorded nearly $5 million in liquidations as of Monday. SOL Price Cracks 10% SOL price chart showcased a 10% drop in value at the time of reporting, reaching $233.18. Solana’s 24-hour low and high were $233.23 and $259.63, respectively. The cryptocurrency has followed the broader market trend, recording over $10 million in liquidations. Meme Cryptocurrency Prices Today Simultaneously, DOGE price tanked 8% over the past day and is trading at $0.327. SHIB price also fell over 7% in the past 24 hours and is sitting at $0.00001851. Moreover, PEPE and TRUMP prices fell nearly 13%, reaching $0.00001301 and $26.60, respectively. DeepSeek AI Threatens U.S. Stocks Meanwhile, the rise of the open-source Chinese AI startup DeepSeek appears to have sent shockwaves across the U.S. large-cap tech. Recent reports reveal that the Chinese AI startup is already outperforming leading American AI companies like OpenAI and Meta, whilst the Nasdaq 100 futures are also down significantly since the market opened just hours ago, all happening as DeepSeek takes the no. 1 spot on App Store. Top Cryptocurrency Gainer Prices Today Onyxcoin (XCN) Price: $0.03688 24-Hour Gains: +10% Jupiter (JUP) Price: $0.9859 24-Hour Gains: +7% AIOZ Network (AIOZ) Price: $0.8133 24-Hour Gains: +4% Top Cryptocurrency Loser Prices Today Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Price: $0.9807 24-Hour Loss: -28% Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) Price: $2.09 24-Hour Loss: -17% HyperLiquid (HYPE) Price: $20.67 24-Hour Loss: 15% Nevertheless, despite the broader cryptocurrency market volatility, renowned crypto analyst Ash Crypto stated, “Altseason is finally coming,” and “utility tokens are about to explode.” Further, digital asset strategist at VanEck, Gabor Gurbacs, spotlighted the DeepSeek rise chronicle on X , saying, “Now that everyone knows that AI doesn’t need that $500 Billion investment, the U.S. should just buy Bitcoin with it,” setting off waves of discussions.

In recent insights on social media platform X, Kiyosaki connected his warnings to economic principles, emphasizing Bitcoin’s growing dominance in the face of traditional financial instability. In RICH DADs PROPHECY-2013 I warned the buggiest stock market crash in history was coming. That crash will be in February 2025. Good news because in a crash everything goes on sale. Cars and houses on sale now. Better news billions will leave the stock and bond markets and… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) January 27, 2025 February 2025: The Crash That Changes Everything Kiyosaki has recalled his 2013 prediction of the “biggest stock market crash in history,” set to happen in February 2025. Technically while other financial tools are destined to fall as per Robert Kiyosaki, he bets high on Bitcoin. He explains Bitcoin’s rise using two ideas: Gresham’s law and Metcalfe’s law. He says inflation has made the U.S. dollar “bad money,” while Bitcoin, gold, and silver are “good money” that hold their value. He also compares Bitcoin’s growing network to successful businesses like McDonald’s, showing how its global reach increases its power and value. TWO LAWS THAT GIVE BITCOIN POWER 1: GRESHAMS LAW: When BAD money enters a system GOOD money goes into hiding. Good money gold and silver have been hiding from FAKE US dollars for years. Today, Gold, silver, and Bitcoin are forcing the fake US dollar into hiding. 2:… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) January 25, 2025 However, Kiyosaki views this impending crash as an opportunity, emphasizing that downturns make assets like cars and houses more affordable. He also believes the fallout will trigger a significant shift in capital from stock and bond markets into alternative assets like Bitcoin, gold, and silver. This is also a great opportunity to buy Bitcoin as prices are still in control once they rise it will be out of scope to buy Bitcoin for small traders. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Altcoins To Watch This Week! New All-time Highs Incoming? , A Call to Action Kiyosaki’s critique of fiat currencies and advocacy for alternative assets reflect his broader warnings about economic instability. He believes Bitcoin’s resilience and network power position it as a hedge against the collapse of traditional financial systems. With a forecast of Bitcoin potentially reaching $250,000 in 2025, Kiyosaki urges people to “get out of fake and into crypto” while prices remain accessible. He says, “Good money is here to stay, and Bitcoin is leading the way.” Kiyosaki’s message underscores his long-standing critique of traditional financial systems. He urges people to leave “fake” assets and seek refuge in cryptocurrencies and precious metals. His predictions are similar to his earlier warnings, and he continues to advocate for preparedness in the face of economic uncertainty. Bitcoin Current Sentiment At present the global Bitcoin market is on the rise and there is growing adoption as Trump is planning for his plan to set up a Bitcoin strategic reserve in the US by this year. However, the overall market saw some turbulence today, as investors are panicking due to the FOMC meeting this week. Bitcoin dropped to $101K, while ETH, XRP, and Solana tanked 4%-8%. US Stocks also hit hard amid Chinese AI DeepSeek’s rise. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

ADA is consolidating and might struggle to start a fresh increase above the $1.00 level. ADA price started a fresh decline from the $1.020 zone. The price is trading below $1.00 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $0.9750 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $1.00 resistance zone. Cardano Price Settles Below $1.00 After struggling to stay above the $1.050 level, Cardano started a fresh decline unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA declined below the $1.00 and $0.9750 support levels. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $0.9750 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The pair even traded below the $0.920 support. A low was formed at $0.91645 and the price is now attempting to recover. There was a move above the $0.9220 level. Cardano price is now trading below $1.00 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.9350 zone. It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.9998 swing high to the $0.9164 low. The first resistance is near $0.9550 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.9998 swing high to the $0.9164 low. The next key resistance might be $0.9680. If there is a close above the $0.9680 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $1.00 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $1.050 in the near term. Another Decline in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.9350 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.9160 level. The next major support is near the $0.90 level. A downside break below the $0.90 level could open the doors for a test of $0.8650. The next major support is near the $0.8450 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.

Trump Conquers Canada (TRUMPCAN), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump Conquers Canada can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Conquers Canada could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Conquers Canada launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Conquers Canada on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Conquers Canada by entering its contract address (CA) – HiPRoUXHrovHyJPB5StmSF2XwERbh78iLEfaxtpjVHJC – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-27 05:19:00

That's the takeaway from the comparative analysis of TRUMP's market cap versus the total value of the crypto market. The memecoin launched with significant impact last week, reaching a market cap of over $10 billion on its first day, but has since dropped to approximately $5.3 billion at the time of writing. Meanwhile, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies has fluctuated around $3.5 trillion, according to data from TradingView and CoinDesk. ""While $TRUMP is now worth billions, the total crypto market cap has barely moved. And while it's a really interesting headline to say that 400,000 users were onboarded, Phantom was the number one app for a little bit, and it feels like the whole world was paying attention to this token, I think what we actually did was onboard a lot of attention,"" Garrison Yang, co-founder of leading international Web3 gaming studio Mirai Labs, said in an email.

While the nature of this supposed stockpile remains unclear, the tweet implies that XRP, alongside BTC, is playing a pivotal role in broader conversations about cryptocurrency. I rarely post rumors unless the sources are reliable and I hear it from multiple places. It will take a long time to see how all of this shakes out, but I can assure you that $XRP is currently a major part of the conversation. Will take months to sort and a lot can change. https://t.co/gd8TsxeUcv — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) January 24, 2025 The Initial Tweet and Context The Wolf of All Streets noted that he seldom shares rumors unless backed by credible sources and multiple confirmations. He emphasized that while the rumor remains unverified, XRP is a key part of ongoing discussions. He cautioned that any developments would likely take months, leaving the community to speculate on the specifics. This tweet reignited debates about XRP’s role in the broader crypto ecosystem, particularly given its status as the only digital asset currently classified as not being security by U.S. courts following Ripple’s partial legal victory against the SEC . Divided Reactions From the Community Responses to the tweet were mixed, with some expressing skepticism and others firmly defending XRP’s potential. A notable comment came from X user Rico, who accused The Wolf of All Streets of attempting to subtly promote XRP for personal gain. Rico pointed out that Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen was a significant donor to Kamala Harris’s campaign, referencing claims supported by a Times Tabloid report from 2024. The report revealed that Larsen contributed $11.7 million to Harris’s presidential race, making him the largest single donor from the crypto sector. Rico argued that this political connection could undermine XRP’s credibility under the current Trump administration. On the other hand, Edo Farina, CEO of Alpha Lions Academy and a prominent XRP advocate, dismissed Rico’s claims. Farina highlighted XRP’s regulatory clarity in the United States, contrasting it with other cryptocurrencies under scrutiny. Farina’s stance aligns with the sentiments of many XRP supporters who view the asset as uniquely positioned for institutional adoption due to its compliance with U.S. regulations.

Bitcoin’s inclusion in such conversations is unsurprising given its dominance as the first and most widely adopted cryptocurrency. However, XRP’s inclusion, if true, could signify recognition of its utility in cross-border payment solutions and its established partnerships with financial institutions. It is worth noting that rumors such as these can significantly influence market sentiment, even without concrete evidence. The cryptocurrency market, often driven by speculation, has seen similar narratives in the past. However, The Wolf of All Streets’ cautious tone suggests he understands the importance of not overstating unverified claims. As the situation develops, it will be important to observe whether these discussions lead to tangible outcomes or remain speculative.

From proposing an overhaul of Coinbase's asset listing process to reflecting on US President Donald Trump’s ambitious plans for digital assets, Armstrong’s recent remarks shine the spotlight on the growing significance of crypto in shaping economic and technological innovation. His insights, shared during the World Economic Forum in Davos, reveal a pivotal moment for the industry as leaders and institutions seek to adapt to shifting market dynamics and regulatory priorities. Brian Armstrong Proposes Overhaul to Coinbase’s Asset Listing Process Amid Token Surge The exponential growth in the number of new tokens has posed significant challenges for exchanges. Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase , the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, has called for a reevaluation of the company’s asset listing process in response to the overwhelming influx of new tokens. In a post on X dated Jan. 24, Armstrong mentioned the difficulties Coinbase faces with the surging number of new tokens being created weekly. “We need to rethink our listing process at Coinbase, given there are ~1 million tokens a week being created now, and growing,” Armstrong wrote. He pointed out that manually evaluating each token is no longer feasible, adding that the current model could hinder innovation in the cryptocurrency space. Armstrong also urged regulators to adopt a more pragmatic approach to token oversight. “It needs to move from an allow list to a block list and utilize customer reviews and automated scans of onchain data to help customers sift through,” he suggested. This hybrid approach, combining automation with community input, could streamline the process while maintaining security and compliance. Coinbase’s existing token listing process is multi-layered, involving initial reviews, due diligence, and regulatory compliance checks. The platform has prided itself on maintaining rigorous standards to ensure security and legal compliance for its users. However, as the cryptocurrency market matures and diversifies, this manual approach may no longer be sustainable. Armstrong’s comments indicate a shift towards a more scalable solution, leveraging automation and decentralized tools to handle the sheer volume of token creations while ensuring that customers can make more informed investment and trading decisions. Armstrong’s proposal has sparked a wave of reactions from the crypto community, with some raising concerns over the fairness and transparency of Coinbase’s listing policies . One of the most notable critiques came from Justin Sun, the founder of Tron (TRX), who highlighted that his project, despite being one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, has been under review by Coinbase for seven years without being listed. “This has nothing to do with TRX itself but rather reflects Coinbase's loss of the most basic fairness and industry judgment when it comes to new listings,” Sun wrote on X. He also alleged that Coinbase demanded exorbitant fees for listing TRX, including 500 million TRX tokens (worth $80 million at the time) and a $250 million Bitcoin deposit to be held in Coinbase Custody. Sun's claims have yet to be verified, but they have reignited debates about the ethics and transparency of listing practices among centralized exchanges. Pseudonymous crypto influencer Ansem also weighed in, suggesting that Coinbase should hire industry veterans with hands-on experience to identify high-potential tokens efficiently. “They can tell you the 10 out of 1 million tokens that need to be listed as soon as possible. This is an easily fixable problem,” Ansem stated. Armstrong’s vision for Coinbase extends beyond overhauling the token listing process. He revealed plans to deepen integration with decentralized exchanges (DEXs), a move that could transform the user experience on the platform. According to Armstrong, the goal is to create a seamless trading experience where customers “shouldn’t need to know or care whether the trade is happening on a DEX or CEX [centralized exchange].” This hybrid model could pave the way for greater decentralization in the crypto trading ecosystem while maintaining the user-friendly interface that Coinbase is known for. As the cryptocurrency market continues to expand, exchanges like Coinbase face mounting pressure to adapt their operations. Brian Armstrong’s proposal to rethink the asset listing process is part of a growing need for scalable and innovative solutions in the face of token proliferation. By leveraging automation, customer reviews, and decentralized tools, Coinbase could set a new standard for how exchanges manage token listings while addressing community concerns about transparency and fairness. However, the path forward is not without challenges. As Armstrong’s proposals draw both support and criticism, the cryptocurrency industry will be watching closely to see how Coinbase navigates this pivotal moment. With the promise of regulatory clarity and the potential for decentralized integration, the exchange has the opportunity to redefine its role in the evolving crypto landscape. Brian Armstrong Highlights President Trump’s Crypto Plans as Key Topic at Davos In related news, Armstrong revealed that US President Donald Trump’s ambitious plans for cryptocurrency have become a focal point of discussion among financial and crypto industry leaders. In a Jan. 24 post on X, Armstrong reflected on his experiences at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, where Trump’s bold stance on crypto dominated conversations. “Basically every conversation I had with major market leaders was focused on what the Trump Admin planned to do on crypto,” Armstrong wrote, adding that Trump’s proactive approach is compelling the industry to “up their game.” President Trump made waves during his WEF address by pledging to transform the United States into the “world capital of artificial intelligence and crypto.” This commitment, one of his first major announcements since taking office on Jan. 20, signals a dramatic shift in US policy toward embracing emerging technologies. Armstrong remarked that Trump’s vision is not just reshaping the crypto space but is also igniting broader discussions within the financial sector. “President Trump is forcing everyone to up their game,” Armstrong said, emphasizing that financial institutions and market leaders are keen to avoid being left behind in this evolving landscape. Trump’s administration has already taken steps to signal its commitment to digital assets. A recent executive order established a working group to evaluate the creation of a strategic national digital assets stockpile. While Bitcoin investors initially hoped for a Bitcoin-specific reserve, the broader language of the order has sparked speculation about whether other cryptocurrencies might also be included. Armstrong lauded Trump’s free-market stance, aligning it with similar approaches by Argentina’s President Javier Milei and El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele. Both leaders have championed Bitcoin and blockchain innovation as tools for economic growth. Armstrong suggested that these leaders “understand that free markets are catalysts for prosperity” and predicted that “socialism is on its way out.” El Salvador, under Bukele, has already adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, and Argentina’s Milei is a vocal advocate for crypto adoption. Trump’s alignment with these policies could further solidify the United States’ position as a leader in the digital asset space. Armstrong noted a surge in interest from traditional financial institutions, including banks, asset managers, and payment service providers, who are now accelerating their investments in cryptocurrency. “There are going to be more players and competition than ever in crypto, and we welcome it all. We need crypto to update the entire global financial system to bring these benefits to everyone,” Armstrong said. While the enthusiasm is palpable, regulatory hurdles remain a significant barrier. At the WEF, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon acknowledged growing interest in Bitcoin but highlighted existing constraints. “At the moment, from a regulatory perspective, we can’t own, we can’t principal, we can’t be involved with Bitcoin at all,” Solomon said, calling Bitcoin an “interesting speculative asset.” Armstrong also referenced Trump’s speculated plans for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a concept that has stirred considerable debate. While some in the crypto community view it as a natural step toward legitimizing Bitcoin as a national asset, others see the broader focus on a digital assets stockpile as a missed opportunity to highlight Bitcoin’s unique attributes. Ripple, the company behind XRP, recently faced backlash for promoting a multi-asset reserve instead of a Bitcoin-specific strategy. Critics argue that Bitcoin’s established reputation and market dominance make it the ideal candidate for a reserve system. Crypto Industry at a Crossroads Armstrong’s reflections bring attention to a critical moment for the cryptocurrency industry. As the United States embraces a more crypto-friendly stance under Trump’s administration, other nations and global financial institutions are also reevaluating their positions. However, questions remain about the practical implications of these policies. Will regulatory clarity emerge to enable traditional institutions to fully participate in the crypto market? Can the US balance innovation with oversight to maintain its competitive edge? As discussions unfold, one thing is clear: Trump’s bold vision is forcing the global financial ecosystem to take cryptocurrency more seriously. Armstrong’s optimism about the future of crypto reflects the industry’s readiness to embrace competition and innovation while navigating the challenges ahead. Brian Armstrong’s observations at Davos highlight the transformative potential of President Trump’s crypto agenda. From discussions about a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to the growing interest among traditional financial institutions, the landscape is evolving rapidly. With leaders like Trump, Milei, and Bukele championing the benefits of free markets and digital assets, the future of cryptocurrency looks brighter than ever. However, the industry must address regulatory and institutional barriers to ensure that this momentum translates into meaningful progress. As Armstrong aptly put it, “We need crypto to update the entire global financial system to bring these benefits to everyone.”",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-27 05:30:00

Meanwhile, is PEPE able to recover its all-time peak soon and will XRP escape its current phase of consolidation? While predictors estimate a startling meteoric increase, ELX is attracting traders’ attention as one of the best cryptos to invest in during this bull run. Read on to find out the reason these three cryptocurrencies are taking the stage. Elluminex (ELX) Is Set To Enhance DeFi On The TON Network Elluminex is positioned as the best crypto investment for those wishing to take advantage of the fast-expanding TON Network. Moreover, Elluminex is poised to improve the DeFi capabilities of this blockchain which is already the fastest growing in the world, offering great opportunities for regular users and developers. Elluminex will close the gap by offering cross-chain solutions and smooth liquidity access as relatively few DeFi choices are now accessible on the TON Network. This innovation will enable projects and crypto users to trade freely and effectively, therefore developing the TON ecosystem into a powerhouse rivaling big blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Meanwhile, Elluminex is not only about tokens and liquidity; it’s about building a platform that encourages active community involvement and participation. Furthermore, Elluminex is positioned to draw a wide and active user base with its mobile app for on-the-go asset management, gamification elements to improve user experience, and rewards for contributing to the ecosystem. Given the ELX token’s cheap $0.06 presale value, buyers have the opportunity to enter early. Elluminex is ready for large returns as speculators estimate a possible rocket gain in this bull run while it drives adoption and expansion inside the TON Network. Pepe (PEPE) Rides The Waves Of Crypto Volatility Reflecting the inherent volatility of the crypto market, the PEPE price has had significant fluctuations over the past week. First ranging between $0.000021 and $0.000018, the PEPE coin experienced a bearish breakout that brought its value down to the $0.000015 level. Meanwhile, the PEPE price declined by more than 19% over the past week. The PEPE price chart showed an intriguing resiliency pattern despite the first decline. Following the first bearish movement, the meme coin swiftly surged back above the $0.000016 level and started to show optimistic momentum. This recovery, though, was fleeting since the PEPE coin soon dropped into the $0.000015 support zone. The past month has been equally bearish as the meme coin dropped by over 21%. Meanwhile, the community feels quite positive about PEPE despite price swings. Maintaining a positive view, speculators think that the ATH of $0.000028 might be retested this year. Other technical indicators provide a different picture even while moving averages produce buy signals on the PEPE price chart , implying possible upward momentum. XRP (XRP) Witnesses Significant Fluctuations The XPR price dropped more than 7% throughout a week of considerable volatility. The XPR price chart shows a consolidation pattern between $3.40 and $2.90 marked by a lot of zigzag movement that leaves holders unsure about the near-term direction of the altcoin . With the XPR coin achieving an amazing price growth of over 34%, the monthly performance offers a more hopeful picture despite weekly swings . Though it is 19% below its all-time high of $3.84, the community’s attitude regarding XPR stays rather positive. Prospects for a retest of the ATH within the current year excite market players, so XPR is among the promising altcoins to watch . The good momentum is shown in several important technical indicators—including the MACD, Momentum Oscillator, and Moving Averages—which are now indicating buy signals on the XRP price chart . However, the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) still shows sell signals. Particularly for top altcoins like XPR, this mixed technical picture emphasizes a period of market uncertainty. While the struggle between bears and bulls continues, XRP holders remain optimistic about a bullish breakout. ELX, PEPE, And XRP: The Trio Set To Dominate 2025 ELX, PEPE, and XRP are promising altcoins to keep an eye on as the crypto sector charges into a positive 2025. While XRP’s contradictory technical signals point to the altcoin possibly being ready for a breakout, PEPE’s resilience amid volatility suggests a possible recovery to its all-time high. Meanwhile, Elluminex is a promising project that not only improves DeFi on the TON Network but also challenges giants like Ethereum and Bitcoin. The window of opportunity is closing rapidly as speculators estimate a startling meteoric rally this year while the ELX token presale price is at an extraordinarily cheap $0.06.

Will the Bitcoin price reach the pivotal support below $99,000? Here’s what the market participants are looking for at the moment, as the entire crypto market has been painted red. Most of the cryptos have recorded massive losses, including XRP, ADA, PEPE, LINK, SUI, and many more. Some altcoins like AIOZ Network, Jupiter, Bittensor, etc. are holding strength. Meanwhile, the star crypto has again reached the threshold and an extended negative approach may slash the BTC price below the crucial resistance at $99,000 soon. On the other hand, the constitutions are constantly accumulating Bitcoin as the spot ETF volume has seen a significant rise. Bitcoin ETFs gained $1B in inflows after Trump’s inauguration as the new President, bringing it to $4.2B inflows so far in 2025. Besides, Michael Saylor wants to buy more Bitcoin after Microstratergy accumulated nearly 14,600 BTC since the start of 2025. Regardless of this, the BTC price struggled hard to revamp a strong ascending trend and mark a new ATH. The BTC price has begun the weekly trade on a bearish note, which could have made the market participants pessimistic. As a result, the markets expect to possess high volatility this week and here’s why so. The crypto markets are expected to undergo a roller coaster ride this week with FOMC, GDP, PCE, unemployment, and more on the horizon. These events are expected to induce some confidence among traders and also test Bitcoin’s resilience or rally. Therefore, it would be pivotal whether these events will catalyse a surge or retreat. Meanwhile, the current bearish action is expected to prevail for some time to as low as $70,000 to $75,000, as predicted by Arthur Hayes , co-founder of Bitmex. However, the founder further states that this could be just a correction as the BTC price is pre-programmed to surge and mark a new ATH at $250K by the end of the year. Hence, the ongoing correction could be a temporary phase that could further trigger a strong crypto bull run, pushing the global market capitalisation beyond $4 trillion soon.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|ALTCOIN|MARKET|AIOZ,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-27 05:35:54

Crypto investors, like their traditional finance counterparts, are likely digesting the impact that DeepSeek, a new AI model, on the industry. Data from DeepSeek posted on Hugging Face , a forum of the AI industry, shows that its model outperforms OpenAI, all while being built on a budget of $6 million and a fraction of the Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) that OpenAI uses – which recently closed a $6.6 billion round with a valuation of over $157 billion. Perhaps most concerning to the perpetual GPU bulls is that DeepSeek is so efficient that a version of it can be run on your phone. Naturally, some of the worst-performing AI tokens are ones with the most exposure to GPUs. Small-cap Nodes.AI, which facilitates access to GPUs, is down nearly 20%, according to CoinGecko data , although Aethir, which does the same (albeit at a much higher market cap) is only down 6% , just slightly more than the CoinDesk 20 benchmark. Lessons from crypto gaming While DeepSeek will make for a stressful week at OpenAI, Nvidia, and other tech giants that have pivoted to AI, it's also a more pressing lesson for crypto projects – one that might be familiar to those with crypto's foray into gaming years ago. Despite the pools of capital available to crypto AI projects, they just haven't been able to make something as revolutionary or interesting as what DeepSeek did. Data from CoinGecko pegs the value of the crypto gaming sector (GameFi) at $19 billion. If the largest entries on this list, like Sandbox, GALA, or Decentraland, were entries on the top-30 largest gaming companies by marketcap they would hold respectable positions alongside household names responsible for recognizable franchises. But despite these projects just haven't had the same success as their traditional counterparts. Last year, blockchain gaming received lowest investment since 2020, according to data source DappRadar. Just $1.8 billion were invested in blockchain gaming and metaverse projects, representing a 38% slide from 2023. And while the daily unique active wallets in blockchain gaming surged 421% last year, the sector's dominance within the industry fluctuated between 26-29%, with DeFi taking the lead. Still, the tally is lower than games on Steam. Besides, some older and less popular games on Steam, from companies with market caps a fraction of GameFi giants, have a larger following. Over the years, many crypto games have struggled to build a sustainable user base. So, for now, one might say that crypto faces challenges in catering to use cases beyond finance.",Markets|Gaming|Blockchain|AI,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|ASIA|BUSINESS|GALA,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-27 05:37:41

So What is the Reason for the Decline?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-btc-and-altcoins-started-the-critical-new-week-with-a-decline-so-what-is-the-reason-for-the-decline/,"Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins started the critical week with a decline. BTC experienced a significant decline ahead of the Fed's interest rate decision to be announced this week. Bitcoin (BTC) price fell to $100,000 levels today, while Ethereum (ETH), XRP, olana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) fell between 5% and 10%. This decline also left investors in leveraged transactions in a bind, with $576 million in liquidations in the last 24 hours, according to Coinglass data. Of this, $532 million consisted of long positions and $43.9 million consisted of short positions. While 212,139 investors liquidated in the last 24 hours, the largest liquidation occurred in the BTC/USDT trading pair on HTX. Only Four Altcoins Are On The Rise! While BTC and altcoins in general have declined in the last 24 hours, only four altcoins have seen positive returns. Accordingly, Jupiter (JUP) increased by 7%; AIOZ Network (AIOZ) by 6%; Movement (MOVE) by 4.9% and Bittensor (TAO) by 3.5%. What is the reason for the decline? While the reason behind this sudden decline is being wondered, experts said that Bitcoin experienced a decline due to profit sales by investors despite the support given by US President Donald Trump. “While the market got 90% of what it wanted with Donald Trump’s executive orders, it was already priced in. Anything short of a Bitcoin reserve that immediately started buying BTC was going to be disappointing. At that point, investors who bought the expectations took profits after expectations and the price fell,” Sean McNulty, head of derivatives at FalconX APAC, told Bloomberg. Experts also state that the uncertainty regarding the FED interest rate decision to be announced this week has also negatively affected the market and triggered the decline in Bitcoin. *This is not investment advice.

Analysts Split As Active Users Hit All-Time Highs,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/will-aptos-crash-or-soar-analysts-split-as-active-users-hit-all-time-highs/,"Aptos, the blockchain platform making waves with its cutting-edge programming language, is riding a rollercoaster of growth and growing pains. While its ecosystem is exploding with new users and activity, its native token, APT, can’t seem to catch a break. Let’s unpack what’s driving the hype—and why investors are biting their nails. Related Reading: Trump Daughter Ivanka Slams Fake Crypto Coin Exploiting Her Name Ecosystem Boom Meets Market Blues Aptos isn’t just growing—it’s skyrocketing. In less than a year, active addresses on the network ballooned from under 100,000 to over 1.4 million. Transactions are up 30% this month alone, fueled by developers jumping ship from chains like Solana to build on Move, Aptos’s sleek, scalable programming language. But here’s the twist: despite the frenzy, APT’s price recently nosedived to under $7.00, dragged down by a crypto-wide sell-off. At the time of writing, APT was trading at $7.34, down 11.9% and 12.7% in the daily and weekly timeframes. Talk about a disconnect. The Technical Tightrope Charts aren’t painting a pretty picture for APT. Analysts, like Ali Martinez, are eyeing an ominous head-and-shoulders pattern—a classic bearish signal—that could send the token tumbling toward 4.30. To flip the script, APT needs to claw its way above $10.50, and stay there. Some analysts, though, still see a glimmer of hope: if Aptos smashes through key resistance levels, we might see a rebound by summer. #Aptos $APT appears to be forming a head-and-shoulders pattern, with a potential downside target of $4.30. A sustained close above $10.50 is needed to invalidate the bearish outlook. pic.twitter.com/4rHCGcOxyy — Ali (@ali_charts) January 25, 2025 2025: Make-Or-Break Innovations Aptos isn’t sitting still. It has recently rolled out Move 2, a turbocharged upgrade to its programming language designed to woo even more developers. Then there’s Raptr, a new consensus mechanism in the works that promises to tackle blockchain’s eternal scalability headaches. If these launches stick the landing, Aptos could leapfrog rivals in DeFi and beyond. But “if” is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. Should You Bet On Aptos? Here’s the deal: Aptos has the tech and the traction to be a long-term player. Its eco-friendly edge and developer-friendly tools are legit advantages. But tread carefully. Bearish charts, volatile markets, and looming token unlocks could shake things up overnight. Savvy investors might see this dip as a buying opportunity—others might call it a red flag. Either way, do your homework. Crypto’s never a sure thing, but Aptos? It’s one to watch.

With a jaw-dropping 50,000% growth potential, this token has already raised $1 million in minutes during its presale. With Bitcoin (BTC) crossing $100,000 and XRP’s recent 500% surge might seem impressive, but none can rival the explosive potential and exclusivity driving THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN forward. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Outshines XRP and Others 1. Massive Growth Potential: XRP’s 500% returns pale in comparison to the staggering 50,000% potential of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Early investors are already seeing the impact of this token’s high demand and limited availability, making it the standout choice for transformative returns. 2. Exclusive Sale Creates High Demand: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM. This strategic exclusivity has heightened interest and secured its place as one of the most sought-after tokens. 3. Strong Community Support: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN thrives on a loyal and engaged community, driving organic growth and market demand. This strong backing amplifies its visibility and positions it as a top choice for long-term success. How It Stacks Up Against Other Cryptos Ethereum (ETH): A DeFi leader, but its growth has plateaued compared to early-stage tokens like THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Solana (SOL): Strong in scalability, but SOL can’t match the exclusivity and skyrocketing demand of this new token. Optimism (OP): A Layer-2 solution with promise, but its gains are modest compared to THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s potential. Injective Protocol (INJ): A promising DeFi player, but it hasn’t generated the same overwhelming excitement. The Crypto Everyone’s Talking About THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already set new standards in the market.

The altcoins have bled out even more heavily, with massive price declines from the likes of DOGE, XRP, ADA, SOL, and many others. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Similar to the previous Monday, this one has started quite painfully for the crypto market. As reported over the weekend, bitcoin had calmed at around $105,000 with little to no movements over a 36-hour period. However, the Monday morning Asian trading session began with a nosedive that pushed the largest digital asset from its aforementioned level to a weekly low (for now) of $99,700. This 5% daily drop has harmed the cryptocurrency’s market cap, which has plunged below the coveted $2 trillion mark. The altcoins have felt even more substantial pain within the same period. ETH, which challenged $3,400 a few days ago, has dropped by 7% in a day to $3,100. XRP has slumped below $3 for the first time in a few weeks, BNB is down to $650, ADA has plunged to $0.9, and LINK is at $23. More substantial declines come from the likes of SOL, DOGE, SUI, PEPE, HBAR, SHIB, LTC, APT, AAVE, and others, as all of them are with double-digit losses. CoinGlass’ data paints a violent picture of the aforementioned volatility. The total value of wrecked positions has shot up to well above $600 million on a daily scale and $560 million within the past 12 hours alone.

Markets reacted positively following Donald Trump’s inauguration last week, with a new all-time high for Bitcoin on Jan. 20, but things appear to be unraveling at the moment.

This report provides early insight into changes in GDP, and economists project that the pace of growth slowed to 2.7% from 3.1% in the third quarter. A higher-than-expected reading could further weigh on the expectations for Fed rate cuts, while a lower-than-expected reading could provide the central bank with data to support rate reductions.

Unpacking the Legal Challenges,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-did-brazil-ban-worldcoins-iris-scan-payments-unpacking-the-legal-challenges/,"The post Why Did Brazil Ban Worldcoin’s Iris Scan Payments? Unpacking the Legal Challenges appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News OpenAi CEO Sam Altman’s Tool for Humanity met another tough hurdle. This time, it was Brazil, which blocked Altman’s effort to create a global identity system. Brazil’s data protection authority ANPD, expressed suspicion about the way the organisation processes data, and demanded more transparency in that area. What does the organisation have to say about Brazil’s move? Would they be able to overcome this? Brazil Bans Iris Scan Payments The Brazilian government banned the operation of Tools of Humanity in the country. ANPD had launched an investigation into the organisation in November, 2024. The ban came as the culmination of this investigation process. Why Brazil Took This Step? Primarily, the government rejected the idea of paying financial compensation to people in exchange for their biometric data, highlighting its potential to interfere with their free expression of will. Additionally, expressing concerns about the way the organisation processes data, the government called for greater transparency in the data processing framework. Response from Tools for Humanity Denouncing all the allegations levelled against Tools for Humanity, the organisation asserted their commitment to the Brazilian legal framework. They lashed out at people spreading fake information about the project on social media platforms. Expressing their genuine interest in providing their service to Brazilaians, they revealed their plan to approach the Brazilian data protection agency as an effort to convince them of the significance of their project. Sam Altman’s Tools for Humanity aims to create a global identity system by scanning irises in exchange for crypto rewards and digital IDs. Brazil is not the first country that has placed a hurdle before the project. Earlier, Spain and Portugal rejected it, highlighting similar reasons. Worldcoin Price Plunge The market cap of Worldcoin stands at $1,807,681,861, and its 24-hour trading volume remains at $260,968,573. In the last 30 days, the market has dropped by at least 12.4%. In the last 24 hours alone, it has slipped by at least 9.7%. Currently, its price is at $1.89. In conclusion, Brazil’s decision to ban Tools for Humanity underscores the growing tension between innovation and data protection. With allegations of transparency issues, the organisation now faces a challenge to rebuild trust with regulators and users. As the global debate on biometric data collection continues, all eyes remain on Tools for Humanity’s next steps in Brazil.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,WLD|REGULATION|TRADING|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-27 06:15:45

According to the latest market data, the memecoin’s valuation slipped by 10 percent in the past 24 hours to hover about $99.8 billion at the time of this writing. With the rising fear of crypto sell-off in the near term, amid the rising calls of a Western stock market crash due to the innovative AI breakthrough in China via DeepSeek, the memecoin industry faces further downward pressure. Furthermore, with heavy crypto liquidations involving over $625 million in the past 24 hours, with the majority being long traders, the odds of a long squeeze have dramatically increased.

According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, SHIB’s price is currently retesting a crucial support range between 0.0000185 to $0.000021. In case of short-term aggregated crypto selling pressure, SHIB price will likely drop 10 percent towards the support level of about $0.000016. Furthermore, the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped below the 50 percent level, suggesting the short-term bears are in control. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto is Down Today & May Remain Highly Voltile This Week: Here’s What to Expect With Bitcoin & Altcoins , Bigger Picture Through the Shibarium layer 2 scaling solution, the Shiba Inu project has gradually shifted to a utility-based memecoin.

In a series of tweets, Kiyosaki explained his bullish stance on Bitcoin ( BTC ) through two key laws. First, he referenced Gresham’s Law, which states that “bad money” in a system causes “good money” to go into hiding. He noted that gold, silver and Bitcoin are forcing the fake U.S. dollar into hiding. TWO LAWS THAT GIVE BITCOIN POWER 1: GRESHAMS LAW: When BAD money enters a system GOOD money goes into hiding. Good money gold and silver have been hiding from FAKE US dollars for years. Today, Gold, silver, and Bitcoin are forcing the fake US dollar into hiding. 2:… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) January 25, 2025 The financial author also emphasized Metcalfe’s Law, which describes the power of networks. Drawing parallels to successful business models like McDonald’s and his own Rich Dad company, Kiyosaki suggested Bitcoin’s network effect would contribute to its growing influence in the global financial system. On January 4, Kiyosaki warned of an impending “giant market crash” while maintaining his positive outlook on Bitcoin, gold, and silver. He criticized the Federal Reserve, Treasury, banks, and Wall Street for relying on money printing, arguing this practice enriches asset holders while harming those who save in dollars due to inflation and taxes. You might also like: Jupiter DEX changes, Musk’s blockchain plans, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin buys | Weekly Recap Kiyosaki has taken an increasingly vocal stance on Bitcoin’s accessibility, stating that unlike traditional wealth-building methods that required sophisticated knowledge, Bitcoin makes “getting rich easy” through simple accumulation and holding strategies. He suggested that purchasing even small amounts of Bitcoin and holding it long-term could lead to wealth creation. His comments come amid broader discussions about monetary policy and inflation concerns. Kiyosaki advised his followers to protect themselves against inflation by saving in what he considers “real assets” – gold, silver, and Bitcoin – rather than holding dollars. The financial educator’s statements align with growing institutional interest in Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation .

Traders expect no indications of a rate cut at the two-day FOMC meeting scheduled for Jan. 28 to Jan. 29, which has typically impacted bitcoin prices as investors either prefer or move away from risk assets. “U.S. economic data shows that there may be less need for a federal interest rate cut in the near term,” Ben El-Baz, managing director of HashKey Global, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Concerns over trade wars and tariffs linger, but a bullish sentiment remains strong as MicroStrategy and Trump's World Liberty Financial continue purchasing crypto.” BTC dropped nearly 6% from a Sunday high of over $105,000, with a steep drop coming as Asian markets opened Monday. This came despite a major catalyst on Friday, when U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the creating of a crypto policy group to advise and drive the country's industry within six months. Crypto market capitalization fell 8%, while the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) fell more than 8.14%. The drop tracked a fall in U.S. stock indices — whose movements bitcoin tends to mirror — with futures of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 down as much as 2.15% on Monday ahead of the market open. Much of the concern draws from a possible overvaluation in U.S. tech companies as DeepSeek’s latest AI model is significantly cheaper to produce and was built using open-source technology that is easy to access. As CoinDesk reported Monday, data from DeepSeek posted on Hugging Face, a forum of the AI industry, shows that its model outperforms OpenAI, all while being built on a budget of $6 million and a fraction of the Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) that OpenAI uses – which recently closed a $6.6 billion round with a valuation of over $157 billion. OpenAI has previously asked for trillions of dollars in funding to build AI systems at scale and is part of the new U.S. project Stargate, which has attracted $500 billion in investments and includes Trump SoftBank and Oracle, to build AI data centers in the country. However, DeepSeek’s reported costs and features threaten the established narrative of needing vast computational resources for AI innovation, potentially reducing the competitive edge of U.S. tech firms and questioning the sustainability of their high valuations — impacting broader market sentiment and bitcoin in the near term. As such, traders loaded on $95,000 strike options for bitcoin to protect against the downside ahead of the week, indicating that expectations of a move lower remain prevalent in the market. “The desk observed growing interest in the Jan $95,000 strikes as the market scrambled for downside protection after BTC lost momentum during yesterday's U.S. session,” traders at Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Saturday broadcast. “With no major catalysts before next week’s FOMC meeting, the market is likely to remain range-bound until there is more clarity on how the recent weak CPI reading has influenced the Fed’s upcoming policy decisions,” QCP added at the time.",Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-27 07:05:35

The meme coin was created on the Pump.fun, Solana’s meme coin launching platform, and was named after Barron, the President’s youngest son.

As BTC struggles to break past the $106K resistance, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes expects it to first crash to $70,000 before resuming the upward trend. Today’s crypto market selloff has pushed the altcoins even lower as Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), etc. have corrected between 5-10%. With the euphoria around the Trump inauguration waning, all eyes will be on the FOMC meeting ahead this week wherein the US Federal Reserve will announce its interest rate decision. Will Bitcoin Price Crash to $70,000 As Arthur Hayes Believes? Arthur Hayes predicts a “mini financial crisis” where he expects the Bitcoin price to crash to $70,000 before resuming a mega bull run to $250,000 once again. He believes that just as this happens, the US Federal Reserve will switch back to money printing once again. In his recent post on X, Arthur Hayes wrote : “I am calling for a $70k to $75k correction in $BTC, a mini financial crisis, and a resumption of money printing that will send us to $250k by the end of the year”. As of press time, the Bitcoin price is trading 3.8% down testing its crucial support of $101,000, which it needs to defend to prevent any further correction ahead. Furthermore, the on-chain data shows that long-term holders have been selling their BTC holdings over the past week. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that the total Bitcoin supply held by long-term holders has decreased by over 75,000 BTC over the past week. This shows strong profit-taking by long-term investors as the Bitcoin price struggles to hit fresh highs and break past $106K resistance. Source: Glassnode However, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju believes that the Bitcoin bull run is not over. He wrote: “We’re in the late stage of the Bitcoin bull market, but I believe there’s still room for growth. I’d say we’re in the early distribution phase, as new retail investors are entering. Trump’s global promotional impact could extend this bull run for another couple of quarters”. Crypto Market Selloff Leads to $548 Million in Liquidations In the early Asian market trading hours on Monday, Bitcoin and altcoins faced strong selling pressure triggering more than $548 million in crypto market liquidations as per the Coinglass data. Of these, the long liquidations have surged to $503 million, where BTC alone is contributing to $190 million. Crypto Market Prepares for First FOMC Meeting After Donald Trump Took Charge The broader cryptocurrency market is bracing for the first FOMC meeting ever since Donald Trump took charge at the White House last week. While the Trump inauguration and crypto executive orders caused major euphoria, the macro indicators will likely decide the next leg of the market journey from here. Notably, Trump has said that he would be asking the US Fed to lower the interest rate in order to drive economic activity further. This week marks a critical period for global markets, with several major central banks set to make significant announcements: Federal Reserve (FOMC) : The Federal Reserve will release its interest rate decision, with expectations pointing toward no changes to the current rate. European Central Bank (ECB) : The ECB is also set to announce its interest rate decision, drawing significant attention from the markets. U.S. Economic Data : Key reports, including the fourth-quarter real GDP figures and the December core PCE, will provide crucial insights into the state of the U.S. economy. China’s DeepSeek AI Storms Market The growing popularity of China’s DeepSeek AI platform has generated a major storm in Silicon Valley, as the Nasdaq futures collapsed more than 3% overnight on Sunday. Several AI chip manufacturing companies Arm (ARM), Nvidia (NDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and Qualcomm (QCOM) are down 2-6%. This is another major reason behind today’s Bitcoin price correction, as well as the broader crypto market selloff. Altcoins Market Correction Turns Severe The top altcoins are also facing deeper correction with Ethereum price down 5.72% as of press time, slipping to $3,166, and wiping off all the weekly gains. On the other hand, the XRP price has also lost its crucial support of $3 today and a daily closing under this level will open the gates for further correction ahead. Meanwhile, Solana price is down by a massive 10.27%, while Dogecoin (DOGE) has crashed by 8.25%. This leaves investors confused as to whether or not the altseason will begin in Q1 2025.

In 2024, Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) showed the world how even the quirkiest of tokens could change lives, delivering incredible returns for those who had the foresight to invest early. For many, missing out on PNUT was a lesson in hesitation. But don’t worry—2025 is offering a new opportunity to ride the wave of crypto success. Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD), a rising star in the meme coin universe. Short for “Buy The Dip,” this coin is more than just a clever slogan; it’s a movement built around community, innovation, and growth. With over $5.7 million raised in its presale and more than 67 billion coins sold , BTFD is shaping up to be the Top New Meme Coin to Invest in This Week.

Players can join the Bulls Squad, complete challenges, and earn rewards in BTFD tokens. With immersive gameplay, strategic power-ups, and real-world earning potential, the game bridges entertainment with financial empowerment.

With over $5.7 million raised, more than 67 billion coins sold, and 9,600 holders already on board, BTFD is positioning itself as the Top New Meme Coin to Invest in This Week. Peanut the Squirrel: A Quirky Token That Changed Lives Before BTFD Coin, Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) stole the spotlight as one of the most unexpected success stories in the crypto world. Launched in early 2024, PNUT charmed investors with its lighthearted approach and innovative ecosystem, proving that even niche meme coins could deliver astronomical returns. What made PNUT special was its ability to blend humor with utility. The token wasn’t just about its playful mascot—it was backed by a decentralized ecosystem that included NFT collaborations, gaming, and community-driven initiatives. These features captured the imagination of crypto enthusiasts, driving demand and sending PNUT’s value soaring. Early adopters of PNUT were rewarded handsomely. The token’s initial presale was modest, but once it gained traction, its value skyrocketed, delivering life-changing returns. Investors who got in early saw their portfolios grow exponentially, solidifying PNUT’s status as a trailblazer in the meme coin space. By 2025, PNUT has evolved into a stable and respected token in the crypto market. Its continued innovation, including partnerships with NFT creators and gaming platforms, ensures its relevance in an ever-changing landscape. However, for many, the story of PNUT is bittersweet—it’s a reminder of what can happen when you hesitate to act. Peanut the Squirrel taught us that timing is everything in crypto. Those who took the leap early reaped the rewards, while latecomers could only watch from the sidelines. If you missed your chance with PNUT, BTFD Coin offers a fresh opportunity to capitalize on a project with similar potential for massive growth. Conclusion: Don’t Let History Repeat Itself—Act Now With BTFD Coin The crypto world is full of missed opportunities, but it also offers second chances. Peanut the Squirrel’s meteoric rise in 2024 showed us the transformative power of early action.

Shiba Inu is among the poorest performers, having dumped by 11% within the past 24 hours to a multi-month low. What’s even more worrying is that SHIB is currently below a crucial support line. SHIBUSD. Source: TradingView The second-largest meme coin rode the post-election bull cycle in an impressive manner, going from around $0.000016 to a multi-month high of well over $0,000033. Thus, it doubled its valuation within a month, as its peak came on December 8. However, it failed to maintain its momentum, even though assets like BTC, XRP, ADA, XLM, and DOGE kept climbing and started to lose value gradually. In fact, its 2025 peak, which came on January 18, was at $0.000025 – 25% lower than the high reached in late 2024. The following week was also turbulent and adverse for SHIB, perhaps due to the TRUMP token mania, as its price slumped further to $0.0002. At one point, it even lost its spot as the second-biggest in its field to the meme coin launched by the US president. Despite the recent bullish predictions , the past 24 hours brought even more pain for SHIB. Alongside the rest of the market , the self-proclaimed Dogecoin killer dumped by 11% to its lowest levels since early November of under $0.000018. This decline could carry even more significance as it drove SHIB below a ‘critical’ support line. According to popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez, that crucial level for SHIB’s price momentum stands between $0.0000185 and $0.0000212. The asset has slumped below both now, and it will be key to see whether it will close the day in such an unfavorable spot, which could trigger even more pain for the SHIB bulls.

Since then, the asset has surged in value, with prices more than tripling from about $20 per coin to more than $70, with at least $24 billion in trading volume and a market cap of more than $14 billion as of Sunday morning. This move and more than a few executive orders show that the United States is enroute to become the “crypto capital of the planet.” And the rise of Bitcoin beyond $100k further attest to this fact… While Bitcoin price is now more appealing than ever, trading BTC can be risky. Therefore, mining offers a better alternative, and with cloud mining, even this has now become affordable. Why is Cloud Mining Suitable in the Current Crypto Climate? As Bitcoin is rising, and if stats by CryptoQuant are to be believed, the $200K target is near. So, while there is no “buying the dip” opportunity in sight, cloud mining provides a relatively safer way to earn crypto. There is no uncertainty around whether miners will earn Bitcoin; they will earn. Cloud mining is more affordable, and it provides daily passive income, with no active trade requirements.

Top artificial intelligence coins like Near Protocol (NEAR), Internet Computer (ICP), Render (RENDER), and Filecoin (FIL) have collapsed 8-10% today as the Nasdaq 100 futures see a 330 points crash in the overnight trading session on Sunday. AI Coins Crash As Investors Panic The AI coins market has tanked by more than 7.66% in the last 24 hours with the total market cap falling under $44 billion, as per data from CoinMarketCap. The data further shows that top AI coins have collapsed an average of between 8-10%. Notably, this correction comes as part of the broader crypto market crash as the Bitcoin price drops all the way to the crucial support of $100K levels. The major reason behind this is the sharp surge in the popularity of China’s DeepSeek AI startup which has stormed the market due to its low-cost infrastructure. Furthermore, it is built using chips that cost just a fraction of what the US AI companies have spent. As a result, the Nasdaq 100 Futures have collapsed over 2% to more than 470 points. However, experts from the decentralized finance artificial intelligence (DeFAI) market believe that the current correction in AI coins presents a buy-the-dip opportunity. Popular market analyst Daniele explained how DeepSeek’s dominance will rather help the AI Coin industry expand further. He wrote: “If you’re selling AI coins due to DeepSeek models being cheap and open source, they are actually very helpful to scale AI Apps to Millions of users with low-entry barrier pricing. Is the best thing that could have happened to the industry”. China’s DeepSeek AI Model Storms Market The Chinese AI startup has taken the Silicon Valley tech behemoths to task. Training advanced AI models like GPT-4 or Claude typically demands massive budgets, with companies like OpenAI and Anthropic spending over $100 million on computing alone. These efforts rely on massive data centers filled with thousands of GPUs, each costing upwards of $40,000—akin to needing a dedicated power plant to fuel a factory. On the other hand, the Chinese AI startup has turned heads by achieving comparable or superior performance to GPT-4 and Claude for a fraction of the cost i.e. just $6 million. Furthermore, it’s built using AI chips that are far less advanced than what US AI companies have been using. Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes has questioned the US AI dominance noting: “A thot: what if the rise of Deepseek causes global investors to question US exceptionalism. What if they question y they are over weight US tech vs the world and why they are over weight US bonds vs the world?” As the DeepSeek app takes the top spot in downloads on the Apple Store, chip stocks in the US have given an overnight reaction. Top companies like Qualcomm (QCOM), Nvidia (NVDA), Arm (ARM), and Broadcom (AVGO) are down by 2-7% today, further intensifying the AI coins dip. Chip Stocks Overnight Reaction to DeepSeek: 1. Arm, $ARM : -5.5% 2. Nvidia, $NVDA : -5.3% 3. Broadcom, $AVGO : -4.9% 4. Super Micro, $SMCI : -4.6% 5. Taiwan Semi, $TSM : -4.5% 6. Micron, $MU : -4.3% 7. Qualcomm, $QCOM : -2.8% 8. AMD, $AMD : -2.5% 9. Intel, $INTC : -2.0% US markets are… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) January 27, 2025 Challenging OpenAI’s Market Dominance The AI Coins dip comes as the Chinese AI startup is making lightning-fast inroads into the global AI market and is already the 1st ranking free app on the Apple App Store. Users have praised the DeepSeek API for its user-friendly experience and seamless performance, noting that rate limits pose no significant hurdles. This has sparked discussions about its potential integration into agentic AI systems. Previously, tech giant Nvidia hailed Agentic AI as the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence, representing a key frontier for innovation in the field. Thus, it would not be an understatement to say that the Chinese player would be directly eating into the market share of $10 billion worth OpenAI. Notably, the discussions further soared as OpenAI’s ChatGPT faced a strong outage last week. DeepSeek has emerged as a leading performer in the AIME, MATH-500, and GPQA benchmarks, as shown in recent results. While ChatGPT maintains its edge in coding benchmarks, the performance gap between the two is rapidly shrinking. The swift development of DeepSeek highlights the growing challenge to U.S. AI dominance, signaling a shift in the global AI landscape. As a result, the AI coins market will also face some turbulence moving ahead as the broader crypto market adjusts to these developments.

This move aims to enhance accessibility, foster innovation, and empower developers across multiple ecosystems. The expansion, confirmed on January 25, represents Virtuals' first step beyond Base. By leveraging Solana’s advanced scalability and vibrant developer community , Virtuals seeks to unlock new opportunities for growth and strengthen its vision of an interconnected, autonomous digital society. Virtuals highlighted Solana’s speed and scalability as key factors in its decision, emphasizing that this blockchain provides an ideal environment for growth. EtherMage, the platform’s pseudonymous lead developer, described the expansion as a critical step in building a diverse and robust multichain ecosystem. Dedicated teams are already collaborating with Solana and other blockchain communities to offer funding, mentorship, and increased visibility for projects within the Virtuals ecosystem. The protocol has unveiled several initiatives tailored specifically to Solana. One of these is the Meteora Pool, a feature aimed at creating new trading opportunities and increasing engagement. Additionally, 1% of trading fees will be converted to SOL and allocated to the Strategic SOL Reserve (SSR) to reward contributors and support Solana's ecosystem. A grant program has also been introduced to foster development on both the Base and Solana chains. This initiative provides projects with access to 42,000 $VIRTUAL tokens to support early-stage growth, encouraging developers to innovate within the ecosystem. Looking ahead, Virtuals has announced plans to host an AI Hackathon in partnership with the Solana Foundation in March. This event will include technical mentorship and resources for developers, further reinforcing Virtuals’ commitment to driving innovation. The platform has gained recognition as a leading player in the crypto space, driven by the increasing demand for AI-powered solutions. With this multichain expansion, Virtuals aims to shape the future of decentralized AI while supporting a thriving developer community. The team emphasized that this is not just an expansion but the start of a new chapter, focusing on creating value, empowering builders, and growing the Virtuals Nation. Despite the promising developments, the value of Virtuals’ native token, $VIRTUAL, has faced short-term fluctuations. The platform remains optimistic, however, about the long-term impact of its strategic initiatives and its mission to revolutionize decentralized AI solutions.",,EN,0,0,SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|FIAT|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-27 07:42:29

Ver has appealed to former President Donald Trump, calling him his “last hope” to stop the extradition, claiming the charges are politically motivated and stem from his advocacy for Bitcoin rather than tax evasion. In a video shared on January 26, Ver urged Trump for intervention, stating, “Only you, with your commitment to justice, can save me.” He is accused of evading $48 million in taxes by hiding $240 million from a 2017 Bitcoin sale. Ver denies wrongdoing, asserting that the charges are retaliation for his cryptocurrency activism, which challenges traditional financial systems. He renounced his US citizenship years ago, citing fears of government targeting due to his political beliefs. Elon Musk initially expressed interest in supporting a pardon for Ver but recently reversed his position. When asked on X about the possibility of clemency, Musk replied, “Roger Ver gave up his US citizenship. No pardon for Ver. Membership has its privileges.” This response highlighted the significance of Ver’s decision to renounce his citizenship and its impact on his chances of receiving support. Ver explained that his decision to relinquish US citizenship was driven by a need to avoid political persecution. He argued that his activism made him a target, referencing a previous unjust imprisonment. Despite this, the odds of Trump granting clemency to Ver within the first 100 days of a hypothetical presidency have fallen to just 12% on Polymarket, a prediction platform. Supporters on X have defended Ver, emphasizing that he renounced his citizenship out of self-preservation. One user wrote, “It’s unfair to hold this against him now when he was just trying to protect himself from further persecution.” Ver’s legal troubles have drawn comparisons to Ross Ulbricht, the Silk Road founder who received clemency during Trump’s presidency. Ver was arrested in February while attending a cryptocurrency conference in Barcelona. In December, he asked a US court to dismiss the charges against him, maintaining that the case is rooted in politics rather than legitimate legal grounds.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-27 07:45:20

Despite the lackluster performance in 2024, ETH price has remained a laggard. But the recent accumulation of $175 million worth of ETH tokens from Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial has caused investors to speculate about a comeback. As noted by MAXPAIN analyst , Ethereum whales are on an accumulation spree and scooped 300K ETH worth $1.08 billion. ETH Whales Accumulate 300K ETH Worth $1 billion in 2 Weeks Moreover, the spike in network activity suggests that new capital is flowing into the Ethereum ecosystem, suggesting a potential bounce. ETH Network Growth Hints New Capital Inflow All in all, the outlook for ETH, an underdog, has been growing bullish. Ethereum price prediction notes that it will likely trigger a volatile breakout soon. Ethereum Price Analysis Forecasts $4,000 Target Ethereum’s falling wedge setup is in the final stages, a make-or-break moment. A bounce off the $3,057 to $3,132 support level will maintain this bullish technical formation. A decisive daily candlestick close above the wedge’s upper trend line around $3,360 will confirm a breakout. In such a case, the falling wedge forecasts ETH price could rally 17% and target $4,000. Three key resistance levels that could interfere with this uptrend are $3,297 and $3,477 and $3,592. These hurdles are previous weekly VWAP, anchored VWAP since November 17, 2024 and previous monthly VWAP, respectively. ETH/USDT 1-day chart VWAP is Volume Weighted Average Price, which means that demand/supply dynamics at these levels will play a pivotal role in determining the directional bias of ETH. Hence, investors need to pay close attention to these levels. On the other hand, a breakdown of the $3,000 psychological level will confirm a breakdown and invalidate the bullish thesis. Such a development could trigger a 13% crash to $2,657.

Among the leading pack are Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL), leading with various technologies and blooming ecosystems. Cardano focuses majorly on being green and secure, while Solana boasts of its speed and scalability. However, a new player, DTX Exchange , is gaining attention with its groundbreaking approach and impressive growth trajectory. With tokens priced at an accessible $0.16, DTX Exchange presents an intriguing opportunity, raising questions about its potential to rival these established giants. Cardano (ADA) Struggles to Deliver Despite Vision Cardano came into existence as a cutting-edge blockchain project implemented to ensure high security, scalability, and sustainability. It, however, has problems of its own, particularly in attracting audiences and price movements. Once reaching a high of $3.10 in around September 2021, ADA has had a bad time maintaining its prices and often falls short of the expectations of investors. ADA is currently trading at modest levels around $0.98 compared to its peak. This has come after a brief run of price increase that saw the coin at $1.14. It has since been correcting, dropping further by 7% in the past few days. Source: CoinMarketCap The project continues to emphasize ecosystem development, with partnerships and upgrades aiming to drive adoption. However, its ability to retain investor interest is being tested in a competitive market, leaving for rising projects like the versatile DTX Exchange to compete. Solana (SOL) Continues to Champion Speed and Scalability Given the high transaction speeds with low fees, Solana has been able to position itself as a very performing blockchain. In fact, this has made it a favorite for DeFi projects, since the Solana ecosystem comprises about 120 projects, from wallet solutions and exchanges to digital gaming. Solana has been on an upward trajectory and reached a high of about $293 just a week ago. However, volatility has set in, and the token has shed several places to trade at around $259 currently. Source: CoinMarketCap With scalability and innovation in focus, Solana continues to be one of the strongest players in the blockchain market. Several factors drive optimism; for one, the possible greenlighting of the listing of Solana-based ETFs and the growing developer traction. So, while there might have been slight corrections in price, Solana remains a top act to follow for an up-and-coming project like DTX Exchange. DTX Exchange (DTX): The Disruptor in the Making DTX Exchange is emerging as a formidable alternative in the crypto innovation market. Leveraging hybrid Vulcan X blockchain technology, DTX Exchange offers a multi-asset trading platform that combines cryptocurrencies, stocks, and forex into one ecosystem. This versatility sets it apart from traditional blockchain projects. One of the prime features of DTX Exchange is its extensive range of trading instruments, boasting more than 120,000 different assets available for trading to meet the varying needs of traders. It also offers up to 1,000x leverage options, attracting both novice and seasoned traders. DTX Exchange operates differently, focusing on utility and trader-centric features like the Phoenix Wallet which is a seamless multi-asset management tool. It also focuses on enhancing security and transparency, with a SolidProof audit that confirms its high-security standards for protecting user assets. DTX’s presale success has been remarkable, with tokens priced at $0.16 and expected to rise to $0.20 upon listing. With over $12.9 million raised and a community exceeding 500,000 members, DTX Exchange is proving its potential as a disruptive force in the crypto landscape. Conclusion The rise of DTX Exchange demonstrates that there is room for new entrants to thrive by addressing gaps in the market. With its innovative features, impressive presale performance, and strong community backing, DTX Exchange is a project to watch closely. In a competitive landscape, DTX may well carve out its place alongside giants like Cardano and Solana.

TradingView: XRP/USDT Reportedly, the XRP coin price has continued to trade within the triangle pattern since December 2024. Moreover, with the recent price drop, the Ripple price broke its important support of $3. However, the support trendline of the triangle pattern acts as a support, indicating a potential bullish reversal. XRP Technical Sentiments The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) records a constant rise in the red histogram with its averages experiencing a bearish convergence. This suggests an increase in the selling-over-buying pressure for the altcoin in the market. On the other hand, the SMA indicator constantly acts as a resistance to the XRP price chart. Moreover, with a strong negative curve in the daily time frame, the price of XRP indicates a bearish outlook this week. Will XRP Price Ever Recover?

The attack targeted a significant holder on the Sui network, underscoring the growing risks in the blockchain sector as new platforms rise in popularity. The attackers stole 6.27 million SUI tokens, valued at $29 million, and moved the funds from Sui to Ethereum using bridging tools. To further hide their trail, they laundered the stolen tokens in smaller portions through Tornado Cash. Following the breach, the affected user acted swiftly by transferring their .sui domain holdings to a secure wallet to prevent additional losses. However, tracking the stolen funds has proven challenging due to limitations in Sui’s analytics tools and block explorers . ZachXBT explained, “The victim transferred their .sui domains to a new uncompromised address shortly after the theft. Current limitations with Sui block explorers and Sui analytics tools make the theft difficult to trace.” This exploit is one of several recent incidents highlighting vulnerabilities in the blockchain industry. For instance, Singapore-based exchange Phemex recently reported unusual activity in its hot wallets, resulting in estimated losses of over $37 million in assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and TRON. These events reflect the ongoing security challenges faced by both well-established and emerging blockchain ecosystems. The Sui blockchain, a Layer-1 network launched in 2023, has grown rapidly thanks to its adoption of the Move programming language and its support for parallel transaction processing. With over 50 million registered accounts and a market capitalization of $12 billion, Sui has become the 16th largest cryptocurrency. However, this rise in popularity has also made it an attractive target for cybercriminals. Despite these challenges, Sui remains committed to strengthening its ecosystem and expanding its use cases. Co-founder Adeniyi Abiodun has outlined ambitious plans for 2025, including a focus on artificial intelligence, gaming, and fintech. The network aims to build on its existing achievements, such as sub-second transaction speeds and innovations in decentralized finance and gaming, to introduce more practical applications. “2025 we’re going way beyond ‘faster finality.’ We’re designing a future where Sui becomes the backbone for finance , gaming, AI-driven agents, and everyday apps,” Adeniyi said. While incidents like the $29 million theft highlight the risks, they also serve as a call to action for improved security and analytics tools across blockchain platforms as the industry continues to evolve.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|SUI|ETH|BTC|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-27 07:48:40

However, Remittix stands out due to its innovative PayFi system and significant potential. Rising as a pathfinder in a $250 trillion sector, Remittix is expected to rank first among cryptocurrency assets in the cross-border payment space. Read on to learn more about the RTX token and why it is one of the top altcoins to buy now. XRP Price Prediction: XRP to Soar Following Trump’s SEC Chair Appointment The choice of Mark Uyeda by President Donald Trump to serve as the new interim U.S. SEC head has generated a great buzz in the Ripple community. Experts believe this shift sets the price of XRP for a significant surge. Beginning the year at $2, XRP’s price rose in the first week of January 2025 to $3. This rise suggests the token’s possible future expansion and demonstrates its increasing attraction in the field of decentralized finance. Bullish technical indicators and the prospect of good regulatory changes under Trump’s incoming SEC leadership inspire this hope. Many in the crypto world speculate the U.S. SEC would revoke its continuous appeal against Ripple, particularly with the resignation of previous chairman Gary Gensler. They expect a change in the SEC’s cryptocurrency regulation as Trump names Republican Commissioner Uyeda at a period when Ripple’s SEC case remains unresolved. This might have a good impact on XRP, which is firmly rooted in legal conflicts. Armando Pantoja among other analysts predicted XRP’s price to surge to somewhere between $8 and $30. With the SEC under fresh direction, Ripple has a bright future. While XRP’s expansion is still attracting interest, other new projects like Remittix are positioned to become the next XRP. Remittix Lives Up to Its Nickname as The Next XRP With 200x Gains in Sight Remittix (RTX) is redefining global payments by integrating blockchain technology with fiat transactions, offering fast and cost-efficient cross-border solutions. With support for over 40 cryptocurrencies, including Cardano, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Ethereum, the platform provides instant conversions into fiat currencies like USD and GBP, enabling seamless deposits into recipients’ bank accounts. As a bridge between crypto and fiat, Remittix is the superior counterpart to traditional payment providers such as Stripe and Wise and crypto-exclusive platforms like Coinbase Wallet. Supporting 30+ fiat currencies and over 50 crypto pairs, Remittix ensures accessibility and inclusivity for businesses and individuals, simplifying global commerce with its extensive range of options. Furthermore notable is the platform’s open flat-fee approach, which offers savings and transparency over exorbitant costs and inadequate exchange rates of conventional banks. This approach guarantees that the full amount sent reaches the recipient, making Remittix a game-changer in the payments industry, where shady practices are unfortunately all too common. Currently priced at $0.0383 during its presale, the RTX token offers a compelling investment opportunity. Forecasts predict significant growth, with a 25x multiplier expected in the presale phase and over 5,000% gains after launch, as demand for innovative cross-border payment solutions continues to rise. Beyond their common emphasis on cross-border payments, XRP and Remittix’s ability to upend established financial institutions and provide actual answers calls for comparison. While Remittix is going one step further with its inclusive approach and excellent technology, XRP has shown the value of blockchain in worldwide banking. Remittix offers investors a chance to interact with a project with the potential same as XRP but at an earlier stage as the bitcoin market develops. RTX might not only equal XRP’s success but also alter the benchmarks for blockchain-based financial solutions with increasing acceptance, a solid basis, and evident market demand.

While that’s a big move on its own, the squeezing Bollinger Bands suggest that XRP could face another one soon. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView XRP Dumps 15% It’s safe to say that Ripple’s native token became one of the best performers throughout the entire crypto market following the US elections. The recent speculations that it will be included in the potential US digital asset reserve also benefited the asset, which went from under $0.6 in early November to $3.4 in January. This cycle’s peak coincided with the all-time high from 2018, but XRP failed to breach it. It started to lose traction in the next few weeks and retraced to $3.15 during the weekend. However, this is where the situation worsened for the entire crypto market. Bitcoin’s price tumbled below $100,000 for the first time in a week, and XRP was not spared. The third-largest crypto asset plunged from $3.15 to a multi-week low of $2.66 (on Bitstamp) before it recovered some ground to $2.8 as of now. Thus, its intraday low came after a 15% drop. While this sounds like a significant move, Ali Martinez warned that the Bollinger Bands are squeezing on XRP’s daily chart, which could lead to another “significant price move.” The Bollinger Bands are squeezing on the $XRP daily chart, signaling that a significant price move could be on the horizon. pic.twitter.com/Sv7miRidTb — Ali (@ali_charts) January 27, 2025 What’s Next? Weighing in on XRP’s upcoming potential moves, macro trader Jason Pizzino noted that the next support lines are at $2.3-$2.5. The asset could avoid a price drop to those levels if its daily close is above “the previous swing top at $2.9,” which is not the case right now. $XRP failing at the 50% extension. Lower volume into the $3.40 top and closes under $3.16 suggest buyers didn’t have enough conviction on the next move higher. The hope for the bulls is closing above the previous swing top at $2.90. Support under here is approx $2.30-$2.50. pic.twitter.com/I7L78vthNV — Jason Pizzino (@jasonpizzino) January 27, 2025 Nevertheless, most analysts remain bullish on XRP’s long-term potential. Rob Art said XRP broke out of a 7-year-long triangle recently and will soon resume its rally, but only after it shakes out all the emotional buyers and sellers. After that, it will “turbo-send” XRP higher. Crypto Bitlord shared a similar opinion, indicating that XRP will “experience a vertical style black swan.” I’m convinced that $XRP will experience a vertical style black swan. The price will go straight upwards with no warning. It will go so high nobody could have ever predicted it. All shorts will cease to exist from that day.

Solana’s SOL and dogecoin (DOGE) dropped more than 10% to lead losses among majors, while ether (ETH), BNB Chain’s bnb, xrp (XRP) and Cardano’s ADA fell as much as 9%. Overall market cap fell 8.5% as of Asian afternoon hours Monday. Tokens outside of the top twenty and across different sectors showed similar woes, with memecoin pepe (PEPE), layer 1 upstart Aptos (APT), Gate.io’s GATE and AI Agent creation platform Virtuals (VIRTUALS) losing as much as 18%. Jupiter’s JUP was the only token in green with a 3.5% gain over the past 24 hours on the back of a decision to buy back tokens from the open market from the fees generated on its trading platform — which may equate to hundreds of millions in net buying volumes in a year. Bitcoin slumped under $99,000 early Monday as traders took profits ahead of the first U.S. FOMC meeting this year. It tracked losses in U.S. stock futures, which fell as traders digested information about the cost and capabilities of China-based DeepSeek, threatening an otherwise costly narrative spearheaded by OpenAI. Futures markets reflected these losses, with traders of BTC-tracked products losing $238 million in the past 24 hours, majorly in early European and Asian afternoon hours. SOL and DOGE bets lost a cumulative $50 million, altcoin-tracked products lost $138 million and ether-tracked futures lost $84 million. The largest single liquidation order happened on HTX, a tether-margined BTC trade valued at $98.4 million. Liquidation happens when a trader has insufficient funds to keep a leveraged trade open. The crypto market's high volatility means liquidations are a common occurrence, although major events such as Monday’s can provide actionable cues for further market sentiment or positioning. The liquidation can signal an overstretched market, indicating that a price correction has occurred, while price-chart areas with high liquidation volumes can act as support or resistance levels where price might reverse due to the absence of further selling pressure from liquidated positions. However, if the market continues declining, those with short positions might see this as validation, potentially increasing their bets.

The symbolic token burn was initiated by burning a large metal cat statue, reinforcing the platform’s goal of reducing emissions, increasing certainty, and lowering fully diluted valuation (FDV). Alongside the burn, Meow announced that 50% of all protocol fee revenues will now be used to buy back JUP tokens, which will be held in a “long-term bin” reserve. The remaining 50% of fees will be allocated for “growth, future strategy, and operational stability.” “I firmly believe that the value of a token is not dependent on buybacks,” Meow said, contradicting the common narrative in crypto investing. “The value of a token is dependent on the community… every coin is a memecoin.” This announcement triggered an immediate market reaction, sending the price of JUP from $0.90 to $1.27 before pulling back slightly. Jupiter Expands AI and Memecoin Investments Beyond the buyback plan, Jupiter announced a number of significant ecosystem developments, including: Acquiring a majority stake in Moonshot, a memecoin launchpad that rivals Pump.fun. Introducing Jupnet, an omnichain network currently in beta testing. The release of Jupiter V2, an upgrade to the platform's DEX aggregation services.

XYZVerse is now making waves with an astonishing potential of up to 25,000% returns. This could be the opportunity to get in early on a new project. The article explores what sets XYZVerse apart and why it might be the next significant player in cryptocurrency. XYZ: The meme coin heavyweight As the first-ever all-sports meme coin, XYZ has pushed through the bear market with unrelenting momentum. With 75x growth potential on the horizon, it’s gearing up to outshine 2024’s meme coin sensations like BOME and WIF.

From entertainment dApps to engaging GameFi innovations, it’s poised to draw millions of sports enthusiasts ready to cash in on the action. Remember Polymarket’s $1 billion surge during the US election? XYZ is positioning itself for an even bigger win, combining meme coin hype, sports fanaticism, and crypto mass adoption to dominate the GameFi arena. Forget the days of BOME’s 5,000% rocket or WIF’s 1,000% rally, those gains are yesterday’s news. XYZ is targeting a 7,400% surge by its Token Generation Event (TGE), setting the stage to dethrone its predecessors.

In the past week, its price decreased by 4.81%, settling within a range of $0.30 to $0.43. Over the past month, however, DOGE’s price increased by 6.39%. Looking at a broader timeline, the cryptocurrency has surged by an impressive 173.41% over the last six months. Based on the data, there’s potential for DOGE’s price to rise. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $0.35 and $0.36 respectively, indicating stability. The Relative Strength Index is at 56.98, suggesting the market isn’t overbought or oversold. A high Stochastic value of 90.95 points to possible upward momentum. The MACD level is slightly positive at 0.0003768, which could signal further increases. If DOGE surpasses the nearest resistance level at $0.49, it might aim for the second resistance at $0.62. This would represent a rise of over 44% from current prices. On the downside, if the price falls, it may test the support level at $0.24, a decrease of about 20%. The second support level at $0.12 is further down, indicating a potential drop of more than 60%. These levels are key indicators of where the price could move in the near future. Conclusion While tokens like DOGE have succeeded, XYZVerse’s unique sports-meme blend aims for explosive growth, presenting a distinctive opportunity in the current bull run.

With the number of tokens created weekly now exceeding 1 million, the platform is exploring new strategies to manage the surge. On January 26, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced the need to reconsider the platform’s current system, stating that manually evaluating each token is no longer feasible . He also emphasized that regulators face similar challenges in managing the sheer volume of new tokens. “We need to rethink our listing process at Coinbase given there are ~1m tokens a week being created now, and growing. High-quality problem to have, but evaluating each one by one is no longer feasible,” Armstrong explained. He proposed moving from the current “allow-list” system to a “block-list” approach. This shift would use automated on-chain data scans and community feedback to identify and exclude risky tokens while streamlining the listing process. Armstrong believes this model will enable regulators to focus on harmful assets without being overwhelmed. In addition to revising its token evaluation strategy, Coinbase plans to strengthen its integration with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) . The goal is to simplify trading for users, making it seamless regardless of whether transactions occur on centralized exchanges (CEXs) or DEXs . “We’ll continue integrating native DEX support more deeply. Customers shouldn’t need to know or care whether the trade is happening on a DEX or CEX,” Armstrong said. The explosion of token creation has underscored the urgency of these changes. According to Conor Grogan, a Coinbase executive, there are now over 36 million tokens in the crypto market, with projections suggesting that number could reach 100 million by 2025. For context, the 2017-2018 altcoin boom featured fewer than 3,000 tokens. Platforms like Solana-based Pump.fun and Tron-based SunPump have significantly contributed to this growth by democratizing the token creation process. Pump.fun alone has enabled the launch of over 6 million tokens since its introduction last year, according to Dune Analytics. Meme coins have also played a substantial role in the surge, highlighting the evolving nature of the crypto ecosystem. As the industry continues to expand, Coinbase’s revamped approach aims to balance innovation with security while adapting to the unprecedented growth of new cryptocurrencies.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ALTCOIN|MARKET|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-27 07:55:28

However, Ozak AI continues to impress investors and is currently determined as the top AI-driven crypto in 2025. Its ability to utilise AI and Blockchain to provide real-world solutions to organisations like finance proves its ability to surpass other AI-Tokens in 2025. $FLUX Price Bounces Off The Trendline $FLUX is trading above the trendline of the asymmetric triangle with its price bouncing above the support line. However, despite the trendline showing a possible soar, the $FLUX price has been declining in the past few days with a 4.76% decline in the last 24 hours. However, a break above the trendline resistance of $0.80 will potentially skyrocket the price to break the previous resistance and soar back to $1. Although this will provide massive gains to investors, the token price is at a break-it or make-it moment. This means a break above the trendline or below the trendline might happen. Currently, $FLUX is trading at $0.4872 with the overall sentiment showing bullish momentum, however, with the bullish expectation in the market, $Flux is determined to surge above the $1 mark.

The firm points to ossification and inertia as major obstacles to the network's progress, warning that slow updates could push users and developers toward rival platforms. Currently, Ethereum undergoes one major update per year, a pace Paradigm sees as limiting its ability to innovate and adapt. In a detailed post, co-founder Matt Huang, along with CTO Georgios Konstantopoulos and general partners Dan Robinson and Charlie Noyes, stressed the need for more frequent upgrades. They argue that speeding up updates would allow Ethereum to respond effectively to market shifts and technological advancements, all while preserving its core values. Paradigm identified ossification, the intentional slowdown of protocol changes to maintain decentralization, as a key risk. While aimed at protecting Ethereum’s governance, this approach, they believe, could hinder competitiveness. Slow updates may prevent Ethereum from meeting user demands and adapting to emerging trends. Furthermore, ossification could drive users to centralized platforms , posing additional risks. Despite these challenges, Paradigm is optimistic about Ethereum’s potential. They believe the network can achieve faster progress through focused, non-controversial improvements. Examples include scaling Layer-2 solutions, optimizing Layer-1 to avoid overburdening nodes, and improving wallet usability through account abstraction. The firm also emphasized the importance of empowering Ethereum's skilled researchers and developers to work on solutions in parallel. “By enabling them to move faster, Ethereum can address problems more effectively and avoid getting caught in unnecessary debates,” they stated. This call for action comes at a pivotal time for Ethereum, which faces increasing competition from platforms like Solana. Internal challenges, such as leadership changes at the Ethereum Foundation and strategic criticisms, have sparked concerns about its ability to maintain dominance . Recent high-profile departures, like that of Eric Conner, have further fueled discussions about the network’s direction. Conner cited a loss of passion due to leadership struggles, adding to the community's unease. Paradigm’s message underscores the need for Ethereum to balance its principles with innovation. They argue that adapting at a faster pace is essential for Ethereum to retain its leading position in the rapidly evolving blockchain space. This balance between tradition and progress is crucial for Ethereum's future.",,EN,0,0,ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|RESEARCH|SOL,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-27 07:58:20

Dogecoin Chart Hints At Major Gains Ahead,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/ready-to-rocket-dogecoin-chart-major-gains-ahead/,"Crypto analyst Ali Martinez (@ali_charts) has spotlighted a potential trend reversal for Dogecoin, revealing that the popular memecoin has flashed a bullish technical signal on its daily chart. According to Martinez, the TD Sequential indicator has presented a “buy signal,” suggesting a price rebound could be on the horizon. Dogecoin Prints TD9 Buy Signal The shared chart—spanning daily candlesticks of the DOGE/USDT pair—illustrates 10 days of downward price action. Dogecoin has retreated from previous highs near $0.4843 to trade at approximately $0.32, shedding around -35% over the past few days. The most recent candle on the chart is a long black (bearish) bar, reflecting notable selling pressure that pushed prices towards $0.3200. “The TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the Dogecoin daily chart, anticipating a price rebound!” Martinez posted via X. At the core of Martinez’s observation is the TD Sequential, a widely respected technical tool among seasoned traders. Developed by market technician Tom DeMark, the TD Sequential aims to identify price exhaustion points and potential reversals in ongoing trends. It works by counting a series of consecutive candles in one direction. Related Reading: Dogecoin Appears Poised For Explosive 10,000% Gain – Analyst The indicator typically monitors up to nine consecutive bearish or bullish candles. When a count of nine is reached during a persistent downtrend, it often flags a possible bullish turning point—referred to as a “TD9 Buy Signal.” Conversely, nine consecutive higher closes in an uptrend can signal a potential bearish reversal. In more extended setups, the indicator can continue counting to 13, offering further confirmation, but the “9” signal itself often draws the most immediate attention from traders. On this Dogecoin chart, the TD9 number has just appeared, signifying that the daily downtrend might be reaching a point of buyer interest. Following a “9” candle, the sequence restarts at “1,” which can hint at the beginning of a new bullish setup, should the upcoming candles confirm the reversal. Price Levels to Watch The most crucial support zone lies at $0.313, the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level on the daily chart. Maintaining a daily close above this level could reinforce bullish momentum if buyers respond to the TD9 signal. Any attempt at a rebound will likely confront initial resistance around $0.3400, where the downtrend line is located. A decisive break above this (black) line may validate the anticipated trend reversal. Related Reading: Dogecoin ETFs Will Skyrocket Price To $15, Forecasts Analyst While further out of reach, regaining ground in the $0.4000 region (0.5 Fibonacci level at $0.395) would be a stronger sign that Dogecoin has recovered from its downward spiral. Overall, Dogecoin is at a crucial spot. The TD Sequential’s “buy” setup does not guarantee instant upside, but it does historically serve as a reliable early warning of trend fatigue. If bullish traders capitalize on this signal, Dogecoin could stage a price recovery toward mid-range resistances. In contrast, failure to hold the $0.3100 area might prolong the current downward cycle.

In a new strategy session, crypto trader Rekt Capital tells his 532,600 followers on the social media platform X that the crypto king’s swings to the downside often test the conviction of holders. According to the analyst, Bitcoin has been using failed breakdowns this cycle to lure traders into giving up their coins before kicking off the next leg up. “This remains to be true. Downside deviations below the range lows occur to trick investors into a fake breakdown (orange circles) before resuming into an uptrend.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Rekt Capital goes on to say that the dips are all “reaccumulation” zones that eventually shoot to the upside given enough time. The trader also notes that if the top crypto asset by market cap finds a weekly close above a key level, it could rip to a new all-time high. “BTC needs a weekly close above $104,416 (red) to set itself up for a breakout to new highs. Weekly closes above the final major weekly resistance at this moment in the cycle have historically preceded strong upside.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Last week, Rekt Capital predicted that Bitcoin would break out following its correction. The trader also warned that a huge dip is in store for the flagship digital asset after the conclusion of its next big rally. Bitcoin is trading for $99,019, down over 5% on the day.

However, a new player, 1Fuel (OFT) , is redefining expectations with its revolutionary one-click cross-chain technology. Offering unparalleled transaction efficiency, privacy features, and real-world usability, 1Fuel is quickly gaining traction. Analysts believe the token can deliver a 100x return in 2025. Read further to find out why! 1Fuel: Revolutionizing Crypto Wallets And Driving Adoption Crypto wallets have seen little innovation over the years, often requiring multiple apps, approvals, and a compromise on privacy. Enter 1Fuel (OFT), a groundbreaking wallet set to disrupt the industry. Users can forget about the pain of moving from chain to chain. The protocol has introduced the one-click cross-chain transaction feature that lets users simply send a transaction and forget about it. Enhanced with a built-in privacy mixer and disposable wallets, 1Fuel ensures complete anonymity for all transactions. Looking ahead, 1Fuel plans to introduce physical and virtual cards, enabling users to spend crypto as easily as fiat. This removes the need for on-ramping and off-ramping, accelerating mainstream adoption by making crypto spending effortless. Institutional investors are also taking note of 1Fuel’s independently verified smart contracts, adding a layer of trust uncommon in newer projects. With staking rewards of up to 30% APR and over 1,200 token holders already on board, 1Fuel is building serious momentum. VeChain Traders Eye $1 In 2025 VeChain is trading at $0.0549, confirming a new bull phase after breaking above a consolidation zone. Recent gains pushed VeChain above the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement, with resistance at $0.0659 and $0.0725 as the next targets. The bullish momentum, supported by rising RSI, suggests the corrective phase is ending, aligning with the start of a new impulsive wave. Short-term pullbacks to $0.0549 or $0.0523 could offer reentry points. If momentum holds, VeChain may retest its all-time high of $0.0804. However, a drop below $0.0496 would invalidate this bullish outlook, signaling a deeper retracement. Tron Reaches New Highs Tron is trading at $0.225, up 1.75% in 24 hours and 6.80% for the week, showing signs of recovery after a bearish start to the year. Despite a wallet exploit comprising over 14,500 wallets and $31.5 million, Tron’s ecosystem has seen growth through SunSwap, which drove $4.1 billion in WTRX transactions, and increased activity from the SunPump token generator. Security improvements, like a 24% drop in illicit transactions, highlight efforts to rebuild confidence. Tron remains far from it’s $0.43 all-time high, and its path to $1 hinges on overcoming security flaws and sustaining ecosystem momentum. The Bottom Line As Tron and VeChain continue to showcase their scalability strengths, 1Fuel (OFT) emerges as a revolutionary contender with its one-click cross-chain transactions and unmatched privacy features. Its ability to streamline blockchain interactions while promoting real-world usability through upcoming debit and credit cards sets it apart in the crypto space. With over $1.5 million raised in its presale and predictions of massive growth, 1Fuel offers a rare investment opportunity. Don’t miss the chance to join this innovative project before it takes off.

Roughly 6 million tokens were removed from the dog-themed meme coin’s circulating supply in the past 24 hours. However, with SHIB price tanking 5% intraday amid a broader market slump, the future outlook remains uncertain at the moment. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Upswings 800% As 6M Coins Destroyed As per the latest data offered by Shibburn on X , the Shiba Inu burn rate witnessed an 856% uptick intraday. Notably, the removal of 6.27 million tokens from the circulating supply has ignited the abovementioned surge. For context, the SHIB token burn mechanism permanently cuts the coin’s circulating supply, thereby sending tokens to a null address. In turn, traders anticipate gains in light of the law of supply and demand. Meme Crypto Market Wanes Ahead Of FOMC However, the current broader market slump has pushed the meme coin to defy such usual market sentiments. Notably, the meme crypto market witnessed an alarmingly waning movement in line with the broader cryptocurrency prices on Monday . This bearish momentum comes ahead of the January 29 FOMC, with market participants reflecting a cautious approach to risk assets. Further, the crypto market also recorded massive liquidations, adding heat to prices. Altogether, these factors have brought volatility to the intraday price movement despite the recent surge in the Shiba Inu burn rate. What’s Next For SHIB Price? At the time of reporting, SHIB price witnessed a 10% dip in value and is currently trading at $0.00001796. Its intraday low and high were $0.00001795 and $0.00002006, respectively. Notably, renowned crypto market analyst Ali Martinez revealed that the $0.0000185 to $0.0000212 range stands as the most critical support zone for the token. Ali Martinez spotlights SHIB price support zone Investors remain apprehensive as the current price level is notably below this range despite the recent Shiba Inu burn rate surge. However, a recent Shiba Inu price analysis by CoinGape revealed that top holders accumulated nearly 30 trillion tokens, sparking optimism over future movements. Also, the meme coin’s marketing lead, LUCIE, has taken to X amid the market crash, stating that “The Shib Ecosystem is still building strong.” This statement has added optimism, hinting at looming advancements. As a result, market participants continue to monitor the token for further price action shifts, given the FOMC looms whilst the ecosystem gears up for developments.

A meme coin frenzy has ushered in explosive growth for both old and new memes. MAGA and TOSHI are two of the newest players in the spotlight. Their surge in price has triggered a market-wide search for the next token to flip 10x before entering the spotlight. CHONE appears on 2025 radar for coins to likely rake in massive gains in 2025. Meme Szn: MAGA and TOSHI Take the Spotlight Meme coins have been making investors rich since the 2021 DOGE outbreak. With a new US administration determined to make crypto the new gold, meme coin gains are only going to the moon from here. MAGA meme coin is a representation of the Make America Great Again slogan of the Trump administration. This reflects the Trump administration’s execution of this mandate. It has surged by over 286% in the last month leading to Trump’s inauguration and into his government, according to Coinmarketcap. Its market cap has grown by over 40% in the last 24 hours to $245 million and has an 84% bullish vote in its meme coin community. TOSHI has had a staggering 798% increase in the last month . It currently has a 98% 24-hour gain, putting it in the number one spot of the top 500 gainers in the last 24 hours. This meme coin is the face of Base & Brian Armstrong ‘s dog, the CEO of Coinbase. What Makes CHONE Stand Out? One key indicator for hidden gems that can yield very high returns is a low market cap. While this alone doesn’t mean much, when coupled with a very strong narrative and a new concept, then a winning hand begins to show. CHONE , which is the native token of Chill Drone , is a meme representative of a really relaxed-looking drone who doesn’t care about world domination but peace of mind. He is aiming for the moon, but not with the pressure and chaos every other person subjects themselves to. Seen as an outcast, he has become a hero and an inspiration to many who need a break from the chaotic hustle and bustle of trying to hit it big. He proposes a more relaxed and steady approach to crypto investments: creating a perfect community of humor, individuality, and creativity, all wrapped in profitability. This relatability and shareability of CHONE have attracted a growing amount of market interest, positioning it for a possible surge in price. The 10x Opportunity: Why CHONE Is A Must Watch CHONE is currently priced at $0.0008 on Solana. Its market cap is pegged at $849k, according to GeckoTerminal . This low price point and low market cap present a very good opportunity for investors looking for optimal entry to maximize their gains. Just like MAGA and TOSHI, part of CHONE’s strength lies in its community backing, which is on the rise. As CHONE’s narrative continues to gain virality alongside its meme, its potential for a 10x surge draws closer to reality.

Particularly with the Shiba Inu news of its notable burn spike, Shiba Inu (SHIB) have taken front stage. But Panshibi ($SHIBI) stands out with its distinctive design, which positions it as the viral meme coin to keep an eye on for 2025! Panshibi is the largest Asian-themed meme coin bringing huge gains for early investors. Read on to learn more about the token. Shiba Inu Faces New Competition Amid A Surge In Token Burns Shiba Inu is gaining traction as its short-term burn rate accelerates. With approximately 3.2 million SHIB tokens taken permanently from circulation, the rate just jumped by 614%. This sudden rise in Shiba Inu token burn points to hope and a means to raise the value of SHIB. Though the market is still bright, Shiba Inu’s price recently dropped from $0.0000248 to $0.0000199 in January. The increased Shiba Inu burn rate indicates that attempts are being taken to increase the coin’s desirability. Analysts project a probable rise to $0.0000441 before Q1 2025 finishes. This latest Shiba Inu news has SHIB on the list of meme coins to watch, but it continues to face fierce competition. This is where Panshibi ($SHIBI), the viral meme coin, comes in. Panshibi To Dominate 2025 With Huge Profit Potential Panshibi is the next major crypto coin; it is not your typical meme coin. Panshibi is leading with its special mix of social-fi and AI components as the meme coin industry gets hot. Designed to bring communities from Asia, pandas, and meme aficionados together, this meme coin provides genuine value and utility to its owners rather than only a nice token. From governance voting to stake-to-earning prospects providing up to 1,200% APYs, $SHIBI is differentiating itself from other meme coins. It even provides presale holders VIP access to the Bamboo Private Members Club, therefore conferring exclusivity. These features guarantee that Panshibi offers long-lasting advantages for its community rather than only buzz. With a team committed to long-term success, Panshibi locks liquidity for ten years and keeps complete openness during the presale. The meme coin is positioned for a big climb since an audited smart contract guarantees security and trust. Its capped $10 million presale and solid roadmap will help it to rank among the most popular meme coins for 2025.

According to Brazil’s data protection watchdog, Autoridade Nacional de Proteção de Dados, this practice could compromise the validity of consent, as the financial compensation offered—such as its native ecosystem token Worldcoin ( WLD )—may unduly influence individuals, particularly those in vulnerable circumstances. For context, World Network aims to create a universal digital identity and financial system by verifying individuals as unique human beings through iris scans conducted with its proprietary “Orb” technology. The project, co-founded in 2019 by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and developed by Tools for Humanity, has expanded with the goal of providing greater digital security and facilitating equitable access to resources in the age of artificial intelligence. However, the ANPD believes the project’s approach to obtaining consent through financial incentives is problematic and has banned Tools for Humanity from offering such compensation for biometric data collection in accordance with Brazil’s data protection laws. These laws require consent to be free, informed, unequivocal, and explicitly given for specific purposes, especially when dealing with sensitive personal data like biometrics.

Regulators have also raised concerns over how World Network handles user data, particularly the irreversible nature of biometric data collection. Even though the Sam Altman co-founded company has stressed its commitment to privacy and data security through measures like data minimization, user control over data, iris code deletion, and secure multi-party computation, that hasn’t shielded it from regulatory pressures across the globe. Particularly, Hong Kong regulators raised similar concerns last year, calling it out for contravening local privacy laws. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data called Worldcoin’s data collection practices “unnecessary and excessive,” noting that it lacked transparency. Regulators criticized the project for failing to provide privacy notices and consent forms in Chinese and for inadequately informing participants about their rights to access and correct their data. As a result, World Network was asked to cease all operations in Hong Kong by the end of May 2024. The project has faced similar restrictions in other regions, including Germany , Spain , and Kenya . Yet it has continued to expand its offerings with the launch of the World Chain mainnet along with upgrades for its World App and Orb devices.

On Jan. 25, Dean Norris’ crypto account was hacked to promote a meme coin created in his likeness, DEAN, taking advantage of the actor’s celebrity status as part of a pump and dump scheme. The hackers used a photoshopped picture of Norris holding a notepad showing “$DEAN” and the launch date, leading users to believe Norris had launched his own meme coin and was promoting it on his social media. When asked for more proof, the hackers prepared a video of Norris seemingly confirming the token’s launch on Jan. 25. “Hey it’s me Dean, and uh… January 25th, I’m declaring it’s real,” said the actor in a five second clip. One of the most believable hackings/scams I’ve seen on here. They had a follow up tweet ready with a photoshopped notepad to “validate” it, had a cameo purchased of Dean Norris saying “Hey it’s me, Dean, it’s January 25th, I’m declaring, it’s real” https://t.co/dz5RYbh2U0 pic.twitter.com/BGF1xvtCls — Tyler (@CowboysIn4) January 26, 2025 On Jan. 26th, the Breaking Bad actor came online to clarify that his X account was hacked to “sell crypto stuff.” After recovering his account, he posted a video clarifying that his account was hacked to promote a crypto scam. “This is Dean Norris actually, and that whole crazy crypto sh*t was a complete fake scam. I was hacked and I don’t know, I just got it back,” said Norris, thanking the platform for helping him restore access to the account.

The token’s trading volume stands at $263,000 while its liquidity is at $46,000. The Solana ( SOL )-based meme coin is currently trading hands at $0.0456. Traders are mass dumping the DEAN token, with only five buy orders in the past hour out of the dozens of sell orders pouring in. On the chart, the token’s value has been flat-lining for the past 12 hours. In a separate post, Dean Norris calls out people on Reddit who accused him of launching a crypto token and using it to “pump and dump” the tokens for a profit. “I clicked on a couple accounts accusing me of lying and looks like THEY were the people pumping it up!!” said Norris, adding that he does not own a Telegram account, and that he rarely uses his X account.

The U.S. has blacklisted Sophgo Technologies, the AI chip company founded by Bitmain co-founder Zhan Ketuan, over concerns its chips might end up in Huawei products, dodging sanctions. According to a Financial Times report , U.S. officials believe that Sophgo was “acting at the behest of Beijing” to boost China’s chipmaking capabilities. The report also mentions a tough time for Bitmain when Zhan shifted focus to AI chips, causing some internal struggles. The trouble started when Zhan shifted resources to AI chip development. His push to move beyond crypto hardware caused internal conflict, the report notes. “We are a company focused on high-performance processors. We started with cryptocurrency processors and now we’re entering artificial intelligence, it’s a new area of application but not a complete pivot.” Zhan told a gathering in Beijing in 2017.

Zhan’s path started back in 2013 when he teamed up with Wu Jihan, a crypto fan, to create Bitmain. The company quickly rose to dominate Bitcoin mining hardware, hitting $2.5 billion in revenue by 2017. Bitmain also owns BTC.com and Antpool, which have been among the largest Bitcoin mining pools. In June 2018, Wu announced that Bitmain was considering an IPO to allow early investors to cash out. The company went on to complete its $1 billion pre-IPO registration with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in August and filed for its IPO in September. However, in March 2019, Bitmain’s IPO application in Hong Kong expired, six months after being filed, with investors reportedly worried about the drop in Bitcoin’s value.

In the last 24 hours alone, the total market cap of the AI coins segment has dropped by around 11.5%. Almost all the top five AI coins have experienced this downward pressure. NEAR has slipped by 10.8%, ICP by 8.3%, Render by 12.6% and FET by 9.7%. DeepSeek uses fewer GPUs compared to OpenAI. Using fewer GPUs is vital as it makes AI models more cost-efficient. It also makes models more energy efficient. Importantly, it makes them highly accessible. Why DeepSeek Concerns GPU-Heavy AI Projects DeepSeek proves that you don’t need expensive GPU setups to create powerful AI models. Most prominent US AI projects, like OpenAI, are GPU-heavy models. If more models like DeepSeek emerge, the demand for GPU-heavy models will naturally decrease. The success of DeepSeek establishes that success depends on innovation and practicality, not just big budgets. GPU-Heavy Tokens Bear the Brunt In the last seven days, NodeAI has seen a fall of 37.2%; in the last 24 hours alone, the token has slipped by 22.9%. Similarly, Aethir has experienced a drop of 17.2% in the last seven days; the token has declined by over 8.8% in the last 24 hours alone. GamiFi: Declining Investments and User Base Struggle Analysts compare the decline of the AI sector with that of the GameFi sector. They believe that both the sectors face almost similar problems. Some highlight the inability of crypto games to match the performance of traditional games. Reports say that investment in the GameFi segment dropped to at least $1.8 billion in 2024. The GameFi sector has recorded a decline of 9.2% in the last 24 hours. During the period, almost all the top five GameFi tokens have experienced this downward pressure; IMX has plummeted by 12.1%, SAND by 11.4%, GALA by 15.1%, AXS by 11.1% and FLOKI by 13%. In conclusion, DeepSeek’s innovative approach challenges the dominance of GPU-heavy models in AI and raises questions about cost-efficiency and innovation. Similarly, the GameFi sector faces its struggles as investments and user engagement drop. These developments emphasise the importance of sustainable innovation for both AI and blockchain gaming sectors to thrive in the evolving tech landscape.",News|Altcoins|Artificial Intelligence|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,MARKET|ALTCOIN|AXS|BLOCKCHAIN|FET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-27 08:28:22

Russia’s central bank digital currency — also known as the digital ruble — will simplify life for entrepreneurs, especially those impacted by sanctions, according to Artem Kiryanov, deputy chairman of the State Duma’s economic policy committee. In an interview with Russia’s news agency, Kiryanov explained that the digital ruble offers a big advantage for entrepreneurs, particularly those engaged in foreign trade. “Using the digital ruble will primarily help entrepreneurs dealing with cross-border economic activities.

It will enhance financial discipline and prevent fraud or unauthorized fund transfers.” Artem Kiryanov Russia has been piloting its central bank digital currency since August 2023, and it’s expected to be available for widespread use by mid-2025. Central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina earlier confirmed that if the pilot projects are successful, the digital ruble will be rolled out in a “mass implementation” by July. However, she noted that the transition will likely take several years to complete. In a consultation paper from October 2020, the central bank reassured citizens that the proposed CBDC will complement, not replace, existing cash and non-cash rubles in circulation. In contrast, China, a key benchmark for Russia’s digitization efforts, has begun paying civil servants in Changshu state salaries using its own CBDC, the digital yuan, to encourage the adoption of the state-controlled currency.

Here is the Level to Watch Out For!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-bitcoin-forming-a-double-top-formation-here-is-the-level-to-watch-out-for/,"According to technical analysis, Bitcoin (BTC) may be forming a double top reversal pattern that could push prices as low as $75,000. Bitcoin Facing Potential 'Double Top' Reversal, Could Drop to $75K A double top formation occurs when an asset forms two consecutive peaks at a similar price level and these peaks are separated by a pullback. If the asset fails to break above the previous high and then breaks through the neckline support, it signals a possible trend reversal from bullish to bearish. Currently, Bitcoin has pulled back below $100,000 after failing to sustain gains above the December highs. This price action sees BTC forming a double top with the neckline support at $91,300. If Bitcoin closes below $91,300 on the daily chart, it will confirm a downtrend reversal and potentially set the stage for a drop to $75,000. This target is derived using the measured move method, which is the gap between the twin tops and the neckline subtracted from the neckline level. Traders are closely watching Bitcoin’s support levels to gauge whether the double top formation will confirm a breakdown. A successful hold above $91,300 could invalidate the formation, while a decisive break below it could signal more downside pressure. The market is at a critical point as Bitcoin has recently failed to hit new highs, and price movements in the coming days could determine whether BTC continues its bull run or sees a deeper correction. *This is not investment advice.

Two top players, Arbitrum (ARB) and Sui (SUI) have faced significant challenges this first quarter, evidenced by their steady price drop. In contrast, FXGuys ($FXG) is gradually taking over the market with its impressive presale, attracting increased attention among traders and analysts. The FX Guys presale has raised over $3.4 million shortly to challenge the records set by top performers like Arbitrum and Sui. Investors desiring the best altcoins for the next bull run are drawn to its unique features, such as its trade-to-earn model, traders’ funding Program, and excellent customer service. With a projected 200% growth upon launch, $FXG is set for market dominance in 2025. The article reveals how FXGuys’ presale is giving tough competition to Arbitrum and Sui while gaining widespread attention in the crypto market. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Arbitrum (ARB): Struggling with Significant Price Drop and Decreased Trading Volume Arbitrum is a crypto platform developed to make working with Ethereum faster and cheaper. Experts revealed that its native token, ARB, reached a peak of $2.40 while it finally hit the market. However, it was unable to maintain this feat as a recent record showcased a price drop up to 68%. This situation also affected the trading volume as it dropped $403 million. This raised questions about its future performance, with all analysis pointing towards further decline. As investors always seek the best crypto coins to buy now , many have shifted their attention to FX Guys, seeing it as a more promising option. Sui (SUI): Price Drop and Market Decline Raise Investor Concerns Within the past few days, the price of SUI declined by 3.5%, raising concern about its future. Experts attribute this dip to the volatile market, resulting in a drop in its volume up to $13.4 billion. Its ranking in the market also reduced to the 14th position, while technical indicators show no signs of recovering soon. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) for instance, shows a downward trend while being supported by the average directional index (ADX). Additionally, the latest EMA levels show signs that a death cross may emerge soon. As these challenges linger, SUI’s position faces additional challenges from emerging altcoins like FXGuys. FX Guys ($FXG): Dominating the Market with an Impressive Presale and custom Trading Platform While Arbitrum and Sui face challenges this month, FXGuys have been trending with their impressive presale. Its presale has raised over $3.4 million, having drawn the interest of experts and those learning how to trade cryptocurrency with a discount offer at $0.04. Over 98% of the tokens allocated for stage two have been sold, which signifies increased adoption among investors and traders. Stage one investors have already secured 33% profits while eyeing further gains. Analysts also predict a further price surge to $0.1 upon launch, which makes it suitable for those learning how to trade cryptocurrency. While this also led to an increase in investors’ confidence, it also increased $FXG’s chance of outperforming most leading altcoins. One major factor that contributed to this growth is the staking system, that guarantees users 20% of the broker’s trading volume. Due to the provision of extra income in the form of staking rewards sourced through trading spreads, trading fees, and the trader funding program, $FXG qualifies among the best crypto coins to buy now. While investors take advantage of this presale offerings and unique features, $FXG’s value will rise more, paving the way for market dominance. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Final Thoughts As Arbitrum and Sui struggle with price decline, FX Guys showcases a promising future with unique features like no trade tax, a trade-to-earn model, and staking rewards.

Amp’s purpose is to enhance the adaptability of cryptocurrencies for day-to-day payments by addressing the issues of potential fraud and slow-speed transactions of typical cryptocurrencies.

AMP price analysis gives a highly bearish prediction of market trends. AMP/USD value has decreased to a $0.00746 low in the last 24 hours. On the other hand, the cryptocurrency lost 7.02 percent of its value during the day. The overall market sentiment remains negative, whereas the bears secured victory today. Is AMP a good investment? AMP has been struggling with a bearish trend for the past few months. Despite this, its strong fundamentals suggest it could be a solid long-term investment. Crypto analysts suggests that the approaching weeks can steadily increase the cryptocurrency’s value. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the AMP above $0.015. Why is AMP up? AMP’s price has increased yesterday. Additionally, the coin has experienced a loss of 7.02% if observed over the last 24 hours. The price is trading at $0.00746 which is a bit on the higher end, moreover, the bulls remained on the lead in the past few days. Will AMP reach $0.010? AMP’s resistance level is at $0.008, yet a break above this level is possible if sufficient buying momentum builds. A break near or above $0.010 will require a more robust push but isn’t impossible, as the coin achieved this level on December 3, 2024. Will AMP reach $1? Amp has never spiked above the $0.12 level. Even this price mark was observed only once at the start of the token’s launch, and AMP has never seen this level again. It seems highly unlikely for AMP to achieve $1 soon. Will AMP reach $10? According to the price prediction, AMP will not achieve this level in the next 10 years until something unusual happens. Considering AMP’s current market cap of only $630.88 million, the scenario seems almost impossible. Does AMP have a good long-term Future? Amp is trading near its average price level if observed over the longest price period levels. It can be a good long-term investment, as its price is expected to double in 2025 and reach $0.0603 by 2031.

At present, the market is under a bull-bear battle, introducing crash-like conditions. Still, the Toshi meme coin is performing against the odds, with its price rising over 1000% in the last few days, and there are many bullish reasons behind this. Let’s discuss. 3 Reasons Behind Toshi Meme Coin Price Rally TOSHI has been a part of the market for only a few months but is in decent demand. It is the 128th biggest cryptocurrency based on its market capitalization and has presented decent gains, with the ATH being just a day ago. There are three main reasons behind that, including its connection with a popular crypto platform, the demand for popular meme coins, and community support. Let’s discuss this one by one. 1. Coinbase Connection & Listing Toshi meme coin gained its name from the Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s cat. As most meme-themed cryptocurrencies are based on popular internet memes or influential crypto industry people, Toshi followed the same trend. With this, it quickly gained the crypto community’s attention, but the Coinbase listing news pushed it to another level. Coinbase is one of the biggest crypto exchanges . It has officially listed the token, increasing its visibility and credibility in the market. This fueled investor sentiment, causing the Toshi price to reach an all-time high of $0.002273 just a day ago. 2. Meme Coin Frenzy Since last year, the meme coin frenzy has increased demand for this category. Investors began to invest heavily in meme-themed cryptocurrencies, and the crypto market has witnessed a rising interest in them. This interest has been fueled by US President Donald Trump’s launch of TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins. Since its launch in September 2024, the Toshi has surged more than 3800.92%. The price has increased over 1000% in the last two weeks alone, confirming the building momentum with Trump’s inauguration event on January 20, 2025. 3. Tokenomics and Community Support A token’s community plays a major role in its performance, and their sentiments can make or break the performance. The Toshi meme coin quickly grabbed the attention of the right audience and maintained significant momentum, especially as tokenomics led to its scarcity. More concisely, Toshi has a total supply of 420.69 billion. Of these, 408.7 billion are in circulation, less than many meme-themed cryptocurrencies, creating scarcity and demand. These three features have boosted the Toshi meme coin price to new highs, but the question is whether it can continue to move away from the Bitcoin market crash odds. Toshi Token Price Hits ATH, What’s Next? At the time of reporting, the Toshi token trades at $0.001357 with a market capitalization of $553.69M. It has moved significantly away from its peak. Just a day ago, the token surged and created an ATH of $0.002273 after more than a 1000% rally over two weeks, 300% over the week. However, the induced ATH volatility dropped the token, especially with current market crash-like conditions. Interestingly, the trading volume is $393.08M after a 66% surge, showing high investor interest, which could aid in its recovery. From a technical standpoint, the four-hour TOSHI/ USDT chart shows that the token is at a critical point. It is now near the demand zone, which could be a support that could deliver two outcomes. A bounce from the demand zone could introduce a bullish momentum, pushing the Toshi price to $0.00116. However, a further correction from the current level could cause a drop to $0.000516 before stabilizing and attempting a recovery. Bottom Line The Toshi meme coin has taken a 180-degree turn within a day, moving from bullish acceleration to downturns. This happened as the volatility hit the token past its ATH milestone, and the broader market sentiments also played a role. At present, it is near the demand zone, where an uptrend could result in the TOSHI price achieving $0.00116, but the consolidation could drop it to $0.000516.

The claim stems from an inquiry to Grok 2—X’s AI tool—claiming that Elon Musk tweeted about XRP but quickly deleted the post. According to Grok 2, the tweet was live for approximately 20 seconds before being removed, though its content remains undisclosed. This report has generated widespread debate across X (formerly Twitter), with various users questioning its legitimacy, especially given the lack of screenshots or documented evidence of the tweet. The original post by Digital Asset Investor included the question, “This true @elonmusk?” This true @elonmusk ? pic.twitter.com/0tVKAqN1DI — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) January 27, 2025 Mixed Reactions from the Crypto Community The lack of visual proof of the alleged tweet has led to skepticism among X users. Arthur Brando, a vocal critic, commented , “Even if it was posted for 1 second, he has tens of millions of people who see his tweets as ‘now’ and not a single screenshot? Yeah, not buying this crap.” On the other hand, another user, BeeMan23, defended the claim, asserting , “GROK doesn’t lie.” However, others, such as XRP Dude, questioned the reliability of Grok itself, pointing out that the AI system primarily compiles information based on user-generated content and speculation. Adding to the confusion, another user, Doofy XRP, who claimed he saw the tweet, said it mentioned “buying the XRP dip.” However, this assertion was not substantiated with any further evidence or corroboration. The Impact of Musk’s Alleged Post Elon Musk , the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and owner of X, is no stranger to influencing markets with his social media posts. His past tweets about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin have caused significant price swings, sparking excitement and controversy in the financial world. The purported mention of XRP by Musk has fueled discussions on its potential market implications. Although the lack of evidence has cast doubt on the claim, the speculation alone has garnered attention, reflecting the sensitivity of the crypto community to high-profile endorsements or commentary. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Concerns About AI-Generated Insights This incident has also brought Grok 2, X’s AI assistant, into the spotlight. While some users have defended Grok’s accuracy, others remain critical of its reliance on aggregated user content. This raises questions about how AI-generated responses are interpreted and used as sources of information in speculative scenarios. Without verifiable evidence of the alleged tweet, the claims remain speculative. However, the incident highlights the influence of both Elon Musk and emerging AI tools like Grok on public discourse, particularly within the cryptocurrency community. As discussions continue, it remains to be seen whether additional details will surface to substantiate the claim or whether it will fade as another unverified rumor.

President Trump demanded rate cuts and lower oil prices early this week, which could also affect inflation. The Financial Times reported that Trump’s demand for rate cuts was likely to be overlooked during this week’s FOMC meeting since slowing inflation and steady job growth sparked debate over the need for further rate cuts. HSBC U.S. economist Ryan Wang said the Fed was expected to refrain from sending signals for a rate cut, adding that it was a hawkish risk. According to FT, investors expected the Fed to hold rates at their current level of 4.25%-4.50% after three consecutive cuts since September last year. Investors’ attention will subsequently focus on any shift in outlook as per the remarks and accompanying statement made by Fed Chair Jay Powell in the press conference after the FOMC meeting. However, the Fed chair is likely to face questions about his early actions and comments from Trump, who this week said he would demand interest rates cut and drop in oil prices. Since November’s election, Trump and Powell have downplayed any friction including the president’s previous calls for the Chair’s exit. Powell also made it clear in November that he planned to serve out his term and maintained that Trump could not remove him. ECB signals more aggressive interest rate cut policy 🚨The next week is MASSIVE: The Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada are scheduled to announce their interest rate decision on Wednesday. On Thursday, the European Central Bank is due. The BoC and the ECB are expected to cut by 0.25% and the Fed to leave rates unchanged. pic.twitter.com/27kKD1u1mz — Global Markets Investor (@GlobalMktObserv) January 26, 2025 Investors expect another interest rate cut on Thursday after Christine Lagarde, the European Central Bank president, came closer than ever to declaring victory over inflation last month. Markets had fully priced in another 0.25% rate cut from Frankfurt’s policymakers. If confirmed, that would reportedly be the fifth reduction since June, taking the key deposit rate to 2.75%, the lowest level in almost two years. The rate cut would also be 1.25% lower than 2024’s peak. In doing so, markets expect the ECB to discount December’s jump in annual inflation back to 2.4%. The ECB was confident that annual price increases this year would be close to its medium-term target of 2%, while economic growth was likely to be disappointing. However, nearly 50% of the 72 European economists polled by the Financial Times said the ECB had been too slow in lowering interest rates. “We do not see ourselves behind the curve” ~ Christine Lagarde Lagarde told CNBC that the ECB was not ‘overly concerned’ about ‘potential repercussions’ for Europe from a potential rise in U.S. inflation. A growing transatlantic gap in monetary policy seemed to be widening, with the Fed becoming much more hawkish in December. Traders were expecting two or three further 0.25% cuts this year according to rate cut levels implied by swaps markets. Canada expects more rate cuts at the next policy-setting meeting The Bank of Canada’s economic data revealed that traders expected a 0.25% interest rate cut at Wednesday’s policy-setting meeting, although recent trends in the economic data had left a small question mark. Swaps markets were pricing in a 90% probability the Canadian central bank would cut its benchmark rate by 0.25% – from 3.25% to 3%. However, the Bank of Canada responded to weaker than expected economic growth and reduced its overnight rate by 0.5% in December for the second consecutive meeting. Subsequently, deliberations from the bank’s governing council showed that the decision between a 0.25% and 0.50% cut was a close call given the mixed data and the substantial cumulation of recent reductions. Thomas Ryan, North America economist at Capital Economics, said the Bank of Canada’s governing council would opt for a 0.25% policy rate cut as tariffs continued to cloud the economic outlook. A summary of the bank’s governing council declared that members would be evaluating the need for further reductions in policy rate ‘one meeting at a time’. The summary also pointed out that a more gradual approach to monetary policy was expected going forward. According to Capital Economics, market data showed that Canada’s economic growth was ‘roughly in line’ with the central bank’s forecast.

Bitcoin (BTC) fell by 5.84%, dipping to $98,809, while Ethereum (ETH) saw a 7.85% drop, reaching $3,077. XRP also experienced a 10% decline, falling to $2.82. Solana (SOL) and Binance Coin (BNB) followed suit, with drops of 12.01% and 6% respectively. Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and TRON (TRX) were also down, though to a lesser extent, continuing the overall negative trend in the market. Bitcoin has struggled to stay above the $100,000 mark, spending more time below this level than above it. Over the past two months, the market has shown increasing signs of indecision, creating one of the more challenging periods in this bull market. The Fear and Greed Index shows that sentiment is still in a greedy state, although there was a brief period of neutral sentiment on January 10th. The market is stuck in a wide range , with Bitcoin fluctuating between $89,000 and $109,000. This range-bound price action could indicate that the market is waiting for a reset in sentiment. Once the market cools down and sentiment shifts, a clearer direction for Bitcoin could emerge.

Memecoins like Shiba Inu, Dogwifhat and Pepe have carved out spaces in the hearts of traders, fueled by hype and wild swings. However, none have made quite the splash as Remittix (RTX) , a game-changing payment network that’s rapidly gaining traction. In just four weeks, Remittix has achieved a stunning 2.2x gain with its viral presale token, leaving competitors like Pepe scrambling in its wake. With its innovative blockchain-powered payment solutions, Remittix isn’t just riding the crypto wave, it’s redefining it. The Rise and Fall of Pepe Pepe has been a favorite in the meme coin realm, offering traders the thrill of big gains and the agony of sharp drops. This rollercoaster dynamic kept it relevant, but it also made Pepe a risky bet. Initially fueled by community-driven hype, Pepe saw significant growth in its early days, pushing its market cap into impressive territory. Traders who timed their entry well undoubtedly enjoyed the ride. But for many, Pepe’s momentum proved short-lived. The coin failed to sustain its growth, partly due to the lack of utility beyond being a meme. In a market increasingly favoring tokens with practical applications, Pepe’s allure began to fade. Recent months have seen it struggle to compete with more robust projects like Remittix, whose innovative approach to blockchain-powered payment solutions is captivating investors. While Pepe’s highs brought excitement, its lows remind traders of the volatility that defines the meme coin space. Meanwhile, Remittix has emerged as a safer and more lucrative alternative. With its focus on utility and transparent flat-fee model, it has become the poster child for what a modern crypto project should aspire to be. Why Remittix Is Dominating the Crypto Market In the competitive cryptocurrency market, Remittix is a disruptor. The platform is addressing practical issues such as exorbitant fees, sluggish transfer speeds and the absence of transparency in conventional payment methods through the smooth integration of blockchain technology with fiat transactions. That’s the promise of Remittix. The platform ensures that even customers who are not familiar with cryptocurrency can benefit from quick and inexpensive transfers by supporting more than 40 cryptocurrencies and converting them into cash. At an incredible rate, this ground-breaking idea, known as PayFi, is gaining popularity. Remittix is already outperforming the majority of its rivals, having raised over $7.7 million in its viral presale token and forecasting 1,500% increases after launch. It is a unique choice for both traders and corporations due to its transparency and user-focused methodology. The “Remittix Pay” API is especially exciting for businesses because it allows them to accept cryptocurrency payments while settling in fiat. For businesses, merchants and freelancers trying to close the gap between traditional and digital banking, this function is revolutionary. Conclusion Remittix is a shining example of dependability and innovation in a market full of projects driven by hype. More important than the remarkable 2.2x gain in four weeks is the development of a scalable, long-lasting platform that addresses pressing issues. The flat-fee model ensures that users get exactly what they send, unlike traditional systems riddled with hidden charges. Moreover, Remittix’s smart contract audit and three-year token lock for liquidity and team tokens highlight its commitment to transparency and long-term value. In the rapidly changing cryptocurrency market, Remittix is establishing itself as a dominant force, while Pepe and other meme coins are having difficulty establishing themselves. Its capacity to integrate practical applications with blockchain-powered payment solutions places it at the forefront of the upcoming wave of cryptocurrency innovation. Remittix is clearly more than just another coin, it represents the future of international payments, as seen by the continued interest in its viral presale token. For traders seeking gains and investors looking for stability, the choice is clear. Remittix is here to stay and it’s only getting started so join in!

This dramatic decline has caused a ripple effect throughout the market, leading to massive liquidations. Bitcoin’s drop resulted in nearly $900 million worth of leveraged positions being wiped out across the crypto space. Massive Liquidations Across the Market According to Coinglass data , over 316,000 traders were liquidated during this price plunge, contributing to a total of $881 million in liquidated positions. Long positions took the hardest hit, making up around $820 million of the total, while short liquidations accounted for $60 million. The largest single liquidation took place on the HTX exchange, with a massive $98.46 million position being liquidated. Market Sentiment Shifts to Neutral As the market continues to struggle, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index shows a shift in sentiment. The index now sits at 55 , indicating a “Neutral” outlook. With increased caution in the market, more traders are betting against Bitcoin’s recovery by taking short positions. Bitcoin’s Critical Support Level: $98,000 Bitcoin is currently testing its crucial support at $98,000 , which it needs to hold to prevent further declines. If Bitcoin loses this level, it could trigger a deeper correction, erasing recent gains and causing more uncertainty in the market. The pressure on Bitcoin is intensifying as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting approaches on January 29, adding further tension. Interestingly, Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes has predicted a “mini financial crisis,” suggesting that Bitcoin could drop to $70,000 before embarking on a strong bull run toward $250,000. Reversing the order of my tryptic essay series. The Ugly will be published tomorrow morning.

However, the crypto markets are facing major turbulence, due to which the XRP price is plunging hard after losing the key support at $3. What’s next? Should you consider selling XRP and joining the ‘panic seller’ list or hold until the selling pressure eases? As the market sentiments have turned bearish, the XRP price may tend to remain deflated for a while. Meanwhile, the bulls are trying hard to hold the rally at $2.75, which has been the previous top after the breakout in November 2024. After losing over 12% since the early trading hours, the question arises whether it is the time to sell XRP as the buyers remain passive at the moment. Ever since the price lost support at $3.1, the bears have held a strong grip over the rally and dragged the price by over 12%. The volume has soar by over 200%, crossing $9 billion, which is majorly dominated by the bears, hinting towards the token offering a good buying range shortly. The short-term price action of XRP suggests the token is facing a free fall after losing the resistance at the 50-day MA. There is a possibility of a healthy rebound as the 200-day MA is expected to offer a strong base. With this, the price could continue to drop by another 4% to 5%, reaching close to $2.6 that may further attract massive liquidity. One of the major bullish signals is the bullish reversal seen with the ADX, hinting towards the rally gaining strength. However, the +Di & -Di levels have diverged away from each other after a bearish crossover, suggesting the rebound could consume more time than speculated. Therefore, the XRP price continues to remain within a bullish range regardless of the persistent bearish pressure escalating over the token. The market sentiments are believed to turn bullish very soon, pushing the price back above $3. Hence, the probability of a new ATH still remains higher as the XRP price remains primed to surge beyond $4 in the upcoming days.",Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-27 08:59:49

This drop occurred despite a significant development on Friday when President Donald Trump announced the formation of a crypto policy group set to shape the country’s crypto industry within six months. Market experts are now cautioning that further losses may follow. “Financial Crisis” Looms BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicts a turbulent path ahead for Bitcoin, expecting a correction to between $70,000 and $75,000 due to a “mini financial crisis.” Despite this, he remains bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term outlook, projecting a rally to $250,000 by the end of the year, driven by renewed monetary stimulus. “I am calling for a $70k to $75k correction in $BTC, a mini financial crisis, and a resumption of money printing that will send us to $250k by the end of the year.” Bitcoin’s recent plunge was attributed to a broader market sell-off triggered by the rising popularity of the China-based artificial intelligence app DeepSeek. The app’s performance, which rivals OpenAI’s models with lower chip requirements, has raised concerns among investors, prompting a “risk-off” sentiment. Bitcoin, which surged past $70,000 in November following Donald Trump’s election victory and subsequent pro-crypto initiatives, remains closely tied to the US stock market. Its price tends to move in tandem with high-growth tech stocks, which have benefited from the AI boom since 2022. However, DeepSeek’s advancements have created fears of a shift in the market, which ultimately led to sharp declines in crypto prices. Market analyst Adam Kobeissi described the latest sell-off as a reaction to investor uncertainty driven by DeepSeek’s disruptive potential. Bitcoin’s Failed Head-and-Shoulders Pattern Data shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez shows the failure of a head-and-shoulders pattern in Bitcoin’s price action, suggesting a bullish outlook for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. In his latest tweet, Martinez indicates that this pattern breakdown points to a potential upside target of $122,000 following the invalidation of the bearish setup and the subsequent possibility of significant upward momentum.

This follows a 28% drop last week. One of the reasons for this sustained crash and what might happen next to PEPE is the selling pressure from whales who have offloaded more than a trillion tokens. How low can price crash? Pepe Coin Price Breaks Key Support as Whales Sell 1.1 Trillion PEPE Pepe Coin price faced significant selling pressure as prominent whales offloaded over 1.1 trillion PEPE, causing the price to fall below $0.000014. On-chain data revealed major whale transactions contributing to the decline. A whale with the address 0xfBfC…07Be deposited 430 B PEPE, valued at approximately $6.39 million, into Binance within the last nine hours. Another notable transaction came from market participants.eth, who transferred 325.5 billion PEPE, worth around $4.9 million, to Binance 24 hours ago.

Adding to the trend, the whale 0xC7ac…BE36 deposited 140.83 billion PEPE, approximately $1.98 million, into Binance just two hours ago. Major market movements illustrate whale behavior changes that threaten the market stability of Pepe Coin.

The meme coin remains within the trading range established since April 8, 2024, oscillating between $0.00000633 and $0.00001461. Despite previously breaking above this range, PEPE has now fallen back into it, signaling a potential further downside. Technical analysis suggests the next key support lies at $0.00000782. A break below this level could trigger a decline toward the lower boundary of $0.00000633. Such a move would represent a substantial 56% crash from the current trading level. The crypto market today has seen corrections, with BTC dropping below $100k and other top coins trading in red.

Should critical price support levels fail price stability derives additional declines.

It benefits from one of the most efficient mining fleets in the sector which gives it ""strong unit economics and outsized BTC production."" KBW gave the stock a $19 price target. Core Scientific offers exposure to the biggest and most appealing AI/HPC hosting services contract in the sector through the 12-year deal it inked with CoreWeave last year, as well as bitcoin mining, KBW said. Core Scientific is well positioned to ""secure incremental capacity"" as it has an engineering team with previous experience in data center operations, the report added. KBW initiated coverage of the shares with a $22 price target. Core Scientific was trading little changed at $16 on Monday.

Over the weekend of January 25-26, the neural network attracted community attention, leading to sell-offs in stock and cryptocurrency markets. DeepSeek: The New AI Powerhouse - What is it? Chinese AI startup DeepSeek is an artificial intelligence startup founded in 2023 in Hangzhou, China. The company specializes in developing large open-source language models and has gained recognition for its innovative approach and achievements. In November, DeepSeek introduced the thinking “super powerful” AI model DeepSeek-R1-Lite-Preview. According to published tests, it performs on par with OpenAI’s o1-preview. At the end of December, the firm showcased its own LLM V3, which surpassed competitors from Meta and OpenAI in tests. DeepSeek's open source model competes with leading AI technologies, offering advanced reasoning and performance benchmarks. DeepSeek V3 has 671 billion parameters. In comparison, Llama 3.1 has 405 billion parameters. This metric reflects the AI’s ability to adapt to more complex applications and provide more accurate responses. The development of the neural network took two months, costing $5.58 million and requiring significantly fewer computational resources compared to larger tech companies. Nvidia H800 chips were used, optimizing the use of computing power in the model training process. Thanks to the new AI model DeepSeek-R1, the company’s chatbot skyrocketed in the rankings of free apps on the App Store in the USA, surpassing even ChatGPT. Introduction to DeepSeek DeepSeek is a Chinese AI startup that has been making waves in the global AI community with its cutting-edge, open-source models and low inference costs. Founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a former head of the High-Flyer quantitative hedge fund, DeepSeek has quickly risen to the top of the AI market with its innovative approach to AI research and development. With a focus on open-source innovation, longer context windows, and dramatically lower usage costs, DeepSeek has positioned itself as a viable alternative to more expensive, proprietary platforms. DeepSeek R1 — the killer of OpenAI's o1 DeepSeek offered performance comparable to top models at a much lower cost. In several tests conducted by third-party developers, the Chinese model outperformed Llama 3.1, GPT-4o, and Claude Sonnet 3.5. Experts tested the AI for response accuracy, problem-solving capabilities, mathematics, and programming. DeepSeek faces significant deepseek challenges in a competitive landscape dominated by technology giants like OpenAI, Google, and Meta. These challenges could impact its growth and adoption, particularly in terms of resource allocation and the effectiveness of its innovative approach compared to proprietary models. “ The developers have indeed managed to create an open-source neural network that performs computations efficiently in output mode. We must take China’s developments very seriously,” commented Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at the World Economic Forum in Davos (Switzerland). DeepSeek also surprised by managing to circumvent U.S. export control restrictions. “The Chinese company DeepSeek may pose the greatest threat to American stock markets since it appears to have built a revolutionary AI model at an extremely low cost and without access to advanced chips, calling into question the utility of hundreds of billions in investments pouring into this sector,” commented journalist Holger Zschäpitz. DeepSeek introduced “distilled” versions of R1 ranging from 1.5 billion parameters to 70 billion parameters. The smallest can run on a laptop. In one example, DeepSeek R1 was even launched on a smartphone. The larger version requires powerful hardware but is available via API at a price 90-95% lower than OpenAI’s o1—$0.14 per million tokens compared to $7.5 for its American competitor. To achieve high performance at lower costs, Chinese developers “rethought everything from scratch,” creating innovative and cost-effective AI tools. Paradigm Shift in the Global AI Landscape Morgan Brown, Vice President of Product at Dropbox, explained DeepSeek’s approach and technical solutions: “Traditional AI is like writing every number with 32 decimal places. At DeepSeek they thought: ‘What if we only use 8? That would still be accurate enough!’ Boom—75% less memory.” DeepSeek also implemented a “multi-token” system. Standard AI “reads like a first-grader”: “The cat… sat…”. The Chinese neural network reads entire phrases at once, twice as fast and with 90% more accuracy. DeepSeek's use of Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) significantly improves model efficiency by distributing focus across multiple attention heads, enhancing the ability to process various data streams simultaneously. “But here’s what is really smart: they created an ‘expert system.’ Instead of one massive AI trying to know everything (like if one person were a doctor, lawyer, and engineer), they have specialized experts that activate only when necessary,” noted Brown. In traditional models, all 1.8 trillion parameters are active all the time. DeepSeek has 671 billion parameters but only 37 billion are active simultaneously. “It’s like having a huge team but only bringing in those specialists who are truly needed for each task,” added Dropbox’s VP of Product. The results are “mind-blowing,” noted experts:Training cost: $100 million → $5 million; Required GPUs: 100,000 → 2,000; API costs: 95% cheaper; Can run on gaming GPUs. DeepSeek's large language models bypass traditional supervised fine-tuning in favor of reinforcement learning, allowing them to develop advanced reasoning and problem-solving capabilities independently. “But wait,” you might say; “there must be some catch!” That’s just it — everything is open-source. Anyone can verify their work. The code is publicly available. Everything is explained in technical documents. This isn’t magic; it’s just incredibly smart engineering,” concluded Brown. DeepSeek achieved these results with a team of fewer than 200 people. However, R1 has a downside — censorship. Being a Chinese model, it is subject to government control. Its responses will not touch on Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy. “The impressive performance of DeepSeek’s distilled models means that highly capable reasoning systems will continue to be widely disseminated and run on local equipment away from any oversight,” noted AI researcher Dean Ball from George Mason University. DeepSeek's ambition to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) as part of its long-term vision highlights their commitment to advancing AI capabilities beyond current limitations. AI Models and Innovations DeepSeek has developed a range of AI models that have been praised for their reasoning capabilities, problem-solving capabilities, and cost-effectiveness. The company’s flagship model, DeepSeek R1, is a large language model that has been trained using a reinforcement learning (RL) approach, allowing it to learn independently and develop self-verification, reflection, and chain-of-thought (CoT) capabilities. DeepSeek R1 has been released in six smaller versions that are small enough to run locally on laptops, with one of them outperforming OpenAI’s o1-mini on certain benchmarks. DeepSeek’s AI models are designed to be highly efficient, with a focus on maximizing software-driven resource optimization and embracing open-source methods. This approach not only mitigates resource constraints but also accelerates the development of cutting-edge technologies. DeepSeek’s models are also highly scalable, with performance improving with longer reasoning steps. Business Model and Partnerships DeepSeek’s business model is unique in that it is financed entirely by High-Flyer, a successful quantitative hedge fund. This arrangement allows DeepSeek to operate without the pressures of shareholder demands or meeting aggressive Series A milestones. DeepSeek has positioned itself as a viable alternative to more expensive, proprietary platforms, with incredibly low API pricing. DeepSeek has also partnered with other companies and organizations to advance its AI research and development. For example, the company has collaborated with Hugging Face on the Open R1 initiative, an ambitious project aiming to replicate the full DeepSeek R1 training pipeline. If successful, this initiative could enable researchers around the world to adapt and refine R1-like models, further accelerating innovation in the AI space. Future Outlook and Challenges DeepSeek’s rapid rise comes with challenges that could shape its future, including U.S. export controls and market perception issues. The company must consistently prove its reliability, especially for enterprise-grade deployments, and navigate the fast-evolving AI landscape. Despite these challenges, DeepSeek’s future outlook is promising. The company’s commitment to open-source innovation and its focus on developing highly efficient and scalable AI models have positioned it as a leader in the global AI landscape. As the AI market continues to evolve, DeepSeek is well-positioned to capitalize on emerging trends and opportunities. However, DeepSeek also faces challenges related to the geopolitical implications of its Chinese origins. The company must navigate the complex landscape of export controls and regulatory frameworks, while also addressing concerns about potential biases in its training data. Overall, DeepSeek’s future success will depend on its ability to balance innovation with accountability, while also navigating the complex geopolitical landscape of the AI industry. Sell-off in the AI Market The sharp rise in DeepSeek’s popularity led to sell-offs in stocks and cryptocurrencies. Investors became concerned about a bubble in the artificial intelligence sector. American AI startups are spending billions on training neural networks while their valuations reach hundreds of billions of dollars. DeepSeek demonstrated that this isn’t necessary. On January 27, shares of Japanese companies involved in chip production fell sharply. There was also significant decline observed in the American stock market, particularly affecting shares of Nvidia —the main beneficiary of the AI boom. Sell-offs in TradFi led to declines in cryptocurrencies, especially those related to artificial intelligence tokens. AI agents were particularly hard-hit as crypto investors seemed to be “digesting” DeepSeek’s influence on the future of the AI sector within digital assets. The open source coding model, exemplified by DeepSeek Coder and DeepSeek-R1, has democratized access to advanced AI capabilities, fostering collaboration and customization. This model is particularly appealing to independent developers and startups looking for alternatives to expensive proprietary systems.

Meanwhile, Astra Nova partners with Shib to revolutionize Blockchain gaming. Also, a new crypto currency, RTX of the Remittix ecosystem, goes viral among crypto enthusiasts, predicting a 100x gain upon launch. XRP Price Prediction Prominent analyst, Dark Defender believes XRP will breach the $3 psychological mark to read $5. This prediction comes as XRP prices move sideways akin to the broader market. Notably, XRP recently reached $3 on 15 January since January 2018, surging to $3.4 the following day. Its price has since retraced significantly, currently trading at $3.13, a 1.1% rise in the past day. Meanwhile, XRP’s bullish run saw its price move from $0.5 in November to cross the psychological resistance levels of $1 and $2 within two weeks. Despite the recent struggles, Dark Defender believes $3 will be history forever as its price could skyrocket soon once it goes above the $3.24 resistance level. XRP’s could then reach $5.8, coinciding with the Fibonacci extension level at 261.8%. Shiba Inu’s Latest News In an announcement made on January 24, Astra Novа partners with Shib to set a stage for collaboration that could reshape digital ownership and Blockchain gaming. According to the release, the collaboration will capitalize on Shiba Inu’s Lаyеr-2 blockchаin solution, Shibarium, to innovate with uniquе gаming fеаturеs аnd digitаl аpplicаtions. Meanwhile, by next month, Astra Novа will start its Action RPG survivаl modе on Shibarium. This survival mode will consist of AI-powered non-player characters (NPCs), bringing a new perspective to blockchаin gаming as it combines аrtificiаl intеlligеncе and dеcеntrаlizеd tеchnology. Adding another layer to the partnership, Novа Toon wеbcomic dеcеntrаlizеd аpplicаtion (dApp) will also debut in Fеbruаry. The dApp will include comics inspired by the Shiba Inu аnd Astra Novа communitiеs. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu’s integrated burn mechanism to bolster the price of Shib as the portion of the revenue of gеnеrаtеd from this survival game would be utilized in burning Shib tokens sеmi-аnnuаlly.

39567919,https://timestabloid.com/?p=55673,1737979078,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple CTO Ends Speculations About XRP Centralization,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-cto-ends-speculations-about-xrp-centralization/,"Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X), a well-known figure in the cryptocurrency space, recently shared a video featuring Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz. The video addressed longstanding questions and speculation surrounding the decentralization of XRP, drawing significant attention across the community. In the video, Schwartz detailed how the XRP Ledger operates, emphasizing its decentralization, transparency, and resistance to unilateral control. Addressing Centralization Concerns David Schwartz began by addressing the broader concerns of centralization, specifically the possibility of one entity—such as Ripple—having disproportionate control over the XRP Ledger. According to Schwartz, centralization is fundamentally tied to whether a single party can dictate the rules, halt the system, or alter its operations to the detriment of its users. He firmly stated that XRP does not fall under this category. “The software is all open; anyone can run a server, anyone can run a validator, and they do,” Schwartz explained. Validators and servers are operated by many stakeholders, including exchanges and individual XRP holders who process their transactions. This distributed network ensures that no single entity, including Ripple, has the power to control or shut down the system. XRP Creation and Protocol Rules One of the most persistent concerns regarding XRP is whether Ripple could create more tokens or manipulate its supply. Schwartz categorically refuted this, stating, “The protocol doesn’t have any way to say, ‘Hey, I got a whole bunch of XRP, just don’t ask me where it came from.’” He explained that the transaction rules of the XRP Ledger are deterministic, with no mechanisms for unauthorized token creation. Moreover, the open-source nature of the software guarantees transparency, allowing anyone to review and verify the rules. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s XRP Holdings and Escrow Mechanism Schwartz also addressed Ripple’s significant holdings of XRP, a point often cited in centralization debates. At the time of Schwartz’s report, Ripple held approximately 60 billion XRP, accounting for 60% of the total supply. Schwartz clarified that 55 billion of these tokens are locked in escrow. Under this mechanism, one billion XRP is released monthly over 55 months to ensure predictable supply and mitigate market shocks. Any unused XRP at the end of each month is returned to escrow, extending the lock-up period. Schwartz highlighted the transparency of this system, as all escrows and transactions are publicly visible on the XRP Ledger. Commitment to Decentralization The Ripple CTO also reiterated the company’s commitment to improving the decentralization of the XRP Ledger. Schwartz noted that in 2018, Ripple prioritized adding more validators to enhance the network’s independence. Although the video referenced past milestones, its key points remain relevant to ongoing discussions about the network’s decentralization. Community Reactions Schwartz’s statements have resonated within the cryptocurrency community, with Brett’s tweet amplifying the discussion. Many XRP supporters have pointed to the video as evidence debunking accusations of centralization, while others have emphasized Ripple’s transparent handling of its XRP holdings. As debates surrounding centralization in blockchain networks persist, Schwartz’s detailed explanation provides clarity on XRP’s structure and Ripple’s role within its ecosystem.

Which One Will Take Gold In 2025?",https://nulltx.com/price-prediction-algorand-aave-render-remittix-which-one-will-take-gold-in-2025/,"The crypto buzz is louder than ever, as investors hunt for the best alt for 2025 that might outshine the rest. Some experts point to Algorand, hailing its quick transactions and major institutional backing. Others champion AAVE, thanks to its DeFi dominance and massive liquidity lock. Another camp sees Render as the next big thing, fueling 3D rendering in a decentralized way. Meanwhile, new arrivals like Remittix are drawing attention with a presale topping $8 million. Could Remittix synergy and the PayFi altcoin revolution be the real game-changer for 2025? Let’s break down each contender’s potential and see which coin (or token) might take the prize in the next big bull cycle. If you’re intrigued by the idea of bridging crypto with everyday finance, check Remittix now before tokens run out. Algorand: Institutional-Grade But Underappreciated Algorand has long been a favourite among those seeking fast finality and robust security. Aggregator data shows Algorand boasting around 1,200 transactions per second, a notable leap from older blockchains. Despite these strengths, ALGO’s price has meandered, hovering well below its peak—partly due to stiff competition and marketing challenges. Supporters argue that if institutions keep exploring Algorand for tokenized assets, it could see a surge by 2025. Critics, however, say Algorand’s dev ecosystem lacks the wow factor of certain layer-1 rivals. Overall, if enterprise deals materialize, ALGO might quietly accumulate value. AAVE: The DeFi Powerhouse AAVE reigns as one of DeFi’s leading lending protocols, with aggregator data showing billions in total value locked at its peak. Its approach to flash loans and permissionless money markets put AAVE at the heart of decentralized finance. Yet the macro DeFi slump has cooled some of the excitement, and AAVE trades far beneath its previous all-time high. Bulls say the next bull run will spark renewed DeFi hype, catapulting AAVE upward. Bears worry about ongoing regulatory scrutiny around lending tokens, which could stifle user growth. While AAVE’s track record is solid, some argue it’s mature enough that 100x moves might be unrealistic now. Render: Fuel for a Metaverse Future Render, or RNDR, supports decentralized 3D rendering, tapping a unique niche. Aggregator data shows a steady climb in token price, driven by rising interest in metaverse and virtual reality apps. Advocates see Render as a crucial infrastructure if immersive worlds explode in popularity by 2025. Skeptics counter that RNDR’s adoption hinges on VR tech going mainstream, which has proven elusive. Render’s gains so far reflect excitement about possible big-brand collaborations—yet few major announcements have cemented that hype. If the metaverse truly takes off, RNDR might be unstoppable. If not, it could stall. Many place Render in the watch-and-see category, acknowledging its ambition but uncertain about timelines. Meanwhile, a new alt is stealing some of RNDR’s thunder by tackling a more immediate global pain point: cross-border payments. Remittix Synergy: The PayFi Altcoin Revolution Here’s where Remittix synergy stands out from these established names. While Algorand pushes institutional-grade performance, AAVE dominates DeFi, and Render targets future VR demand, Remittix addresses real-world remittance fees in a $190 trillion market. Already, it has raised $8 million in presale, enticing investors who believe bridging crypto with banking might spawn exponential gains. Liquidity is locked for three years, and the contract will be renounced after the presale, aiming to prevent rug pulls. Critics note that real adoption requires forging partnerships and scaling user-friendly apps. If that pans out, Remittix could rocket beyond 50x by next year. Feeling curious? Explore the presale at Remittix if a PayFi altcoin revolution resonates more than a crowded DeFi field or uncertain metaverse hype. Who Takes Gold in 2025? Algorand offers enterprise-grade speed and security, AAVE leads DeFi lending, and Render chases the metaverse. Each has a unique appeal, but the PayFi altcoin revolution led by Remittix might carve out a more immediate path to mass adoption by solving every day remittance woes. Of course, no project is guaranteed stardom. Algorand must land big enterprise deals, AAVE needs a DeFi comeback, and Render hinges on VR taking off. Meanwhile, Remittix must prove its cross-border model can scale globally. If it does, this “new kid” could overshadow older tokens that rely on hype cycles. Always research thoroughly and manage your risk, but if bridging crypto and real-world banking intrigues you, a token in presale nearing $8 million might be your next big bet.

Due to merged mining with LTC, miners hold a significant portion of DOGE. This article will explain Dogecoin cloud mining and how you can earn $10,800 daily with DDB Miner and more. Understanding Dogecoin Cloud Mining Dogecoin cloud mining involves cloud mining services being compensated with new Dogecoins for processing transactions on the Dogecoin blockchain. While it sounds straightforward, it's not easy to accomplish! Cloud mining requires several computers to handle the same transaction batch simultaneously, but only one computer receives the reward of new coins. The node that receives these coins is the one that adds the completed transaction block to the new block by solving a complex math problem. The first node to crack this mathematical puzzle wins! It can then attach the newly verified transaction block to the existing blockchain. This method is common across most cryptocurrency mining, but Dogecoin mining has unique characteristics. These include: ⦁ Algorithms: Each cryptocurrency uses specific mining rules known as mining or hashing algorithms. Block Time: This refers to the average duration needed to verify a new transaction block and add it to the blockchain. ⦁ Difficulty: This figure indicates how challenging it is to mine each new currency block. Difficulty can fluctuate based on the number of miners, and the protocol adjusts it to maintain consistent block times. ⦁ Reward: This is the amount of new currency awarded to the miner for each new block. Initiating Dogecoin Cloud Mining with DDB Miner Select a cloud mining service provider. Occasionally, DDB Miner's expert analysts and IT team will evaluate the hash rate produced by miners and upgrade to the latest machines, ensuring users receive higher returns from cloud mining.

The rise in XRP has also helped DOGE, with its price expected to rise to $1. The supply of DOGE is growing every day, with 10,000 new coins being created every two minutes. Miners are among the largest holders of DOGE due to merged mining with LTC. This article details what Dogecoin cloud mining is and how you can make $10,800 a day with DDB Miner and more What is Dogecoin cloud mining? Dogecoin cloud mining is the process by which cloud mining service providers are rewarded with new Dogecoins by viewing transactions on the Dogecoin blockchain. It may seem simple, but it is not easy to do! Cloud mining involves multiple computers processing the same batch of transactions at the same time, but only one computer can be rewarded with new coins. The computer that gets the new coins is the node that adds the old transaction block to the new block. This is done through a complex mathematical equation. The node that solves the math problem first wins! It can then append the newly confirmed block of transactions to the rest of the blockchain. Most cryptocurrency mining is done this way. However, Dogecoin mining differs from other currencies in a few important ways. These aspects include: ⦁ Algorithms: Each cryptocurrency has a set of rules for mining new coins. These rules are called mining algorithms or hashing algorithms. Block time: This is the average length of time it takes to check a new block of transactions and add it to the blockchain. ⦁ Difficulty: This number represents how difficult it is to mine each new block of the currency. Mining difficulty can go up or down, depending on how many miners there are. The currency protocol also adjusts the difficulty to ensure that the block time remains constant. ⦁ Reward: This is the amount of new currency awarded to the miner for each new block. How to Start Dogecoin Cloud Mining with DDB Miner Choose a crypto cloud mining service provider. In rare cases, DDB Miner's team of professional analysts and IT team will analyze the hash rate generated by the miner's operation and replace the latest miner.

Unfortunately for the bulls, that energy is being released downward as market sentiment shifts in response to concerns over the impact of the low-cost Chinese AI startup DeepSeek on the U.S. AI sector and American technological leadership. Bitcoin plummeted to $97,800 during Asian trading hours, with whales driving prices lower to liquidate overleveraged buyers on perpetual futures exchanges. GPU-heavy AI tokens saw sell-offs of up to 40%, with similar pressure affecting GameFi assets. Nasdaq futures tanked 700 points, with shares in chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) indicated 10% lower in pre-market trading. DeepSeek-R1 is expected to significantly reduce the costs of developing large language models, raising a questions on the validity of the rich valuations for AI-associated companies like Nvidia. Trader and analyst Alex Kruger noted on X, ""The problem is, few understand how DeepSeek changes things. it’s hard to quantify the issue—and when facing uncertainty, people derisk. When this happens in low liquidity conditions, the market flushes hard."" Kruger is opting not to buy the dip, saying he prefers to short positions above $100,000 as he anticipates heightened volatility from the upcoming Fed meeting and potential political maneuvering from President Donald Trump. The Fed is expected to reiterate its wait-and-see approach, maintaining its hawkish December guidance on interest rates. Still, all is not lost. Paul Howard, Senior Director at Wincent, said institutional participation could ramp up in the coming months. ""The next wave up will likely come from organic participation from institutions in the next 3-4 months. I’d be surprised to see a sharp bounce back to all-time highs before Q2,"" he said in an email. Howard identified newly launched layer-1 blockchains with a focus on security and transactions per second, like SUPRA, as valuable opportunities, while stressing that for long-biased funds, discovering alpha in a bearish market involves seeking out low market-cap layer-1s alongside their already established peers.

The downturn dented massive Sunday rallies on Jupiter's JUP and Base memecoin toshi (TOSHI). JUP spiked 40% as founder ‘Meow’ announced at an annual conference that the platform would burn over $3 billion JUP tokens and begin using 50% of its fees to buy back the tokens from the market. TOSHI more than doubled as Coinbase listed perpetual futures for the token, making it the only Base memecoin with both a spot and futures listing on the influential exchange. The subsequent spike in demand sent the token to a peak market capitalization of $820 million. Derivatives Positioning BTC perpetual funding rates flipped negative during European hours, showing a net bias for shorts. Historically, such a positioning has tended to mark local price bottoms. BNB, DOGE, TRX and AVAX also saw negative funding rates. BTC, ETH short-dated options now show a bias for put options, offering downside protection. Expiries after February continue to show a bias for calls. Key block trades for the day include a short volatility play, involving short positions in BTC $05K call and $98K put, both expiring on Jan. 10.

TICO will be available to traders on major cryptocurrency exchanges , including Gate.io, MEXC Global, BitMart, and Uniswap, at noon (12:00 PM) UTC. As one of the core parts of Funtico’s ecosystem, TICO will unify gaming experiences, AI-powered systems, and transactions across various platforms. Initially launched as an ERC-20 token on the Avalanche C-Chain and then seamlessly bridged to other chains like Ethereum ( ETH ), Base ( BASE ), and Polygon ( MATIC ), the new token will provide interoperability to both developers and gamers. The TICO token adds various features to Web3 gaming, AI-driven infrastructure, and many utilities for gamers and publishers. TICO for gamers and publishers For example, gamers can use TICO for in-game purchases, premium content, and monetization while benefiting from interoperability across item ownership, gaming environments, customization, and NFT integration. Additionally, users can access functionalities such as “Publisher as a Service” tools, rewards, and extra AI features. On the other hand, publishers can rely on TICO to transition from Web2 to Web3 games and get monetization tools, co-branding options, item ownership capabilities, and community interaction tools. TICO has a capped supply of 10 billion tokens distributed to boost ecosystem growth and sustainability. 17% goes to seed and private sales, with 10% for the first and 3% for the second strategic sales. Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) get 3%, while 1% goes aside for advisors. Furthermore, team allocation amounts to 10%, while 12% is held in the liquidity pool for market stability. Lastly, in-game rewards and limited edition NFTs have a proportion of 14%, 15% allocated to the ecosystem fund and treasury, and another 15% allocated to marketing and partnerships. TICO’s security and compliance Funtico values security and compliance, with its smart contract being audited by Sayfer, a blockchain security firm. Furthermore, the Funtico platform and its games have been reviewed for reliability, integrity, and industry compliance. Ultimately, TICO is legally classified as a utility token, embracing regulatory standards and prepping up a base for a sustainable future for Web3 gaming.

However, as 2025 begins, both altcoins have started to lose momentum, prompting investors to explore alternatives like Rollblock for greater profit potential. Rollblock has already achieved an impressive 330% return for early investors and shows no signs of slowing down. Experts predict that RBLK could hit $1 once it secures listings on major exchanges, which is expected to happen in the coming months. Discover what sets Rollblock apart and why investors are so bullish. Rollblock Is Revolutionizing a $450 Billion Industry Despite generating over $450 billion annually, traditional gambling is still marred by ethical issues. Data reveals that over 9% of operators have been implicated in fraud and scams, with common practices including tampering with game odds and stealing player deposits. Rollblock is addressing these challenges by integrating blockchain technology into gaming. Rollblock offers over 7,000 AI-powered games, all fully on-chain. Each outcome is encrypted and recorded on Ethereum, ensuring tamper-proof results. To reinforce trust, Rollblock’s smart contracts have undergone a SolidProof audit, verifying the absence of backdoors or hidden functionalities. Additionally, its games and sports betting offerings are licensed by the Anjouan e-gaming authority, further enhancing credibility among players. This emphasis on transparency has yielded remarkable results. In December alone, Rollblock recorded $1.75 million in wagers. Experts forecast these numbers could double by the end of January as the platform continues to expand. At the core of Rollblock’s ecosystem is its native utility token, RBLK. The token powers governance, fee payments, and staking for passive income. Currently in its tenth presale stage and priced at $0.052, RBLK has already delivered a 330% return for early investors. RBLK further sets itself apart from tokens like Cardano or Ripple with its innovative revenue-sharing model. Rollblock allocates up to 30% of its revenue to buying back RBLK from the open market. It then burns 60% of those tokens and uses the rest as staking rewards. Analysts believe this model could be the key factor driving RBLK’s price to $1 once it enters the open market. Can Cardano Reclaim $1 This Cycle? Cardano is trading at $0.9648, consolidating below $1.00 amid market uncertainties. The RSI and MACD indicate weak momentum, with resistance at $1.00 and $1.13. A breakout above $1.13 could push Cardano to $1.23, while failure to hold $0.87 support risks a drop to $0.76. Long-term holders are stabilizing Cardano’s price, but its low correlation with Bitcoin raises concerns about underperformance in isolated market conditions. Analysts predict Cardano could reach $1.05 by 2025, with some projecting $3.00 if whale activity and ecosystem growth continue. Cardano investors should watch resistance levels and broader market trends for direction. Is $7 a Realistic Goal for Ripple? Ripple is trading at $3.17, slightly below its recent high of $3.40. A bullish flag pattern suggests potential upward momentum, with resistance at $3.25 and $3.40. A breakout could push Ripple’s price to $3.60, while support at $3.00 and $2.85 must hold to avoid further declines. Analysts predict Ripple could reach $5 to $7 by 2025, though outcomes depend on legal clarity and adoption. Can Rollblock Surpass Top Altcoins? If Rollblock maintains its current momentum, experts predict it could surpass Ripple and Cardano in 2025. RBLK has already delivered an impressive 330% return during its presale with analysts predicting a massive 100x rally in 2025.

However, as 2025 kicks off, these altcoins are beginning to slow down, pushing investors to seek alternatives like Rollblock for potentially higher returns. Rollblock has already delivered a remarkable 330% return for its early backers and seems poised for continued growth. Industry experts anticipate that RBLK could reach $1 once it gets listed on major exchanges, with these listings expected in the coming months. Learn what makes Rollblock unique and why it’s gaining such investor confidence. Rollblock Is Transforming a $450 Billion Industry Even though traditional gambling rakes in over $450 billion each year, it remains plagued by ethical problems. Reports indicate that more than 9% of operators are involved in fraud and scams, including manipulating game odds and misappropriating player deposits. Rollblock is tackling these issues by merging blockchain technology with gaming. The platform offers over 7,000 AI-driven games that operate fully on-chain. Each game's outcome is encrypted and recorded on Ethereum, ensuring results that cannot be tampered with. To build trust, Rollblock’s smart contracts have been audited by SolidProof, confirming no backdoors or hidden features. Additionally, its gaming and sports betting services are licensed by the Anjouan e-gaming authority, further establishing credibility with users. This focus on transparency has led to impressive outcomes. In December alone, Rollblock saw $1.75 million in bets placed. Analysts expect this figure to double by the end of January as the platform continues to grow. Central to Rollblock’s ecosystem is its native utility token, RBLK. This token is used for governance, paying fees, and staking for passive income. Currently in its tenth presale phase at a price of $0.052, RBLK has already provided a 330% return to its early investors. RBLK distinguishes itself from tokens like Cardano and Ripple through its groundbreaking revenue-sharing model. Rollblock dedicates up to 30% of its revenue to repurchasing RBLK from the open market, burning 60% of those tokens, and distributing the remainder as staking rewards. Analysts suggest this approach might be the catalyst for RBLK’s value reaching $1 upon entering the open market. Will Cardano Break the $1 Mark Again This Cycle? Cardano is currently trading at $0.9648, consolidating just below the $1.00 threshold amid market uncertainty. Technical indicators like the RSI and MACD point to weak momentum, with resistance levels at $1.00 and $1.13. A breakout past $1.13 might propel Cardano to $1.23, while failing to maintain support at $0.87 risks a drop to $0.76. Long-term holders are helping stabilize Cardano’s price, but its low correlation with Bitcoin raises concerns about potential underperformance in isolated market scenarios. Analysts forecast that Cardano could rise to $1.05 by 2025, with some even predicting a leap to $3.00 if whale activity and ecosystem expansion persist. Cardano investors should monitor resistance points and broader market trends for guidance. Is a $7 Target for Ripple Within Reach? Ripple is trading at $3.17, slightly under its recent peak of $3.40. A bullish flag pattern suggests possible upward movement, with resistance at $3.25 and $3.40. A breakout might push Ripple’s price to $3.60, while support at $3.00 and $2.85 must hold to prevent further drops. Analysts suggest Ripple could achieve $5 to $7 by 2025, though outcomes depend on legal clarity and wider adoption. Could Rollblock Overtake Leading Altcoins? If Rollblock keeps its current trajectory, experts speculate it could surpass Ripple and Cardano in 2025.

Key Support levels: $2.6, $2, $1.6 Key Resistance levels: $3, $3.3 1. First Major Sign of Weakens for XRP It was critical for XRP to hold above $3 if there was hope of higher highs. This level was lost today and the price fell to $2.7. This drop has also turned the level at $3 into a key resistance. The cryptocurrency fell by 11% today which shows sellers are returning. While this is a market-wide correction, the timing was quite unfortunate for XRP as this is turning the chart bearish. Chart by Tradingview 2. Falling Volume Hinted at Correction The first giveaway that a correction could be coming for XRP was seen on the volume profile. While the price made a higher high above $3, the volume did not do the same. This was an early sign that a bearish divergence was forming which called for caution. Chart by Tradingview 3. Bearish Divergence Detected The bearish divergence was quite obvious on the volume profile, as seen below. However, the same situation can also be seen on the MACD and RSI momentum indicators.

No longer is it about the mega high-graphic scene, but it’s time to play for keeps with the unique betting ecosystem that blockchain can provide. That’s the promise of Race To a Billion , a P2E gaming project that’s changing the gaming paradigm for the better. Can it become the next big gaming crypto in 2025? Revving the Engines to Win the Prize – The Race To a Billion Promises There is nothing more nostalgic than kart racing; friendships were made (and lost) when we were little and Mario Kart was our favorite pastime. But this racing game isn’t about taking control of the vehicle. Race To a Billion is a race to a $1 billion market capitalization, taking shape within the convergence of AI and blockchain. Multiple meme mascots are the drivers. There is the cheery DOGE who aims to win the prize with glee, and then there is Pepe that aims to see what lies past the finish line. Cat-based themes are also here, trying to reign supreme and win the big prize. And finally, there is the Trump meme as well, which has one goal: winning the race under any circumstance and through any means. Fair Play at the Core Fairness is the core of this racing court. Enabled by blockchain technology, Race To a Billion embraces transparency. The goal is to let the memes race in an AI-driven court. Those who spectate can do so using the RACE token, bet on these games, and earn based on whether the memes win. This blend of modern gaming, where profits are the main goal, and staking, where passive earnings take the front seat, is making Race To a Billion one of the best gaming cryptocurrencies on the market. But is it enough to make it the best gaming crypto in 2025? The answer is still a resounding yes. What Makes RACE the Best Gaming Crypto to Buy? The reasons that RACE could be the best gaming crypto to support this year are many. However, diving deep into its tokenomics and technology gives the complete answer. Tokenomics is the first factor that stands out. 40% of the total supply has been allocated to the presale, giving the community most of the stake in the project. 20% of the supply lies in staking, giving presale investors incentive to hold onto their tokens. Liquidity gets 10%, ecosystem also gets 10%, and 10% goes to marketing. Simplicity in tokenomics is preached here, and the smart contract has already been audited by SolidProof, which is another reason this project is high on trust. The technological aspects of this project focus on transparency. The interface will be modern, the races will be robust, and the outcomes will be transparent and fair. Fairness of the game outcomes will mirror the volatility and fairness of the meme coin market, allowing players to make gains in more ways than one. The third reason why RACE could be a good buy is the regulatory aspect. Since it is crypto-based, it is not beholden to regular gambling laws. And the betting ecosystem is unique, meaning KYC requirements are not present. This means fewer roadblocks and more fun. But that’s not to say the project won’t hold up to standards. It will follow the standard ethics of information technology, protecting users’ details while keeping the games fair. RACE Raises Above $200k – Final Stage is Here Race To a Billion has been a major success, with the project raising upwards of $200K to date. A countdown has started, and the project will go live soon, giving users one last window of opportunity to participate. To join, follow the steps given below: Visit the official website Connect your wallet Enter the number of ETH or USDT to swap for RACE tokens Complete the transaction Wait for the token generation event to arrive and claim your tokens Conclusion Race To a Billion is the race to bring the best meme mascots onto one race course and help the token reach a $1 billion market cap. With its multi-meme style, Race could be considered a great unifier of meme coins. And now that the market is bullish again, users have another chance to buy.

Ethereum’s recent recovery, PEPETO ‘s innovative cross-chain solutions, and Bitcoin’s steadfast position point toward stability. The crypto sector remains active thanks to the pull these particular assets exercise despite existing bearish conditions. Ethereum Shows Resilience Amidst Negative Sentiment Ethereum’s price rebounded with a 4% increase on Friday after investors spent a bearish week reacting to widespread negativity in the community. The fact that exchange reserves grew by 434,000 ETH throughout nine days shows investors exercised increased selling activity. Ethereum overcame recent challenges with its value reaching above $3,300 which hints at upcoming price stabilization. According to on-chain measurements, Ethereum reached its lowest staked value in six months with 34.15 million ETH. Long-term investor trust erodes because the continued market unpredictability leads to this sharp decline. Measures show small activity increments in dormant circulation that point toward activity from wallet owners both with short-term and long-term positions. The derivatives field gained stability evidence through a record-setting Ethereum futures open interest that reached 9.50 million ETH. Ethereum stands poised for potentially 20% growth given the present strength of its momentum combined with more positive market sentiment should it push through its resistance barriers. PEPETO Revolutionizes Cross-Chain Trading and Gains Investor Trust #PEPETO stands out as the revolutionary solution for cross-chain crypto trading by providing extreme transaction speeds alongside unmatched operational efficiency.

Bitcoin’s market capitalization, equivalent to 11% of gold’s value, highlights its growing role as a store of value.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Pepe Coin shows signs of a rebound, Yeti Ouro’s growth potential and robust ecosystem make it the token to watch, potentially outpacing PEPE’s rally. Table of Contents Whale activity and upcoming catalysts Why Yeti Ouro could eclipse Pepe’s gains In-game economy powered by YETIO A 1000% growth potential Two strategies, one winner: Why Yeti Ouro takes the lead Meme coins have long been known for their roller-coaster price movements. Pepe Coin (PEPE) is no exception, experiencing dramatic downturns during market lulls. Yet, it seems the tides may be shifting. Over the past day, Pepe coin price has shown signs of resilience, sparking excitement among investors about a potential rally. While PEPE’s rebound is drawing attention, another top meme coin contender, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) is poised to outpace its growth by an astonishing 1000%, making YETIO a must-watch token in the current market. Whale activity and upcoming catalysts Pepe Coin price recently saw a 5% surge, fueled by increased activity from Ethereum whales. According to data, two significant whales accumulated a staggering 480 billion PEPE, valued at $8.7 million. This vote of confidence from high-stake investors indicates that PEPE’s mid-to-long-term potential remains intact. Adding to the bullish sentiment is the upcoming halving event scheduled for February 4, 2025. The halving will reduce PEPE’s emission rate, creating a deflationary environment that could drive scarcity-driven growth. However, while PEPE’s rally looks promising, its lack of a functional ecosystem remains a limitation. Meme coins like PEPE thrive on hype but often struggle to sustain value due to the absence of utility, prompting many investors to look elsewhere at the first sign. Why Yeti Ouro could eclipse Pepe’s gains Yeti Ouro stands apart with its integration into Yeti Go, a dynamic blockchain-based play-to-earn (P2E) game. Unlike speculative tokens, Yeti Ouro’s value grows organically as players actively engage in the ecosystem. Yeti Go not only entertains but creates tangible demand for YETIO tokens, making it a unique contender in the crypto market. The project also prioritizes security and transparency, a recent audit from SolidProof, a trusted name in blockchain security is a testament to that. Recent advancements in Yeti Go’s development underscore the team’s commitment to delivering a high-quality product: Streamlined mechanics: Enhanced controls for intuitive gameplay. Dynamic interactions: Engaging features that balance chaos and strategy. Immersive environments: Stunning visuals developed in collaboration with industry-leading designers. You might also like: XRP could reach $30 by end of 2025, meanwhile Yeti Ouro thrives In-game economy powered by YETIO At the heart of Yeti Go lies a dynamic in-game economy powered by YETIO tokens. Players can use YETIO to personalize their gaming experience with unique skins, customizations, and powerful items. Yeti Go includes high-speed races and tournaments, while a marketplace allows the trading of collectables and in-game assets. Moreover, staking YETIO unlocks exclusive rewards and premium content, deepening player engagement. This integration of financial incentives with gameplay creates a sustainable ecosystem, blending entertainment and token utility seamlessly. A 1000% growth potential Unlike PEPE, Yeti Ouro’s value goes beyond market speculation. The token’s integration into Yeti Go creates a sustainable demand cycle: players earn YETIO, which they can reinvest into the ecosystem or hold/stake for future gains. Yeti Ouro already generated significant buzz, with phase 1 of its presale selling out early. Stage 2 is already 37.8% complete, and more than 141,000,000 tokens have already been sold in total. This provided early investors a strategic entry point to capitalize on its potential 1000% rally, seeing a 40% ROI. YETIO has become one of the highest-growth cryptos with almost explosive potential. Yeti Ouro’s roadmap highlights its commitment to an engaging user experience, reinforced by regular updates on game development and strategic collaborations with prominent game designers. These efforts, combined with Yeti Go’s immersive gameplay, aim to foster a vibrant and growing community centered on both entertainment and value. Two strategies, one winner: Why Yeti Ouro takes the lead PEPE thrives on its meme appeal and whale activity, offering short-term gains driven by market speculation. Yeti Ouro, on the other hand, delivers a blend of entertainment and utility, bridging the gap between fun and functionality.

Key Support levels: $0.90, $0.73 Key Resistance levels: $1, $1.3 1. Price Struggles at Key Support Cardano is about to decide where it goes next. If the key support at 90 cents does not hold, then it will turn into a resistance and see the price fall lower towards 73 cents next. At that point, ADA will make a lower low which could indicate a prolonged correction has begun. Chart by Tradingview 2. Momentum is Reversing The volume is making lower highs, the price is making lower highs, and so does the RSI and MACD histogram. These are all bearish signals. It would be surprising to see the key support hold considering the above. However, until the 90 cents level breaks, it is too early to call it. Chart by Tradingview 3. Impending Bearish Cross on Weekly Timeframe A big warning sign is given by the weekly MACD which shows that a bearish cross is imminent. If so, that could be the start of a long correction that can see the price fall towards 73 cents or lower. This scenario is likely if the overall market enters a deep correction.

Pepe, Sui Or New Revolutionary PayFi Altcoin Remittix",https://nulltx.com/where-should-i-invest-my-1000-pepe-sui-or-new-revolutionary-payfi-altcoin-remittix/,"Investing in crypto can sometimes feel like you’re standing at a buffet with too many options. Which would you prefer—a cutting-edge blockchain project, a meme coin with erratic fluctuations, or a brand-new altcoin that is revolutionizing payments? Investing $1,000 in the proper token could yield enormous gains, or it could cause your money to vanish before you can say “blockchain.” Let’s break it down: your options are Remittix, a ground-breaking PayFi altcoin that is still in its presale; Sui, a high-performance blockchain; and Pepe, a meme token that has generated a lot of buzz. Over $8 million has been generated in the Remittix presale, which is expected to grow by 100x . This just might be the best investment you could make with your $1,000. Pepe: The Meme Coin with Community Power Pepe and other meme coins profit from community support and hype. Dogecoin or Shiba Inu rallies prove how quickly a meme coin can grow. Pepe is a favorite among investors who like high-risk, high-reward because of its community-driven business model. Many investors experienced amazing gains following its early 2024 spike. Nevertheless, meme coins are not very useful, therefore their popularity is usually short. Pepe has been having trouble keeping up lately, as trading volumes have decreased and fewer investors have joined the craze. Although some analysts believe Pepe can recover, meme coins are a risky investment due to their unpredictability. It’s only worth a look if you’re just having fun and don’t mind taking big risks. Sui: A Layer 1 Blockchain with Growth Potential Sui is a Layer 1 blockchain created to address difficulties with speed and scalability. Sui’s architecture prioritizes performance, unlike Ethereum or Bitcoin, which can become slowed down by expensive fees and delayed transactions. Its object-centric programming approach, which makes developing decentralized apps (dApps) easier, is why developers adore it. Recent collaborations and improvements have strengthened its standing as a significant participant in the blockchain market. According to the Sui crypto growth forecast, it will continue to grow steadily as long as developers and projects are drawn to it. However, other Layer 1 chains like Solana and Avalanche, pose a serious threat to Sui. It has potential for long-term investors, but don’t count on quick profits. Remittix: A Revolutionary PayFi Altcoin Ready to Surge Remittix might be the revolution you’ve been waiting for if you’re searching for something genuinely innovative. Remittix, a PayFi altcoin, blends the finest features of conventional and cryptocurrency payment methods. It enables users to send money straight to bank accounts throughout the globe and convert more than 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currency. This isn’t simply another cryptocurrency initiative; it’s a workable answer to actual payment problems. Here’s what makes Remittix’s growth potential stand out: Flat rates with no hidden costs: Remittix guarantees cost-effectiveness and transparency in contrast to more established technologies like SWIFT. Global accessibility: Local payment networks and blockchain integration enables smooth cryptocurrency-to-fiat transactions. Privacy-first strategy: This method offers unparalleled security and ease of use by allowing you to make payments without disclosing the source. With token prices as low as $0.0383, the presale has already raised over $8 million. Remittix’s growth potential is drawing in both institutional and individual investors thanks to its excellent early momentum. Invest Your $1,000 in Remittix Ready to make your move? Now is the moment to take action, whatever your investing style. If you’re considering risk-taking with Pepe, long-term with Sui, or forward-thinking with Remittix, there’s no better time to invest. The best option of the three is Remittix because of its practical utility, strong presale performance, and potential for exponential growth.

KYC Deadline Approaching As the Pi Network’s mainnet launch nears, the Know-Your-Customer (KYC) deadline is fast approaching. Pi Network’s developers have set January 31 as the final date for KYC verification, with hopes that no further extensions will be granted. This deadline comes after two previous delays, primarily since while over 13 million pioneers were verified, only 8 million had moved their coins to the mainnet. It is expected that the KYC process will close once at least 10 million users have transferred their coins. Three Key Conditions for Mainnet Launch KYC verification is one of three conditions that must be met before Pi Network can go live on the mainnet. The second condition is that the network needs at least 100 applications ready for the mainnet. Right now, there are about 80 apps available, so the team is working hard to add 20 more before the launch. Meanwhile, the third condition, which is related to external factors, has already been met, making it clear that the launch is moving forward. Pi Coin Price Movement Currently, Pi Coin is only listed on HTX and has seen some price movement as the KYC deadline approaches. Despite a 5% drop in the last 24 hours, Pi Coin’s price remains around $42.21, with a market cap of $2.86 billion. The price chart shows a pattern called a double bottom, which is often seen as a sign that the price could go up. If the mainnet launch goes as planned, Pi Coin could rise by 110%, reaching around $91.50. But, if the launch gets delayed again, the price might drop to $30, which was the lowest price in September.",News,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-27 12:08:21

This decision helps the company raise more money to buy Bitcoin, proving its dedication to its Bitcoin strategy. MicroStrategy plans to raise $42 billion by selling more shares , thanks to the new approval from shareholders. The company is also preparing to redeem $1.05 billion in senior notes in February 2025. This move reduces its financial risks, giving it more room to focus on Bitcoin without added pressure. The company will release its fourth-quarter earnings on February 5, 2025. After that, it will host a live webinar to discuss financial results and future plans. However, MicroStrategy might have to pay federal tax on its unrealized Bitcoin gains , based on the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. If enforced, the company could owe taxes on its $19.3 billion in unrealized profits, possibly forcing it to sell some Bitcoin. Crypto Market Today The global cryptocurrency market saw a sharp decline, shedding 5.37% in value hitting market cap of $3.42 trillion. Bitcoin (BTC) led the crypto crash , pulling down major altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP, along with several memecoins. The downtrend was partly driven by the buzz around China’s AI app DeepSeek. At Press time, Bitcoin is trading at $99K with 5% loss. The price drop caused a wave of liquidations in the crypto market, leading to $860.55 million in total liquidations over the last 24 hours, with nearly $260 million coming from Bitcoin, as reported by CoinGlass.",News|Bitcoin|Fintech Company,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|ETH|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-27 12:10:41

How far can they fall, and where might be the best support levels to buy a possible bounce? Buying small cap altcoins like trying to catch a falling knife Holding altcoins is not an enjoyable experience right now. Some are already reaching a more than 10% loss, and this is still in early trading on Monday. Investors are going to wonder what hit them, and a snowball selling effect could start to happen. As far as buying goes, if it’s any of the smaller market cap altcoins, this would be tantamount to trying to catch a falling knife. One would arguably be better off waiting for the U.S. Stock market to open later on Monday, and seeing how this is likely to affect crypto going forward. Has the altcoin market cap hit a good enough support? Source: TradingView Looking at the Total3 chart, which tracks the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies, excluding $BTC and $ETH, it can be seen that the price dropped out of the small triangle, and reentered the much larger wedge pattern. Currently holding on to horizontal support at $973 billion, either a bounce will occur here, or possibly at the bottom of the wedge. $ETH inverse head and shoulders pattern Source: TradingView For buying the altcoins, the large caps are going to be the safest, and with $ETH already reaching the major $3000 horizontal support, this could be a good area to start buying. An inverse head and shoulders pattern could also be about to play out, potentially taking the price back to just under $4,000. If the downside onslaught does continue, the next strong horizontal support is at $2,700. Could $SOL hit $183? Source: TradingView Solana $SOL is the next large cap where possibilities beckon. Taking the measured move out of the triangle would send the price exactly down to the deepest support on the chart above, at $183. That’s not to say that the price will get down there, but depending on how badly the U.S. stock market reacts when it opens, depends on whether $183 could actually be a possibility. $SUI plunge could provide excellent entry points Source: TradingView Finally, we consider the price of $SUI. Although this is not in the league of $ETH or $SOL, it is probably now a large cap altcoin, and it has seen some fantastic growth over recent months. As can be seen in the daily chart above, the price has come down to make a beautiful test of the 0.382 Fibonacci. If the stock market does put in a really bad day on Monday, there is the possibility that $SUI could come down to the 0.5 Fibonacci at $2.92, or even the 0.618 Fibonacci at $2.34. The latter could be an excellent entry level. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

How much further can they decline, and where are the most promising support levels to consider buying for a potential rebound? Buying Small Cap Altcoins: A Risky Endeavor Holding onto altcoins right now feels like a challenging ordeal. Some have already suffered losses exceeding 10%, and that's just in the early hours of Monday trading. Investors might be caught off guard, sparking a chain reaction of selling. When it comes to purchasing, going for smaller market cap altcoins feels like trying to catch a knife mid-fall. It might be wiser to wait for the U.S. stock market to open later on Monday to gauge its impact on cryptocurrencies moving forward. Is the Altcoin Market Cap at a Strong Support Level? Source: TradingView Examining the Total3 chart, which shows the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies, excluding $BTC and $ETH, reveals that the price has slipped out of a small triangle and reentered a larger wedge pattern. It's currently holding onto horizontal support at $973 billion, and a bounce might occur here or possibly at the bottom of the wedge. $ETH's Potential Inverse Head and Shoulders Formation Source: TradingView For those considering altcoin purchases, large caps offer more security, and with $ETH having reached the significant $3000 horizontal support, this might be an attractive entry point. An inverse head and shoulders pattern could be forming, which might elevate the price to just below $4,000. Should the decline persist, the next strong support lies at $2,700. Will $SOL Reach $183? Source: TradingView Next up is Solana $SOL, another large cap with potential opportunities. If we consider the measured move from the triangle, it could drive the price down to the deepest support level shown above, at $183. While it's uncertain if the price will fall that low, the reaction of the U.S. stock market upon opening might make $183 a potential target. $SUI Drop Might Offer Great Buying Opportunities Source: TradingView Lastly, we evaluate the price of $SUI. While not as prominent as $ETH or $SOL, $SUI is likely now a large cap altcoin and has experienced substantial growth in recent months. As shown in the daily chart above, the price has successfully tested the 0.382 Fibonacci level. If the stock market has a particularly bad day on Monday, $SUI might drop to the 0.5 Fibonacci at $2.92, or even the 0.618 Fibonacci at $2.34. The latter could represent an excellent buying opportunity. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This Utility Altcoin Could Beat Binance Coin (BNB) and XRP in 2025",https://nulltx.com/600000-roi-potential-this-utility-altcoin-could-beat-binance-coin-bnb-and-xrp-in-2025/,"The crypto market is now considered synonymous with transformative growth and high returns. With ever more investments making their way into the crypto space and a growing crush of competitors, finding the next token set to experience exponential growth is essential. Binance Coin (BNB) and Ripple’s XRP have become industry leaders, with some of the best use cases and mind-blowing returns over time. However, the emerging utility altcoin, DTX Exchange (DTX) , is showing great promise. In 2025, DTX could reshape the industry and easily outperform giants like Binance coin and XRP with a 600,000% ROI on the horizon. DTX Exchange (DTX): The Next Generation of Utility Altcoins DTX Token, a utility coin used to solve current digital asset trading problems, resides at the heart of the DTX Exchange. The hybrid platform, DTX Exchange (DTX) , coupled with traditional and decentralized finance (TradFi and DeFi), brings together over 120,000 asset classes at your immediate reach. DTX Token’s transformational emergence as a force in the blockchain space is being cultivated due to its proprietary blockchain infrastructure and an emphasis on accessibility, transparency, and security. Already, investors are flocked to presale stages that have exceeded $13 million, already favoring the fundamentals of the market. DTX Exchange is offering the DTX token in presale at $0.16 apiece. In the eighth and final stage, this is your last chance to buy into one of the most lucrative projects in the market. Since the DTX Exchange is a direct competitor to Binance and CoinBase, its room for growth is immense, with analysts projecting the DTX token could experience a 600,000% ROI post launch similar to the BNB price increase. Binance Coin: BNB Prices Stagnate Amid Strong Market Binance Coin (BNB) is one of the most versatile cryptocurrencies out there; it’s the utility token of the Binance exchange. BNB was launched back in 2017 and has since gone well beyond eliminating trading fees — it’s become a key component of the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Since then, the BNB price has increased nearly 600,000%, highlighting that such a rally is possible. As of now, the Binance coin has faced acceptance and adaptation, and a current BNB price of roughly $689.94 has been able to maintain strong resistance. Its hailed as one of the most stable cryptos, with BNB prices rarely fluctuating near the $700 resistance level. The Binance coin fuels over a thousand of dApps and DeFi protocols making BNB’s price market relevant. However, as Binance coin is very strong, BNB prices may not have much growth potential with newer projects like DTX Exchange being potential contenders. Potential Ripple ETF and Futures Bring Up XRP Price Ripple’s XRP is a major contender for faster and cheaper cross border payments. XRP is used by various banks and financial institutions to perform near-instant transactions, which makes it very much an in demand solution for international money transfer. Though strong on fundamentals and increasingly institutional, XRP prices have not had a smooth ride thus far, mainly thanks to its legal tussles with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). However, since the recent legal victories, XRP prices have increased nearly 7x, bringing Ripple near ATH territory. With the current XRP price of $3.14, Ripple was one of the biggest winners in January, rising 45% on the monthly charts. Good news came in the form of a potential XRP ETF, and Futures have led to an increase in market sentiment and XRP’s price. Analysts are optimistic about Ripple, with many claiming XRP prices could challenge the previous ATH of $3.84 hit back in 2018. Key Takeaways With XRP prices rising, the whole market is optimistic for up-and-coming projects. With a robust platform, visionary roadmap, and possibility of industry disruption, the DTX token could mirror the 600,000% BNB price trajectory. The potential to reap profits from DTX Token’s unparalleled growth rate makes it a must-have in any portfolio!

Yeti Ouro Gains Traction In Play-To-Earn Market,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/yeti-ouro-gains-traction-in-play-to-earn-market/,"The post Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction: Will XRP Surge? Yeti Ouro Gains Traction In Play-To-Earn Market appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto space is abuzz with talk of XRP and the new hot thing, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) . XRP has established itself as a major player in the crypto space. Yeti Ouro is getting attention for its unique take on combining cryptocurrency with Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming. Undoubtedly, it will continue to reshape new innovative gaming experiences with their Yeti Go game. XRP News: What’s Next? As of January 25, 2025, XRP price is at $3.12 on Coinmarketcap, which is 2.94% down over the past 7 days, but as shown in the chart below, XRP price is still fairly stable. However, when we look at XRP’s performance over the past 30 days, the token is actually up over 45%, which shows that it’s still growing. In regards to price predictions, experts predict XRP price to reach $4.44 in 3 months, but only time will tell if this price point is met. Yeti Ouro: A New Crypto Opportunity? As XRP moves forward, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) is emerging as a new project with big growth. This Ethereum-based token is a mix of meme coin culture and real-world utility, especially with its gaming integration. Combining market potential, utility, and creativity Yeti Ouro is preparing investors for their next big move. Comprehensive security measures taken by the team, having been audited by SolidProof further enhances trust and engagement, positioning YETIO as a market leader. Yeti Go: Play-to-Earn Gaming Yeti Ouro’s flagship product is Yeti Go, a fast paced racing game built on Unreal Engine 5. In this game players compete in elimination style races, navigate hazards and use power-ups to beat opponents. Players earn YETIO tokens by winning races, completing challenges and participating in special events. The game’s immersive design and seamless cryptocurrency rewards make it a standout in the P2E gaming space. Here is a glimpse into the level 1 map of the game. Yeti Ouro’s Deflationary Tokenomics Yeti Ouro has a deflationary token model to drive long term value. Here are the key features: Capped Supply: 1 billion YETIO tokens in total, inherent scarcity. Burn Mechanism: 5% burn on every transaction, supply reduces over time, value increases as demand grows. Utility: YETIO tokens are the in-game currency, players can buy items, join races and earn rewards. This tokenomics is stable and long term growth for both players and investors. Additionally, the presale is currently ongoing with the YETIO token on sale for $0.017 with a 10% bonus for new investors. Over 141,000,000 tokens sold out already in presale, shows strong investor confidence. Why Yeti Ouro Is A Good Pick For 2025 Actual Utility: Unlike many tokens that are just hype, Yeti Ouro has real use with the Yeti Go game. The game creates ongoing demand for the tokens so value is sustained beyond speculation. Deflationary Mechanics: Capped supply and token burn creates scarcity which can drive price up as adoption grows. Community Building: Yeti Ouro’s focus on building a loyal community through transparency and rewards creates trust and long term interest in the project. Market Timing: As P2E gaming is taking off globally and blockchain adoption is growing, Yeti Ouro is in the right place at the right time. Investing in YETIO would be a unique opportunity for those who look forward to substantial returns from this revolutionary token. XRP Vs Yeti Ouro Both XRP and Yeti Ouro have their strengths but their growth paths are very different: XRP: XRP is an option for institutional investors and financial systems for cross border payments. But its growth is tied to external factors like regulatory developments which may limit its upside. Yeti Ouro: With gaming and deflationary token model, Yeti Ouro has more room for exponential growth. It’s an option for both gamers and investors so it’s a more dynamic and future oriented investment. Conclusion XRP is still in the market but its price prediction is for steady growth not explosive. For investors looking for big returns and exposure to emerging trends, Yeti Ouro is the altcoin to watch out for. With the Yeti Go game, deflationary tokenomics and successful presale phases, Yeti Ouro presents an intriguing investment chance for those wishing to undertake strategic investments with significant returns.

Here’s why experts predict the astonishing growth to continue in 2025, as Rollblock continues to ship Web3 innovation to an enormous sector sorely in need of disruption. Rollblock (RBLK) Set To Dominate In 2025 2025 looks to be a breakout year for the Rollblock ( RBLK ) gaming platform as it builds on the phenomenal growth it witnessed during the end of 2024. In December alone, new users of the Rollblock platform surged by over 600% , as more than $1.75 million of wagered bids were placed in just one month. Rollblock brings new levels of transparency to the gaming space by anonymously securing each and every transaction onto the Ethereum blockchain. This gives its users the power to verify that everything is fully above board and that no underhand manipulation has occurred. This is in stark contrast to the majority of traditional gaming platforms and will be enough to secure a huge chunk of the $500 billion online gaming market for Rollblock this year. Rollblock Gamers Spoiled For Choice The Rollblock offering is truly comprehensive and features more than 7,000 classic games, from Monopoly to slot machines, and many new exclusives created by industry leaders. Competitive PVP modes add to the excitement, as does a popular live gaming mode that has fostered an incredibly vibrant community. Fiat Onboarding Now Live Rollblock recently made it even easier to get involved, thanks to its recently announced partnership with Google Pay, Apple Pay, and Mastercard. This enables gamers to deposit in the currency of their choice and seamlessly convert their account balances to RBLK. The Rollblock (RBLK) token continues to pull in tens of thousands of new investors as more than 90% of its stage nine presale tokens have now sold out. This token has tokenomics on its side, as its supply will never exceed 1 billion tokens and will actually trend lower over time as Rollblock gains dominance over the market. Revenue Sharing Will Benefit The RBLK Community This is thanks to Rollblock’s unique revenue-sharing scheme that takes up to 30% of the platform’s profits to reinvest in buying up masses of RBLK tokens each week. Of these purchases, 60% are burned from the supply while the remaining 40% end up back in the hands of die hard Rollblock holders through staking rewards. Some of the best APY in all of crypto is available to Rollblock stakers, who can double down on their holdings by earning up to 30% on their bags. According to the basic laws of supply and demand, a falling supply and exponentially rising demand will see RBLK rally significantly over the coming months. Rollblock Price Action Is Just Getting Started Many experts are incredibly bullish on Rollblock’s prospects this year and predict a coming supply squeeze that could send its token price up to 50x from its current level of $0.052. This price will inevitably rise again in the days to come, as demand for stage ten tokens has been intense lately. A rise to $1 is not out of the question, as Rollblock’s potential is sky high right now – golden opportunities like this don’t come along very often in crypto.

Ethereum Sees Highest Surge in Network Growth Since October 2022,https://cryptopotato.com/bullish-signal-ethereum-sees-highest-surge-in-network-growth-since-october-2022/,"Despite the negative sentiment surrounding Ethereum in recent months, the crypto network has just recorded significant growth, the kind that has not been seen in more than two years. According to an analysis by the market intelligence platform Santiment, between January 24 and 25, Ethereum witnessed a significant surge in network growth, the highest since October 8, 2022. ETH Wallet Creation Soars Before the weekend ended, Ethereum users created 206,290 new addresses. Santiment noted that this increase in daily wallet creation came amid mild price concerns within the crypto industry. Additionally, sentiment among ether (ETH) investors has been extremely negative, especially as other altcoins have outperformed the second-largest cryptocurrency. Last week, CryptoPotato reported that the market cap of other assets like Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) had grown by double digits monthly, while ETH was in the red, with a 4.7% decline. Ethereum has also performed poorly compared to Bitcoin. While crypto analysts expect a potential bullish reversal in the coming weeks, investors insist that ETH has fallen short of expectations in this bull cycle. Moreover, social media discussions among the Ethereum community have revealed concerns about the network’s decentralization, regulatory compliance issues, and co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s periodic sales of ETH. Bullish Signal? Since investor sentiment surrounding the Ethereum network has been predominantly negative, the uptick in wallet creation is surprising. However, Santiment mentioned that the increase in addresses is not the only positive occurrence on the network. Ethereum is seeing a rise in decentralized finance (DeFi) and staking options, and this has fortified its position as a leader in total non-empty addresses for the crypto sector. A few days back, the Ethereum Foundation (EF), a non-profit organization supporting the blockchain, launched a multisig wallet to participate in the DeFi ecosystem. This move aims to foster the EF’s transparency, particularly in its treasury management. Meanwhile, there has been a significant rise in Ethereum’s open interest, so much so that the metric hit a new all-time high. Open interest tracks active futures contracts across exchanges and reflects high trader activity, with more long positions being opened. With Ethereum’s open interest rising to record levels, the asset could breakout and witness a rally that would push it past the $3,000-$4,000 range. The post Bullish Signal?

MSTU's extreme volatility, with an implied volatility of 180% and an ATR of 19%, makes it suitable only for short-term trading. MSTU has outperformed during Bitcoin bull runs but underperformed during bearish phases, emphasizing the importance of timing in leveraged funds. I recommend MSTU as a speculative Buy during bullish Bitcoin phases, but caution against its high volatility and unsuitability for long-term holding. Bitcoin’s relentless ascent since November has brought sharper focus into not only the various funds that give investors exposure to Bitcoin itself, but also the derivatives of the OG alt-coin. Perhaps no derivative has been more talked about than MicroStrategy (MSTR), the company that has made it a mission to own as many Bitcoin as possible. The company owns more than 460k Bitcoins, making it by far the largest single corporate owner of Bitcoin. That means its tiny software business is completely irrelevant, and its stock therefore moves more-or-less in tandem with Bitcoin. That fact has led to funds that track MSTR on a leveraged basis, such as today’s topic, the T-Rex 2X Long MSTR Daily Target ETF (MSTU). This fund does exactly what it sounds like; it’s a 2X leveraged long fund on shares of MSTR. Any leveraged fund carries with it enormous risk, and we’ll cover those below. But if you’re bullish on Bitcoin, it’s difficult not to be bullish on MSTU. What is MSTU? This fund attempts to gain 2X daily exposure to MSTR shares, so theoretically it should move exactly 2X in percentage terms what MSTR does on any particular day. It’s not quite that simple in reality, but that’s essentially what you’re getting. Of course, with any leveraged fund there is tracking error. Leveraged funds are not intended to be buy-and-hold vehicles because of this tracking error. If you decide to own MSTU or any other leveraged fund, it’s best used in small doses and for shorter time frames. Leverage means potential returns are greater, but so is the risk. We’ll come on to that in a bit, but let’s first take a look at how MSTU generates its leverage. Seeking Alpha It owns a lot of MSTR shares, but also a bunch of call options. We can see these are extremely short-dated options, with all of them expiring within eight days of the as-of date of this holdings list. Options are a great way to generate leverage, but at significant cost as options decay over time, and particularly if their expiry is near, like the ones on this list. With any ETF, you should know what the fund actually owns and not just take whatever the stated goal of the fund is at face value. If you consider that Bitcoin is essentially a play on risk-on behavior in financial markets, MSTR is a leveraged version of Bitcoin, and MSTU is a leveraged version of MSTR, you’re dealing with a lot of layers of risk. And one thing we can probably all agree on is that risk in MSTU is very high. If that kind of thing suits you, it can be a great trading vehicle. If it doesn’t, you should move on to something else. Speaking of risk, let’s dig in a bit there to quantify what we’re dealing with. Below is the volatility skew for MSTU options that are expiring near the end of February, so right at one month out from today. optioncharts.io The implied volatility of MSTU’s is about 180% right now, and it changes everyday so it can be higher or lower. For reference, the S&P 500’s implied volatility is roughly 13%, so we’re looking at volatility that is something like 14X that of the S&P 500. This is one of the most volatile securities I’ve come across, which can be great for trading opportunities if you’re right, but please consider the fact that you could be wrong. Seen another way, MSTU’s average true range on a 14-day basis is pretty incredible. Right now, its ATR is 1.989 as we can see below. StockCharts With a share price of $10.45 as of Friday’s close, that implies MSTU’s average daily range is 19% of its share price. While ATR also changes over time and fluctuates day-to-day, this gives us another idea as to just how volatile this thing is. If you’re not comfortable with the value of your MSTU holdings moving around 19% each day, it’s not for you. Bitcoin still looking bullish Now that we have the risks out of the way, let’s take a look at why you may want to consider MSTU. We’ll start with a chart of MSTU, but I’d argue it’s more important we focus on MSTR (the underlying stock for this fund), and Bitcoin itself. StockCharts The MSTU chart is limited because it’s only existed for a few months. For what it’s worth, we can see some of the extreme moves this thing makes day-to-day, with Friday being a good example as it fell more than 10%. That kind of move is pretty normal for MSTU, as incredible as that sounds. Now, if you’re interested in MSTU, it’s probably because you’re bullish on MSTR. Let’s take a look at how MSTU has performed relative to MSTR to get an idea of the difference of owning the two. StockCharts During the massive bull run MSTR had that culminated in the post-election top, MSTU outperformed by 184%. Remember this is just outperformance ; it went up on an absolute basis much more than that. The flip side is that during the period since then, MSTU has underperformed by 46% or so. This is the trouble with leveraged funds; any significant drawdowns are extremely costly. I’d say MSTU executed on its 2X leverage goal pretty well during these periods based on this data, for what it’s worth. Now, continuing our discussion from above, MSTR is essentially a leveraged play on Bitcoin, and MSTU is a leveraged play on MSTR. So how does MSTU perform against Bitcoin itself? StockCharts During the bull run into November, MSTU outperformed Bitcoin by 530% . Part of that was because MSTR massively outperformed Bitcoin, and then MSTU doubled that outperformance (more or less). MSTU during this bearish phase has underperformed Bitcoin by 64%, however, giving back nearly all of the prior outperformance. This is why timing is incredibly important when it comes to using leveraged funds. If I take all of this into account, it is my view MSTU does a nice job of double leverage on MSTR. It also does a good job of tracking the relative price movements of Bitcoin, outperforming when it should, and underperforming when it should. You can use that however you will, but I’d argue MSTU is executing well on its stated goal. Let’s finish up by focusing on MSTR itself, and of course, Bitcoin. StockCharts MSTR is consolidating since the November peak, and one could argue this is a bull flag, which I’ve drawn in with dotted blue lines. We’ll see if that ends up being the case, but if I ignore everything and just look at this chart, I can’t help but be bullish until proven otherwise. The flag pattern is about to complete one way or the other; the direction it breaks will likely show us the way in terms of the next really big move on the stock. The bulls have the rising RSI and PPO on their side just as the flag nears completion, and given this pattern itself is a bullish consolidation pattern, I’m inclined to remain bullish unless proven otherwise. What would make me lose faith in this pattern? Closing below the flag pattern is a big red negative, and trading below the early-January low of ~$300 means we’re probably starting another bearish phase. With all of this discussion predicated upon Bitcoin, it would be irresponsible to neglect that chart, so let’s take a look. StockCharts Bitcoin has been consolidating since November, and I’ve drawn in the rectangle that contains nearly all of the trading since then. Again, this is a bullish consolidation. Rectangles that form after strong uptrends are bullish pauses, so unless this pattern resolves below ~$90k, I have no reason to think Bitcoin’s rally is done. We have a bullish PPO that shows momentum in positive territory and rising. The RSI is more neutral as it’s spent the past month or so bouncing between 40 and 60. One clue that we have something more on our hands is a sustained move over 60. We don’t have that yet. Wrapping up My feelings on MSTU have to be derived from Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin is a play on risk-on sentiment in financial markets, MSTR is a leveraged play on that, and MSTU is leveraged on MSTR. You end up with a fund that is 14X more volatile than the S&P 500, and extreme leverage to the price of Bitcoin. I like Bitcoin unless its pattern resolves lower, and I’m happy to change my stance if and when that occurs. For now, I like Bitcoin, which means I have to like MSTR, and by extension, MSTU. Let me be extremely clear one more time; MSTU is unbelievably volatile and is not suitable for everyone. It’s probably not even suitable for a sizable portion of your portfolio, but that’s a choice each person must make for themselves. For me, I like MSTU during bullish phases for Bitcoin, and if we get a breakout in Bitcoin above its rectangle consolidation, the returns in MSTU could be absolutely explosive. For that reason, I like MSTU as a trading vehicle, and I'm initiating with a speculative Buy rating with the caveats noted above.",MSTU,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|TOKEN SALE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-27 13:30:00

Executives from leading Ethereum Layer 2 networks, including Base and Optimism, outlined plans to improve Ethereum’s security and unification through ”based” and ”native” rollups. Meanwhile, a prominent Ethereum-based whale, “marketparticipant.eth,” executed a $4.9 million PEPE token sell-off, marking the culmination of a carefully planned 10-month accumulation strategy. Ethereum Layer 2s Unite: Executives Champion “Based” and “Native” Rollups for Enhanced Security and Decentralization Executives from leading Ethereum Layer 2 networks are rallying behind a shared vision to unify Ethereum by implementing “based” and “native” rollups. The proposed rollups, which aim to bolster security and reduce fragmentation, mark a significant shift in Ethereum’s approach to scaling and decentralization. During a Jan. 25 call with Ethereum founders and developers, Jesse Pollak , the head of Base—a prominent Ethereum Layer 2—emphasized the transformative potential of based rollups. Pollak described them as “a flexible and powerful tool” that would enable Base to deepen its integration with Ethereum and enhance its security guarantees. Ben Jones, Director of the Optimism Foundation, echoed Pollak’s sentiments, bringing attention to the urgency of the initiative. “I want to just reemphasize we are here to support this; it is wartime,” Jones declared, emphasizing the critical need for collaboration between Ethereum’s base layer and Layer 2 solutions. Currently, Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base rely on centralized sequencers to process and order transactions. While this approach has enabled high-speed processing and significant revenue generation, it has also introduced a level of centralization that undermines Ethereum’s core principle of decentralization. Based rollups, a concept introduced by Ethereum core developer Justin Drake in March 2023, propose returning transaction sequencing to Ethereum’s base layer. This shift would decentralize the block-building process, allowing all Ethereum validators to participate instead of relying on a single centralized sequencer. The implications of this change are profound. Decentralized sequencing would enhance network security, reduce reliance on centralized entities, and strengthen Ethereum’s foundation as a trustless blockchain. However, it would come with a trade-off: transaction confirmations would take 12 seconds on the base layer, compared to the near-instant confirmations currently offered by many Layer 2 networks. In addition to based rollups, Ethereum executives are advocating for native rollups, which focus on optimizing how transactions are executed on the base layer. Native rollups would enhance composability across the Ethereum ecosystem, ensuring seamless interactions between different Layer 2 networks and the base layer. This advancement would address one of Ethereum’s longstanding challenges: interoperability. Daniel Wang, CEO of Taiko, a Layer 2 network that has already implemented based rollups, highlighted the importance of interoperability during the call. “We’ve been waiting for the FABRIC standards so we can work together and provide a full solution,” Wang said, referencing a new infrastructure standard designed to support based rollups. Transitioning to based and native rollups would require Layer 2 networks to forgo a significant portion of the revenue they currently generate through centralized sequencers. For example, Arbitrum has earned $210 million from its centralized sequencer, while Base has brought in $96.2 million, according to data from Dune Analytics. Much of this revenue comes from Maximum Extractable Value (MEV), the additional profit block producers earn by rearranging, including, or excluding transactions. Despite these potential revenue losses, executives argue that the long-term benefits of decentralization outweigh the short-term financial impact. By returning revenue to Ethereum’s base layer, the proposed rollups could enhance the value of Ether (ETH), potentially boosting its price. Additionally, decentralized sequencing and improved composability would attract more developers and users to the Ethereum ecosystem, driving further growth. FABRIC: The Infrastructure for Collaboration To facilitate the adoption of based rollups, Ethereum developers are working on FABRIC, an infrastructure standard that would enable seamless integration across Layer 2 networks. The FABRIC initiative aims to address Ethereum’s interoperability challenges and create a unified framework for collaboration. Pollak and Jones have expressed strong support for FABRIC, viewing it as a critical step toward achieving Ethereum’s vision of a decentralized and secure blockchain. Wang also affirmed Taiko’s readiness to adopt the standard, signaling a broader alignment among Ethereum Layer 2 networks. The push for based and native rollups represents a pivotal moment for Ethereum. As Layer 2 networks work to implement these solutions, they are not only addressing the immediate challenges of scalability and security but also laying the groundwork for a more unified and decentralized Ethereum ecosystem. However, the transition will require careful coordination, significant technological advancements, and a willingness to embrace financial trade-offs. The success of these efforts will depend on the collective commitment of Ethereum developers, Layer 2 networks, and the broader community. As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve, the adoption of based and native rollups could redefine its architecture, ensuring that it remains a robust and decentralized platform capable of supporting the next generation of decentralized applications and users. Ethereum Whale “Marketparticipant.eth” Takes Profits on $4.9M PEPE Tokens In other news, an Ethereum -based whale known as “marketparticipant.eth” made a bold decision to take profits on their substantial investment in PEPE tokens. The blockchain analytics platform Onchain Lens tracked the transaction, revealing that 325.48 billion PEPE tokens—valued at approximately $4.9 million—were transferred to Binance in a single transaction. This calculated exit has sparked discussions about whale behavior in the meme coin market and what it might signal for smaller investors. This wasn’t a spur-of-the-moment decision. The transaction marks the culmination of a 10-month-long accumulation strategy. Beginning in April 2024, “marketparticipant.eth” started acquiring PEPE tokens during market dips, showcasing a disciplined approach to capitalizing on the highly volatile meme coin market. Blockchain records suggest that the whale’s average purchase price was around $0.000007 per token. Fast forward to today, and the value of those same tokens nearly doubled to $0.000015—a 214% gain. The timing of the transaction appears deliberate. Recent weeks have seen a growing trend among large holders of meme coins like PEPE to lock in gains. While the broader crypto market has remained relatively stable, whales like “marketparticipant.eth” seem unwilling to risk potential price declines, opting instead to cash out while prices hover near their recent highs. By transferring the PEPE tokens to Binance, the whale has made their intentions clear: turning digital assets into fiat or stablecoins. Binance, as the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, is a natural choice for liquidating large holdings quickly and securely. Interestingly, the PEPE market has so far taken this move in stride. Despite the significant size of the transaction, there has been no immediate price shock. Smaller investors and market watchers are keeping a close eye on developments. Whale movements often foreshadow short-term turbulence, as their actions can influence market sentiment and liquidity. For now, the lack of a major price dip may provide some reassurance, but the situation remains fluid. What makes this story even more intriguing is the background of “marketparticipant.eth.” Blockchain data reveals that this entity had no history of major transactions before diving into PEPE. Their decision to allocate significant resources to the meme coin market and their disciplined strategy during accumulation showcase a high-risk, high-reward approach that paid off handsomely. This move not only shows the profitability of meme coins for savvy investors but also the growing maturity of the meme coin market, where even whales are adopting more calculated strategies. What Does This Mean for PEPE and Meme Coins? The whale’s exit raises questions about the future of PEPE and the broader meme coin market. As one of the top meme coins by market capitalization, PEPE has enjoyed substantial attention from both retail and institutional investors. However, the recent trend of large holders locking in gains could signal caution ahead. While the market remains relatively stable for now, sustained profit-taking by whales could dampen buying momentum and create downward pressure on prices. For smaller investors, the key takeaway is to remain vigilant. Whale behavior often serves as an early indicator of market trends, and their actions can influence short-term price movements. The actions of “marketparticipant.eth” highlight the intricate dynamics of the cryptocurrency market, where even meme coins have become a playing field for strategic investment.

It operates as a decentralized platform where global currencies are traded, offering opportunities for individuals, corporations, and institutions to profit from price fluctuations in currency exchange rates. If you’re new to FX forex trading or looking to enhance your understanding, this comprehensive guide covers everything from currency pairs to trading strategies and essential tips for success. What Is FX Forex Trading? FX forex trading involves buying and selling currency pairs to profit from changes in their exchange rates. Unlike stock markets, the forex market operates 24 hours a day, five days a week, making it accessible to traders across the globe. Why Is Forex Trading Popular? High Liquidity : Trade execution is seamless, even for large positions. Leverage : Allows traders to control larger positions with smaller capital. Accessibility : Open to retail traders, institutional investors, and corporations alike. Diverse Opportunities : The forex market offers hundreds of currency pairs, including majors, minors, and exotics. How FX Forex Trading Works Forex trading takes place in currency pairs, where one currency is exchanged for another. The value of a currency is determined by its exchange rate relative to another currency. Currency Pair Structure Base Currency : The first currency in the pair (e.g., EUR in EUR/USD). Quote Currency : The second currency in the pair (e.g., USD in EUR/USD). Example: In the EUR/USD pair, 1 EUR might be equal to 1.10 USD.

Minor Pairs Pairs that do not include the USD but involve other major currencies. Examples: EUR/GBP, AUD/NZD, CAD/CHF. Exotic Pairs Combine a major currency with one from an emerging market. Examples: USD/TRY, EUR/ZAR, GBP/SGD. Key Participants in the FX Forex Market Central Banks Influence currency values through monetary policies and interventions.

Day Trading Positions are opened and closed within the same day, avoiding overnight risks. Timeframe: Minutes to hours.

Risks of FX Forex Trading Leverage Risks While leverage amplifies gains, it also magnifies losses, making risk management essential. Volatility Sudden market movements can lead to significant losses, especially during geopolitical or economic events. Unregulated Brokers Working with unregulated brokers increases the risk of fraud. Always choose reputable and regulated platforms. Emotional Trading Fear and greed often lead to poor decision-making, emphasizing the need for discipline.

Choose a Broker Select a broker that is regulated and offers competitive spreads, fast execution, and a reliable trading platform.

With its high liquidity, 24-hour access, and leverage options, it’s an exciting space for both beginners and experienced traders.

Some traders and investors believe this crash offers a fundamental opportunity to buy Bitcoin ( BTC ) or Altcoins as 2025 starts. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin lost 5.51%, trading at $98,910, while altcoins crashed by 7.71%. TradingView ’s Total Crypto Market Cap Excluding BTC Index (TOTAL2) marks $1.34 trillion, suffering slightly more than the leader. Bitcoin (BTC) price and Altcoins total market cap. Source: Finbold / TradingView Nevertheless, analysts eye an incoming altcoin season (or altseason) , according to indicators like Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D). As Finbold reported, different analysts are looking to BTC.D and fundamental aspects, including macroeconomics and the regulatory landscape in the United States, forecasting altcoins to soon outperform in gains. Interestingly, even Michael Saylor, formerly known for his “Bitcoin maximalist” stance is apparently shifting his narrative and strategy, calling for a “Crypto Renaissance,” instead of a “Bitcoin Renaissance” as he would usually do. This comes after Saylor admitted in an interview he was wrong about Ethereum (ETH), seeing value in its use case. On January 26, as the crash started, Binance ’s former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) urged investors to “stick with fundamental,” saying “time will be on your side.” Stick with fundamentals. Time will be on your side. A hot market may have many ""opportunities"" or ""quick returns."" But it is best to stick with fundamentals. — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) January 26, 2025 Grok AI picks between Bitcoin or Altcoins as the best buy for 2025 In this context, Finbold consulted with Grok 2, an artificial intelligence model developed by xAI that challenges the legacy web . Elon Musk’s AI considered all the information we shared above, plus real-time analysis on the web, including the X platform. After deeply analyzing both potential buys from an investment perspective, Grok concluded on whether Bitcoin or Altcoins would make a better purchase at this point. In summary, BTC could still be the better choice for conservative investors, in the AI’s output. This considering Bitcoin’s “established market position, liquidity, and perceived safety,” being less volatile than altcoin. On the other and, aggressive investors could benefit from “more lucrative opportunities” presented by altcoins. “The potential for significant gains, backed by innovation in blockchain technology, and regulatory shifts,” the AI said, “make altcoins appealing for those willing to accept higher risk.” Grok’s conclusion on “Bitcoin or Altcoins as a better buy for 2025.” Source: Finbold / xAI However, Michael Saylor’s apparent shift in narrative and the regulatory changes under Donald Trump, favor a “diversified approach,” Grok concluded. “Including both Bitcoin for stability and a selection of altcoins with strong fundamentals or innovative use cases could balance risk and reward.” Featured image from Shutterstock The post Bitcoin or Altcoins?

39569924,https://blog.kraken.com/?p=27248,1737985993,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/98/default.png,Making sense of crypto investing: A simple explanation of Kraken’s CF Benchmarks’ new factor model,https://blog.kraken.com/crypto-education/cf-benchmarks-new-factor-model,"Kraken’s CF Benchmarks (CFB) has introduced a comprehensive analysis framework to help investors better understand cryptocurrency portfolio construction, optimization and risk management. Why should you care about crypto factors? A familiar model that applies to a new asset class Investors have long relied on factor-based approaches in traditional markets to understand the underlying drivers of returns and manage risks. With growing interest in cryptocurrencies, CFB has adapted these methodologies for digital assets, providing a framework to analyze and navigate this emerging market. Debunking the myth of randomness A significant outcome of this research is the debunking of the myth that crypto returns follow a random walk – that they’re essentially random and therefore unpredictable. The study provides compelling evidence that cryptocurrency returns are influenced by a set of identifiable risk drivers – factors – comparable in significance to those used in traditional stock market models. Unique inputs for a unique asset class Cryptocurrencies lack traditional valuation metrics like cash flow or earnings, making it challenging to apply conventional investment approaches. Instead, CFB’s model incorporates unique crypto-specific data, such as onchain activity, to capture the realities of this asset class. Factors like value and growth, which leverage onchain data, emphasize crypto’s distinct characteristics and establish it as a standalone, full-fledged asset class. A practical framework for crypto investing The model enables investors to construct and optimize portfolios, manage risks effectively and explore opportunities for developing new financial products in the cryptocurrency market. What is a factor model, and why does it matter? A factor model identifies common traits (factors) that influence investment returns. These might include: Market Trends: How the overall crypto market performs Size: The total market capitalization of a given asset Value: Metrics like transaction fees compared to the asset’s total value locked Momentum: Whether a cryptocurrency’s price has been rising or falling recently Growth: Trends in usage or activity, such as growth in the number of active users Risk Sensitivity: How much an asset reacts to market downturns Liquidity: How easily the asset can be traded without big price changes By understanding these factors, investors can make smarter decisions and get a clearer picture of what drives crypto prices. How did CF Benchmarks create their model? Data collection: They used reliable data from crypto exchanges, blockchain networks and other sources. Their study focused on the top 50 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins like Tether) to ensure replicability. Analysis: They examined how different factors – like size, momentum, value etc. – affect crypto returns. Validation: The model was extensively back-tested, proving these factors carry risk premiums and help explain crypto price changes. Key takeaways from the research Crypto factors work: Factors like market, size, and value are just as useful for understanding crypto as they are for stocks and bonds, debunking the myth that digital assets follow a random walk. Crypto is a new and distinct asset class: The use of unique data like on-chain metrics highlights crypto’s position as a standalone asset class. Our factor model is a framework that yields practical benefits: This model supports portfolio construction and optimization, risk management, and the development of innovative financial products. Why this matters for investors Crypto markets can seem unpredictable, but CF Benchmarks’ factor model brings some order to the chaos. By borrowing proven methods from traditional finance and adapting them to crypto, this research gives investors a new way to approach digital assets with confidence and clarity. It’s a step toward making crypto investing a mainstream component of diversified investment portfolios and more accessible for everyone.

39569981,https://crypto.news/?p=14331128,1737986032,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/39569981.jpeg,3 reasons Bitcoin and altcoins are crashing,https://crypto.news/3-reasons-bitcoin-and-altcoins-are-crashing/,"Bitcoin and most altcoins plunged on Monday, continuing a downward trend that has persisted since Donald Trump’s inauguration. Bitcoin ( BTC ) fell to a low of $97,855, declining by about 10 percent from its high earlier this month. Other major laggards in the crypto industry included popular names such as Fartcoin, Raydium, Pepe, and Virtuals Protocol, which each dropped by over 20%. Many of these coins are trading significantly below their monthly highs. Fartcoin, a popular meme coin on the Solana ( SOL ) network, has dropped by 63% from its peak this month. Raydium, the largest decentralized exchange on Solana, has fallen by 20%, while Pepe has declined by nearly 40%. The first main reason for the crash is the fact that investors have embraced a risk-on sentiment following DeepSeek’s success. This also explains why major stock market indices like the Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100, and S&P 500 have fallen by over 2%. DeepSeek, a Chinese competitor to Anthropic’s Claude, ChatGPT, and xAI, was developed in less than four months and at a fraction of the cost. Its success has raised concerns about future demand for high-priced chips from companies like NVIDIA and AMD, as well as broader market valuations. Second, Bitcoin and altcoin prices have dropped as the market anticipates the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision. Economists expect the Fed to maintain a hawkish tone due to elevated inflation levels. A report earlier this month revealed that the headline Consumer Price Index rose from 2.7% in November to 2.9% in December. You might also like: Bank of America says Fed should stop rate cuts —How will crypto react to Trump 2.0? Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies often react negatively to a hawkish Federal Reserve stance, as it typically results in higher bond yields. Third, the declines are also being driven by anticipation of earnings reports from major technology companies, including Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Apple, and Tesla. Weak financial results from these firms could have a negative impact on both the stock and crypto markets. Bitcoin price chart pattern points to more downside Bitcoin price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Bitcoin’s price has formed a double-top chart pattern at $108,310, with the neckline at $90,000. A double-top is widely regarded as one of the most bearish patterns in technical analysis. On the positive side, Bitcoin remains above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, indicating that the overall bullish trend is still intact. However, the bearish outlook will persist as long as the price stays below the double-top level of $108,310.

Innovations in Ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem, like ”based” and ”native” rollups, could enhance decentralization and network unity, while Paradigm is advocating for faster protocol upgrades to address market demands. Meanwhile, Bitcoin dipped below $100,000 due to market turbulence driven by competition in the AI sector and Federal Reserve uncertainty. Ethereum's January Decline Sets Stage for Bullish February Ethereum (ETH) experienced a sharp decline in January by dropping close to 7% and diverging from the broader cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin. ETH started the year at a high of $3,400 but since fell to $3,049, according to CoinMarketCap. Ethereum’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Despite this lackluster start to the year, historical data offers a more bullish outlook for Ethereum in the coming months. February and March have traditionally been very strong periods for the altcoin. CoinGlass data reveals that ETH has only experienced one February decline in its history, back in 2018, after a 50% surge in January. Over the past six consecutive years, ETH posted gains in February, with its largest increase occurring in 2024 when it climbed 46% from $2,280 to $3,380. Similarly, March saw gains in seven of the past nine years. Market sentiment among Ethereum supporters is also still quite optimistic despite the current price drop. Engineer and analyst “ Wolf ” recently shared their confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential, and described it as the ”best asymmetrical bet” due to the strength of its historical chart performance. Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano also commented positively on recent changes in the Ethereum Foundation, and believes there will be a renewed sense of determination in the community. While January has been challenging for Ethereum, analysts believe the cryptocurrency is well-positioned to benefit from historically bullish trends in February and March. Based Rollups Could Transform Ethereum's Future Executives from leading Ethereum layer 2 networks, including Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum, are willing to improve Ethereum’s network unity by adopting “based” and “native” rollups. These innovations could boost security and reduce fragmentation across the ecosystem. Jesse Pollak, head of Base, pointed out the potential of based rollups during a Jan. 25 call with Ethereum founders and developers. He believes they can play an important role in creating a stronger connection to Ethereum while improving security guarantees. Optimism Foundation Director Ben Jones also voiced his support. Call with Ethereum founders and devs (Source: YouTube ) Based rollups were introduced by Ethereum core developer Justin Drake in 2023, and they shift the block-building process back to Ethereum’s base layer, decentralizing it by involving all Ethereum validators rather than relying on a single centralized sequencer. This change addresses concerns over centralization in existing layer 2 networks, which generated huge revenue through centralized sequencers. Although this transition could reduce layer 2 profits from Maximum Extractable Value, it will reallocate revenue to Ethereum’s base layer, which could potentially benefit ETH’s price. Native rollups are another proposed improvement, which would enhance transaction execution at the base layer, fostering better network composability. Despite the benefits, decentralized sequencing would extend transaction confirmation times to 12 seconds compared to the near-instant confirmations currently offered by layer 2 networks. Several executives also support adopting “FABRIC,” which is an infrastructure standard that is designed to facilitate based rollups. Taiko’s CEO Daniel Wang confirmed that his firm is ready to implement FABRIC to address interoperability issues. Taiko was the first layer 2 to adopt based rollups. Overall, Ethereum layer 2s are more than ready to enhance the network’s decentralization, composability, and unity, even at the expense of short-term revenue advantages. Paradigm Pushes for Faster Ethereum Protocol Upgrades Paradigm, a crypto venture capital firm, called for faster implementation of protocol changes in Ethereum to adapt to evolving market structures while still preserving the network’s core values. In a blog post that was published on Jan. 25, Paradigm argued that Ethereum’s development pace, historically averaging one major change per year, could accelerate without compromising its principles of decentralization, openness, and neutrality. The firm believes that Ethereum’s resources, including its talented researchers and engineers, are more than sufficient to support quicker and parallel development to solve problems efficiently and avoid unnecessary delays. Paradigm also pointed out the importance of prioritizing high-impact improvements, like allowing Ethereum layer 2 networks to inherit security directly from the base layer through native rollups. This aligns with the recent support from layer 2 executives, who are willing to adopt these solutions to improve security and reduce fragmentation. The firm also believes there is a need to scale Ethereum’s mainnet without modifying the block gas limit and called for improvements in wallet infrastructure to simplify user experiences, including eliminating the reliance on private keys. The venture capital firm also mentioned that client diversity should not hinder the pace of innovation and announced the development of the Reth Ethereum testnet to provide developers with an experimental platform for new ideas. Paradigm considers these protocol changes crucial to driving blockchain innovation and achieving Ethereum’s ambitious roadmap. The Ethereum Foundation itself recently committed resources to the ecosystem by allocating 50,000 ETH, which is valued at close to $160 million, to support the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. This happened after an announcement by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin that the nonprofit organization will undergo structural changes to provide more active support for developers and increase transparency in the community. Bitcoin Dips Below $100K Despite outperforming Ethereum throughout January so far, Bitcoin fell below $100,000 for the first time since President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20. This was likely due to market turbulence driven by competition in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector and shifting monetary policy expectations. Bitcoin’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Analysts largely attributed the decline in BTC’s price to the rapid rise of China-based AI app DeepSeek, which recently overtook ChatGPT to claim the top spot on Apple’s App Store rankings in the US. As a result, this caused fears of an escalating AI arms race. The success of DeepSeek sent shockwaves through various sectors, including technology and cryptocurrency. Nvidia , which is also a dominant player in the AI space, saw its valuation dip by 3.12% to $3.49 trillion by Jan. 24. In the crypto market, approximately $864 million in positions were liquidated, with Bitcoin long positions contributing $250 million, according to CoinGlass data . Market sentiment was dampened even more by expectations of a hawkish tone from the US Federal Reserve. With no rate cuts expected at its upcoming meeting on Jan. 28 and 29, traders have scrambled for downside protection. Analysts suggest the market is likely to remain range-bound until fresh policy signals emerge. Overall, the COO of Bitget Alvin Kan shared that investor caution intensified due to volatility in the US AI market and broader economic uncertainties. Despite the negative sentiment, Matrixport analysts presented a more bullish outlook due to the Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year celebrations across Asia, which are historically favorable times for Bitcoin. This festive season is known to create a statistically strong 20-day window for the cryptocurrency, which certainly could provide some hope for a potential rebound despite the current market challenges.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|FORKS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-27 13:56:16

These numbers represent individuals navigating life without the financial safety nets most depend on. Blockchain and Web3 technologies are creating pathways to bridge the gap between financial systems and unbanked or underbanked customers. Challenges in Accessing Traditional Banking Systems For many, gaining access to conventional banks is simply not feasible, even in nations like the US, where such issues might not be expected. Nearly 23% of those earning less than $25,000 annually are disconnected from financial services. Barriers are widespread globally, influenced by geographical, economic, and social factors. The need for extensive paperwork, high fees, and the requirement to visit physical branches serve as significant hurdles. Maintaining a bank account is often difficult due to minimum balance requirements or monthly fees that lower-income families might struggle to meet. Entire communities are without the necessary tools for financial security and stability. Additionally, the limited operating hours of many banks clash with the schedules of hourly workers, making access difficult or inconvenient. In developing countries or rural areas, unreliable infrastructure, lack of internet access, and distant branches exacerbate the situation, leaving many without essential services. Blockchain Solutions Offering New Opportunities There's immense potential in communities whose financial power remains untapped, with merchants losing out on connections with a large underserved market. Web3 technologies could revolutionize this, offering tools that enable the unbanked and underbanked to engage with financial systems. Blockchain platforms provide decentralized lending and payment options, along with verifiable credit histories. An example is the L1 blockchain Creditcoin , designed to reach the unbanked, focusing on emerging markets. It recently launched the Ecosystem Investment Program via Credit Labs, valued at $10 million. This initiative aims to foster innovation within the platform's network by offering equity investments between $25,000 and $250,000 to Web3 entrepreneurs, startups, businesses, and developers. The program targets projects that advance Web3 tech adoption, enhance financial access, improve decentralized payment and credit solutions, and apply Creditcoin's blockchain in real-world scenarios. Creditcoin also supports decentralized internet access through Spacecoin, delivering high-speed satellite connections to underserved areas. Greater access to credit promotes economic growth, enabling businesses to expand and create job opportunities. Leapfrogging to Advanced Solutions In many developing regions, the jump to mobile technology was due to limited funds for infrastructure. The high costs of upgrading and implementing outdated infrastructure led people to bypass traditional communication methods. This demonstrates that lower-income countries can skip older systems and directly adopt modern technology. For instance, landline use is minimal in countries like India, Ghana, and Nigeria, while mobile phone adoption is rapidly increasing . Blockchain technology, much like mobile tech, can fill the void left by outdated systems. Platforms such as Spectral and Centrifuge utilize this technology to track financial activities, creating transparent credit scores based on blockchain behavior. Decentralized platforms integrate alternative data sources, such as utility payments or mobile phone usage, to determine creditworthiness. DeFi loans, both collateralized and uncollateralized, present intriguing possibilities. The first type requires users to deposit assets exceeding the loan amount to manage default risks. Jellyverse's jAssets allows users to monitor the value of traditional assets, using crypto as collateral. TrueFi offers uncollateralized loans to reliable borrowers based on their credit and reputation. Community lending pools enable groups to support individuals, reducing default risks. Platforms like MakerDAO employ smart contracts to automate loan processes and collateral management. Digital platforms facilitate cross-border lending, making credit accessible to those underserved. Lenders and borrowers interact directly, with funds secured in smart contracts until conditions are fulfilled. Decentralized payment gateways such as Celo focus on smooth cross-border transactions using stablecoins. Web3 companies are also developing user-friendly interfaces for those less tech-savvy, including wallets with fiat on/off ramps for straightforward onboarding. By cutting out intermediaries, Web3 and DeFi platforms can offer lower transaction fees than traditional banks. Advantages for Blockchain Firms in Serving the Unbanked Naturally, Web3 and blockchain companies can benefit from catering to populations in developing nations, primarily through long-term profitability. Emerging economies are expected to grow faster than their developed counterparts, with purchasing power and financial activity rising swiftly. The IMF ranked countries based on projected real GDP growth from 2024 to 2025. Many developing nations, including Libya and Sudan, fall into the highest growth category, with GDP predicted to rise by over 13% and 8%, respectively. Governments in these regions often welcome innovation and may offer favorable regulations or testing environments for blockchain solutions. Blockchain companies entering these markets early can secure a leading position, staying ahead of rivals. Investors, customers, and partners may view companies focusing on developing regions as socially and environmentally responsible. Blockchain technology has significant potential for environmental sustainability, offering secure solutions for renewable energy trading, tracking carbon emissions, protecting natural resources, and managing waste. Many blockchain projects in these areas align with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) objectives, attracting impact-driven investors. While Bitcoin is known for its environmental impact, a recent study identified 23 blockchain networks with much lower carbon emissions and energy consumption compared to Bitcoin. Notable eco-friendly blockchains include Fantom and Algorand. Numerous organizations and projects support sustainable blockchain efforts, such as GreenTrust, the Renewable Energy Certificate Mechanism, and the Energy Web Foundation.

39570088,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/connecting-the-unconnected-blockchains-path-to-global-financial-access,1737986396,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/39570088.jpeg,Connecting the Unconnected: Blockchain’s Path to Global Financial Access,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/connecting-the-unconnected-blockchains-path-to-global-financial-access,"Over 1.4 billion adults lack access to financial services worldwide, depriving them of opportunities to invest, save, and even pay bills in some cases. These numbers represent individuals navigating life without the financial safety nets most depend on. Blockchain and Web3 technologies are creating pathways to bridge the gap between financial systems and unbanked or underbanked customers. The barriers to traditional financial systems Access to traditional banking is impossible for many, even in countries like the US, where one wouldn’t expect this to be the case. Almost a quarter (23%) of people earning less than $25,000 a year are unconnected to financial services. Similar barriers exist globally, driven by a mix of geographic, economic, and social factors. Excessive paperwork, high fees, and having to visit a physical branch create roadblocks. It’s challenging to maintain a bank account due to minimum balance requirements or monthly maintenance fees, which lower-income households may not be able to afford. Entire communities lack the tools needed to ensure financial stability and security. What’s more, the fixed hours in which many banks operate conflict with hourly workers’ schedules, rendering access impractical or inconvenient. Unreliable infrastructure and the lack of internet access and nearby branches compound the issue in developing countries or rural areas. As a result, many people have no access to essential services. Blockchain tools as a possible solution Certain communities’ spending potential remains untapped, and merchants are missing opportunities to connect with a vast and underserved market. Web3 solutions are a potential game-changer, providing tools that empower the unbanked and underbanked to become part of the financial system. Blockchain platforms offer decentralized loans and payments as well as access to verifiable credit histories. L1 blockchain Creditcoin is an example of a platform connecting the unbanked, whose financial services target emerging markets. It recently announced the launch of its Ecosystem Investment Program through Credit Labs, worth $10 million. The initiative will accelerate innovation within the platform’s network by providing equity investments ranging from $25,000 to $250,000 for Web3 entrepreneurs, startups, businesses, and developers. The program prioritizes investments in projects that drive broader Web3 tech adoption, improve financial accessibility, enhance decentralized payment and credit solutions, and utilize Creditcoin’s blockchain infrastructure for real-world applications. Creditcoin also provides the infrastructure for decentralized internet access with Spacecoin, taking high-speed satellite internet connections to places in need. Increasing access to credit facilitates economic prosperity, allowing businesses to create jobs and scale. The concept of leapfrogging to next-gen solutions Many developing regions went straight to mobile because of insufficient funds for infrastructure. The massive expenses associated with the modernization and implementation of poorly developed infrastructure led populations to inevitably circumvent traditional communication technologies. This concept shows that lower-income countries can skip intermediate systems as they develop, going straight to their modern equivalents. Many countries skipped landline adoption. Landline use has remained extremely limited in India, Ghana, and Nigeria, while mobile phone adoption is rising exponentially . Like cellular technology, blockchain technology can fill the gap left by analog systems. For example, Spectral and Centrifuge use this tech to track financial activities, creating transparent credit scores based on on-chain behavior. Decentralized platforms integrate non-traditional data sources, such as utility payments or mobile phone usage, to assess creditworthiness. Collateralized and uncollateralized DeFi loans are another interesting development. DeFi platforms offering the first loan type require users to lock up assets worth more than the loan amount to mitigate default risks. The platform Jellyverse’s jAssets allows users to track the value of traditional real-world assets, locking crypto as collateral. TrueFi offers uncollateralized loans to trusted borrowers based on their creditworthiness and reputation. Community-based lending pools allow groups to vouch for individuals, reducing default risks. Platforms like MakerDAO use smart contracts to automate loan issuance, repayment, and collateral management. Digital platforms enable cross-border lending, making credit accessible to underserved populations. Lenders and borrowers interact directly, with funds locked in smart contracts until terms are met. Decentralized payment gateways like Celo focus on seamless cross-border payments using stablecoins. Web3 companies are also building user-friendly interfaces for non-technical users, like wallets with fiat on/off ramps for easy onboarding. By avoiding intermediaries, Web3 and DeFi platforms can provide lower transaction fees compared to traditional institutions. Benefits of servicing the unbanked for blockchain companies Predictably, Web3 and blockchain companies stand to gain from providing services to developing countries’ populations, primarily in terms of long-term profit. Developing economies are projected to grow faster than developed ones, with purchasing power and financial activity increasing rapidly over time. The IMF ranked countries by the projected percent change of real GDP growth from 2024 to 2025. The highest growth category, 6% or more, was observed in many developing countries, with Libya and Sudan’s GDP predicted to increase by more than 13% resp. 8%. Many governments in developing regions are open to innovation and may offer favorable regulations or sandboxes to pilot blockchain solutions. Blockchain companies that enter these markets early can establish a dominant position, staying ahead of the competition. Investors, customers, and partners may consider companies targeting developing regions to be socially and environmentally responsible. In fact, blockchain technology holds immense potential for environmental sustainability, offering transparent and secure solutions to support renewable energy trading, track carbon emissions, protect natural resources, and facilitate waste management. Many blockchain projects in developing regions align with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) goals, making them attractive to impact-focused investors. Bitcoin is notorious for its environmental consequences, but a recent study identified 23 blockchain networks generating significantly lower carbon emissions and consuming far less power than Bitcoin. Two of these environmentally friendly blockchains are Fantom and Algorand. Many organizations and projects support eco-friendly blockchain initiatives, such as GreenTrust, the Renewable Energy Certificate Mechanism, and the Energy Web Foundation.

This unexpected move raises concerns over the sustainability of its upward momentum, with the market now at a crossroads. It is important to be keenly on the lookout for whether this breach is a temporary dip or a sign of more extensive downside movement in the coming sessions. The breach of the $100,000 support level places Bitcoin at a precarious juncture. Historically, this level has acted as a psychological barrier and a key point of support. The coming days will be crucial in shaping the next phase of Bitcoin’s market performance, with any sustained weakness potentially setting the stage for a deeper correction. Analyzing The Break Below $100,000 Support BTC’s current price action indicates that the asset is firmly in a bearish phase, demonstrating significant negative resilience after successfully dropping below the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the critical $100,000 support level. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $181,000? Mayer Multiple Reveals When BTC Will Become ‘Overbought’ This break below $100,000 represents a pivotal shift in market sentiment, signaling the strength of the bears as they seize control of the price action. Its failure to hold above this important support level has caused a wave of selling pressure, pushing the price lower and raising concerns about further declines in the short term. Compounding the movements, the RSI, which has now dropped into oversold territory, reinforces the bearish outlook, suggesting a lack of buying interest and that the market sentiment remains firmly negative. As Bitcoin struggles to find support at lower levels, traders are closely watching for any signs of stabilization. If the price continues to trade below the $100,000 mark, further downside movement toward key support zones such as $90,000 or even $85,000 could be expected. Moreover, the break of the $100,000 support has now set a new benchmark, and a failure to reclaim this level might indicate that the bears remain in control, triggering downward pressure in the foreseeable future. Will Bitcoin Reclaim $100,000 Or Continue To Slide? Bitcoin’s recent price action has left traders wondering whether the cryptocurrency can reclaim the critical $100,000 support level or if it will continue its slide. After breaking below this key level, the asset is currently facing increased bearish pressure, with market sentiment shifting to the downside. Failure to bounce back above $100,000 may signal a deeper downturn, pushing Bitcoin toward lower support zones such as $93,257. Related Reading: Crypto Experts Forecast Bitcoin Market Peak: Bear Market Could Emerge Within 3 Months However, if BTC reverses the current trend and reclaims the $100,000 level, it could set the stage for a potential recovery. A strong rally above this threshold would likely reinvigorate bullish sentiment and provide fresh momentum for further upside toward its current all-time high of $109,577.

Bitcoin Funding Rates Turn Negative as Nasdaq Futures Drop 700 Points The decline follows growing concerns that China's artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek could challenge U.S. dominance in the sector and trigger a broader sense of risk aversion. According to Velo Data, BTC’s perpetual futures funding rate has turned negative, indicating that traders are either more bullish or bearish. This suggests that more investors are betting on further price declines by taking short positions. The leading cryptocurrency fell more than 3%, briefly dropping below $98,000. Meanwhile, Nasdaq futures fell 3.5%, while AI giant NVIDIA lost 10% in pre-market trading. The sell-off came shortly after President Donald Trump signaled support for a crypto policy working group but stopped short of approving a U.S. Bitcoin reserve, dampening market optimism. Simultaneously, the emergence of DeepSeek has shaken up the tech industry, as its success demonstrates that low-cost AI models can disrupt incumbent US-based companies. Despite the bearish trend, negative funding rates have historically signaled local price bottoms in BTC. There is also the risk of a short squeeze, where bears closing positions could push prices back up. However, analysts warn that the funding rate swing remains narrow and it is too early to call short BTC an overcrowded trade. *This is not investment advice.

Some believe that, with the rising demand for seamless and efficient cross-border payments, XRP might have a chance of reaching $9 in the near future. There’s also NovaDEX ($NVX) , a new project that could gain momentum as a decentralized exchange with exciting features like staking pools offering solid rewards and yield farming opportunities. The project’s mainnet went live just and has already hit some impressive milestones, showing that it might be one to watch. Let’s break down the details of both projects. Can Ripple (XRP) Reach $9 with Its Latest Payment Solution? Ripple (XRP) appears to be building momentum, fueled by its recent legal win against the SEC, which has sparked fresh confidence across the crypto market. This positive regulatory outcome has shifted perceptions, with more institutional players now seeing Ripple as a credible force in the blockchain space. Ripple’s position in cross-border payments remains strong, bolstered by the integration of RLUSD. This solution is gaining recognition as a reliable option for global transactions, potentially enhancing Ripple’s ecosystem and XRP’s use cases. Whale investors seem to be taking notice of these developments, with data pointing to an uptick in large-scale XRP accumulation. Historically, whale activity tends to impact price trends, increasing liquidity and boosting market sentiment. On the technical front, XRP is showing promising signs. TradingView data highlights steady increases in trading volume, which could signal a breakout on the horizon. Analysts are watching closely for further upward momentum. Broader market trends also align with Ripple’s strengths. As crypto adoption grows and demand for efficient cross-border payment solutions rises, Ripple’s offerings stand out compared to other technologies. With its expanding partnerships, increasing whale interest, and favorable market dynamics, XRP could be on track to hit $9 by the end of Q1 2025—assuming the current trends hold steady. Ripple’s innovations and strategic moves position it as a strong contender for significant gains in the next market cycle. What Is NovaDEX All About? NovaDEX is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers users access to concentrated liquidity, yield farming, and staking pools. The platform’s mainnet launched recently, achieving significant milestones that point to strong adoption potential in the DeFi space. According to the official website, the native token NVX plays a critical role in the ecosystem. Over 1,900 holders currently back the token. Other Solana DeFi Projects like Jupter, Orca or Raydium have achieved significant traction within the Solana ecosystem. Whether NovaDEX can achieve something similar remains to be seen. Expectations for further growth remain high as more users discover the platform’s features. Since its introduction, NovaDEX has gained attention as one of the most active and fast-growing projects in DeFi. The platform already handled over 85,000 transactions across various activities, highlighting its momentum and appeal in the decentralized finance market. What Gives NovaDEX Its Edge? Innovation, Growth, and Security So, how is NovaDEX any different from hundreds of other DeFi platforms? Well, the main differentiating feature is its ability to let users create permissionless liquidity pools for any coin on the exchange. This freedom could allow traders to explore opportunities not typically available on other platforms. The platform also delivers competitive pricing and high returns. With low slippage and some of the best APRs in the market, it offers strong incentives for investors. Yield farming adds another layer of value by allowing users to earn rewards through liquidity provider tokens in yield farm pools, creating opportunities for consistent income. The exchange also emphasizes decentralization and security. Users play a direct role in its development through a community-driven governance model. On the security front, NovaDEX’s smart contracts have undergone audits by QuillAudits, ensuring the platform provides a safe environment for its users. With its focus on innovation, user control, and security, NovaDEX could become a truly unique and valuable player in the DeFi space. Wrapping Up Whether XRP reaches $9 will likely depend on continued regulatory support and greater adoption, especially with Trump’s push for deregulation. Market dynamics, combined with further favorable rulings for Ripple, could heavily influence XRP’s future trajectory. Meanwhile, NovaDEX could bring something fresh to the Solana ecosystem. With its advanced features, including permissionless liquidity pools, yield farming and staking, NovaDEX has the potential to reshape decentralized finance on Solana. ————– This article is not financial advice.

Van Straten Says Bitcoin's Bull Run Will Face Major Test If BTC Drops Below $91K Analysts warn that any further declines below $91,000 could put significant pressure on the rally. The latest pullback has been attributed to concerns over China's DeepSeek AI, whose hyper-efficient AI model is seen as a major challenge to the US's tech dominance. That, along with a broader sell-off in U.S. markets, contributed to heightened risk aversion. Nasdaq futures fell 4%, signaling a broader correction in stocks. On the other hand, Bitcoin’s bull run has suffered multiple 15% corrections since Donald Trump won the US elections. BTC has experienced double-digit declines several times since its rise from $66,000 to $109,000, making the current decline appear consistent with previous market behavior. A key support level to watch is the short-term owner cost floor, currently at $91,000. This metric, which tracks the average on-chain cost of coins moved over the last 155 days, has historically served as a floor in bullish markets. However, the bearish sentiment is growing. The negative Bitcoin funding rate is suggesting that traders are betting on further downside. Meanwhile, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicted a correction to $70,000-$75,000 before BTC eventually climbs to $250,000. With both crypto and equity markets under pressure, investors are closely watching whether Bitcoin can hold above $91,000 or if a deeper correction is on the horizon. *This is not investment advice.

Ethereum Foundation Sells 100 More ETH, Bringing Total ETH Sold to 300 in 2025 This is the third sale this year, bringing the foundation's total ETH sale in 2025 to 300 ETH. Ethereum Foundation's ETH Sales Strategy The Ethereum Foundation has historically sold ETH at market highs, leading to speculation about its potential impact on market sentiment and Ethereum’s price trends. However, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has previously suggested exploring staking and DeFi yields as alternative sources of income rather than selling ETH holdings. While the foundation’s ETH sales have raised questions in the community, these sales may reflect operational funding needs rather than a bearish outlook. The market will watch whether the Ethereum Foundation continues this trend or moves to alternative income strategies as Vitalik has previously hinted. As the downward trend continues in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) was trading at $3050 at the time of writing. *This is not investment advice.

Liquidity Easily bought and sold globally, gold coins are one of the most liquid investment options.

What Levels Can Be Seen? Experienced Analysts Explained!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/how-long-will-the-decline-in-bitcoin-btc-continue-what-levels-can-be-seen-experienced-analysts-explained/,"Despite the open support of US President Donald Trump, Bitcoin suffered a major decline and fell to $98,900 levels. The decline in Bitcoin coincided with a downturn in the broader cryptocurrency market triggered by the launch of DeepSeek R1, which shook the AI sector and negatively impacted the prices of AI-themed tokens. While investors are nervous about the decline experienced before the FOMC, they are wondering how long the decline in BTC can last. At this point, pseudonymous analyst AlphaBTC said in his X analysis that Bitcoin looks weak. Stating that breaking the $100,000 support could cause Bitcoin’s price to drop below $90,000, the analyst argued that if the bulls regain $100,000, the price could recover from current levels. “BTC and TradFi futures have been selling off all night, Bitcoin is looking really weak as we start a new week. This time, it seems that the 100,000 level has been passed, but the question will be: will BTC be able to regain this level with a strong reaction or will we fall below 90,000 once again? Apart from this, popular analyst Michael van de Poppe also shared his current analysis. Warning his followers not to panic, the analyst claimed that the ongoing selling wave was “nothing more than a short-term panic reaction in the markets.” According to Poppe, who stated that the decline presents a buying opportunity, the range between $99,000 and $98,000 offers a suitable entry zone for Bitcoin investors. The analyst also warned that if the bulls fail to seize power, the Bitcoin price could drop to $89,500-$91,500. Bitcoin Price Could Drop to $70,000! BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said in a tweet that Bitcoin could potentially pull back to the $70,000 to $75,000 range, and that this move could trigger a mini financial crisis. However, Hayes added that the BTC price could rise to $250,000 by the end of the year. Related News: BitMEX Former CEO Arthur Hayes Warned!

This milestone highlights MicroStrategy’s enduring confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term asset. According to Cointellig , the company’s strategic decisions in expanding its Bitcoin holdings have proven to be monumental in the cryptocurrency sector.

A significant move by the company’s shareholders recently approved the expansion of its stock issuance limit, paving the way for additional Bitcoin acquisitions. This decision not only cements the company’s role as a key player in the cryptocurrency landscape but also underscores its commitment to maximizing returns through Bitcoin investments. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Journey: A Pioneer in Institutional BTC Adoption MicroStrategy has been at the forefront of institutional Bitcoin adoption since its initial purchase in 2020. Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, the company’s investment strategy is centered around the belief that Bitcoin is “digital gold.” By accumulating Bitcoin during market fluctuations, MicroStrategy has consistently capitalized on its belief in the cryptocurrency’s potential for long-term growth. The company’s unwavering strategy has made it the largest Bitcoin holder among publicly traded companies, solidifying its reputation as a trailblazer in the cryptocurrency space. As of today, MicroStrategy holds over 152,000 BTC , purchased at an aggregate cost of approximately $4.53 billion.

The Role of Bitcoin in Modern Investment Portfolios MicroStrategy’s bullish stance on Bitcoin has prompted a broader discussion about the role of cryptocurrencies in modern investment portfolios. As inflationary pressures mount and fiat currencies face devaluation, Bitcoin’s scarcity and decentralized nature make it an appealing store of value. Institutional investors like MicroStrategy have increasingly turned to Bitcoin to diversify their holdings and protect against traditional market risks. This trend underscores the growing recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate financial instrument with the potential to reshape the global economy. The Future of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Strategy Looking ahead, MicroStrategy shows no signs of slowing down its Bitcoin acquisitions. The company has repeatedly emphasized its commitment to holding Bitcoin as a long-term asset, regardless of market volatility. The recent shareholder decision to expand the stock issuance limit indicates that MicroStrategy remains steadfast in its efforts to increase its Bitcoin holdings. This move could encourage other companies to follow suit, further accelerating institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. As Bitcoin’s value continues to stabilize and regulatory frameworks evolve, MicroStrategy is well-positioned to reap the rewards of its bold investment strategy. The company’s unwavering belief in Bitcoin as a transformative asset could inspire more corporations to integrate cryptocurrencies into their financial strategies.

By demonstrating the profitability of institutional Bitcoin investments, MicroStrategy paves the way for increased corporate adoption of cryptocurrencies. The company’s success also reinforces the argument that Bitcoin can serve as a hedge against economic uncertainties.
