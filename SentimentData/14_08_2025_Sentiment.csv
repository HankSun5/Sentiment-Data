It’s now sitting at $123,334.03, up 2.82%, with traders who tried to short the asset losing big. Coinglass showed that over $397 million got wiped out in market liquidations, and $259 million of that came from short positions that bet against this price climb. JUST IN: Bitcoin hits new ATH of $123,500 pic.twitter.com/ldUksSC5zd — Cryptopolitan (@CPOfficialtx) August 13, 2025 Ether didn’t sit this one out either. It’s now just 3% away from its 2021 high, and helped push total crypto market cap to a record $4.2 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. Ether has been lagging behind for a long time, but it just caught a second wind. A flood of money has moved into Ether-focused investment funds. These funds are, of course, public companies buying Ethereum like Michael Saylor used to buy Bitcoin. Those companies now hold nearly $17 billion worth of ETH, per numbers from StrategicEthReserve.xyz. ETHZilla stock explodes after Ether stash reveal One of those Ether-stacking firms is 180 Life Sciences Corp., now trading as ETHZilla. The firm used to be in biotech, but after it pivoted into crypto and announced that it holds 82,186 ETH tokens, its stock price shot up. The price jumped more than 200% on Tuesday and kept rising, gaining another 50% in premarket trading on Wednesday. ETHZilla is backed by billionaire Peter Thiel, which likely added fuel to the fire. The change in momentum is also visible in trading activity. For the first time ever, nine US spot Ether ETFs recorded more daily trades than Bitcoin ETFs, based on Bloomberg data. In August alone, those Ether ETFs pulled in $1.7 billion, while Bitcoin funds saw a net outflow of $436 million. Traders aren’t just buying ETH, they’re betting on it long-term. Coinglass data showed Ether futures across all exchanges reached $66 billion in open interest, a new record high. There’s a policy angle here too. The GENIUS Act, passed in July, cleared the way for stablecoins to go fully mainstream in the US. That bill is already having ripple effects. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, said stablecoins already account for 40% of blockchain fees, and over half of them run on Ethereum. In his words, “The GENIUS Act should indirectly boost Ethereum’s layer one activity.” With more stablecoin use, Kendrick expects more DeFi action, and DeFi lives on ETH. The bank has now revised its forecast. Standard Chartered moved its year-end 2025 Ether price target from $4,000 to $7,500, citing the ongoing demand spike and ecosystem growth. Bitcoin holds its spot at the top of long-term growth rankings Even with Ether doing numbers, Bitcoin is still the asset everyone’s watching for long-term growth. A new Bitcoin Intelligence Report compared its 10-year gains to other major assets. Over the past decade, Bitcoin’s modeled compound annual growth rate (CAGR) came in at 42.5%. That number crushed everything else. The Nasdaq had a CAGR of 16%, Gold averaged 10.65%, and US M2 money supply grew at just 6% per year. Even adjusted for its limited supply, Gold only hit 12.88%. Right now, the next level for Bitcoin is just above $130,000, where resistance is building. But the year-end forecast remains way higher. Using a mix of power-law trends and quantile analysis, analysts have pinned $200,000 as a realistic top by the end of 2025. The base projection still holds at $120,000, but a cyclical bull phase could push it higher. That’s not where it ends. Looking further ahead, the same models put Bitcoin’s price in 2035 between $1.2 million and $1.5 million. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The agency’s latest regulatory greenlight came in as it accepted the filing for the Invesco Galaxy Spot Solana ETF, a proposed exchange-traded fund (ETF) designed to track the spot price of Solana (SOL). The SEC has said it has received and is reviewing the application for the Invesco Galaxy Spot Solana ETF, which means it is not too far from making a decision that many expect to be an approval. The acknowledgement comes after Cboe BZX Exchange submitted a Form 19b-4 to propose a rule change for listing and trading the ETF, which initiates the SEC’s formal review process. BREAKING: SEC acknowledges Invesco Galaxy Spot $SOL ETF filing pic.twitter.com/utvILTqFEH — Cryptopolitan (@CPOfficialtx) August 13, 2025 Why the acknowledgement matters The filing is the latest Solana ETF to be filed this year and comes after the REX Shares SOL ETF Application was filed in May and marked “immediately effective,” signaling that the launch could happen soon. With the SEC’s acknowledgement, the Invesco filing joins filings from issuers like VanEck, 21Shares, Bitwise, Grayscale, Canary Capital, Franklin Templeton, and Fidelity who are also waiting for the SEC’s nod. Meanwhile analysts have remain optimistic despite the delay with many estimating a high chance that the SEC approves them by October, an optimistic outlook encouraged by Trump’s love of crypto and the existence of CME-listed Solana futures, which strengthens the argument for a spot product. There are kinks to be worked out Despite the Solana ecosystem’s excitement about a future ETF approval, the SEC has remained cautious, delaying decisions while citing the need for further evaluation. There is also the fact that the debate about whether Solana should be classified as a commodity or a security , which could impact approval, is still ongoing. Securities and commodities are regarded as two different financial instruments, and in America, they are regulated by two different government organizations. Where crypto is concerned, a legal determination that a cryptocurrency is either one of those financial instruments has far-reaching implications about how it can be sold, where it can be listed and who has the right to sue in the event an issuer oversteps the mark. If a cryptocurrency is classified as a security, cryptocurrency issuers and exchanges are required to seek the necessary licenses from their securities regulators, which is usually difficult to do. As such, the crypto industry does a lot to ensure that cryptocurrency sales and developments don’t trespass any securities laws. Most avoid violating the securities law through decentralization after all, if a cryptocurrency is created in such a way that a securities regulator is unable to identify a central, coordinated group responsible for pumping the value of the token, the asset is less likely to be considered a security. Any cryptocurrency that is classified as a security risks not getting listed by exchanges who want to avoid fines from the SEC for listing unregistered securities. The debate has heated up this year thanks to all the ETF filings but its outcome is anybody’s guess. One potential result would be some cryptocurrencies getting classified as securities, while others are classified as commodities. However, this could lead to an even more complex regulatory landscape where different cryptocurrencies are subject to varying rules and regulations. Get seen where it counts.

The South Korean newspaper Metro Seoul reported that the Presidential Committee on State Affairs announced its plans at a public briefing on August 13. South Korea Crypto Reform Taking Shape The committee spoke of a five-year plan for state administration, naming 123 state affairs-related tasks. Among these tasks named were “the construction of a digital asset ecosystem” and “developing the domestic cryptoasset market.” Both were identified as “key national tasks” for the administration, which took office in early June this year following the election of President Lee Jae-myung. President Lee Jae Myung on Wednesday laid out a sweeping five-year policy agenda, detailing 123 national tasks ranging from constitutional reform to industrial growth and market fairness. https://t.co/52cb7gzOvi — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) August 13, 2025 Lee has spoken repeatedly about his intention to build up the domestic crypto sector, with deregulation and stablecoin regulation high on his agenda. The President appears keen to let domestic firms issue won-pegged stablecoins . Leading banks and IT companies have reacted by registering scores of stablecoin-related trademarks . Others are hurriedly rolling out crypto-related business plans, aware that this may allow non-financial firms to develop advanced payment platforms. However, one of President Lee’s key campaign pledges was left off the five-year plan, namely the dissolution of the Financial Services Commission (FSC). The FSC is the nation’s top financial regulator. Its Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) polices the country’s crypto exchanges , issuing operating permits and conducting periodic on-site inspections. It also enforces anti-money laundering and terrorist financing protocols at the trading platforms. The Government Complex Building in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: Seoul Institute [CC BY 4.0]) FSC: Vociferous Critic No More? In previous years, the FSC has been a vociferous critic of the crypto sector. But in recent years, as governments have relaxed their hardline stance to the industry, it has spoken in favor of reform. Under the proposal, FSC’s supervisory duties were to transfer to the Financial Supervisory Service. The FSC’s policy-related tasks were due to transfer to the Ministry of Strategy and Finance. But Lee’s plan to scrap the FSC proved controversial, even among senior ministers. While his offices have yet to confirm that the President has shelved the policy, the five-year plan appeared to suggest the proposal may have moved to the back burner. There was no mention of the regulatory reorganization move on the plan. And seven of the 123 tasks were assigned to the FSC. The newspaper added that crypto reforms are a “key focus” for both the government and the National Assembly this year. As such, reforms are “expected to gain momentum” in the weeks ahead, Metro Seoul wrote. ‘Time to Play Catch-up’ Political leaders are concerned that South Korea is being left behind. They note that over the past two years, the global crypto market has expanded by about 262%. While crypto investment has spiked in the US, the European Union, and Japan, driven by institutionalization drives, the same cannot be said for Seoul. The outlet wrote: “Delayed institutional reforms and a lack of legislation in South Korea have left the domestic cryptoasset market significantly lagging in terms of competitiveness.” South Korea says President Lee Jae Myung to visit Japan this month https://t.co/PmtmRcPibF — Nikkei Asia (@NikkeiAsia) August 13, 2025 The FSC has prioritized its plan to allow corporations to buy and sell crypto. It also wants to tak a “more relaxed approach” to regulations. The regulator has previously spoken of its intention to roll out crypto-related regulations before the end of this year. However, skeptics say that a final decision on the fate of the FSC is yet to be taken. Talks to abolish the regulator “may resume in the future,” the newspaper explained. Unnamed financial sector officials opined that the debate over the reorganization of the financial regulators would “continue until the end of the year.” Earlier this month, the Seoul district of Gangnam announced it had recouped $144,057 in unpaid taxes in the first half of this year by seizing coins from tax evaders .

The figure matched June’s reading and came in below the 2.8% forecast, giving traders confidence that inflation is staying under control. Meanwhile, a new coin, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is gaining the attention of large buyers in the market. Latest Development Driving the Surge The news drove Bitcoin to its Monday high of $122,190 before sellers came in and pulled the price down three percent to $118,500. The dip failed to suppress Bitcoin, which was soon able to recover to almost $119,500, with the $120,000 threshold still in sight. One of the important indications of the next thrust would be a daily close above a figure of $119,982. Technical signals continue to suggest the possibility of a bull run. An earlier breakout of a flag pattern this week indicates that the most recent dip was a healthy retest prior to continuation. Market analysts envision an end-year target of $137,000, with a declining trendline breakout noted on Sunday. A break above 120,000 would not just be a psychological break but the first of its kind in the history of Bitcoin, which could potentially lead to the next leg in the current rally. Unless Bitcoin reclaims the $120,000 mark, analysts fear short-term pressure with support at $117,650 and $115,650. MAGACOIN FINANCE Draws Early Interest from Professional Traders Experienced traders are adjusting positions to add MAGACOIN FINANCE prior to its possible breakout. Although Bitcoin steals the show, people regard MAGACOIN as a distinct presale project that has received a select number of community supporters and innovative tokenomics. The presale is already picking up momentum with consistent activity on the blockchain and an increasing number of dedicated investors. Conclusion Bitcoin’s battle around the $120,000 mark is more than just a price story—it sets the tone for the rest of the market. A definite breakout will spark not only the top cryptocurrency but also a series of altcoin surges. Although BTC is well-established, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making quite a name by being one of the hottest presale tokens in 2025. The next few weeks could be crucial to traders who are monitoring the two coins.

A massive Ethereum whale transfer , involving 60,000 ETH, recently moved from Coinbase Institutional to an unknown digital wallet. This intriguing development, valued at approximately $284 million, has naturally sparked considerable discussion and speculation across the crypto community. Such large movements often signal shifts in sentiment or strategic maneuvers by major players. Understanding these transfers is key to grasping the broader market dynamics. What Just Happened? Unpacking the Large ETH Transaction Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking service, reported a substantial movement of Ethereum. Specifically, 60,000 ETH, worth an astounding $284 million at the time of the transfer, departed from a wallet associated with Coinbase Institutional. This massive sum then arrived at a newly created, previously unknown wallet address. This particular large ETH transaction immediately caught the attention of market observers due to its sheer size and the institutional origin. Origin: Coinbase Institutional, indicating a major entity. Destination: An entirely new, unknown wallet address. Value: Approximately $284 million, a significant sum for any single transfer. Such transfers are not uncommon in the fast-paced world of digital assets. However, their scale and the entities involved always warrant closer examination. When an institutional-grade custodian like Coinbase Institutional is involved, it often suggests a strategic decision by a major investor or a large corporate entity. Why Do These Coinbase Institutional ETH Movements Matter? Movements from platforms like Coinbase Institutional ETH accounts are particularly noteworthy because they often represent the actions of large-scale investors, corporations, or even other financial institutions. These entities typically execute well-thought-out strategies rather than impulsive trades. Therefore, a transfer of this magnitude from such a source can be interpreted in several ways: Off-Exchange Custody: The owner might be moving their assets into self-custody or a different cold storage solution for long-term holding, reducing immediate selling pressure on exchanges. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: The ETH could be destined for an OTC desk, facilitating a large private sale that avoids impacting public exchange order books. Strategic Deployment: The funds might be earmarked for a specific decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, staking, or participation in a new blockchain initiative. Understanding the potential motives behind such a move helps analysts predict possible market impacts. It also highlights the growing participation of institutional capital in the Ethereum ecosystem. Understanding Crypto Whale Activity : Who is Behind This Ethereum Whale Transfer ? The term ""whale"" in crypto refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Their actions, known as crypto whale activity , can significantly influence market sentiment and price. While the destination wallet for this Ethereum whale transfer remains ""unknown,"" the identity of the whale itself is often obscured by the pseudonymous nature of blockchain. However, the origin from Coinbase Institutional narrows down the possibilities somewhat. It could be: A hedge fund rebalancing its portfolio. A major corporation moving treasury assets. A high-net-worth individual consolidating holdings. An arbitrage firm adjusting positions across different platforms. The lack of immediate movement from the new wallet often suggests a long-term holding strategy rather than an imminent sale. This can be a bullish signal, as it removes a large block of ETH from potential immediate liquidation on exchanges. What Are the Potential Market Implications of This Unknown ETH Wallet ? The emergence of an unknown ETH wallet holding such a substantial amount of Ethereum naturally leads to questions about its future impact on the market. While the immediate effect of this transfer on Ethereum’s price was minimal, the long-term implications depend heavily on the whale’s intentions. Reduced Selling Pressure: If the ETH is moved to cold storage, it indicates a strong belief in Ethereum’s long-term value, potentially reducing supply on exchanges. Future Volatility: Should the funds eventually move back to an exchange, it could signal an intent to sell, potentially leading to increased supply and price volatility. Market Confidence: Large institutional movements, even to unknown wallets, can boost confidence among retail investors, signaling that major players are still actively engaging with the asset. Observing the future activity of this new wallet will be crucial for understanding its long-term market influence. The crypto community will closely monitor any subsequent transfers or transactions from this address. In conclusion, the recent Ethereum whale transfer of 60,000 ETH from Coinbase Institutional to an unknown wallet is a prime example of the dynamic and often mysterious nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the immediate implications are subject to speculation, such movements underscore the growing institutional interest in Ethereum and the power of large holders to influence market perception. This event reminds us that vigilance and understanding of on-chain data are essential for navigating the exciting world of digital assets. Keep an eye on this wallet; its next move could tell us a lot. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ""Ethereum whale transfer"" mean? A1: An Ethereum whale transfer refers to the movement of a very large amount of Ethereum (ETH) by an individual or entity (a ""whale"") from one wallet to another, often involving millions of dollars. Q2: Why is a transfer from Coinbase Institutional significant? A2: Coinbase Institutional serves large-scale investors and corporations. Transfers from such platforms often indicate strategic moves by major players, rather than typical retail trading activity, making them noteworthy for market analysis. Q3: Does this transfer mean the ETH will be sold soon? A3: Not necessarily. Moving ETH to an unknown new wallet, especially if it remains dormant, can indicate a shift to long-term cold storage or an Over-the-Counter (OTC) deal, rather than an immediate sale on public exchanges. Q4: How can an ""unknown new wallet"" be tracked? A4: While the owner’s identity remains anonymous, blockchain explorers allow anyone to track the activity of any wallet address. The crypto community monitors these large, unknown wallets for any future transactions that might reveal the whale’s intentions. Q5: What are the potential impacts of such large ETH movements on the market? A5: Large ETH movements can influence market sentiment, potentially signaling bullish (if moved to cold storage) or bearish (if moved to an exchange for selling) trends. They can also contribute to short-term price volatility or indicate significant institutional interest. Did this significant Ethereum whale transfer spark your interest?

MAGACOIN emerges as the best altcoin to buy now, attracting ADA and SHIB investors in 2025. Avalanche (AVAX) and XRP have both pushed through important technical resistance levels. Traders are watching these breakouts closely, with price targets well above current ranges. Analysts believe these moves could mark the start of a broader crypto market rally. While the spotlight is firmly on these two heavyweights, another name is starting to appear more often in discussions — MAGACOIN FINANCE. This crypto presale is being talked about as a fresh, exciting addition to the list of the best altcoins to buy now, with some traders shifting funds from older holdings toward this rising contender. Avalanche Breaks $25: Chart Patterns Hint at Bigger Moves AVAX climbed from a 24-hour low of $22.8 to significantly more than $25, breaking above a resistance level that had been topping price action for weeks. Analysts point to a gigantic long-term falling wedge formation, created since the 2021 high, as proof that momentum is possibly building. Elite Crypto suggested that the final phase of this trend could be ending. If AVAX is able to break above its next resistance level — roughly 40% higher than its current price — it could start a bull run to $80. That kind of rally would cement Avalanche’s place among the best altcoins to buy now. For the majority, the question is not if AVAX will probe higher levels, but whether it can sustain them if the rally picks up steam. XRP Clears $3.2: Eyes Set on Higher Targets XRP has gone up over 3%, breaking the $3.2 threshold and reawakening bull hopes in its fans. Analyst Javon Marks stated that based on past bull cycle performance, XRP could be looking to hit ~$9.63, which is likely a possible jump from here. While there is no rally guaranteed, most of the traders see these levels as part of a larger XRP price forecast 2025 picture. Especially if future market triggers play out well. Its capacity to remain above $3.2 will be a short-term observation. Continued gains above could also enhance its position among individuals seeking the best crypto to invest in 2025. Some investors are closely watching the whales’ moves. Accumulation patterns before important price action have historically indicated the direction of the next move, and with more extensive ETF discussions prevailing, speculation is rife. Cardano and Shiba Inu Investors Shift Toward MAGACOIN FINANCE Cardano (ADA) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have long had loyal investor bases, but recent weeks have shown a gradual change in behavior. More holders from these communities are moving capital into MAGACOIN FINANCE. The reason is simple — many see greater growth potential in a project still early in its market journey, rather than in assets that have already experienced multiple major cycles. This shift is being driven by both narrative appeal and potential upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been discussed alongside some of the best crypto presale stories of the year. It has drawn attention from traders looking for high-risk, high-reward plays. Its positioning in market chatter is also growing, especially as it gains traction among those searching for the best crypto to buy now with strong upside targets. The project’s early signs point toward a growing online presence and a narrative that resonates with traders looking beyond the usual big names. If momentum continues, it could climb into the same conversations as the top crypto to invest in 2025. Looking Ahead — Three Coins Shaping the Conversation Avalanche’s breakout above $25, XRP’s push beyond $3.2, and the growing chatter around MAGACOIN FINANCE all signal that this quarter may deliver surprises. AVAX and XRP are backed by strong technical signals, each with potential for multi-digit percentage gains if the bullish setups play out. MAGACOIN FINANCE, while newer, offers something different — the allure of catching a project before it becomes widely recognized. For traders building diversified positions in the best crypto presale to buy now, combining proven large-caps with emerging names could be the strategy that defines their returns heading into next year.

AVAX eyes a $100 mark by 2030, bolstered in the short term by network growth and expanding DeFi use. RNDR recently crossed $3.60, benefiting from a decisive breakout and broader market recovery. Yet, the most striking figures come from Cold Wallet . At Stage 17, priced at $0.00998, with a fixed launch at $0.3517, the return sits at 3,423%. With over $5.95 million secured, this is more than a speculative hope; it’s a measurable gap ready to close. While AVAX and RNDR build over time, Cold Wallet’s path is direct, steep, and already in motion. Will AVAX Hit $100 by 2030? A Data-Based View Avalanche’s long-term targets spark debate, but numbers suggest varied possibilities. Analyst projections for 2025 range widely, with many pointing to a $26–$33 zone this year if bullish trends hold. Ambitious scenarios project $50 by mid-decade, while some models stretch to $100 between 2026 and 2027, and even higher by 2030 in peak cases. The leap to $100 relies on factors such as ETF approvals, enterprise integrations, and steady DeFi expansion. Timing entries becomes critical, as each presale stage narrows the profit gap. Whether traders focus on AVAX fundamentals or speculative price surges, aligning timing with data remains key. RNDR Maintains Strength Above $3.60 Render’s firm hold above $3.60 reflects renewed confidence after escaping a multi-month descending wedge, where it had hovered between $2.90 and its ceiling. Technical signs, including RSI and MACD trends, point toward building bullish energy. Macro view of a screen of trading terminal with abstract financial graph and digits. Trading and forex concept. 3D Rendering The coin’s recovery from key support and its breakout structure suggest more upward potential, especially with market sentiment improving. While past patterns don’t secure future results, RNDR’s chart now supports an optimistic view if it sustains above $3.60 and market momentum continues. Stage 17: Cold Wallet Nears Final Sub-$0.01 Pricing Cold Wallet approaches a defining point with Stage 17 pricing at $0.00998, one of the last points before crossing $0.01. For market participants, moving past this threshold often signals faster gains ahead. The locked launch price of $0.3517 sets up a 3,423% ROI potential. History shows that later presale stages deliver the sharpest jumps, and with over $5.95 million already raised and 710 million coins sold, the end of Stage 17 will quicken price increases. Larger buyers often act now, aware that scarcity drives momentum when under $0.01 pricing ends. Cold Wallet’s approach centers on securing value before broader awareness lifts demand. Soon, sub-$0.01 will be gone, and those entering now will hold that advantage when listings go live. Final Words Reaching triple digits for AVAX depends on adoption cycles, scaling, and macro conditions. RNDR’s rebound is technically solid but will need sustained traction and market alignment. Cold Wallet stands apart with a fixed ROI model, clear presale momentum, and its final low-cost stage offering a rare entry before launch. From $0.00998 today to $0.3517 at listing, the growth path is built into the numbers. In markets where timing and precision decide gains, Cold Wallet is positioned to turn early action into substantial results.

He opens his note with an unambiguous header—“My Top Altcoin Picks: DOGE”—and then lays out the case in plain language: “We’ve been actively trading Doge for about a week and a half now, and I’ve been sharing updates with you every step of the way. Doge looks extremely bullish on the weekly time frame, potentially closing this week with a bullish engulfing candle if we can manage to close above $0.241. That would be fantastic.” Why Dogecoin Is The Top Altcoin Right Now The weekly DOGE/USDT chart shows price pressing into a well-defined supply band labeled “Resistance” around $0.27–$0.30, where July’s “Higher High” ($0.287) sits. Underneath, a rising weekly trendline that has contained price since mid-2023 currently tracks through the upper-$0.16s to low-$0.17s, with a horizontal “Support” shelf near $0.13 aligned to the prior “Swing Low.” The staircase of “swing low → higher → higher low → higher high” marked on the chart remains intact. The analyst ties the structure to a specific pattern roadmap. “We may also be forming a broadening ascending wedge pattern here, and the potential upside target of this pattern could be as high as the all-time highs at $0.75,” he writes. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $1? Only If This Plays Out, Says Analyst Extending the projection, he adds: “If we extend this further out in time, we could even argue that the 1.618 Fibonacci extension around $1.17 might come into play. Of course, we’d need to break through the resistance levels marked on the chart to see something like that,” before situating the trade in market context: “If the market continues as it is—Bitcoin dominance dropping and ETH continuing its upward momentum—I don’t think this is out of the question for Doge.” Momentum reads argue there is room. On the chart, weekly RSI has turned up from the mid-30s, reclaimed its signal, and now sits in the mid-50s to low-60s—well shy of the overbought band that accompanied the prior thrust. The analyst highlights that runway explicitly: “Using the RSI as an indicator, there’s still significant room for growth before we enter the overbought territory, which is typically when things get exciting.” He also frames the setup within a higher-timeframe impulsive structure: “Technically speaking, Doge has experienced two significant impulses on a higher timeframe, both setting higher highs and higher lows. Now, we’re looking for a third impulse.” Positioning matters to him as well. “Looking at Doge as a top 10 crypto asset, we see that all other cryptos in the top 10, except for Cardano and Solana, have reached all-time highs… Doge remains behind, and I believe the major impulse is still yet to come.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Buy The Dip: $1 Billion DOGE Added On execution, he points to the lower-timeframe tape confirming the bias: “On the lower timeframes, we’re seeing higher highs and higher lows, which suggests that the impulse may have already begun.” That leads to the trade thesis: “With all this in mind, it’s an exciting time for altcoins, and I believe that Doge’s risk-to-reward ratio, especially considering its position as a top 10 asset, makes it an attractive trade even from current levels.” Peer technicians are aligned. In a brief community ping titled “Good boy Doge,” the analyst reiterated the same levels and structure from earlier in the week. Fellow trader CRG explained the patience trade: “Nothing much to update. Price just chilling for now, been consolidating for 6 months making higher lows. DOGE is gonna full send at some point, no doubt in my mind, just gotta be patient.” He summarized the rationale behind positioning with a screenshot captioned, “This is why we are in the $DOGE trade fam.” From here, the immediate trigger is mechanical and visible on the chart: a weekly settlement above $0.241 would print the bullish-engulfing confirmation the analyst is watching at the mouth of resistance. Acceptance through the $0.27–$0.30 band would reopen the path toward the mid-$0.30s and the prior rejection in December last year when DOGE peaked above $0.48, while failure to hold the rising trendline would defer the move to the next demand zones near $0.17 and $0.13. As long as the sequence of higher lows remains unbroken, the wedge continues to frame a credible springboard toward the analysts’ stated targets, with $0.75 as the first historical waypoint and the 1.618 extension at ~$1.17 reserved for a fully developed impulse. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.242.

BlockchainFX (BFX) is closing in on its $5.5 million softcap, already securing $5.08 million from 4,323 backers for its planned multi-asset trading platform covering cryptocurrencies, stocks, ETFs, and commodities. Ozak AI, priced at $0.005 in Stage 4, has passed the $1.7 million mark with a proposition that blends blockchain infrastructure with AI-powered predictive analytics. Strong results for both, but BlockDAG’s momentum is operating at a scale far above the rest. The project has raised $373 million, sold more than 25.1 billion coins, and delivered over 2,660% returns to those who bought in during Batch 1. At today’s Batch 29 price of $0.0276, near-term targets suggest a jump to $1, representing 3,522% potential ROI. With over 200,000 holders and millions mining before launch, every batch sold moves BlockDAG (BDAG) closer to its $600 million goal and pushes early-stage pricing further out of reach. BlockchainFX (BFX) Closing in on Softcap The BlockchainFX presale has now raised $5.08 million, bringing it to 92.45% of its $5.5 million softcap. The project’s pitch outlines a trading platform capable of integrating over 500 assets, ranging from crypto to traditional financial instruments like ETFs and commodities, into one ecosystem. Listed features include daily staking rewards in both BFX and USDT, instant asset swaps, and a revenue-sharing model where up to 70% of trading fees are returned to users. This mix of incentives aims to attract both active traders and long-term participants. Presale numbers show 4,323 contributors so far, with payment accepted in several major cryptocurrencies. BlockchainFX positions itself as a bridge between conventional markets and blockchain-based assets. Whether this integration gains traction will depend on post-launch adoption, user experience, and competition in the multi-asset trading space. Ozak AI Presale Pushing Toward $2 Million The Ozak AI presale, now in Stage 4 at $0.005 per unit, has raised over $1.7 million. The next phase will see the price increase to $0.01. The project plans to merge blockchain capabilities with artificial intelligence, focusing on predictive analytics to support decision-making across multiple sectors. Ozak AI’s proposed ecosystem includes the Ozak Stream Network for real-time data delivery, customizable Prediction Agents designed for specific industries, and a decentralised infrastructure powered by DePIN. This combination of blockchain and AI aims to provide actionable insights while maintaining data security and transparency. While its concept gives it a defined niche, long-term success will depend on how effectively it executes beyond fundraising. Factors like developer engagement, integration with existing data pipelines, and competitive positioning in the AI-crypto crossover space will decide its trajectory. BlockDAG Closing in on $600M Milestone BlockDAG’s original presale roadmap targets $600 million across 45 batches, and that goal is now in clear sight. The project has already secured $373 million in sales, moving more than 25.1 billion BDAG coins into circulation before launch. The speed of this progress has been boosted by large-scale purchases early in the campaign and a growing community eager to secure positions before later price tiers take over. The current active stage is Batch 29, priced at $0.0276. For comparison, those who entered in Batch 1 have already achieved a 2,660% return. Based on a conservative near-term projection of $1, new entries at today’s price could see 3,522% ROI shortly after launch. Beyond that, speculative forecasts of $5, $10, or even $20 hint at much higher upside over time. These numbers sit on top of a foundation that is already built. The network counts more than 200,000 holders, 4,500 developers working on over 300 planned Web3 projects, and 2.5 million active users of the X1 Miner app. In addition, nearly 19,300 hardware miners have been sold, contributing close to $7.8 million to overall sales. Each completed batch not only pushes BlockDAG closer to its $600 million finish line but also reduces the supply available at lower price points. As those tiers disappear, opportunities for cost-effective entry will vanish, leaving open-market pricing to be determined by demand once the coin lists publicly. Which Project Holds the Top Crypto Presale Title? Presales often generate excitement, but the real test is what happens after the first stage of funding. BlockchainFX (BFX) has already raised $5.08 million, 92.45% of its softcap, while promoting a platform that offers daily staking rewards, instant swaps, and a 500+ asset trading lineup. It shows promise, but still faces the adoption test once it launches. Ozak AI is nearing the $2 million mark in Stage 4, with a technology stack designed to merge blockchain and AI-driven analytics. It has an interesting product direction, but must execute effectively after fundraising to stand out in an increasingly competitive market. BlockDAG, on the other hand, combines presale acceleration with a visible and functioning ecosystem. At $0.0276 in Batch 29, early participants from Batch 1 are already up 2,660%, while current buyers could see 3,522% ROI if the coin reaches $1 post-launch. With 200,000 holders, thousands of developers building on its network, and millions mining before the mainnet is even live, BlockDAG’s track record makes it the strongest contender for the top crypto presale right now.

50051654,555365,1755129650,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50051654.jpeg,Bitcoin Treasury Company Metaplanet Reports Strongest Quarter Ever,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-treasury-metaplanet-strongest-quarter-ever/,"Bitcoin treasury firm Metaplanet has just delivered its strongest quarter ever, with revenue rising by 41% compared to the previous quarter. Metaplanet Has Seen A Sharp Flip In Net Income In a new post on X, Metaplanet has shared the numbers related to its Q2 2024 performance, revealing significant quarter-over-quarter growth in several key metrics. The Japanese company recorded a revenue of ¥1.239 billion ($8.4 million) and gross profit of ¥816 million ($5.5 million), up 41% and 38% compared to the last quarter, respectively. The bigger story, however, is the dramatic turnaround in ordinary profit and net income. The former stood at a loss of ¥6.9 billion in Q1, but flipped to a profit of ¥17.4 billion ($117.8 million) in Q2. Similarly, the latter went from -¥5.0 million to +¥11.1 billion ($75.1 million). The firm’s net assets also surged to ¥201.0 billion ($1.36 billion), corresponding to a quarter-over-quarter increase of a whopping 299%. “This is the strongest quarter in Metaplanet’s history,” commented Simon Gerovich, the company’s president. Metaplanet, which transitioned to a Bitcoin treasury model last year, says its strategy is simple: “to prudently and rapidly accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible on behalf of our shareholders.” This approach is similar to the one adopted by Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly Microstrategy). In the past quarter, the strategy has seemingly worked out for Metaplanet, with its record-breaking quarter being backed by the appreciation of its BTC reserves and continued accumulation efforts. On Tuesday, Gerovich announced a new acquisition for the company involving 518 BTC. These tokens were bought at an average price of $118,519, meaning the total stack cost the firm $61.4 million. Following this purchase, Metaplanet’s Bitcoin reserve has grown to 18,113 BTC, with a cost basis of $1.85 billion. At the current exchange rate, these holdings are worth $2.18 billion, putting the firm into a profit of 17.8%. While treasuries like Strategy and Metaplanet are busy buying, some veteran players in the market have been using the bull run prices to sell, as revealed by institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) in an X post . From the above chart, it’s visible that Bitcoin long-term holders have been shedding their holdings recently. This isn’t anything unusual, as the diamond hands of the sector have historically moved to take their hard-earned profits during major bull rallies. What’s different this time, however, is the fact that the selloff has been more gradual than previous cycles. Only time will, though, whether this is an indication that the current cycle is going to be different or if this fact will have no effect on its length. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $120,200, up more than 5% over the last seven days.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Treasury|btc|BTCUSDT|Metaplanet|Metaplanet Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-14 00:00:50

A significant development has just emerged from South Korea: Upbit, a leading crypto exchange, has officially launched its dedicated Upbit Custody platform. This groundbreaking service is specifically designed to meet the sophisticated demands of institutional crypto investors , marking a pivotal moment for digital asset security in the region. What is Upbit Custody and Why Does it Matter? Upbit Custody is more than just a storage solution; it’s a comprehensive crypto custody platform built with enterprise-grade security in mind. Operated directly by Upbit, it provides a trusted environment for corporations and institutions looking to safeguard their valuable digital assets. This launch underscores the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency market, as institutional participation increasingly relies on secure and compliant infrastructure. The platform’s core strength lies in its commitment to secure digital asset storage . Unlike typical online wallets, Upbit Custody utilizes dedicated offline wallets.

This growth presents a potential opportunity for digital assets such as XRP, which offers low-cost, fast transactions and could be integrated into QR wallet systems to facilitate payments in these underserved regions. Global QR-based payment volumes reached approximately $5.4 trillion in 2024, according to industry data, and are projected by Juniper Research to grow to around $8 trillion by 2029. Currently, QR codes account for nearly half of all mobile wallet transactions worldwide, making them a critical component of digital payment infrastructure. XRP Price Projections in a QR Wallet Adoption Scenario If XRP were to gain significant traction in the QR payment sector, market models suggest substantial price growth could follow. One projection, based on a payment utility framework, estimates that if XRP processed 10% of global QR-based transactions by 2029, equivalent to about $800 billion annually, its utility-based value would be approximately $0.674 per token. However, because cryptocurrency markets often trade at values above their utility price due to investor speculation, applying a market behaviour multiplier suggests a potential range of $6.74 to $33.70. A second projection focuses on capital inflows that could result from widespread adoption. If QR wallet usage in rural and offline markets generates $200 billion in new investment into XRP, historical patterns indicate that such inflows could significantly expand the market capitalization. Using a market growth factor observed in past crypto cycles, the projected valuation would rise to around $4.175 trillion, translating to an estimated XRP price of roughly $70.38 . This figure represents an aggressive growth scenario in which XRP plays a central role in digital payments across developing economies. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Global Indicators Supporting QR Payment Growth Current trends reinforce the expectation that QR wallets will continue expanding, particularly in regions with large unbanked populations. In India, for example, rural and semi-urban areas accounted for 60% of all transactions processed through the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) by 2023. Transaction volumes rose from 18 million in 2017 to over 8 billion in 2023, with total value increasing from $16.7 billion to $1.7 trillion in the same period. In the Asia-Pacific region, digital wallets handled almost two-thirds of global mobile payments in 2023, totaling $9.8 trillion. In Africa, mobile payment platforms such as M-Pesa reported a 32% increase in active users last year, with QR-based solutions contributing to that growth. Technological advancements now enable QR payments to be made without a constant internet connection, utilizing offline methods such as static codes and Bluetooth. These capabilities are particularly valuable for merchants, farmers, and small traders in rural settings, enabling cashless transactions even in areas with limited connectivity. If adoption in these markets continues at its current pace, XRP’s integration into QR wallet systems could position it as a key player in the future of global digital payments.

This incredible milestone highlights Bitcoin’s growing influence and its undeniable presence in the modern financial landscape, signaling a significant shift in how we perceive value and investment in the digital age. What Does This Astounding Bitcoin Market Cap Achievement Mean? This remarkable ascent signifies more than just numbers; it represents a fundamental shift in how the world perceives Bitcoin . For years, skeptics questioned its long-term viability, yet its consistent growth has defied expectations. Reaching the fifth spot globally by Bitcoin market cap places it alongside established behemoths such as gold, silver, and major corporations, underscoring its maturity as a significant financial instrument. It validates the belief held by many early adopters that Bitcoin is not merely a passing fad but a revolutionary force. Validation: This achievement offers strong validation for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, demonstrating the potential for decentralized digital currencies to compete with traditional assets. Mainstream Acceptance: Surpassing a household name like Google in market capitalization brings Bitcoin further into mainstream consciousness, potentially attracting new investors and institutional interest. Economic Impact: As Bitcoin’s influence grows, its movements can have broader implications for global financial markets, impacting investment strategies and wealth management. The Journey: How Bitcoin Became a Leading Digital Asset How did Bitcoin achieve such a monumental feat? Its journey began over a decade ago as a decentralized digital currency, free from traditional banking systems. Initially viewed with skepticism and largely confined to tech enthusiasts, Bitcoin gradually gained traction. Over time, it has evolved into a recognized store of value, often dubbed ‘ digital gold ‘ by proponents. This evolution has attracted both individual investors seeking alternative investments and large institutions looking to diversify their portfolios. The increasing institutional interest, coupled with growing mainstream acceptance, fuels its continued climb as a prominent digital asset . Major corporations, investment funds, and even some countries are now exploring or adopting Bitcoin, further solidifying its position. This sustained interest, despite periods of volatility, demonstrates a fundamental belief in its long-term potential and its role in a digitized future. Is Bitcoin Truly the New Digital Gold? Navigating the Future Many investors now view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, much like traditional gold. Its finite supply, transparent ledger, and decentralized nature make it an appealing alternative for wealth preservation in an increasingly uncertain global economy. While its volatility remains a factor, the long-term trend suggests a strong correlation with its perceived value as a scarce digital asset . This narrative strengthens its position within the broader financial ecosystem, offering a compelling alternative to traditional safe-haven assets. The broader cryptocurrency market is inherently dynamic, and Bitcoin leads the charge. While its ascent is impressive, understanding the nuances of this market is crucial. Investors should always consider market volatility, regulatory developments, and technological advancements when engaging with digital assets. However, Bitcoin’s consistent performance in achieving new milestones, like its current ranking among global assets , demonstrates its resilience and potential for future growth. The future will likely see continued innovation and integration of digital assets into everyday finance. The fact that Bitcoin market cap has eclipsed major corporations like Google is a testament to its disruptive power and increasing acceptance. It solidifies Bitcoin’s role not just as a niche technology, but as a formidable player in the global financial arena. As the world continues to embrace digital transformation, Bitcoin’s journey from an obscure internet currency to a top-tier global asset is truly extraordinary. This milestone invites us all to consider the evolving nature of wealth and the remarkable potential of decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is market capitalization? Market capitalization, or market cap, is the total value of a company’s or asset’s outstanding shares or units. For Bitcoin, it’s calculated by multiplying the current price of one Bitcoin by the total number of Bitcoins in circulation. Q2: Why is Bitcoin’s market cap surpassing Google significant? It’s significant because it demonstrates Bitcoin’s growing economic influence and its increasing acceptance as a legitimate asset class, putting it on par with some of the world’s largest and most established corporations. Q3: Is Bitcoin considered a ‘global asset’? Yes, Bitcoin is increasingly recognized as a global asset due to its worldwide accessibility, decentralized nature, and ability to be traded across borders without traditional intermediaries. Its market cap ranking further solidifies this status. Q4: What factors contribute to Bitcoin’s market cap growth? Key factors include increasing institutional adoption, growing retail investor interest, its finite supply (21 million coins), its role as a hedge against inflation, and its continuous technological development. Q5: What are the risks associated with investing in Bitcoin? While promising, Bitcoin investments carry risks such as high price volatility, potential regulatory changes, security concerns (e.g., hacks), and market manipulation.

The recent surge has had ripple effects across the broader crypto landscape—benefiting not only large-cap Layer-1 chains but also boosting attention toward emerging altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE , which is currently in the final phase of its presale. While Solana captures headlines for its robust infrastructure and DeFi liquidity, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing increasing interest from the opposite end of the market: early-stage, high-upside retail speculation. Solana DeFi TVL Hits $14.18 Billion As of August 11, 2025, Solana’s DeFi TVL reached $14.18 billion , up from $10.45 billion just three weeks prior—representing a 36% increase and a 60% gain from prior Q2 lows. The growth has been fueled by a sharp rise in SOL’s market price, which is trading near $195.50, and heightened activity on key protocols like Raydium, Orca, and Meteora , which collectively processed over $22 billion in DEX volume during a single week. Stablecoin inflows have also played a significant role, particularly USDC , which now represents more than 70% of Solana’s stablecoin market share. Analysts attribute this institutional inflow and liquidity growth to Solana’s improving network reliability, ongoing scalability upgrades, and its success in securing strategic partnerships with asset managers and infrastructure firms. While the TVL increase is partly price-driven, the network’s growing user base and expanding DeFi infrastructure point to deeper fundamental growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A High-Risk Contender in a Rising Market In parallel to the institutional rally lifting chains like Solana, a markedly different trend is unfolding at the speculative end of the market. MAGACOIN FINANCE , an emerging altcoin with meme aesthetics but structured tokenomics, has advanced through multiple presale stages and is approaching full allocation. While it does not yet participate in DeFi activity like Solana or Ethereum, its strategic positioning as a low-cap, high-potential launch gives it a different kind of relevance in the current market cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE has successfully completed an independent audit conducted by leading blockchain security firms, receiving a strong rating for its smart contract integrity and overall protocol safety. The audit confirms that MAGACOIN’s codebase meets high security standards, providing investors with greater confidence ahead of its presale completion and official launch. Looking Ahead If current trends continue, Solana is on track to challenge Ethereum’s dominance in DeFi user activity, particularly among fast-moving, cost-sensitive protocols. However, the spotlight is also expanding to include new-generation tokens that represent retail-driven momentum and meme-era virality—now refined through more transparent and deflationary token models. As institutional demand lifts top-tier altcoins , and retail appetite fuels presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE , the remainder of 2025 could showcase not just a market recovery—but a rebalancing between infrastructure and community-led innovation.

Google just provided a significant update regarding its Google Play crypto policy , specifically clarifying the rules for non-custodial wallets . This crucial announcement brings much-needed clarity and relief to the digital asset space. What Sparked the Confusion Around Google Play Store Crypto? Earlier reports caused a stir within the cryptocurrency community. News outlets suggested that Google Play Store would soon require all software wallet developers to obtain a license before publishing their crypto wallet apps. This created uncertainty for many developers and users alike. The initial understanding was that Google’s new policy aimed to “ensure a safe and compliant ecosystem for users.” However, the broad interpretation led to concerns about the future of self-custody tools on the platform. Google’s Official Stance on Non-Custodial Wallets Google quickly addressed the widespread speculation. Through its official “News from Google” account on X, the tech giant issued a definitive statement. It confirmed that “ non-custodial wallets are not in scope of Google Play’s Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Software Wallets Policy.” This clarification means that apps facilitating true self-custody, where users retain full control over their private keys, are exempt from the new licensing requirements. Google also announced it is updating its Help Center to reflect this important distinction, providing transparent information to developers and users. How Does This Clarification Impact the Crypto Wallet Policy? This update significantly impacts the landscape for crypto applications on Google Play. It creates a clear distinction between custodial services and non-custodial wallets . Here’s what this means: Reduced Burden for Developers: Developers of self-custody apps will not need to navigate complex cryptocurrency licenses to publish their applications. This fosters innovation and lowers barriers to entry. User Empowerment: Users retain easy access to tools that promote self-sovereignty over their digital assets. This aligns with the core principles of decentralization in the crypto world. Clearer Regulatory Lines: The clarification helps differentiate between entities that hold user funds (like centralized exchanges, which may still require licenses) and those that simply provide tools for users to manage their own assets. The policy initially applied to 15 jurisdictions, including the EU and the U.S. This broad scope made the clarification even more critical for global developers and users. What’s Next for Cryptocurrency Licenses and App Development? Google’s swift response demonstrates its commitment to fostering a secure yet innovative environment. The company’s focus remains on creating a safe space for users, while also understanding the nuances of the blockchain ecosystem. This decision on the Google Play crypto policy ensures that developers can continue building essential self-custody tools without undue regulatory pressure. It promotes a healthier balance between regulation and technological freedom. In conclusion, Google’s explicit statement regarding non-custodial wallets is a positive development for the entire crypto community. It provides essential clarity, reduces uncertainty, and supports the continued growth of decentralized applications on the Google Play Store. This move helps to reinforce trust and understanding within the evolving digital asset landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main difference between a custodial and a non-custodial wallet? A custodial wallet means a third party holds your private keys and controls your funds, similar to a bank. A non-custodial wallet gives you full control over your private keys and, therefore, your digital assets, meaning only you can access them. Q2: Why did Google introduce this crypto wallet policy in the first place? Google introduced the policy to ensure a safer and more compliant ecosystem for users on its Play Store. This aims to protect users from fraudulent activities and ensure financial service apps meet necessary regulatory standards, especially for services that custody user funds. Q3: Which jurisdictions are affected by Google’s Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Software Wallets Policy? The policy applies to 15 jurisdictions globally, including major regions like the European Union (EU) and the United States (U.S.). This broad application makes Google’s clarification on non-custodial wallets particularly impactful. Q4: Does this mean all crypto apps are now unregulated on Google Play? No, this clarification specifically exempts non-custodial wallets from the licensing requirements. Apps that function as cryptocurrency exchanges or provide custodial services may still be subject to strict licensing and regulatory policies, depending on the jurisdiction. Q5: Where can developers find the updated Google Play crypto policy information? Google is updating its Help Center to reflect this clarification. Developers should refer to the official Google Play policy documentation for the most current and detailed information regarding app requirements and cryptocurrency licenses .

When the index climbs into the ‘Greed’ territory, it often indicates a period of strong buying interest and positive momentum. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Really Measure? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index operates on a scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 represents ‘Extreme Fear,’ indicating that investors are very worried and likely selling their assets. Conversely, a score of 100 signifies ‘Extreme Greed,’ suggesting that the market is overbought and potentially due for a correction. The current score of 75 sits comfortably within the ‘Greed’ bracket, signalling widespread optimism. This comprehensive index considers six key factors to determine the prevailing crypto market sentiment : Volatility (25%): Measures current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it with average values. Social Media (15%): Scans various social media platforms for crypto-related hashtags and sentiment analysis. Surveys (15%): Gathers investor sentiment through weekly polls. (Note: Currently, this factor is paused). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Assesses Bitcoin’s market share. A rising Bitcoin dominance often indicates a shift from altcoins to Bitcoin, which can signal caution. Google Trends (10%): Examines search query trends for crypto-related terms, indicating public interest. Why is ‘Greed’ Dominating Crypto Market Sentiment Now? The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 75 reflects a prevailing positive outlook across the digital asset space. Several factors likely contribute to this elevated sense of ‘Greed’. Often, sustained price increases in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum can fuel optimism. When prices are consistently moving upwards, investors feel more confident, leading to increased buying activity and a general sense of euphoria. Moreover, positive news cycles, increased institutional adoption, or even anticipation of future market events can significantly boost crypto market sentiment . High trading volumes coupled with strong momentum, as measured by the index, suggest that a large number of participants are actively engaging in the market with a bullish bias. This collective enthusiasm can create a self-reinforcing cycle, pushing the index further into the ‘Greed’ zone. Navigating the Market: Understanding Bitcoin Dominance and Investor Psychology Understanding the components of the index is crucial for effective market analysis . For instance, Bitcoin dominance plays a nuanced role. While a rising index indicates overall greed, a significant increase in Bitcoin’s market share might suggest that investors are moving away from riskier altcoins towards the perceived safety of Bitcoin. This could be a sign of cautious optimism rather than pure speculative frenzy. Furthermore, understanding investor psychology is paramount, especially when the market leans towards ‘Greed’. While it feels good to be part of a rising market, periods of extreme greed can precede market corrections. Historically, when the index hits very high ‘Greed’ or ‘Extreme Greed’ levels, it often signals that the market might be overheated. Smart investors often consider this a time to exercise caution, rather than blindly following the crowd. Beyond the Numbers: Practical Market Analysis Tips The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool, but it should not be your only guide for market analysis . Think of it as a compass for sentiment, not a definitive map for trading. Here are some practical tips: Combine with Other Tools: Use the index alongside technical analysis (chart patterns, indicators) and fundamental analysis (project developments, real-world utility). Understand Context: A high ‘Greed’ score might be sustainable during a strong bull run, but it could also signal an an impending pullback during more volatile periods. Manage Emotions: The index highlights collective emotion. Your goal should be to make rational decisions, not emotional ones. Avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) when the market is overly optimistic. Risk Management: Always prioritize sound risk management strategies, regardless of the index’s reading. In conclusion, the ascent of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 75 underscores a vibrant and optimistic period in the crypto market. While this ‘Greed’ phase reflects strong positive sentiment and buying interest, it also serves as a subtle reminder for investors to remain vigilant. By understanding the underlying factors of the index and balancing emotional indicators with thorough market analysis, participants can navigate the dynamic crypto landscape more effectively. Staying informed and making rational decisions, even amidst collective enthusiasm, is key to long-term success in this exciting space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current sentiment of the cryptocurrency market, ranging from ‘Extreme Fear’ to ‘Extreme Greed’ on a scale of 0 to 100. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? It is calculated based on six weighted factors: volatility, market momentum/volume, social media activity, surveys (currently paused), Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends data. What does a ‘Greed’ reading mean for investors? A ‘Greed’ reading, like the current 75, indicates that investors are feeling optimistic and are actively buying. While positive, extreme greed can sometimes signal an overbought market that may be due for a correction. Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable trading tool? While valuable for understanding market sentiment, the index is not a standalone trading signal. It should be used in conjunction with other forms of market analysis, such as technical and fundamental analysis, to make informed decisions. How does Bitcoin dominance affect the index? Bitcoin dominance, which measures Bitcoin’s market share, is one of the factors influencing the index. A high Bitcoin dominance, especially when combined with high ‘Greed’, can sometimes suggest a shift towards Bitcoin as a safer asset, even amidst overall market optimism.

The program, known as “Sovereign Brazil,” provides 30 billion reais ($5.5 billion) in credit along with other steps intended to ease the blow. Just hours later, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced more sanctions on Brazilian officials, showing that tensions between the two countries were rising, as reported by Associated Press . President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva outlined the initiative as an initial effort to assist affected exporters, with a legislative proposal to be sent to Congress for approval. Lawmakers from different political factions attended the event in Brasília, the first such gathering in months, which observers viewed as a sign of greater political cohesion in response to U.S. trade actions. The plan involves postponing certain tax obligations for companies harmed by the U.S. tariffs, assigning 5 billion reais ($930 million) in tax credits to small and medium-sized enterprises until the close of 2026, and broadening insurance coverage for orders that get cancelled. It also directs public institutions to purchase goods that can no longer be shipped to the U.S. A one-year extension will be granted for tax credits under Brazil’s “drawback” scheme, allowing companies to import materials without tax if used in producing goods for export. Lula calls U.S. move “unpleasant” “We cannot be scared, nervous and anxious when there is a crisis. A crisis is for us to create new things,” Lula said. He called the U.S. move “unpleasant” and argued the justifications for the sanctions “do not exist.” Trump has tied the tariff decision to legal proceedings against his political ally, former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest. Lula accused Washington of using human rights rhetoric as a political instrument, adding that Brazil would seek out new markets for its products. Trump has repeated claims made by Bolsonaro’s supporters that the former president’s prosecution for allegedly attempting to overturn the 2022 election is a violation of due process and a politically motivated effort. Lula responded that Brazil’s judiciary functions independently, free from interference by the executive branch. He emphasized that Supreme Court justices have publicly affirmed they will not yield to political pressure. Bolsonaro’s trial is expected to reach sentencing between September and October. Earlier this month, Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is presiding over Bolsonaro’s case, was sanctioned under the U.S. Magnitsky Act, which targets major human rights violators. De Moraes stated that all defendants were afforded due process and pledged to continue his work despite the sanctions. Shortly after Lula’s remarks, Rubio said the U.S. would restrict visas for officials from Cuba and other governments connected to what he called Cuba’s “exploitative labor export program.” He singled out Brazil’s “Mais Médicos” (More Doctors) program, introduced in 2013, which brought thousands of Cuban medical professionals to underserved parts of the country. Rubio labeled the initiative a “diplomatic scam,” while Brazil’s government maintains that nearly 25,000 doctors are currently working in the program, though it did not specify the number of Cubans among them. Despite the rising tensions, Lula said he would not immediately trigger Brazil’s reciprocity law to raise tariffs on U.S. products. “We like to negotiate. We don’t want conflict,” he said. “The only thing we need to demand is that our sovereignty is untouchable.” Finance Minister Fernando Haddad told attendees that Brazil “is being sanctioned for being more democratic than its aggressor.” The diplomatic dispute shows no signs of cooling, with both countries continuing to exchange measures and accusations while Brazilian exporters wait to see the effects of the new support program.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, Bitcoin (BTC) has achieved an astonishing milestone, soaring above the $124,000 mark. Currently, BTC is trading at an impressive $124,050 on the Binance USDT market. This remarkable Bitcoin price surge has captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, signaling a potentially new era for digital assets. It represents a significant moment, showcasing the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the crypto market. What’s Fueling This Remarkable Bitcoin Price Surge? When Bitcoin experiences such a dramatic ascent, several factors typically contribute to the momentum. A powerful combination of strong buying pressure and overwhelmingly positive market sentiment often drives these movements. Moreover, increased institutional interest can play a pivotal role, as large-scale investments bring substantial capital into the ecosystem. This influx of funds strengthens the overall market, propelling prices upward. Technical indicators also provide valuable insights. Breakouts above key resistance levels can trigger further buying, as traders and algorithms react to these signals. The narrative of Bitcoin’s scarcity, especially with its fixed supply, also continues to attract investors looking for a store of value. Consequently, these combined forces can ignite a powerful cryptocurrency rally , drawing in new participants and reinforcing the upward trend. Navigating the Current BTC Market Update While the excitement of a rapid ascent is undeniable, understanding the market dynamics is crucial. This significant BTC market update highlights the inherent volatility of digital assets. Prices can move swiftly in both directions, presenting both immense opportunities and considerable risks for participants. Therefore, a measured approach to Bitcoin trading is always advisable, regardless of market conditions. For those engaging in Bitcoin trading , careful consideration of strategies is essential. Here are some key aspects to remember: Stay Informed: Continuously monitor market news and analysis. Knowledge empowers better decision-making. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders to limit potential downsides. Diversify: While Bitcoin leads, a diversified portfolio across various digital assets can mitigate risk. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Understand your investment horizon. Short-term trading requires active monitoring, while long-term holding may weather market fluctuations. This current market environment demands diligence and a clear strategy. The Ripple Effect: Unlocking Digital Asset Gains Bitcoin’s performance often acts as a barometer for the broader cryptocurrency market. When BTC experiences a substantial Bitcoin price surge , it frequently creates a positive ripple effect across other digital assets. Altcoins, which are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, often see their values appreciate as investor confidence grows and capital flows from Bitcoin into these alternative assets. This phenomenon can lead to widespread digital asset gains throughout the entire ecosystem. A robust Bitcoin rally can also signal increased mainstream acceptance and adoption of blockchain technology. This wider acceptance, in turn, can attract more developers, businesses, and users to the decentralized space, fostering innovation and further growth. Consequently, the entire digital economy benefits, reinforcing the potential for sustained expansion and broader recognition. This interconnectedness means that Bitcoin’s success often paves the way for a healthier and more vibrant overall crypto landscape. What Does This Mean for Your Portfolio? As the market experiences this exciting period of digital asset gains , it is natural to consider its implications for personal investments. For existing holders, it might represent a validation of their long-term conviction. For prospective investors, it could signal a compelling entry point, albeit one that still requires careful consideration of personal risk tolerance. Always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions. The dynamic nature of the market means that opportunities are always evolving, but so are the potential challenges. In conclusion, the recent Bitcoin price surge above $124,000, as reported by Bitcoin World market monitoring, marks a truly exciting moment in the cryptocurrency space. It underscores the incredible potential of digital assets and the ever-evolving landscape of decentralized finance. While the journey of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be volatile, their ability to reach new highs continues to inspire and challenge traditional financial paradigms. Staying informed, exercising caution, and understanding market trends are key to navigating this thrilling environment.

Diversifying portfolios and understanding personal risk tolerance are crucial when navigating a dynamic market during this exciting BTC market update . What are the risks associated with such a rapid cryptocurrency rally? Rapid rallies can be followed by significant corrections.

The Justin Sun lawsuit has just been filed, seeing the prominent Tron founder take on a major media powerhouse, Bloomberg. This legal action centers on the alleged planned release of highly sensitive financial information , sparking widespread discussion about privacy in the digital asset space. What exactly is happening, and what does this mean for the crypto community? What’s Behind the Justin Sun Lawsuit? Tron founder Justin Sun, a well-known figure in the blockchain industry, has initiated a legal challenge against Bloomberg. The core of this Justin Sun lawsuit stems from Bloomberg’s alleged intention to publish personal financial details belonging to Sun. According to a court filing, as cited by the X account “zoomer” (which boasts over 61,000 followers), this information is considered highly sensitive. This development immediately raises questions about the boundaries of financial reporting and individual privacy. It highlights the increasing tension between public interest in transparency and the right to keep personal financial dealings confidential, especially for high-profile individuals in the often-scrutinized crypto sector. The Stakes: Why is Crypto Privacy So Crucial? The concept of crypto privacy is a cornerstone for many in the digital asset space. While blockchain transactions are often public, the identities behind them are typically pseudonymous. However, when a major news outlet plans to reveal personal sensitive financial information , it touches upon fundamental concerns. Individual Rights: Everyone, regardless of their public profile, has an expectation of privacy regarding their personal finances. Security Concerns: The exposure of detailed financial data can potentially lead to security risks, including targeting for scams or hacks. Industry Perception: How such cases are handled can influence public trust in the crypto industry’s ability to protect its participants’ data. This case serves as a critical test for these principles within the evolving landscape of digital finance and media. Examining the Bloomberg Lawsuit The Bloomberg lawsuit brings a significant media entity into the legal spotlight. Bloomberg is renowned globally for its financial news and data services. Their alleged intention to publish this information suggests they believe it falls within the realm of public interest or newsworthiness. Conversely, Justin Sun’s legal team is arguing that such a publication constitutes an unwarranted invasion of privacy. The legal battle will likely hinge on the definition of “sensitive financial information” and whether its public disclosure serves a legitimate public interest that outweighs an individual’s right to privacy. This clash of interests is a common theme in high-profile media disputes. Implications for the Tron Founder and Beyond For the Tron founder , Justin Sun, this lawsuit is more than just a personal matter; it carries broader implications for his public image and the projects he leads, including Tron and BitTorrent. Such legal disputes can divert attention and resources, though they also underscore a commitment to protecting personal data. Beyond Sun, this case could set precedents for how media outlets report on the financial dealings of prominent figures in the cryptocurrency space. It may also influence how individuals, particularly those with significant crypto holdings, manage their public and private financial profiles. The outcome of the Justin Sun lawsuit will be closely watched by many. Navigating Sensitive Financial Information in Crypto The debate surrounding sensitive financial information is particularly complex in the crypto world. While many advocate for decentralization and pseudonymity, there’s also a growing push for transparency, especially concerning large holders or projects. This lawsuit highlights the delicate balance that needs to be struck for crypto privacy . Users and project founders in the crypto space often face unique challenges in maintaining privacy while operating in a largely open ledger environment. This legal action serves as a stark reminder of the potential for personal financial data to become a point of contention, necessitating robust legal and personal strategies for protection. What’s Next in This Developing Story? As the Justin Sun lawsuit unfolds, legal proceedings will determine the fate of this sensitive financial information. The outcome will have significant ramifications, not just for Justin Sun and Bloomberg, but for the broader discussion around media freedom, individual privacy, and the evolving nature of financial reporting in the digital age. We will continue to monitor this developing situation closely. The resolution of this Bloomberg lawsuit could shape future interactions between public figures in crypto and the media, impacting how personal financial data is handled and reported across the industry. In summary, the legal action taken by Tron founder Justin Sun against Bloomberg over the publication of his sensitive financial information marks a pivotal moment. It underscores the ongoing tension between media transparency and individual privacy rights, especially within the cryptocurrency sector. The outcome of this case will undoubtedly influence future discussions and practices regarding financial data and public figures in crypto. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Justin Sun? A: Justin Sun is the founder of Tron, a prominent blockchain platform, and a well-known figure in the cryptocurrency industry. Q2: What is Bloomberg accused of in the lawsuit? A: Bloomberg is accused by Justin Sun of planning to release his “sensitive financial information” without authorization. Q3: Why is this Justin Sun lawsuit important for crypto privacy? A: This lawsuit highlights the ongoing debate about individual financial privacy versus media transparency in the cryptocurrency space, potentially setting precedents for how personal financial data of crypto figures is handled. Q4: What is considered “sensitive financial information” in this context? A: While the exact details are part of the legal proceedings, it generally refers to personal financial data that, if disclosed, could lead to privacy breaches, security risks, or undue public scrutiny. Q5: What could be the potential outcomes of the Bloomberg lawsuit? A: The lawsuit could result in an injunction preventing the publication of the information, a settlement, or a court ruling that defines the boundaries of media reporting on private financial data, impacting future cases involving public figures in crypto.

In the past week, huge sums have flowed into Cardano, Avalanche, and Ethereum, sparking fresh speculation about where these assets could be heading next. From multi-million-dollar token buys to record-breaking on-chain numbers, the signs point to renewed whale interest. While the bigger names grab headlines, a new entrant called MAGACOIN FINANCE is also catching attention, with its fast-shrinking allocation supply adding urgency for those looking for the next breakout. Cardano and Avalanche Attract Heavy Buying Cardano has been in the spotlight following huge holders buying around 200 million ADA, worth around $166 million. It’s one of the largest accumulation periods of ADA over the past couple of months. Those wallets that are undertaking these shifts each contained between 100 million and 1 billion ADA, and their inclination to give more is raising eyebrows from traders following Cardano price prediction trends. Avalanche has also attracted media coverage for non-price reasons. In the third quarter, it hit an all-time high of 7.3 million in monthly active addresses, a clear sign that more individuals are engaging with the network.

Imagine the potential for significant growth! However, as the U.S. government allows more avenues for such participation, a crucial warning emerges for those considering crypto retirement plans . While these investments could boost portfolio efficiency, they also introduce a significant vulnerability, particularly during an economic crisis. Understanding Crypto Retirement Plans and Their Appeal Many investors are attracted to the high-growth potential of digital assets. They see cryptocurrency investments as a way to supercharge their long-term savings. The allure of quick gains or substantial returns often overshadows the inherent volatility and unique risks associated with this asset class. People hope to leverage the burgeoning crypto market to secure a more prosperous future. For decades, traditional retirement accounts have relied on stable, collateral-backed assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate. The introduction of cryptocurrencies represents a significant shift. This new frontier promises innovation but also brings uncharted territory for risk management within retirement portfolios. What Are the Hidden Dangers of Cryptocurrency Investments? South Korean firm Meritz Securities recently highlighted a major concern: cryptocurrencies lack collateral. Unlike traditional financial instruments, no underlying physical asset or government entity backs their value. Their prices are driven almost entirely by market sentiment, supply, and demand dynamics. This fundamental difference creates a precarious situation. According to Meritz Securities, a severe economic downturn could trigger a massive sell-off. Without collateral to underpin their value, there would be nothing to prevent crypto prices from collapsing. This scenario poses a direct threat to the stability of any retirement portfolio heavily exposed to these assets. Economic Downturn Impact: A Collateral Conundrum What happens when the global economy falters? During an economic downturn impact , investors typically seek safety in traditional, less volatile assets. Cryptocurrencies, by their very nature, tend to move in tandem with riskier assets, often experiencing amplified price swings. Consider these key differences: Lack of Intrinsic Value: Cryptocurrencies derive value from belief and utility, not physical backing. Market Sentiment Driven: Fear and panic can lead to rapid, uncontrolled price drops. Liquidity Concerns: In a widespread sell-off, finding buyers at reasonable prices can become challenging. Consequently, a portfolio heavily reliant on crypto could face devastating losses during a crisis, jeopardizing years of retirement savings. Mitigating Digital Asset Risks in Your Portfolio Understanding these vulnerabilities is the first step toward smart financial planning. While the potential for growth in crypto remains, a cautious approach is vital. Investors must actively manage digital asset risks within their retirement accounts. This means carefully considering the proportion of your portfolio allocated to cryptocurrencies. Financial experts often advise against putting all your eggs in one basket. For retirement savings, this advice is particularly critical. Diversifying across various asset classes can help cushion your portfolio against extreme market movements in any single sector, including volatile digital assets. Navigating Retirement Portfolio Diversification with Caution The key to a resilient retirement fund lies in intelligent retirement portfolio diversification . While including a small, speculative portion of cryptocurrencies might align with some risk appetites, it should never form the core of your retirement strategy. Traditional assets provide a foundational stability that cryptocurrencies currently cannot. Actionable Insights for Your Retirement Planning: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Understand how much volatility you can truly handle. Diversify Broadly: Include a mix of stocks, bonds, real estate, and other traditional assets. Limit Crypto Exposure: Consider a small, manageable percentage for digital assets that you are prepared to lose. Stay Informed: Continuously monitor market conditions and regulatory changes affecting cryptocurrencies. The Prudent Path Forward While the prospect of including cryptocurrencies in retirement accounts offers exciting potential, it also introduces significant, unbacked risks. The research from Meritz Securities serves as a stark reminder: during an economic crisis, the lack of collateral behind digital assets could lead to a severe price collapse. Therefore, investors must approach crypto retirement plans with extreme caution, prioritizing robust diversification and a clear understanding of the inherent volatility. Your financial future depends on making informed, balanced decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why are cryptocurrencies considered risky for retirement plans? A1: Cryptocurrencies are risky because they are not backed by collateral and their value is primarily driven by market sentiment and supply/demand. This makes them highly volatile and vulnerable to sharp price collapses, especially during economic downturns. Q2: What is the main concern raised by Meritz Securities? A2: Meritz Securities argued that in an economic crisis, the lack of collateral for cryptocurrencies means there is nothing to prevent their prices from collapsing during a severe sell-off, unlike traditional assets. Q3: How does an economic crisis impact cryptocurrency investments? A3: During an economic crisis, investors typically move towards safer assets. Cryptocurrencies, being highly speculative and lacking intrinsic value, often experience amplified price drops, potentially leading to significant losses for portfolios exposed to them. Q4: How can I mitigate digital asset risks in my retirement portfolio? A4: To mitigate risks, diversify your retirement portfolio broadly across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate). Limit your cryptocurrency exposure to a small, manageable percentage that you are comfortable losing, and continuously monitor market conditions. Q5: Is it advisable to put all my retirement savings into crypto? A5: No, it is generally not advisable to put all your retirement savings into cryptocurrencies due to their extreme volatility and lack of collateral. A balanced approach with robust diversification across traditional assets is recommended for long-term financial security. Share This Insight!

Solana (SOL) price analysis shows buyers holding firm above $173, aiming for a move toward $190. At the same time, the Polygon (POL) price chart is testing the $0.27 resistance, with a breakout likely to spark further gains. While these coins are pushing against key levels, BlockDAG (BDAG ) is already giving its community the tools they will use on launch day. With Dashboard V4 offering real-time market conditions, BDAG holders can refine strategies now instead of waiting for listings. The presale has passed $373 million, making BlockDAG’s momentum less about “waiting for the break” and more about acting early. Polygon Price Chart Hovers Near $0.27 Resistance The Polygon (POL) price chart shows the coin holding just under a major $0.27 barrier that has blocked several past attempts. After breaking above a long-term downtrend earlier this year, recent activity has formed higher lows, showing signs of steady strength. The current range is capped at $0.27 on the upside, with mid-$0.20s acting as the main support zone. Deeper support lies in the upper $0.10s to low $0.20s. A confirmed close above $0.27 with strong trading volume could trigger a move toward the low $0.30s. If price slips and fails to hold above the main support, the current consolidation could weaken, delaying any breakout. Solana Price Analysis Holds Above Key Support The Solana (SOL) price analysis highlights a rebound from the important $173 level, after briefly touching $173.43. Buyers quickly lifted it back to $175.43, with highs reaching $186.80 during the day. This recovery shows there is strong demand despite recent swings. Daily volume stands at $603.8 million, keeping market activity steady. The next major resistance is at $190, and a clear break above could set up a return to the $206.30 swing high. Until that happens, SOL appears to be consolidating above its key support while traders watch for fresh upward momentum. BlockDAG’s Dashboard V4 Gives Community Early Trading Experience BlockDAG has launched its Dashboard V4, a live trading interface that looks and works like a professional exchange. It connects wallets, streams real-time prices, and shows complete BDAG market data. This lets holders see exactly how trading will work once BDAG is listed. The presale has crossed $373 million, with over 25.1 billion BDAG coins sold across 29 batches. The current price is $0.0276, and Batch 30 will open at $0.029. Since the first batch, BDAG has climbed 2,660%, with the launch price set at $0.05. Sales also include $7.7 million worth of miners, totaling more than 19,250 units. This shows the network is ready for both trading and mining activity from day one. With each price step higher, the benefit of securing BDAG before launch grows stronger. By giving the community full access to a working trading dashboard, BlockDAG allows holders to test orders, monitor price moves, and prepare strategies under realistic market conditions. When trading officially begins, they’ll already know the platform inside out. The Best Crypto for the Future Could Already Be Moving Polygon’s price chart is pressing against $0.27, and Solana’s analysis shows bulls holding the $173 line. Both show signs of potential, but are still waiting for confirmation moves. BlockDAG is already in motion. It has raised $373 million, sold over 25.1 billion coins, and rolled out a complete trading dashboard before launch. With tools live now, it’s acting like a listed coin before even hitting the market. For those asking about the best crypto for the future, BDAG’s readiness and pace make it hard to ignore. SOL might rally, POL might break out, but BDAG is already building momentum in real time. The launch clock is ticking.

Related Reading: Ethereum Hits $4,300, Restoring Vitalik Buterin’s Crypto Billionaire Status Reports have disclosed the move came with a clear push to support the firm’s large Solana treasury, which has drawn attention from investors and rival corporate treasuries alike. Upexi Deepens Its Solana Bet According to Upexi’s own filings and public statements, the company now holds over 2 million SOL in its treasury. That stake has been built quickly through multiple purchases and capital raises, and publications place its value in the hundreds of millions of dollars depending on the SOL price used. Upexi says it is also using staking to earn yield from the holdings, a move meant to add steady income as it holds the tokens. upexi forms advisory committee, welcoming arthur hayes (@CryptoHayes) as first member arthur is cio of @maelstromfund and brings deep digital asset and institutional finance expertise committee will drive strategy, expand visibility, and unlock capital for our $SOL treasury… pic.twitter.com/lBtzxziL3r — Upexi (@UpexiTreasury) August 12, 2025 Upexi’s hiring of Arthur Hayes — a high-profile figure in crypto circles — is meant to sharpen strategy and help unlock more capital for the firm’s purchase plans. Reports say the advisory committee will guide visibility, partnerships and capital-raising for acquisitions tied to the treasury effort. The move has already helped lift investor interest in the company’s stock. Other Public Firms Join The Push Beyond Upexi, other public companies have made clear Solana bets. Based on reports, DeFi Development Corp. has increased its holdings to nearly a million SOL units after a fresh round of purchases and financing. That placement puts it among the biggest corporate Solana holders and gives it meaningful exposure to the altcoin’s price moves. Meanwhile, crypto miner BIT Mining disclosed purchases around 27,190 SOL and has said it will convert existing crypto holdings to focus on SOL while also launching a validator to stake tokens. These corporate moves are not just headlines. They represent predictable, on-balance-sheet demand that can tighten the available supply held by retail traders and exchanges. At the same time, concentrated positions raise questions about what would happen if any of these holders decided to change strategy or sell quickly.

50054676,555745,1755133258,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50054676.jpeg,Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund’s Indirect Bitcoin Exposure Reaches Over $860M,https://bitcoinist.com/norway-sovereign-wealth-indirect-bitcoin-exposure/,"Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, managed by Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), has increased its indirect holdings of Bitcoin to 7,161 BTC, valued at approximately $862.8 million as of June 30, according to new analysis from K33. This represents an 87.7% rise in the last six months and a 192.7% increase over the past year. The gains stem largely from the fund’s positions in companies with significant Bitcoin treasuries, including Strategy, Block, Coinbase, Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), and Metaplanet. K33 Head of Research Vetle Lunde explained that the calculation is based on NBIM’s shareholdings in these firms, multiplied by the amount of Bitcoin they hold. While Lunde noted the exposure is likely an outcome of NBIM’s broad, diversified investment strategy rather than a targeted bet on Bitcoin, he highlighted it as a clear example of how BTC is becoming part of mainstream financial portfolios, often by default. Growth Driven by Strategy Holdings and Corporate BTC Accumulation The most significant contributor to NBIM’s increased Bitcoin exposure is its stake in business intelligence and corporate BTC treasury firm Strategy. NBIM’s ownership in the company rose to 1.05% of its shares, valued at $1.18 billion at the end of June, up from 0.72% ($514 million) at the end of 2024. Strategy itself expanded its BTC holdings by 145,945 BTC in the first half of 2025, which added 3,340 BTC to NBIM’s indirect exposure over the same period. Additional exposure came from holdings in other public companies with sizeable Bitcoin reserves. Firms such as Block, Coinbase, MARA, and Metaplanet have increased or maintained significant BTC balances, further contributing to the upward trend. Lunde pointed out that per capita, NBIM’s Bitcoin exposure now amounts to roughly 1,387 Norwegian kroner, or about $138, for each Norwegian citizen. Broader Market Context and Currency Considerations Lunde emphasized that this growing indirect exposure aligns with a wider market pattern: any investor with a diversified equity portfolio today is likely to have some exposure to Bitcoin through corporate holdings. He expects this trend to strengthen as more companies allocate to BTC as part of their treasury strategies. “Odds are high that any index investor or broadly diversified investor currently holds a modest BTC exposure through proxies,” Lunde said, adding that the phenomenon is likely to accelerate over time. The report also placed the fund’s Bitcoin exposure within the context of BTC’s recent market performance. In US dollar terms, BTC reached an all-time high of more than $123,000 in July, up 11.9% from its January 20 level. However, gains are less pronounced in other currencies, with BTC up only 1.5% against the US dollar index and still below January highs in euros. According to Lunde, €105,600 remains a key resistance level for BTC in euro terms, highlighting the role of currency fluctuations in assessing Bitcoin’s price performance globally. NBIM’s growing indirect stake in Bitcoin demonstrates how exposure to the asset class can expand organically within large, diversified portfolios. Whether driven by deliberate allocation or as a byproduct of equity investments, the trend reflects Bitcoin’s deepening presence in global financial markets.

The Altcoin Season Index , a crucial metric for understanding cryptocurrency performance , recently hit 40. This signals a clear shift in the broader crypto market , indicating we are in a pronounced Bitcoin Season , where Bitcoin outperforms most other digital assets. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Reveal About Cryptocurrency Performance? The Altcoin Season Index serves as a vital barometer for the health and direction of the crypto market and overall cryptocurrency performance . Compiled by CoinMarketCap, it helps investors understand prevailing sentiment and asset dominance. How it works: This index measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Understanding the score: A score of 75 or higher indicates an Altcoin Season , meaning at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin. Conversely, a score of 25 or lower signifies a Bitcoin Season , where 25% or fewer altcoins have managed to outshine Bitcoin. Scores between 26 and 74 suggest a mixed or neutral market. When the index registers 40, as on August 14th, it suggests Bitcoin leads the pack, absorbing market liquidity. This indicates which assets drive momentum, rather than being a negative market sign. Why is the Crypto Market Currently in Bitcoin Season? The Altcoin Season Index ‘s recent jump to 40, reported by Bitcoin World, firmly places the crypto market in Bitcoin Season . This trend often emerges during market uncertainty, as investors flock to Bitcoin, perceiving it as a safer asset. Several factors contribute to Bitcoin’s dominance during such times: Flight to quality: In volatile environments, Bitcoin often acts as a “safe haven” within the crypto space due to its larger market capitalization. Liquidity concentration: When overall market sentiment is cautious, capital tends to consolidate into Bitcoin, leading to its outperformance. Macroeconomic factors: Broader economic conditions, like inflation concerns, can influence investor behavior, often leading to a preference for less speculative assets like Bitcoin. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for informed decisions. It helps recognize that the current environment is about Bitcoin’s gravitational pull, not individual altcoin strength. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Season: What Should Investors Consider? For investors, recognizing the ongoing Bitcoin Season is key to adapting strategies. This period presents both challenges and opportunities. While many altcoins may struggle, Bitcoin’s strength can pave the way for future altcoin rallies. Challenges: Underperformance of altcoins: Many altcoin portfolios may see stagnant or declining values relative to Bitcoin. Reduced speculative appetite: The market may be less receptive to new or unproven altcoin projects. Actionable Insights: Focus on Bitcoin: Consider accumulating Bitcoin if you believe in its long-term potential. Strategic Altcoin Selection: Prioritize altcoins with strong fundamentals, clear use cases, and established communities. Dollar-Cost Averaging: Continue to invest a fixed amount regularly to mitigate risk. Patience is a virtue during Bitcoin Season . It allows portfolio re-evaluation and strategic positioning for when tides turn towards an Altcoin Season . When Might We See Another Altcoin Season? The transition from Bitcoin Season back to an Altcoin Season is not always predictable, but it follows patterns within the broader crypto market cycle. Historically, after Bitcoin dominance, capital often flows into altcoins as investor confidence grows. Factors that could signal a return to an Altcoin Season include: Bitcoin’s Stability: A period where Bitcoin’s price stabilizes after a significant rally, allowing altcoins to catch up. Increased Risk Appetite: General improvement in macroeconomic conditions or positive crypto news. Technological Breakthroughs: Major developments within prominent altcoin ecosystems, like Ethereum upgrades, drawing attention. Declining Bitcoin Dominance: A sustained decrease in Bitcoin’s market dominance chart. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index regularly, alongside other indicators, provides valuable insights. While Bitcoin leads now, the dynamic nature of the crypto market ensures cycles will evolve. In conclusion, the Altcoin Season Index at 40 unequivocally points to a prevailing Bitcoin Season in the crypto market . This signals the current flow of capital and investor sentiment. Understanding these seasons and adapting your strategy allows you to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency performance with confidence. The crypto world is cyclical; Bitcoin dominance often sets the stage for future altcoin growth. Stay informed, strategic, and always conduct your own research.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. South Korea’s decision to shelve its central bank digital currency pilot in favor of private-sector stablecoins has sparked a wave of activities among fintechs and banks. As CoinDesk previously reported , KakaoBank is weighing both issuance and custody roles, while Upbit and Naver Pay are collaborating on a payments-focused token that could help close the “kimchi premium” gap between local and global crypto prices. The opportunity comes as Korea is moving to extend FX trading hours , allow more foreign participation in its onshore market, and position itself for inclusion in major global bond and equity indices. A regulated KRW stablecoin could fit into these modernization plans, offering faster settlement and tighter integration between banking and digital asset markets. But any Won stablecoin effort is going to run into a massive wall: Korea's currency is not fully internationalized. Since the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997, Korea has kept deliverable KRW trading entirely onshore . Foreign institutions cannot exchange won among themselves abroad, and every dollar–won transaction must be settled through domestic intermediaries under the Bank of Korea's supervision. Authorities in Seoul maintain this system to monitor speculative flows, contain volatility, and preserve monetary policy autonomy. So for a Won stablecoin to work, it would have to be only used with whitelisted, KYC-verified addresses that have some tie to Korea. If a privately issued stablecoin becomes too dominant, it can erode a country’s control over its currency, encourage “unintended dollarisation,” and weaken the central bank’s ability to manage employment and price stability, Vera Yuen, a professor at Hong Kong University's business school told CoinDesk in a note. The question is, just how useful would this on-shore only stablecoin then be? Domestic interbank transfers in Korea settle around the clock, 365 days a year. Sending money from one account to another is immediate, free, and widely used, leaving little payment friction for a KRW stablecoin to solve inside the country. Without a speed or cost advantage in domestic transfers, the token’s primary utility would lie in cross-border settlement — and that is precisely where the onshore-only rule becomes a brick wall. Taiwan faces a similar dilemma. The island's central bank does not impose capital controls on the economy—the Taiwan dollar (NTD) is freely convertible—but it also can't be used offshore, making it of questionable utility as a stablecoin . An NTD-pegged token would be bound by Taiwan’s stablecoin framework issued in June , which requires local bank issuance, 100% onshore reserves, and central bank oversight with foreign exchange reporting, which are designed to stop it from becoming an unregulated channel for moving NTD value abroad. One day, a Won, and NTD, stablecoin may emerge, but its utility will likely be confined largely to domestic use rather than the global crypto market, so it'll play a very niche role. It'd be a different story for a Hong Kong Dollar stablecoin as the currency, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, has no restrictions on being used abroad. Right now, it's wait a wait-and-see mode to determine how much demand there is for non-USD stablecoins and what role they will play in the broader crypto economy. Market Movers BTC: BTC is trading at 123,901.58, supported by broader market momentum as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hover near record highs on softer inflation signals and speculation of Fed easing. ETH: ETH is getting ready to challenge its all-time high, trading above $4700. Gold: Gold rose 0.3% to $3,356.98 as mild U.S. inflation data boosted expectations for a Fed rate cut next month and increased the odds of further easing this year. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets opened mixed Thursday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 0.31% after hitting a record high in the prior session . S&P 500: U.S. stocks climbed Wednesday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting new records as steady inflation data fueled expectations for two Fed rate cuts this year.

This bold move, involving the sale of 2,496 ETH for a staggering $11.83 million in DAI, has sent ripples through the DeFi landscape. It highlights ongoing challenges in blockchain security and raises urgent questions about safeguarding digital assets. This development follows the initial $53 million exploit of Radiant Capital (RDNT), a decentralized finance protocol. The incident underscores the critical need for robust security measures within the rapidly evolving crypto ecosystem. For many, it serves as a stark reminder of the risks inherent in decentralized finance. What Exactly Happened with the Stolen ETH ? About 30 minutes ago, the attacker behind the Radiant Capital breach executed a large transaction. They successfully converted 2,496 ETH into $11.83 million in DAI. This conversion occurred at an approximate rate of $4,741 per ETH. This crucial detail was quickly identified and reported by Onchain Lens on X, a platform known for its on-chain analytics. The swiftness of the sale suggests a calculated effort by the perpetrator to liquidate the assets and obscure their trail. Such actions are common tactics used by malicious actors in the crypto space. The original exploit targeted Radiant Capital, a cross-chain lending protocol. It involved a flash loan attack that manipulated the price oracle, allowing the hacker to drain funds. This type of sophisticated attack often exploits vulnerabilities in smart contract logic or external data feeds. Who is This Crypto Hacker and What’s the Impact on DeFi Security ? While the identity of the perpetrator remains unconfirmed, suspicions point towards a group with known ties to North Korea. These state-sponsored cybercriminal organizations are increasingly active in targeting cryptocurrency platforms, using the stolen funds to bypass international sanctions. The involvement of such sophisticated actors raises serious concerns for overall DeFi security . It indicates that protocols must contend not only with individual opportunistic hackers but also with highly organized and well-funded groups. This escalating threat landscape demands enhanced vigilance and advanced protective measures from all participants in the decentralized finance sector. The impact of such exploits extends beyond financial losses. They erode user trust, deter new investment, and can trigger significant market volatility. Protecting user funds and maintaining system integrity are paramount for the continued growth and adoption of DeFi. Strengthening Blockchain Security : Lessons from the Exploit The Radiant Capital incident provides invaluable lessons for enhancing blockchain security across the entire crypto industry. It highlights several key areas where protocols and users can improve their defenses against future attacks. Consider these vital steps for bolstering security: Rigorous Audits: Regular, independent security audits of smart contracts are non-negotiable. These audits should cover all potential vulnerabilities, including reentrancy attacks, flash loan exploits, and oracle manipulations. Decentralized Oracles: Relying on multiple, decentralized oracle networks can significantly reduce the risk of price manipulation. This approach diversifies data sources and makes it harder for a single point of failure to be exploited. Community Vigilance: An active and engaged community can act as an early warning system. Encouraging bug bounties and fostering a culture of responsible disclosure helps identify and address vulnerabilities before they are exploited. Multi-Signature Wallets: For treasury and large fund movements, implementing multi-signature wallets adds an extra layer of security. This requires multiple approvals for transactions, preventing a single compromised key from leading to catastrophic losses. This incident reminds everyone that the decentralized nature of blockchain does not inherently mean invulnerability. Continuous innovation in security protocols and a proactive approach to threat detection are essential. The Path Forward for Secure DeFi The sale of the stolen ETH from the Radiant Capital exploit is a stark reminder of the persistent threats facing the decentralized finance world. It underscores the sophistication of modern crypto hacker groups and the critical importance of robust blockchain security measures. As the DeFi ecosystem continues to expand, so too does the need for unwavering commitment to security, transparency, and user protection.

A recent significant announcement from South Korea’s major trading platform, Bithumb, highlights this. Bithumb has officially declared a temporary Bithumb BERA suspension for both deposits and withdrawals of the BERA token . This crucial move, scheduled to begin at 09:00 UTC on August 27, is in direct support of an upcoming, vital Berachain upgrade . Users of the Bithumb crypto exchange should be aware of this temporary halt to their crypto deposits withdrawals activity concerning BERA, ensuring a smooth transition during this period. What’s Behind the Bithumb BERA Suspension? Bithumb, a leading Bithumb crypto exchange in South Korea, consistently prioritizes the security and stability of its platform. The decision to implement a Bithumb BERA suspension stems directly from the need to facilitate a significant network enhancement. The Berachain network, which the BERA token operates on, is undergoing a substantial upgrade. Such upgrades are essential for improving network performance, enhancing security features, and potentially introducing new functionalities. Exchanges temporarily halt services like crypto deposits withdrawals during these periods to prevent transaction errors or loss of funds that could occur if the network undergoes changes while transactions are in progress. This precautionary measure ensures a smooth transition and protects user assets on the Bithumb crypto exchange . The announcement, made on Bithumb’s official website, clearly outlines the timeline. Starting precisely at 09:00 UTC on August 27, users will be unable to send BERA into their Bithumb wallets or withdraw BERA out of them. This temporary measure impacts all holders of the BERA token on the platform, emphasizing the importance of planning ahead. Navigating Crypto Deposits and Withdrawals During Upgrades When a major network undergoes a significant overhaul, like the upcoming Berachain upgrade , temporary service interruptions for crypto deposits withdrawals are a common and necessary practice across exchanges. This isn’t unique to Bithumb or Berachain; it is standard operating procedure designed to safeguard user funds and ensure data integrity during complex technical transitions. Imagine upgrading the engine of a car while it’s still driving – it’s simply not feasible or safe. Similarly, blockchain networks require a brief pause in certain activities to implement changes effectively. This careful approach is why the Bithumb BERA suspension is crucial. Users who plan to trade or move their BERA token around the suspension period should complete their transactions well in advance of the August 27 deadline. Once the suspension is active, any attempts to deposit BERA may result in the loss of funds, as the transactions might not be recognized by the updated network.

Meanwhile, market watchers are naming MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the best cryptos to watch ahead of the next bull cycle alongside XRP. XRP ETF Approval Momentum Builds The conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC has opened the door for an inevitable XRP ETF launch. Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg, whose firm is among the ETF applicants, believes approval could come this year. He mentioned newly published listing standards by NASDAQ, NYSE, and CBOE, which would make XRP eligible once its regulated U.S. futures market surpasses six months of activity McClurg argues XRP could outperform Ethereum ETFs for three reasons: no staking opportunity cost, unmatched dominance in cross-border payments, and an exceptionally loyal community base. He said $5 billion in inflows can enter XRP market within the first month of ETF trading, beating Ethereum ETF debut figures. Polymarket odds now place ETF approval likelihood at over 88% in 2025. Price Impact Scenarios for XRP If XRP ETFs indeed attract $5 billion in inflows, the price implications could be surprising. Using market analyst Dom’s 272x market cap multiplier, the capital could push XRP’s valuation to roughly $1.546 trillion, translating to around $26 per token, far beyond the current $3.15. Even under more conservative estimates from Google’s Gemini AI, which applied 10x and 15x multipliers, XRP could still see its market cap rise to between $236.5 billion and $261.5 billion, pricing the token between $3.99 and $4.41. In both cases, these projections are a clear path to breaking the $5.50 barrier in a strong bullish environment. The real question now is whether institutional inflows will match McClurg’s projections and whether retail demand will amplify the momentum in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Best Crypto to Buy Ahead of the Bull Run Analysts are also spotlighting MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch for the next bull run. The token operates on a tax free model with transparent ERC-20 tokenomics. It is also backed by completed audits and an expanding market presence. Its initial sale phase has already outperformed many early-stage projects, which is now boosting predictions of substantial upside in the coming months. Major exchange listings are expected soon, and MAGACOIN FINANCE seeks to be a high-potential coin for those seeking strategic exposure before the next blow off top in crypto. Bottom Line XRP’s potential ETF approval could be a game-changer as forecasts range from modest gains to a multi-trillion-dollar valuation boost. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to gain traction as a “best crypto to buy” candidate ahead of 2025’s bull cycle. You can explore MAGACOIN FINANCE via the official website.

An anonymous yet powerful investor, previously observed offloading a substantial amount of Ethereum, has now made an even larger re-entry into the market. This bold move raises questions about market sentiment and the potential future direction of the Ethereum price . What Triggered This Astounding ETH Whale Repurchase? Just a week ago, a significant wallet holder sold 10,256 ETH, valued at approximately $39.336 million, at an average price of $3,835. This action caught the attention of many, as large sales can sometimes signal a bearish outlook. However, the narrative took a dramatic turn. Approximately eight hours ago, the same whale astonishingly repurchased 10,730 ETH. This latest acquisition cost a hefty $50.596 million, with an average price of $4,715 per ETH. This data comes directly from on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X, highlighting the transparency of blockchain transactions. Such a swift and substantial reversal in position is uncommon. It suggests a strong conviction about Ethereum’s immediate future or perhaps a strategic play to capitalize on perceived dips and rallies. Understanding these large ETH transactions is key to deciphering market dynamics. Deciphering Large ETH Transactions Through On-Chain Analysis The ability to track such movements comes from on-chain analysis , a powerful tool in the crypto space. This involves examining publicly available data on blockchain ledgers to gain insights into market behavior. For instance, we can see the exact amounts, addresses, and timestamps of these massive transfers. Why do these whale movements matter? Large transactions can influence the overall Ethereum price . When a whale sells, it can create selling pressure. Conversely, a major repurchase like this can signal strong demand, potentially boosting investor confidence and price momentum. It’s like watching a giant ship turn in the ocean; its movement creates ripples. This particular ETH whale repurchase serves as a prime example of how individual, large-scale actions can reflect or even drive market sentiment. It prompts observers to consider the whale’s motivation: Was it profit-taking followed by re-accumulation, or a belief that Ethereum was undervalued at its current level despite a recent rally? Lessons from a Whale’s Crypto Trading Strategy Observing such a sophisticated crypto trading strategy from a whale offers valuable insights, but also critical lessons for the average investor. Whales often have access to significant capital and potentially more advanced market insights or information. However, even their moves are not without risk. Key takeaways from this whale’s actions: Market Volatility: The rapid shift from selling to buying highlights the inherent volatility of the crypto market. Prices can change dramatically in short periods. Conviction: The whale’s decision to repurchase at a significantly higher price ($4,715 vs. $3,835) suggests strong conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value or an expectation of further short-term gains. Risk Management: While we see the successful outcome of this particular trade (so far), it’s crucial to remember that not all large trades are profitable. Every strategy carries inherent risks. For individual investors, it’s important not to blindly follow whale movements. Instead, use on-chain analysis as one piece of a larger research puzzle. Always conduct your own due diligence, understand your risk tolerance, and consider diversifying your portfolio rather than putting all your eggs in one crypto basket. This remarkable ETH whale repurchase underscores the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the crypto markets. It serves as a vivid reminder that significant capital is actively moving, constantly shaping the landscape. Whether this whale’s bold move signals a new bullish trend for the Ethereum price or is simply a speculative play, it certainly adds another fascinating chapter to the ongoing crypto narrative. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an “ETH whale repurchase”? A1: An “ETH whale repurchase” refers to a large-scale acquisition of Ethereum (ETH) by an individual or entity holding a significant amount of cryptocurrency, often enough to influence market prices. In this case, it means a whale bought back a large quantity of ETH after previously selling it. Q2: How was this whale’s activity tracked? A2: This whale’s activity was tracked using “on-chain analysis.” This involves monitoring publicly available transaction data on the Ethereum blockchain. Analysts like @EmberCN use specialized tools to identify large transactions and link them to specific wallet addresses. Q3: Does a whale’s large ETH transaction guarantee future price movement? A3: No, a whale’s large ETH transaction does not guarantee future price movement. While significant buys or sells can influence market sentiment and create short-term volatility, many factors affect the Ethereum price, including broader market trends, technological developments, and macroeconomic conditions. It’s one data point among many. Q4: What can individual investors learn from this whale’s crypto trading strategy? A4: Individual investors can learn about market volatility and the importance of conviction. However, it’s crucial to remember that whales operate with different capital levels and risk tolerances. Retail investors should focus on thorough research, understanding their own financial goals, diversifying portfolios, and avoiding impulsive decisions based solely on whale movements. Q5: What is the significance of the price difference in the whale’s buy and sell? A5: The whale sold ETH at an average of $3,835 and repurchased it at $4,715. This significant price difference ($880 higher per ETH on the buy) indicates that the whale either believes Ethereum’s value will continue to rise significantly from the repurchase price, or they were executing a complex strategy that factored in other market conditions or financial instruments.

50055505,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78317,1755135943,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Updated Timeline for XRP and Cardano ETF Approvals,https://timestabloid.com/updated-timeline-for-xrp-and-cardano-etf-approvals/,"Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, has outlined a revised outlook for when exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on XRP and Cardano could receive regulatory approval in the United States. His comments arrive as the year draws to a close and interest in the launch of additional cryptocurrency ETFs continues to grow. Regulatory Progress Sets the Stage for Approvals According to Geraci, the approval process for new altcoin ETFs could soon accelerate due to recent developments involving the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) , Nasdaq , and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). These major exchanges have submitted applications to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for standardised rules covering cryptocurrency ETF listings. The implementation of these rules would create a consistent framework for approving such products, reducing procedural delays. In addition to these regulatory filings, the exchanges have also lodged 19b-4 applications with the SEC on behalf of various asset managers, targeting ETFs for several cryptocurrencies, including XRP, Solana, and Cardano. Geraci noted that more than 75 cryptocurrency ETF applications are currently under review by the SEC. He believes that once the standardized listing rules are adopted, approval for multiple altcoin ETFs, including those for XRP and Cardano, could follow quickly. Geraci’s assessment suggests that the SEC could finalize the new ETF listing framework within the next two months. If that occurs, he expects a substantial number of new cryptocurrency ETFs to enter the market in a short period. This would mark the beginning of broader institutional access to a wider range of crypto assets. Increasing Demand for Crypto ETFs Market demand for cryptocurrency ETFs remains strong, which could benefit any new XRP and Cardano products. Geraci pointed to 2024 inflows as evidence of investor interest, with over $26 billion moving into crypto ETFs this year. Bitcoin spot ETFs accounted for $19 billion of that figure, while Ethereum spot ETFs attracted $7 billion. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Most of the recent surge in interest has come in the past several months. In July alone, Bitcoin ETFs attracted $6 billion, and Ethereum ETFs collected $5.5 billion. Ethereum products also experienced five of their most active trading days during this period, reflecting growing investor engagement. Geraci attributes this momentum to a favourable regulatory environment, citing measures such as the GENIUS Act , progress on the CLARITY Act, and recent SEC approval for in-kind creation and redemption processes for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The SEC has also launched “Project Crypto,” with Chair Paul Atkins signaling an intention to expand blockchain integration into the broader financial system. Market Expectations for XRP and Cardano ETFs Predictions from decentralized betting platform Polymarket indicate a high probability of approval for both products in 2025. The likelihood of a Cardano spot ETF being approved next year is estimated at 85%, up from 63% the previous week. For XRP, the projected approval probability before the end of 2025 stands at 79%, an increase from 66% as of August 7. Financial analysts, including those at JPMorgan , have suggested that XRP and Solana ETFs could draw between $3 billion and $8 billion in investment once approved, underscoring the significant market potential for these products. With the SEC advancing toward standardized listing requirements and demand for crypto ETFs at record levels, conditions appear promising for the launch of XRP and Cardano ETFs in the near term. If Geraci’s projected timeline holds, approvals within the next two months could position these products to capture substantial investor interest, further expanding institutional participation in the cryptocurrency market.

They confirmed a temporary Bithumb NEAR suspension for both deposits and withdrawals, a measure taken to facilitate an essential network update. This development is crucial for anyone holding or planning to transact with NEAR on the platform. Understanding the Bithumb NEAR Suspension Bithumb, a prominent player in the South Korean crypto market, officially communicated this temporary halt via its website. The suspension for NEAR token services is set to begin promptly at 03:00 UTC on August 18. This action is not uncommon in the fast-evolving world of cryptocurrency, where network upgrades are regular occurrences. Users often wonder why such suspensions happen. Exchanges like Bithumb implement these measures to ensure the safety and integrity of assets during significant network changes. A network update for a token like NEAR Protocol often involves technical improvements, security enhancements, or protocol upgrades that could affect transaction processing. Why is a NEAR Protocol Network Update Necessary? The NEAR Protocol network update is the primary reason behind Bithumb’s decision. Blockchain networks, much like traditional software, require periodic maintenance and upgrades to function optimally. These updates are vital for several reasons: Enhanced Security: Updates often patch vulnerabilities, making the network more resilient against potential attacks. Improved Performance: New features or optimizations can increase transaction speed and network capacity. New Features: Developers might introduce new functionalities that improve the user experience or expand the network’s capabilities. Stability: Regular maintenance helps prevent unforeseen issues and ensures the network runs smoothly. By temporarily pausing services, Bithumb ensures that all user funds are secure and that the transition to the updated NEAR Protocol network occurs without complications. Navigating Crypto Deposit Suspension: Your Action Plan When facing a crypto deposit suspension or withdrawal halt, it is important for users to understand their options and take appropriate steps. For Bithumb users holding NEAR, here is what you should consider: Plan Ahead: If you need to deposit or withdraw NEAR tokens from Bithumb, complete these transactions before the August 18, 03:00 UTC deadline. Monitor Official Announcements: Always rely on Bithumb’s official website or communication channels for updates regarding the resumption of services. Avoid unofficial sources.

However, be cautious and only use trusted platforms. Remember, this is a temporary measure. Once the NEAR Protocol network update is successfully completed and thoroughly tested, Bithumb will resume normal services. Impact on the Bithumb Exchange Community While a temporary suspension might seem inconvenient, it reflects the Bithumb exchange ‘s commitment to maintaining a robust and secure trading environment. Such actions are standard practice across major cryptocurrency exchanges globally when significant network events occur. This proactive approach helps prevent potential losses or technical glitches that could arise from an unmanaged network transition. The community on the Bithumb exchange should view this as a necessary step for the long-term health and stability of the NEAR token on the platform. Transparency in these announcements helps users prepare and manage their assets effectively, fostering trust between the exchange and its users. Preparing for NEAR Token Withdrawals After the Update Users are naturally curious about when NEAR token withdrawals and deposits will resume.

50055984,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=189286,1755136812,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/50055984.jpeg,"Shocking Radiant Capital Exploit: Hacker Converts 4,326 ETH to $20.48M DAI",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/radiant-capital-exploit-update/,"BitcoinWorld Shocking Radiant Capital Exploit: Hacker Converts 4,326 ETH to $20.48M DAI The cryptocurrency world is once again grappling with the aftermath of a significant security breach. In a recent development, the perpetrator behind the massive Radiant Capital exploit has made a substantial move, converting a large sum of stolen Ethereum into stablecoin. This action, tracked meticulously through on-chain analysis , highlights the ongoing challenges in maintaining robust digital asset security within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. What Did the Crypto Hacker Do? Just recently, the individual responsible for the $53 million Radiant Capital (RDNT) breach executed a major transaction. This crypto hacker swapped 4,326 ETH for a staggering $20.48 million in DAI. This move was quickly identified by prominent on-chain analysts, including @EmberCN on X, who provided real-time updates to the community. Such conversions are common tactics for attackers. They aim to obscure the trail and convert volatile cryptocurrencies into stable assets like DAI, making it harder for funds to be frozen or recovered. The hacker’s remaining holdings are still substantial, indicating a prolonged effort to manage the illicit gains. The Scale of the Digital Asset Security Breach The scale of the Radiant Capital exploit is truly concerning. Following this recent conversion, the attacker reportedly still holds a considerable sum: 12,326 ETH and $43.93 million in DAI. This brings their combined illicit fortune to approximately $102 million. This immense sum underscores the critical need for enhanced digital asset security measures across all DeFi platforms. The ability of a single entity to control such a vast amount of stolen funds poses a significant threat to market stability and investor confidence. Furthermore, suspicions linking this crypto hacker to a North Korea-affiliated group add another layer of complexity, raising geopolitical concerns about state-sponsored cybercrime in the crypto space. How Does On-Chain Analysis Track Exploits? Understanding how these illicit transactions are tracked is vital. On-chain analysis plays a crucial role in monitoring the flow of funds post-exploit. Blockchain explorers and specialized analytical tools allow experts to follow every movement of stolen assets, from initial theft to subsequent swaps and transfers. This transparency, inherent to public blockchains, provides a powerful tool for investigators. While it doesn’t prevent attacks, it offers valuable insights into hacker methodologies and helps in tracing funds, which can sometimes lead to recovery efforts or at least prevent further laundering. It is a constant cat-and-mouse game between attackers and security experts. What Are the Implications for DeFi Security? The repeated occurrence of incidents like the Radiant Capital exploit raises serious questions about the overall robustness of DeFi security . Each successful hack erodes trust in the decentralized ecosystem, making potential users and institutional investors hesitant to participate. Platforms must prioritize rigorous auditing, bug bounty programs, and continuous vulnerability assessments. Key challenges facing DeFi security: Smart Contract Vulnerabilities: Exploits often target flaws in code. Flash Loan Attacks: Manipulating market prices through uncollateralized loans. Oracle Manipulation: Feeding incorrect price data to protocols. Lack of Centralized Oversight: While a core tenet of DeFi, it means less traditional consumer protection. For users, understanding the risks and practicing due diligence, such as using reputable protocols and diversifying investments, becomes increasingly important. Safeguarding Your Digital Assets While developers work tirelessly to bolster DeFi security , users also have a role to play in protecting their investments. Always ensure the protocols you interact with have undergone multiple independent audits. Stay informed about recent exploits and the attack vectors used. This incident serves as a stark reminder that even well-established protocols can fall victim to sophisticated attacks. Vigilance, continuous learning, and a proactive approach to security are paramount for anyone navigating the dynamic world of decentralized finance. The recent actions of the Radiant Capital hacker underscore the persistent threats within the crypto landscape. While the community relies on advanced on-chain analysis to track these illicit movements, the broader challenge of enhancing digital asset security remains paramount. As the industry evolves, collaborative efforts between developers, security researchers, and users will be crucial to building a more resilient and trustworthy DeFi future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What was the Radiant Capital exploit? The Radiant Capital exploit was a significant security breach on the Radiant Capital decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, resulting in the theft of approximately $53 million in digital assets. How did the hacker move the stolen funds? The hacker recently converted 4,326 ETH (Ethereum) into $20.48 million worth of DAI, a stablecoin, likely to obscure the transaction trail and stabilize the value of the stolen funds. What is on-chain analysis? On-chain analysis involves examining public blockchain data to track transactions, identify wallet movements, and monitor the flow of cryptocurrencies, often used to trace stolen funds after an exploit. Is the hacker linked to any specific group? Yes, the hacker behind the Radiant Capital exploit is suspected to be affiliated with a North Korea-linked group, highlighting potential state-sponsored cybercrime in the crypto space. What are the implications for DeFi security? This incident emphasizes the ongoing need for robust DeFi security measures, including thorough smart contract audits and vigilant monitoring, to protect user funds and maintain trust in decentralized finance.

Ethena Climbs 260% & Dogecoin Targets 50% Gain",https://thecoinrise.com/cold-wallet-prepares-for-a-3424-leap-ethena-climbs-260-dogecoin-targets-50-gain/,"Market moves in crypto can shift rapidly, rewarding only those ready to act. Ethena’s recent 260% rise and Dogecoin’s bullish setup show how momentum can build quickly, leading to sharp gains for those entering early. While such trends spark short-term interest, the Cold Wallet presale offers a clearer and measurable advantage. Now in Stage 17 at $0.00998 per CWT and set for a confirmed listing price of $0.3517, it has a built-in 3,424% ROI before it reaches exchanges. This distinct and quantifiable gap places it ahead of most market plays. For those looking for defined entry points with significant growth potential, Cold Wallet stands out as a leading crypto choice in 2025. Last Chance at Low Pricing Before the 3,424% ROI Window Narrows Cold Wallet’s presale sits at a crucial point, giving one of the most clearly defined early-access chances available. At Stage 17, each CWT is priced at $0.00998, while the confirmed launch price is locked at $0.3517. This secures a 3,424% ROI before its exchange debut, not including the potential rise from post-listing demand. The presale has already surpassed $5.95 million in funding, showing strong interest. As more buyers join in, each stage is closing faster, pushing prices up at every step. At the current pace, entry costs could rise soon, reducing this exceptional profit window. Acting before the next price adjustment could be key to securing the highest potential gain. Cold Wallet isn’t only a profit opportunity; it’s built for real-world use. It functions as a self-custody wallet rewarding users for everyday crypto transactions, offering CWT cashback on gas fees, swaps, and fiat transfers. A tiered rewards system encourages holding, sustaining demand beyond the launch. This mix of locked-in ROI potential and ongoing utility makes a strong case for early entry. With the current stage pricing, it presents a rare mix of low cost and high potential return that won’t last long. Right now, the figures are clear: a purchase at $0.00998 could multiply significantly by launch, but waiting risks losing the advantage. Ethena ENA Price Action Hints at Strong Breakout Ethena ENA’s upward trend continues, with a sharp climb of around 260% from $0.25 to $0.81 recently. Analysts now point toward a possible run to $1.18, showing a near-term upside if the rally keeps momentum. Breaking above $0.80 signals firm buying pressure, driven by sustained bullish interest. Traders are watching closely as technical indicators align with further gains. With the target now within reach, entering at current prices could secure notable returns before the next move higher. As momentum builds, each session may push prices closer to that projection. Acting during the climb could make the difference between capturing peak gains and chasing the market later. Dogecoin DOGE Structure Points to a 50% Surge Dogecoin DOGE is forming a bullish ascending triangle pattern, suggesting a possible 50% rally. Price movements show steadily higher lows, while resistance holds near $0.25. This tightening range often precedes a sharp upward break, and a strong move past $0.25 could send it toward $0.28 and $0.36. Technical signals, including a positive MACD crossover and rising trading volume, add weight to the bullish case. With the breakout point approaching, time is limited. Entering early could mean securing a better position, while hesitation risks buying higher after momentum accelerates. The Dogecoin setup is flashing urgency for those ready to act. Final Words While Ethena and Dogecoin present short-term market-driven setups, they require precise timing. Cold Wallet’s presale, by contrast, offers a fixed advantage. With Stage 17 at $0.00998 and launch at $0.3517, the 3,424% ROI is already secured before listing. This measurable edge gives a rare chance to secure value without relying on unpredictable momentum. As stages sell out quickly, delaying could mean paying more. For those seeking high potential returns with a fixed entry price, Cold Wallet remains a top contender for 2025.

50056042,555789,1755136839,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50056042.jpeg,"‘Crypto Mom’ Tells Industry: SEC Acting Now, Not Waiting On Congress",https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-mom-tells-industry-sec-acting-now-not-waiting-on-congress/,"Crypto firms may get fresh guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission even if Congress takes its time, Republican Commissioner Hester Peirce told Bloomberg. Peirce, also known as “Crypto Mom”, said agency staff have been working on guidance since January and that the SEC plans to use its existing authority to clarify how securities laws apply to tokens and on-chain trading. That means rules could shift from internal memos or staff letters rather than new federal statutes alone. Project Crypto Moves Forward According to comments from the SEC, Chair Paul Atkins launched a program called Project Crypto to bring securities rules into line with modern markets. Peirce said the project “is going very well” and that teams across the agency are meeting with industry leaders. Based on reports, those meetings are meant to narrow down how current law should be interpreted for token issuers, trading platforms, and custody services. Draft Bill Faces Industry Pushback Last month the US Senate Banking Committee released a draft market-structure bill meant to address crypto jurisdiction and oversight. Reports have disclosed that companies like Ripple raised concerns that the bill could broaden the SEC’s reach. Peirce described the draft as “a very sophisticated piece of legislation to work out,” and she said the agency is ready to work with members of both the House and the Senate to help shape the final text. Coordination With CFTC Is Ongoing The draft bill aims to draw lines between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Peirce noted that she has worked with the CFTC for many years and that staff from both agencies are coordinating on recommendations. That coordination is focused on preventing conflicting rules and on determining which agency should handle different types of crypto products. Companies operating in token markets should assume guidance and enforcement could come from the SEC even before Congress acts. That means compliance teams should document how their products fit under current securities tests and be prepared for staff inquiries. Peirce’s remarks suggest the agency will try to provide practical guidance, but she also reminded audiences that enforcement powers remain available while guidance is being developed. On Clarity & Uncertainty Investors may see market reactions when the SEC releases guidance or when Congress updates the draft bill. Two separate tracks — administrative guidance from the SEC and possible legislation from Congress — could produce quicker clarity on some issues, while creating uncertainty on others. Based on recent statements, the SEC intends to act within its current authority while the legislative process continues. That approach could speed some answers for the industry, but it also keeps enforcement risk alive and leaves open questions about the final division of power between the SEC and the CFTC.

50056027,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=804262,1755136845,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/50056027.jpeg,Bitcoin Price and Futures Leverage Climb Together — Here’s Why That Matters,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-price-and-futures-leverage-climb-together-heres-why-that-matters/,"Bitcoin has extended its upward momentum over the past week, gaining nearly 6% in that time and 1.8% in the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $120,499, maintaining its position near a key resistance zone between $119,000 and $120,000. Market data indicates that traders are watching this price area closely, given its significance in previous price action during July. Recent analysis from CryptoQuant contributor Arab Chain shows that Bitcoin’s open interest (OI) on Binance has climbed to around $13.7 billion, approaching its mid-to-late July highs. This metric, which tracks the total value of outstanding futures contracts, is often used to gauge market participation and potential volatility. The current levels suggest a notable build-up of speculative positions as the price approaches critical resistance. Related Reading: Bitcoin At Risk Of Pullback As Binance Miner Distributions Spike, Analyst Says Bitcoin Leveraged Positions and Potential Market Outcomes According to Arab Chain, a simultaneous rise in both price and open interest typically signals the entry of new speculative liquidity, most likely from traders taking long positions. While this can support short-term price increases, it also raises the market’s sensitivity to corrections. If open interest grows faster than price, the rally can become overleveraged, leaving the market vulnerable to a long squeeze in the event of a sharp pullback. The $119,000–$120,000 range has acted as a decision point in recent months. A breakout above this level with stable or slightly declining open interest could indicate the move is driven by spot buying or short covering, which generally carries less liquidation risk. In this scenario, Arab Chain sees potential for BTC to target the $122,000–$124,000 range. However, a sharp rejection at these levels with elevated open interest could trigger liquidation-driven declines toward nearby support. Monitoring Open Interest Trends for Confirmation Open interest is currently just below the all-time high of approximately $14 billion, leaving limited room for further leveraged build-up before reaching historic extremes. Arab Chain notes that after a decline in both price and OI from late July to early August, indicating capital exiting the market, both have since rebounded together, suggesting renewed confidence among derivatives traders. The analyst cautions that a significant jump in open interest without a corresponding price advance, or worse, with a price decline, would point to an overleveraged environment. Related Reading: Two Forces Can Launch Bitcoin To $1 Million, Says Mike Novogratz Conversely, price stability or gains above $120,000 while open interest holds steady or declines slightly would be a healthier sign, indicating the move is supported by actual buying rather than excessive leverage. At present, the intraday trend remains bullish, but the sustainability of this move depends on whether leverage levels stabilize as Bitcoin tests resistance. Traders are likely to focus on how BTC behaves around the $120,000 mark in the coming days, with open interest dynamics serving as a key signal for the next directional move.

Investors are rapidly entering into Solana, Ethereum and Chainlink with renewed energy as price targets turn bullish for all three assets. Among this run we are seeing some new names emerge and gaining traction quickly. One such name, gaining serious attention, is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana Pushes Toward $250 as Treasury Demand Soars Solana continues to rise, currently trading at nearly $215 after breaking resistance at $200 for the first time this month. Analysts are looking towards the $220-$230 area as the next short-term hurdle, while the breakout target is now $250. Whale accumulation, high on-chain activity, and continuous institutional adoption are driving the surge. The DeFi Development Corporation recently disclosed treasury holdings of over $250 million in SOL, which is a major vote of confidence from long-term players. Besides, Solana has recorded over 21.9 billion total transactions—showing the strength and scalability of its ecosystem. Ethereum Holds Strong at $4,600 Amid ETF Boom After breaking out earlier this week on the back of historic ETF inflows, Ethereum climbed to and held above $4,600. Call option traders have paid over $5 million betting to break $5,000 price level, widely considered the next psychological hurdle. ETFs bought by BlackRock and Fidelity have attracted more than $1.01 billion in inflows in a single day, setting a record for Ethereum and surpassing Bitcoin ETFs in net flows. Firms like BitMine and SharpLink have stepped up ETH accumulation. BitMine now holds over 1.2 million ETH, currently worth nearly $5 billion. Chainlink Surges 15% as Institutions Accumulate In the last week, Chainlink has experienced a 15% increase in price, surpassing $24 as a result of significant whale activity and high-profile integrations. The token reached a seven-month peak after news broke of Chainlink’s partnership with Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) to bring on-chain real-time FX and commodity pricing. In the last two months, LINK exchange balances are down nearly 10%, which is a sign of less selling pressure. Expect the price to be $29 and even $35 in short time, with momentum building. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Momentum Before Listing Events Featured on 2025’s best Altcoins to buy now watchlist by top researchers , MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction among analysts who cite its scarcity-driven tokenomics, strong community growth, and strategic market positioning. Backed by increasing whale accumulation and institutional interest, the project’s momentum is building ahead of anticipated exchange listings and utility rollouts. With both retail and smart money closely monitoring its trajectory, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a standout contender for significant gains in the upcoming market cycle. Final Thoughts With Solana nearing a major breakout, Ethereum showing stability above $4,600, and Chainlink seeing rising demand from institutions, the outlook for the altcoins remains bullish for the end of August. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the most awaited projects, thanks in part to the recognition it has received through research and the community backing, which points to significant upside.

BlockchainFX (BFX) is closing in on its $5.5M softcap, pulling $5.08M from 4,323 participants for its multi-asset trading platform spanning crypto, stocks, and commodities. Ozak AI, now in Stage 4 at $0.005, has passed $1.7M with a pitch that fuses blockchain with AI-driven predictive analytics. Strong figures, but BlockDAG’s (BDAG) scale is in a league of its own: $373M raised, 25.1 billion coins sold, and early buyers already securing ROIs of over 2,660%. With today’s $0.0276 price and a $1 near-term projection, new entries eye 3,522% potential ROI. Behind the numbers are 200,000 holders and millions mining before launch. Each batch sold pulls BlockDAG closer to its $600M target and pushes early pricing further out of reach. BlockchainFX (BFX) Presale Nears Softcap Milestone The BlockchainFX (BFX) presale has raised over $5.08 million, reaching 92.45% of its $5.5 million softcap. According to project details, the platform plans to integrate over 500 assets, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, ETFs, and commodities, into a single trading environment. Features listed include daily staking rewards in BFX and USDT, instant asset swaps, and up to 70% of trading fees returned to users. The BlockchainFX presale reports 4,323 participants, with payment options spanning multiple major cryptocurrencies. The platform positions itself as bridging traditional finance and blockchain, though market adoption will ultimately determine its impact. Ozak AI Presale Approaches $2 Million Milestone The Ozak AI presale, now in Stage 4, has raised over $1.7 million with tokens priced at $0.005. According to project materials, the next phase will raise the price to $0.01. The platform aims to combine blockchain infrastructure with AI-driven predictive analytics, incorporating components such as the Ozak Stream Network for real-time data streaming, customizable Prediction Agents, and DePIN-based decentralized infrastructure. With its mix of blockchain infrastructure and AI-powered predictive tools, the platform has a defined niche; whether it secures long-term traction will depend on adoption rates, competitive positioning, and the execution of its roadmap beyond the initial fundraising phase. Closing in on $600M: Is BlockDAG’s Presale Ending Soon? BlockDAG set out to raise $600M across 45 presale batches. That target is now coming into sharper focus, with more than $373M already secured and 25.1+ billion BDAG sold. The pace has been fast, helped along by large buyers locking in significant allocations early and a growing community eager to secure their share before the final batches disappear. Batch 29 is active at $0.0276. For context, those who joined in Batch 1 have already seen a 2,660% rise. With a near-term projection of $1, the potential ROI for current entries stands at 3,522% shortly after launch. That’s without even factoring in long-term forecasts of $5, $10, or even $20, which paint an even more compelling profit picture. Behind these numbers is a network that is already taking shape. More than 200,000 holders are on board, alongside 4,500 builders preparing 300+ web3 projects to go live on BlockDAG’s infrastructure. Over 2.5M people are using the X1 Miner app, while nearly 19,300 miners have been sold, adding almost $7.8M to the presale total. Each batch sold moves the project closer to its $600M goal and further away from the entry prices available today. As the total climbs, the remaining supply at current pricing shrinks. The end of the presale will also mark the end of these early-stage opportunities, shifting BDAG into open market trading where supply and demand will set the pace. Which Is the Top Crypto Presale Right Now? Presales can be exciting, but the smartest money looks beyond early promises to see what’s already in motion. BlockchainFX (BFX) has raised over $5.08M, 92.45% of its softcap, offering daily staking rewards, instant swaps, and a 500+ asset trading environment, but adoption will ultimately test its model. Ozak AI is closing in on $2M in Stage 4, with AI-powered predictive analytics and blockchain infrastructure on the roadmap, though its success depends on execution after fundraising.

Reports indicate that Bain Capital Ventures, a major early investor in Compound, might be preparing for a substantial Bain Capital Ventures COMP sale . This move involves a considerable amount of COMP tokens, valued at millions of dollars, and it has naturally captured the attention of investors and the wider crypto community. What Does This COMP Token Sale Involve? The core of this news revolves around 349,000 COMP token s, valued at approximately $18.85 million. Bain Capital Ventures originally received these tokens five years ago as part of their early investment in Compound. The recent activity, as reported by @EmberCN on X, shows a wallet linked to Bain Capital Ventures moving this entire stash. Specifically: About nine hours ago, the full 349,000 COMP was transferred to an institutional trading platform. From this initial transfer, 87,250 COMP, worth about $4.73 million, has already been sent to major cryptocurrency exchanges. These exchanges include prominent names like Binance, OKX, Bybit, and Gate.io, indicating a clear intention to sell. This large-scale movement of COMP token s by a foundational investor is a notable event, raising questions about its implications. Understanding the Institutional Crypto Sales Landscape When an entity like Bain Capital Ventures, a well-known venture capital firm, undertakes such a significant transaction, it falls under the category of institutional crypto sales . These sales often carry more weight than individual retail transactions due to their sheer volume and the perception of informed decision-making by large investors. Such actions can sometimes signal broader trends or shifts in investor sentiment. For the broader crypto market impact , large sales can: Increase supply on exchanges, potentially leading to price pressure. Influence market sentiment, as other investors might interpret the sale as a bearish signal. Test the liquidity and resilience of the underlying asset’s market. Therefore, tracking these movements provides valuable insight into the market’s dynamics. The decision by Bain Capital Ventures to potentially offload a substantial portion of its Compound token holdings is certainly a development worth monitoring closely. What’s Next for the Compound Token and Its Community? The potential Bain Capital Ventures COMP sale naturally brings the Compound token and its decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol into sharp focus. Compound is a leading DeFi lending protocol, and COMP is its governance token. Holders of COMP can vote on proposals that shape the future of the protocol. The community will likely be watching closely to see how this significant supply influx affects the token’s price and market stability. While large sales can create short-term volatility, the long-term resilience of a project like Compound depends on its fundamental utility, ongoing development, and active community engagement. It’s important to remember that investors often take profits, and such sales are a part of the natural investment cycle. Ultimately, the true impact of this move will unfold over the coming days and weeks. The crypto market is dynamic, and various factors influence asset prices. Keeping an eye on the trading volumes and price action of COMP on the mentioned exchanges will provide clearer indications. Summary: A Watchful Eye on COMP The potential Bain Capital Ventures COMP sale represents a significant event for the Compound ecosystem and the broader crypto market. With $18.85 million worth of COMP token s on the move, including millions already hitting exchanges, the market is bracing for potential shifts. While institutional crypto sales can introduce volatility, the long-term outlook for the Compound token will depend on the project’s continued strength and community support. Investors and enthusiasts alike should remain vigilant and informed as this situation develops. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the main news about Bain Capital Ventures and Compound?

Greenidge Generation Holdings, a prominent Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency miner , recently made headlines with its impressive Q2 performance. The company officially announced via a Business Wire press release that it successfully produced 110 BTC during the second quarter, marking a significant milestone in its Greenidge Bitcoin mining operations. Unpacking Greenidge’s Impressive BTC Production Greenidge Generation Holdings is not just any mining company; its listing on Nasdaq signifies a level of corporate governance and public scrutiny often absent in the broader crypto space. This public announcement provides valuable insight into their operational efficiency and commitment to the digital asset sector. The reported BTC production of 110 Bitcoins in Q2 highlights the company’s active role in securing the Bitcoin network while generating revenue. For a publicly traded entity, such consistent reporting of mining output is crucial for stakeholder confidence. However, it is worth noting that the company’s press release focused solely on production figures. Details regarding Bitcoin sales or current holdings were not disclosed. This is a common practice for some miners, yet it leaves room for speculation regarding their treasury management strategy. What Do These Q2 Results Mean for the Cryptocurrency Miner? Understanding the context of these Q2 results requires a brief look at the Bitcoin mining landscape. Mining Bitcoin involves solving complex computational puzzles to verify transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. This process requires substantial computing power and energy, making efficiency a critical factor for profitability. Operational Efficiency: Producing 110 BTC indicates robust operational efficiency and potentially optimized hardware utilization within Greenidge’s facilities. Market Position: As a Nasdaq-listed entity, Greenidge is under public scrutiny, and its mining output contributes to its market narrative as a serious player in the Greenidge Bitcoin mining industry. Revenue Generation: Each Bitcoin mined represents a potential revenue stream, although the actual value depends on the Bitcoin price at the time of sale. While the press release did not elaborate on the specifics of their mining fleet or energy sources, the consistent production suggests a well-managed infrastructure capable of handling the increasing difficulty of Bitcoin mining. Navigating the Challenges of Digital Asset Mining The journey of a cryptocurrency miner is not without its hurdles. The profitability of mining is heavily influenced by several external factors: Bitcoin Price Volatility: Fluctuations in Bitcoin’s market price directly impact the fiat value of mined BTC. Mining Difficulty: As more miners join the network, the difficulty of mining increases, requiring more computational power to earn the same rewards. Energy Costs: Energy consumption is the single largest operational expense for miners. Access to affordable and sustainable energy sources is a significant competitive advantage. Greenidge’s ability to maintain its BTC production amidst these variables speaks to its strategic planning and operational resilience. The company’s unique position as a power generator in some of its facilities likely provides a hedge against fluctuating energy prices. The Future Outlook for Greenidge Bitcoin Mining The Q2 results provide a snapshot of Greenidge’s performance, but what does the future hold? The company’s continued operation and reported output suggest a commitment to expanding its presence in the digital asset space. As the Bitcoin network grows and evolves, so too will the demands on miners. Investors and market observers will be keen to see how Greenidge continues to adapt to changing market conditions, technological advancements, and regulatory landscapes. The strategic decisions made regarding hardware upgrades, energy procurement, and treasury management will be pivotal in shaping its long-term success. In conclusion, Greenidge Generation Holdings’ announcement of 110 BTC mined in Q2 underscores its significant operational capacity as a Nasdaq-listed Greenidge Bitcoin mining entity. While the full financial picture awaits further disclosures, this production figure solidifies its position as a notable player in the competitive cryptocurrency mining industry. It highlights the ongoing efforts of publicly traded companies to bring greater transparency and accountability to the burgeoning world of digital assets.

That’s the spirit driving today’s meme coin frenzy, where creativity, internet culture, and earnest money meet head-on. For those who know how to spot the real deals, the rewards can be staggering. At the front of the pack is Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) —a project weaving a vivid storyline with concrete financial incentives. Alongside it, Popcat (POPCAT), Osaka Protocol (OSAK), and Daddy Tate (DADDY) each bring their spark. Arctic Pablo’s meme coin presale is already pulling in whale wallets and sharp investors, and its combination of narrative, staking, and deflationary mechanics cements it as the top new meme coin to invest in now. 1. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) – The Icy Expedition With Sky-High Rewards In a world where most tokens are just code on a blockchain, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out by taking investors on a mythical snowmobile ride through frost-covered lands in search of hidden wealth. The central character, Arctic Pablo, uncovers shimmering $APC coins said to hold ancient magic and the promise of fortune. The project’s 66 % Annual Percentage Yield staking program lets holders lock in tokens for two months after launch and watch them grow while staying part of this global adventure. It’s this blend of fantasy and financial firepower that has made it a standout among the top new meme coins to invest in now. Arctic Pablo’s staking program isn’t an afterthought—it’s designed to reward commitment. The more you stake, the more you earn, all while being part of a narrative that keeps the community invested emotionally as well as financially. In a market full of disposable meme coins, this one builds a story you want to hold onto. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale – Stage 36 Is Almost Out Right now, Arctic Pablo Coin is in Stage 36 (Horizon Haven) of its meme coin presale , with more than 98 % already snapped up. The current price is $0.0008, and the tally has crossed $3.36 million. Early birds from the first stages have already clocked gains of 5,233.33 %. Even buyers entering now are looking at a 900% return at the listing price of $0.008, and if analysts’ projections of $0.1 come true, Stage 36 entries would yield a staggering 12,400% profit. Here’s how it plays out: a $30,000 buy at the current price secures 37,500,000 APC tokens. At $0.008, that becomes $300,000. The difference between catching it before this stage closes and missing it could be life-changing. The project also burns any unsold tokens weekly during the presale, and whatever is left afterward, permanently reducing supply and driving scarcity. It’s this structured deflation, combined with story-driven marketing and whale participation, that makes Arctic Pablo Coin impossible to ignore as the top new meme coin to invest in now . 2. Popcat (POPCAT) – The Meme That Keeps Climbing Popcat proves that sometimes the simplest ideas are the most powerful. What started as a playful internet meme has grown into a community-fueled phenomenon on Solana, with traders and collectors alike pushing it forward. The project thrives on constant conversation, clever content, and a culture that rewards engagement as much as holding the token itself. Its viral nature means Popcat often finds itself in front of fresh audiences without even trying, a rare trait in the meme coin space. It earns a place among the top new meme coins to invest in now for showing how a lighthearted concept can sustain serious momentum when backed by consistent community energy and creative execution. 3. Osaka Protocol (OSAK) – Built on Community Roots Osaka Protocol carries a sense of loyalty and shared history that’s rare in the fast-paced meme coin arena. Its origins are tied to rewarding early crypto believers, a move that instantly bonded the project with a strong base. Since then, Osaka has leaned into that ethos, fostering a culture where participation and contribution matter as much as speculation. From online discussions to coordinated initiatives, the community’s involvement shapes its direction. That ability to grow while staying anchored in its original values is why it stands out in this list of the top new meme coins to invest in now—Osaka shows that when a project respects its roots, it can keep attracting new supporters without losing its identity. 4. Daddy Tate (DADDY) – Branding With a Punch Daddy Tate is proof that personality-driven branding can be a powerful force in crypto. Inspired by the unapologetic style of its namesake influencer, the coin attracts holders who connect with boldness, controversy, and high energy. Its online presence is loud, confident, and impossible to ignore, keeping it in constant conversation across social media. While the meme coin space is full of playful mascots, Daddy Tate leans into a persona that sparks debate as much as it inspires loyalty. This blend of strong branding and community engagement secures its spot among the top new meme coins to invest in now as a token that knows exactly how to command attention and keep it. The Verdict Data shows meme coin volumes have surged dramatically in recent months, and Arctic Pablo Coin is positioned to ride that wave straight through its presale finale. With its narrative of hidden worlds, staking yields that turn heads, and a presale nearly sold out, it stands as the top new meme coin to invest in now . Stage 36 won’t stay open long. The gains outlined aren’t theoretical—they’re math in motion. The moment to secure APC before it lists is now, not later. The blend of creative storytelling, deflationary tokenomics, and staking incentives makes Arctic Pablo Coin a presale entry worth serious consideration.

50056946,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=189298,1755138310,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/50056946.jpeg,AguilaTrades Loss: Shocking $1.85 Million Wipeout on Hyperliquid,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/aguilatrades-loss-hyperliquid-trading/,"BitcoinWorld AguilaTrades Loss: Shocking $1.85 Million Wipeout on Hyperliquid A stunning event recently unfolded in the fast-paced world of decentralized finance, highlighting the immense volatility and inherent risks of high-stakes crypto trading . A prominent figure known as AguilaTrades, a whale trader operating on the Hyperliquid decentralized exchange, suffered a significant financial blow. This AguilaTrades loss amounted to a staggering $1.85 million, incurred over just eight hours with a 0% win rate across six consecutive trades. What Led to the Catastrophic AguilaTrades Loss? The recent series of unfortunate events for AguilaTrades began with the closure of previous Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) positions. Following this, the trader embarked on six new positions within an eight-hour window. On-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X brought these details to light, revealing that every single one of these trades resulted in a loss, accumulating to a total of $1,846,000. This perfect losing streak serves as a stark reminder of how quickly fortunes can turn in the highly unpredictable crypto markets. Understanding the Whale Trader’s High-Stakes Game on Hyperliquid Who exactly is AguilaTrades ? This individual is recognized as a ‘whale trader’ – a term used to describe market participants holding significant amounts of cryptocurrency, whose large trades can influence market prices. Their activity on Hyperliquid , a decentralized exchange, means they operate in an environment known for its high liquidity and often, opportunities for substantial leveraged trading . Currently, AguilaTrades holds a massive 25x leveraged long position of 21,050 ETH. This position is valued at an astonishing $99.93 million, having been entered at an ETH price of $4,750.06. Such high leverage amplifies both potential gains and, as seen, potential losses significantly. It underscores the immense capital at play in the DeFi ecosystem. The Perils of Leveraged Crypto Trading: Lessons from AguilaTrades The incident involving AguilaTrades underscores the extreme risks associated with leveraged trading in the volatile cryptocurrency market. While leverage allows traders to control large positions with a relatively small amount of capital, it also magnifies losses if the market moves against their prediction. A 25x leverage, for instance, means a mere 4% price drop can wipe out the entire initial capital, leading to a swift liquidation. What can we learn from this devastating AguilaTrades loss ? Risk Management is Crucial: Even experienced traders can face severe setbacks without proper stop-loss orders and meticulous position sizing. Market Volatility: The crypto market is inherently unpredictable. Sudden price swings can liquidate highly leveraged positions rapidly, regardless of market sentiment. Emotional Control: Consecutive losses can lead to impulsive decisions, further exacerbating the situation and potentially leading to greater financial exposure. The recent multi-million dollar AguilaTrades loss on Hyperliquid serves as a powerful cautionary tale for anyone involved in crypto trading . It highlights that even whale traders, with their vast resources and experience, are not immune to the market’s unforgiving nature, especially when engaging in high-leverage strategies. This event reminds us all about the critical importance of prudent risk management and understanding the magnified dangers of leveraged positions in decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is AguilaTrades? A1: AguilaTrades is identified as a prominent whale trader , meaning an individual or entity with significant capital whose trades can influence market prices, particularly on platforms like Hyperliquid . Q2: What is Hyperliquid? A2: Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that facilitates high-speed crypto trading , often allowing for significant leverage on various cryptocurrency pairs. Q3: What does ’25x leveraged long position’ mean? A3: A 25x leveraged long position means the trader is borrowing funds to amplify their exposure to an asset (in this case, ETH) by 25 times, betting that its price will increase. While it magnifies potential gains, it also drastically increases potential losses. Q4: How did AguilaTrades lose so much money? A4: AguilaTrades incurred a $1.85 million loss by opening six consecutive positions over eight hours, all of which resulted in losses. This 0% win rate, likely compounded by high leverage, led to the substantial AguilaTrades loss . Q5: What are the main risks of high-leverage crypto trading? A5: The primary risks include magnified losses, rapid liquidation of positions due to small price movements, and the potential for emotional trading decisions after significant setbacks. It requires robust risk management. Did you find this article insightful?

A recent CoinDesk report shines a light on the formidable challenges hindering the development of such a digital asset in South Korea. It appears the nation’s stringent South Korea currency controls are proving to be a major hurdle, potentially stifling a key area of digital currency innovation . Understanding these limitations is crucial for anyone interested in the future of stablecoins and global finance. Understanding South Korea’s Currency Controls: A Historical Context South Korea’s tight currency regulations are not new; they are a direct legacy of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. This pivotal event led to the implementation of strict rules designed to safeguard the nation’s financial stability. Essentially, these regulations limit deliverable won trading almost exclusively to domestic markets. This means foreign institutions are explicitly prohibited from exchanging the currency overseas, a significant barrier for any aspiring won-backed stablecoin looking for international adoption. Moreover, every single dollar–won transaction must navigate through domestic intermediaries. This entire process operates under the vigilant oversight of the Bank of Korea. These measures, while effective for traditional financial stability, create a challenging environment for new digital financial instruments, especially those aiming for global reach like a true won-backed stablecoin . The very nature of these South Korea currency controls limits the natural expansion of digital assets. Why Won-Backed Stablecoins Face Hurdles for Cross-Border Settlement One might wonder, why would South Korea even need a stablecoin for its domestic transactions? The answer lies in the existing efficiency of its traditional banking system. In South Korea, interbank transfers already boast remarkable features: They settle instantly, ensuring immediate fund availability. They operate year-round, providing uninterrupted service. They incur virtually no fees, making them highly cost-effective. Given this advanced infrastructure, a stablecoin offers little in the way of improvement for internal payments. Its most compelling application, cross-border settlement , is precisely where the nation’s currency rules become an insurmountable barrier. The requirement that all trading remains onshore directly conflicts with the global, borderless nature of stablecoins, thus hindering the full stablecoin potential . This situation isn’t unique to South Korea. Taiwan faces a similar predicament. The Taiwan dollar (NTD), while freely convertible, cannot be used outside its borders. This restriction significantly limits its potential as a stablecoin, mirroring the challenges seen with the potential won-backed stablecoin and the broader implications for cross-border settlement . The Broader Impact on Stablecoin Potential and Digital Currency Innovation The implications of these rigid South Korea currency controls extend beyond just the won. They cast a shadow over the broader stablecoin potential within the country and, by extension, the nation’s capacity for rapid digital currency innovation . While South Korea is a tech-forward nation, its conservative approach to currency management creates a paradox for its burgeoning crypto industry. For a stablecoin to truly thrive, it needs the freedom to move across borders, facilitate international trade, and offer a seamless digital alternative to traditional remittances. When a currency is tethered so tightly to its domestic market, the fundamental utility of a stablecoin – its ability to bridge fiat and crypto globally – is severely curtailed. This regulatory environment necessitates a careful balance between financial stability and fostering innovation in the digital currency innovation space. Navigating the Future: Overcoming Regulatory Challenges for Digital Won The path forward for a won-backed stablecoin , and indeed for greater cross-border settlement efficiency, requires a thoughtful re-evaluation of existing currency frameworks. While the reasons for the current regulations are understandable, the global financial landscape is evolving rapidly with digital assets. Policymakers face the complex task of adapting these rules to accommodate new technologies without compromising financial security. Dialogue between regulators, financial institutions, and blockchain innovators will be crucial. Exploring regulatory sandboxes or controlled environments for pilot programs could offer a way to test the waters. Ultimately, for South Korea to fully embrace the future of finance and unlock the full stablecoin potential , it must find innovative ways to reconcile its historical South Korea currency controls with the demands of a globally interconnected digital economy. This evolution is vital for truly realizing digital currency innovation . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a won-backed stablecoin? A won-backed stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged 1:1 to the South Korean Won. This means its value is intended to remain consistent with the national currency, unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. 2. Why does South Korea have such strict currency controls? South Korea implemented stringent currency controls after the 1997 Asian financial crisis. These measures were put in place to protect the nation’s financial stability by limiting the international flow and exchange of its currency, the won. 3. How do South Korea’s existing payment systems compare to stablecoins? South Korea already boasts highly efficient domestic payment systems. Interbank transfers are instant, operate year-round, and incur virtually no fees. Therefore, a stablecoin offers little improvement for internal transactions within the country. 4. What is the primary use case for stablecoins that is blocked in South Korea? The primary blocked use case for a won-backed stablecoin in South Korea is cross-border settlement. Current regulations require all won trading to remain onshore, preventing the stablecoin from facilitating international transactions freely. 5. Is South Korea completely against digital currency innovation? While South Korea has strict currency controls, it is a technologically advanced nation that has shown interest in blockchain and digital assets. The challenge lies in balancing financial stability and regulatory oversight with fostering new digital currency innovations. Did you find this article insightful?

Many investors are also keeping an eye on MAGACOIN FINANCE as market moves gain pace. The next few weeks could set the performance tone of altcoins for the rest of the year. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum crossed $4,600 on Wednesday. It climbed 8% in the last 24 hours and hit $4,715, just shy of its $4,867 all-time high from November 2021. Onchain data from Glassnode shows bids for ETH are strengthening. The asset is serving as a barometer of the larger altcoin market. Spot Ethereum ETFs are experiencing enormous inflows as investor demand grows. The streak of inflows in the past six days has been worth $2.3 billion. Monday alone broke records, registering a $1 billion net inflow. The performance is also good on daily activity. On Tuesday, Ethereum recorded more than 1.87 million transactions. The number of transactions in July 2025 was approximately 50 million, a record in more than a year. XRP (XRP) Crypto analyst Ali Martinez predicts XRP could rally to $12.60. His chart shows a multi-year symmetrical triangle that recently broke upwards. The bullish breakout suggests a possible long-term rally. Martinez expects the peak in November. XRP was trading at $3.1840 at the time of his post. This would imply an increase of more than 395 percent in the event that his goal is achieved. Martinez has gotten it right in the past. His prediction of $3.34 unfolded following the conclusion of the Ripple vs. SEC case on August 7. The resolution has now provided a clarification on the regulatory status of XRP, which can facilitate its better growth. Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche is testing the $26 resistance level. A close above this could trigger a significant rally. The weekly chart shows AVAX has been moving inside a descending parallel channel since March 2024. It bounced in April and reclaimed $20 as support. The wave count is bullish. According to analysts, AVAX has already undergone a long-term correction, and the coin might enter a bullish period. There are target prices of $74 and $110 on the rally. This move should be confirmed by a weekly close above $26. Experienced whale investors are currently pumping large amounts of capital into MAGACOIN FINANCE in an indication that they have high expectations of its growth. These big players tend to detect the spot market opportunities earlier than retail traders, and their early presence signifies that the project may have large momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE is on track to become a serious player during the new market cycle. Conclusion Ethereum, XRP, and Avalanche all have robust charts in anticipation of ETF approval. Technical indicators and increasing inflows suggest potential breakouts. There is an extra layer of interest with MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the purchase of whales indicates an initial placement before the mood of the market changes. Combined momentum among these projects may determine the next big altcoin bull run in case ETF approvals arrive shortly.

Experts say MUTM is clear winner,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/14/mutm-vs-ada-which-hits-5-first-experts-say-mutm-is-clear-winner/,"In the competitive world of cryptocurrencies, Cardano’s ADA has long been recognized as a leading player with a well-established market presence and a strong developer community. However, a fresh contender is emerging on the scene with a unique approach designed to accelerate growth and adoption— Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . While ADA’s steady progress is commendable, MUTM’s innovative dual lending system, Layer-2 integration, and strategic roadmap put it in a prime position to reach the $5 mark faster than ADA. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s is developing a dual lending model separating Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, enabling a more flexible and efficient ecosystem. This system caters to both blue-chip assets and more speculative coins, broadening its appeal and usability. This versatility is a significant edge that MUTM holds over ADA, whose platform, though robust, lacks this degree of lending innovation. Investors looking for projects with tangible utility and rapid expansion opportunities find MUTM’s model far more dynamic, laying the groundwork for accelerated price appreciation. Strong presale momentum and upcoming beta launch At the heart of MUTM’s rise is its impressive presale performance. Currently in Phase 6, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $14.33 million at a price of $0.035 per token, attracting over 15,200 holders. With 15% of the tokens already sold at this stage, the demand clearly indicates growing confidence in the project’s vision and future prospects. This level of early support is critical for building momentum and signaling to the market that MUTM is more than just a speculative token. Looking ahead, the upcoming beta launch will serve as a pivotal moment for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). This phase will allow real users to interact directly with the platform’s lending, borrowing, and staking features, turning theoretical value into practical utility. Unlike many projects that remain intangible for extended periods, MUTM is set to make its utility tangible, which will increase organic demand for the token well beyond speculation alone. Layer-2 integration further strengthens MUTM’s position by addressing two critical issues that often slow down blockchain projects: transaction speed and cost. By leveraging Layer-2 technology, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer significantly faster transactions and lower fees compared to many existing blockchains, including ADA’s current structure. This technological leap not only enhances user experience but also makes MUTM more accessible to a broader audience, driving higher platform activity and token demand. Stablecoin and early investment advantage The planned introduction of a decentralized stablecoin is another game-changing feature for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). This stablecoin will boost the lending ecosystem by enabling safer and more efficient borrowing and staking activities. By adding this financial instrument, MUTM expands its use cases and positions itself as a serious contender in the DeFi lending space, setting it apart from ADA’s more generalized approach. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap reflects steady progress with major milestones lined up, including exchange listings on some of the industry’s biggest names—Coinbase, Binance, KuCoin, and Kraken. These listings will dramatically enhance liquidity and token accessibility, inviting more investors and traders to join the MUTM community. Increased liquidity often correlates with price stability and upward momentum, making this a critical factor in MUTM’s potential to hit $5 sooner. To put this into perspective, early investors who bought MUTM tokens during the initial presale phases at prices well below $0.035 are now positioned to realize significant gains as the token approaches its anticipated $0.06 listing price. When compared to ADA’s more gradual ascent, MUTM offers a clearer path for those seeking rapid and substantial returns. With the next presale phase poised to increase the token price by 15% to $0.040, investors have a final opportunity to secure MUTM tokens at a discount before prices rise further. In the race between MUTM and ADA to reach the $5 milestone, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out for its innovative lending infrastructure, forward-looking technology, and strong market traction. Its ability to combine real utility with strategic growth plans makes it a top choice for investors aiming to capitalize on the next wave of DeFi expansion. The clock is ticking for those who want to join MUTM early—waiting too long means missing out on a critical phase of growth that is already underway.

Bitcoin (BTC)’s historic surge, which multiplied some early investors’ wealth by 1000 times, set a benchmark few projects have matched since. Now, leading analysts who accurately forecasted that remarkable BTC run have identified a new contender as the next major growth opportunity beyond Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH): Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Positioned as a high-potential decentralized finance platform, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing keen attention for its innovative approach to crypto lending and borrowing, coupled with a well-structured presale that offers an accessible entry point well below $0.04 per token. While BTC and ETH remain the giants of the space, the anticipated growth in DeFi and stablecoin ecosystems is creating a fertile environment for new projects to shine. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dual lending model, combining Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer systems, presents a fresh and dynamic opportunity that investors will find difficult to ignore as the crypto market goes beyond 2025. P2C lending example: steady yields from blue-chip crypto Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending mechanism allows users to deposit widely recognized cryptocurrencies into lending pools that generate consistent returns while enabling borrowers to access liquidity with reasonable loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. Consider an investor who deposits 80 AVAX tokens, worth around $2,800, into a P2C lending pool. With an LTV of 68%, this user can borrow $1,904 in DAI stablecoins, unlocking liquidity without selling their assets. On the lending side, providing liquidity to a MATIC lending pool with $100,000 could yield an impressive 11% annual percentage yield (APY), translating to $11,000 per year in returns. This system offers an attractive blend of security and profitability, appealing to investors who want to earn passive income while maintaining exposure to valuable crypto assets. As Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s beta launch nears and Layer-2 enhancements are implemented, lending efficiency and demand will rise, making these returns even more rewarding. P2P higher yield: capturing premium returns on speculative tokens In addition to its P2C pools, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) features a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending model tailored for higher-risk, higher-reward scenarios. Unlike the shared pools in P2C, P2P loans are directly negotiated between lenders and borrowers, allowing for flexible terms and elevated interest rates reflecting the risk profile of speculative tokens. Take the example of the popular PEPE token. An investor might lend $6,000 in USDT stablecoins on a 30-day loan, secured by PEPE tokens as collateral, at an APY of 27%. This high-yield arrangement allows lenders to capitalize on short-term opportunities with carefully managed risk. This distinctive P2P approach diversifies the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform, attracting both conservative users and those chasing premium returns in speculative crypto markets. The combination of P2C and P2P lending offers a comprehensive DeFi experience that is rare in the current market. Presale data: solid foundations for growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.035. The project has successfully raised approximately $14.33 million, supported by a vibrant community of more than 15,200 holders. Only 15% of tokens have been sold so far, indicating significant room for growth and adoption. Security and trust are paramount for any emerging DeFi project, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has completed a full CertiK audit, providing assurance on the safety and reliability of its smart contracts. This thorough third-party validation reinforces the platform’s commitment to protecting investors and users. With Phase 7 approaching, token prices are expected to rise to $0.040, offering an immediate 15% price appreciation for presale participants. This pricing step-up adds a clear incentive for early supporters to join before the next phase. Trust builders: incentives that strengthen the ecosystem Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enhances user confidence through its $50,000 Bug Bounty program, encouraging ethical hackers to identify and report vulnerabilities before any malicious exploitation can occur. This proactive security stance is a strong signal of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dedication to maintaining a robust and safe ecosystem. Alongside this, the platform is running a $100,000 giveaway to reward community members and broaden token distribution. These programs not only build trust but also actively engage the community, fostering a loyal and enthusiastic user base poised to support future growth milestones. ROI angle: early investors reaping big rewards Early investors in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are positioned for remarkable returns. For example, a Phase 2 participant who invested $40,000 worth of ETH tokens at the $0.015 price now holds MUTM tokens valued at $93,300 based on current presale prices. When the token lists on centralized exchanges, expected to be at $0.06, this investment will be worth approximately $160,000 on paper. Looking further ahead, with the launch of the platform’s beta version and multiple exchange listings planned, the value of that investment will climb even higher, reaching or surpassing $320,000. These projections highlight Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s enormous potential to deliver returns that rival or exceed those of established cryptos like BTC and ETH in their early days. Top analysts who have accurately predicted crypto’s biggest moves are now ranking Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the best alternative to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) for substantial growth post-2025. Combining innovative lending mechanisms, strong security foundations, an engaged community, and a compelling presale valuation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands ready to become a defining project in the next phase of crypto evolution. Investors looking beyond BTC and ETH for outsized returns will find MUTM an essential addition to their portfolios.

This surge has captured widespread attention, highlighting the value of strong technology and user engagement in driving token prices. Yet, while Solana (SOL) basks in the spotlight, another promising project is quietly building a foundation for explosive growth— Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Positioned at an entry price of just $0.035 during its presale, Mutuum Finance is rapidly becoming a top choice for investors seeking substantial upside in the DeFi space. Solana (SOL) hits $185 Solana (SOL) surged 12.6% to $185, driven by a massive 140% decentralized exchange (DEX) volume spike to $1.4 trillion in July 2025, per blockchain.news. The rally, with a 24-hour trading volume of $5.2 billion, reflects growing institutional interest and user activity, per CoinGecko. Technical indicators show SOL breaking $180 resistance, with RSI at 67 and support at $170, per Cryptopolitan. On-chain data highlights 6 million daily active addresses and whale accumulation of $200 million, boosting sentiment. The Alpenglow upgrade, achieving 100ms finality in testnets, enhances Solana (SOL)’s scalability, per BlockBeats. However, macro pressures like U.S. tariffs and a 17% memecoin activity drop pose risks. Analysts project a $211 target if $188 clears, but a drop below $170 could test $158. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Unlike many tokens chasing quick hype, Mutuum Finance is focused on delivering real-world utility through an innovative dual lending system that separates Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. This unique model is being designed to provide users with flexible borrowing and lending options, catering to a broad spectrum of crypto assets—from blue-chip tokens to more speculative coins. This approach sets MUTM apart, attracting a diverse user base ready to engage with the platform’s upcoming features. Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance has already raised a substantial $14.33 million and grown its community to over 15,200 holders. With 15% of tokens sold at the current $0.035 price, early investors are showing strong confidence in MUTM’s long-term potential. This level of support underlines the growing momentum and signals that more investors will be joining as the project progresses. The near-future beta launch at the time of listing is set to be a turning point for Mutuum Finance. This phase will allow real users to interact with the platform’s lending, borrowing, and staking functions, turning what has been theoretical into tangible experiences. The platform’s integration of Layer-2 blockchain technology will further accelerate its appeal by delivering faster transactions at significantly lower fees. This leap forward will make MUTM’s platform far more accessible and cost-effective than many traditional Layer-1 blockchains, offering a clear advantage that will drive user adoption. A standout feature that will expand Mutuum Finance’s utility is the introduction of its decentralized stablecoin. This stablecoin will empower users to borrow against their crypto collateral with peace of mind, while maintaining the system’s overall balance through automatic minting and burning mechanisms. As stablecoins have become essential tools for liquidity and lending in DeFi, this addition will create a fresh, continuous demand driver for MUTM tokens and further solidify the platform’s position in the market. CEX listing Mutuum Finance’s roadmap reflects steady and consistent progress, with carefully planned milestones designed to enhance both platform functionality and market presence. Following the beta launch, the project aims to secure listings on major exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, KuCoin, and Kraken. These listings will boost MUTM’s visibility and liquidity, attracting new users and traders, which in turn will support higher trading volumes and sustained price growth. For investors watching Solana (SOL)’s rise, Mutuum Finance presents a compelling alternative—an undervalued token backed by robust technology, a clear path to real-world application, and a growing community ready to support its expansion. The combination of Layer-2 speed, the stablecoin’s borrowing capabilities, and upcoming exchange listings provides a powerful foundation for significant price appreciation. As the presale enters its next phase, the price of MUTM will increase by 15% to $0.040. Given that only a limited supply of tokens remains at the current $0.035 price, now is the crucial window for investors to secure their positions. This is the moment to get in before the price moves higher and the platform’s utility begins to translate into broader market demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another token waiting for the market to notice; it is a well-structured DeFi project building momentum through real technology and strategic growth. For those looking beyond the headlines to find a project with the potential to move from $0.035 to $4 and beyond, MUTM is one to watch closely. The opportunity to enter early and benefit from this growth is available now—but will not last long.

U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs have just closed a truly remarkable day, recording a combined net inflow of $704.32 million on August 13. This impressive figure marks the seventh consecutive trading day of positive Ethereum ETF inflows , signaling robust and sustained investor interest in the second-largest cryptocurrency. What’s Driving These Remarkable Ethereum ETF Inflows? This consistent influx of capital into ETH ETF products highlights a growing confidence among institutional and retail investors alike. The continuous positive flows suggest a maturing market where investors increasingly view Ethereum as a legitimate and accessible investment vehicle. Many factors contribute to this trend. Increased Accessibility: ETFs offer a regulated and familiar way for traditional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This ease of access significantly lowers barriers to entry. Market Maturation: The approval and launch of these ETFs indicate a broader acceptance of digital assets within the traditional financial system. This institutional validation can attract more cautious investors. Ethereum’s Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum’s foundational role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and various Web3 applications continues to drive its utility and long-term appeal, making it an attractive asset for diversified portfolios. The steady stream of capital suggests that market participants are not just dipping their toes, but actively committing to Ethereum through these regulated investment products. Leading the Charge: Key Players in US Crypto ETFs The August 13 inflows were not evenly distributed, with several major players in the US crypto ETFs space leading the charge. Understanding who is attracting the most capital provides insight into investor preferences and market leadership. BlackRock’s ETHA: This fund led the pack with a substantial $476.02 million in inflows, demonstrating strong investor trust in one of the world’s largest asset managers. Fidelity’s FETH: Following closely, Fidelity’s FETH attracted $154.69 million, solidifying its position as a significant contender in the Ethereum ETF market. Grayscale’s mini ETH: Adding $51.34 million, Grayscale’s mini ETH also saw considerable interest. Bitwise’s ETHW: Bitwise’s ETHW contributed $10.85 million to the total. Grayscale’s ETHE: The larger Grayscale ETHE fund saw $7.83 million in inflows. Franklin Templeton’s EZET: Franklin Templeton’s EZET rounded out the top contributors with $3.59 million. These figures, compiled from data by Trader T on X, underscore the competitive yet growing landscape for Ethereum-based investment products. The remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, indicating that the majority of new capital is concentrating in a few key offerings. Why Does This Digital Asset Investment Trend Matter? The consistent and significant digital asset investment into Spot Ethereum ETFs holds profound implications for the wider cryptocurrency market. It is not merely about daily numbers; it signifies a pivotal shift in how traditional finance interacts with digital assets. Institutional Validation: Large inflows from major financial institutions via ETFs provide a stamp of approval, potentially encouraging more conservative investors to explore the crypto space. Market Liquidity and Stability: Increased investment through regulated products can contribute to greater market liquidity and potentially reduce volatility for Ethereum, making it a more attractive asset class. Future Growth Potential: Sustained inflows could pave the way for more diverse crypto-backed financial products and further integration of digital assets into mainstream investment portfolios. However, investors should always consider market volatility and conduct thorough research. While these inflows are positive, the crypto market remains dynamic. This trend undeniably strengthens Ethereum’s position as a foundational asset in the evolving digital economy. The recent surge in U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs inflows marks a significant milestone for the digital asset landscape. With $704.32 million flowing in on August 13 alone, and a seven-day streak of positive movements, it is clear that institutional and retail investors are increasingly embracing Ethereum as a core component of their portfolios. This momentum, led by major players like BlackRock and Fidelity, highlights the growing maturity and acceptance of regulated crypto investment vehicles.

Ethereum’s price performance has prompted Standard Chartered, one of the UK’s largest financial institutions, to significantly revise its price projections for the cryptocurrency. Ethereum Consolidates 4% Below All-Time Highs Currently, the Ethereum price is consolidating above the $4,600 level, which could serve as a crucial support point as if ETH breaks through its previous all-time high of $4,878 reached in 2021, it may enter a new phase of price discovery. Presently, a mere 4% gap separates Ethereum’s current price from that record, but analysts at Standard Chartered, led by Geoff Kendrick, are optimistic for a new bullish phase for the cryptocurrency. They forecast a bullish trend that could nearly double the Ethereum price by the end of the year, raising their year-end target from $4,000 to $7,500. Furthermore, they have set an ambitious 2028 target of $25,000 for ETH. Related Reading: The Grand Bitcoin Roadmap: Crypto Expert Says $160,000 Still In The Works Several key factors underlie this optimistic outlook. Firstly, the recent approval of Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has led to significant market activity. Ethereum ETFs recently recorded $1 billion in inflows, marking the largest daily influx to date. Year-to-date, these exchange-traded funds tracking ETH’s price have attracted $8.2 billion, representing around 1.5% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. Additionally, legislative progress in the United States, particularly with the passage of the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, has bolstered Ethereum’s prospects. These developments are expected to enhance liquidity in the Ethereum ecosystem, as a substantial portion of stablecoins—often considered a stealth bullish driver for ETH—are issued on the Ethereum blockchain. Currently, major stablecoins like USDC, issued by Circle (CRCL), and USDT, developed by Tether, primarily operate within Ethereum’s ecosystem, further supporting the altcoin’s price performance. Greater Impact From Institutional Investments Beyond these bullish developments, there is a growing trend among public companies adopting Ethereum treasury strategies similar to those employed by Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) with Bitcoin (BTC). As reported by NewsBTC on Tuesday, approximately 865,000 ETH is now held by these companies, reflecting a broadening interest from institutional investors looking to capitalize on Ethereum’s long-term potential. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price Crash Below $3, But There’s Good News Adding to the bullish sentiment, analyst VirtualBacon has shared forecasts suggesting that if Bitcoin approaches $150,000 and the ETH/BTC ratio rises to 0.044, Ethereum could reach prices between $6,000 and $7,000 this year. The analyst noted in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), that Ethereum’s smaller market capitalization means that each dollar from institutional investors has a more pronounced effect on its price compared to Bitcoin. VirtualBacon identifies $3,350 as a potential floor for ETH, unless Bitcoin experiences a significant downturn. He emphasizes that the pivotal moment for Ethereum will be clearing the $4,850 resistance level, which could quickly propel ETH above $6,000. As of this writing, ETH trades at $4,636, registering a 4.3% surge in the 24-hour time frame.

Chainlink, Ethereum, XRP, and an emerging player, MAGACOIN FINANCE, are standing out as some of the best crypto to buy. Chainlink Price Heads to $24: Is $30 Next Chainlink (LINK) has been on a notable run, gaining over 51% in the past week and holding near $23. On-chain data reveals over 2 million LINK worth $46 million have been withdrawn from exchanges in just 48 hours. The best crypto to buy often shows strong accumulation, and Chainlink’s On-Balance Volume (OBV) indicator confirms steady buying pressure. Additionally, its Total Value Secured in DeFi is now above $93 billion. Technical charts show $24.86 as the next target to beat, as a break above it will open the door toward the $29–$30 range. Ethereum Heads To All-Time Highs Ethereum has grown past $4,700, closing in on its all-time high of $4,867. Glassnode says ETH’s recent strength is being pushed by a six-day streak of spot ETH ETF inflows totaling $2.3 billion, including a record $1 billion in a single day. Major accumulation is also rising, with treasury holdings exceeding $16.5 billion, and more than 30% of ETH staked, limiting immediate sell pressure. Network activity is equally good, with daily transactions at 1.87 million and total value locked in DeFi at $95 billion. Cryptoquant analysts see $4,750 as the next resistance, with a decisive break sending ETH into a “price discovery” phase. Other forecasts range from $7,500 to $13,000, with long-term prices as high as $20,000. These factors make Ethereum one of the best crypto to buy ahead of a possible Q4 price frenzy. XRP Could Reach $11 to $50? While XRP hovers around the $3 mark, optimism is growing within the community. Technical analyst Dark Defender and other prominent voices argue that $3 is not XRP’s ceiling. They cite promising multi-year chart patterns like the triangle formation and flag break out setup. Predictions vary: Mario Nawfal suggests $10 by the end of 2025 as Bitcoin hits $225,000. Ali Martinez targets $11–$12, and Patrick Riley sees $30 in this cycle. Some extreme projections, like $50 or even $1,000, stem from XRP’s role as a settlement layer for global currencies. With improved regulatory clarity and institutional buying, XRP’s long-term case remains healthy, making it among the best crypto to buy. MAGACOIN FINANCE Recognized as a Prime Entry Crypto MAGACOIN FINANCE has also been gaining attention as one of the best crypto to buy for long-term, growth-focused investors. The project operates on a security-first framework and has been audited to ensure safety. Currently, in its initial phase, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a powerful market entry, with industry watchers noting its potential ahead of incoming exchange listings. Conclusion Chainlink, Ethereum, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are all presenting compelling cases as the best crypto to buy now. However, MAGACOIN holds a more promising position as it is in its early phase and exchange listing is coming soon. You can learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE via the official website.

Per official details, the firm manages over $27 billion in total assets. Choreo Reveals Exposure To Bitcoin ETF According to a new filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Choreo LLC now holds stakes in multiple Bitcoin ETFs. Its largest position is in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), with 51,679 shares valued at more than $3 million as of June 30. The firm also holds 22,976 shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), worth around $1.9 million at current market prices. Further, it also holds 8,314 shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF (BTC), valued at nearly $400,000. Additionally, Choreo owns 13,607 shares of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), valued at approximately $1.3 million. Data from SoSoValue shows that BlackRock’s IBIT leads in total net assets, currently worth $89.11 billion. Notably, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded four consecutive months of positive inflows, attracting over $17 billion between April and July . In August, however, the ETFs faced a net outflow of $321 million. Meanwhile, the total net assets tied to spot BTC ETFs have surged to over $155 billion. This amount represents 6.48% of BTC’s total market cap. Beyond wealth management firms like Choreo, an increasing number of educational institutions’ endowment funds are also steadily increasing exposure to BTC ETFs. Recently, Harvard disclosed a $117 million stake in BlackRock’s IBIT ETF. Most recently, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund increased its indirect exposure to BTC by 192%, year-on-year. The fund’s total exposure now stands at 7,161 BTC. BTC ETF Euphoria Grips Crypto Market While BTC continues to trade on the verge of a new all-time high (ATH) – exchanging hands at slightly above $120,000 at the time of writing – institutional interest in BTC ETFs has also been rising at a rapid pace. For instance, BlackRock’s IBIT ETF reached a whopping $70 billion in assets under management in under a year, marking a record for rapid adoption of BTC-focused regulated financial products. In the same vein, following US President Donald Trump’s November 2024 election victory, his social media firm – Trump Media – has accelerated its crypto ambitions. Last month, the firm filed for a third ETF, which will track the performance of five different cryptocurrencies. That said, the financial watchdog is carefully evaluating new ETF applications due to the inherent risks of digital assets.

For traders navigating the complex world of derivatives, understanding market dynamics is crucial. One key indicator of market sentiment and volatility is crypto perpetual futures liquidation . This process occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is automatically closed due to insufficient margin to cover potential losses. Over the past 24 hours, we have witnessed substantial liquidation events across major digital assets, offering a stark reminder of the inherent volatility in the perpetual futures space. What Exactly is Perpetual Futures Liquidation? In the high-stakes environment of the cryptocurrency derivatives market , perpetual futures contracts are a popular tool. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely. However, they come with leverage, meaning traders can control large positions with a relatively small amount of capital. This leverage amplifies both potential gains and losses. When the market moves against a leveraged position, and the trader’s margin balance falls below a certain threshold, the exchange automatically closes the position. This is known as liquidation. It serves as a protective mechanism for the exchange to prevent negative balances. These events can trigger cascading effects, especially when large positions are involved, leading to further price movements and more liquidations. A Deep Dive into Recent Crypto Liquidation Data The past 24 hours have revealed significant activity in crypto liquidation , particularly on the short side. This means that a large number of traders who bet on prices falling (short positions) saw their positions closed out as asset prices moved upwards. Let’s break down the key figures: Ethereum (ETH): A staggering $141.80 million in ETH perpetual futures positions were liquidated. A substantial 64.46% of these were short positions. This indicates a strong upward price movement for Ethereum, catching many short sellers off guard. Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin saw $129.84 million in liquidations. An overwhelming 89.03% of these were short liquidations. This high percentage highlights a significant short squeeze in the BTC market, as Bitcoin rallied, forcing bearish bets to close. Solana (SOL): Solana experienced $30.01 million in liquidations, with 58.61% being short positions. While lower in absolute terms compared to ETH and BTC, this still represents a notable amount for SOL, suggesting a similar upward trend challenging short positions. These figures collectively paint a picture of a market where bullish momentum prevailed, leading to substantial losses for those holding bearish positions. Understanding these short liquidations provides valuable insight into recent price action and market sentiment. Why Do Short Liquidations Dominate? The prevalence of short liquidations in this 24-hour period suggests a rapid upward price movement, often referred to as a “short squeeze.” When prices begin to rise, short sellers face increasing pressure. As their losses mount, their margin levels deplete. This triggers liquidations, which in turn can push prices even higher as exchanges buy back the underlying asset to close positions, creating a positive feedback loop. This phenomenon is common in volatile markets like cryptocurrency. For traders, this serves as a critical reminder about the risks associated with high leverage, especially when betting against the prevailing market trend. Even seasoned traders can be caught off guard by sudden shifts in momentum. Actionable Insights for Traders Navigating the perpetual futures market requires a robust strategy. Firstly, always manage your risk. High leverage can lead to quick and significant losses. Consider using stop-loss orders to limit potential downside. Secondly, understand market sentiment. While shorting can be profitable, betting against strong bullish trends, especially when driven by significant buying pressure, can be perilous. Finally, keep an eye on liquidation data. Platforms often provide real-time liquidation charts, which can signal potential turning points or confirm strong trends. This data helps you gauge the broader market’s health and the intensity of certain price moves. Concluding Thoughts on Crypto Liquidation The recent crypto perpetual futures liquidation data underscores the dynamic and often unforgiving nature of the cryptocurrency derivatives market. The significant short liquidations across Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana highlight a period of strong upward price action, punishing bearish positions. For anyone involved in trading, these events are a powerful lesson in risk management, the impact of leverage, and the importance of adapting to rapid market shifts. Staying informed about these crucial metrics can help you make more informed decisions and potentially avoid becoming another liquidation statistic. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are crypto perpetual futures? A1: Crypto perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without an expiry date, often using leverage. Q2: How does crypto liquidation work? A2: Liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position loses too much value, and their margin balance falls below a required level. The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses. Q3: Why were short liquidations so high in the past 24 hours? A3: High short liquidations suggest that the price of the underlying cryptocurrencies moved significantly upwards, catching many traders who had bet on prices falling (short positions) off guard. Q4: What is a “short squeeze”? A4: A short squeeze happens when a rapid increase in an asset’s price forces short sellers to buy back the asset to limit their losses, which further pushes the price up, creating a cascading effect. Q5: How can traders avoid liquidation? A5: Traders can reduce the risk of liquidation by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders, monitoring their margin levels closely, and having a robust risk management strategy.

DAPP has outperformed the S&P 500 since February and offers exposure to digital asset transformation but remains highly volatile and concentrated. Liquidity concerns persist with DAPP, and investors should use limit orders; the fund's high yield is not guaranteed given inconsistent distributions. While DAPP benefits from crypto's rally, especially in ether, the late-Q3 period is historically weak, warranting continued caution for new highs. Ether has taken Wall Street by storm. The Ethereum network's fuel, the digital asset is a medium of exchange and utility token within that ecosystem. Often considered a younger brother of sorts to bitcoin, “ETH” has taken off since notching a sharp low in April. At one point, ether was down 57% on the year, but, after a remarkable comeback, it is now up 34%. That’s above bitcoin’s strong return and better than what spot gold has produced. Tom Lee, Chairman of Bitmine (BMNR), has taken on a similar strategy as Michael Saylor, CEO of Strategy (MSTR). The Fundstrat co-founder now stands behind ether, which has perhaps prompted a fresh wave of optimism across the crypto space. The GENIUS Act was another bullish catalyst. Unfortunately, not everything linked to bitcoin and ether has gone to the moon. Today, I’m revisiting the VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP). I had a hold rating on the fund back in February , and shares are up a solid 12% since then, outperforming the S&P 500. While the valuation is more favorable, I see resistance on the chart, which keeps me cautious and sticking with a hold rating. Ether Now Beating Bitcoin & Gold In 2025 Stockcharts.com According to the issuer , DAPP aims to invest in companies at the forefront of the digital assets transformation while offering investors diversification through exposure to exchanges, miners, and infrastructure firms. The issuer states that fund offers access to companies that have the potential of earning 50% of revenue from digital assets. DAPP is a small ETF with just $277 million in assets under management as of August 11, 2025. Its annual expense ratio is moderate at 51 basis points, while the trailing 12-month dividend yield is actually high at 3.48%. Share-price momentum has been strong for much of this year, but I will note later that the fund has pulled back from its 2025 high, despite the crypto rally. DAPP is also a highly risky product , given elevated historical annualized volatility trends and a concentrated portfolio. Liquidity can be a concern—its median 30-day bid/ask spread is somewhat wide at 17 basis points, while average daily volume is near 600,000 shares. So, I encourage prospective investors to use limit orders, particularly around the market open. For an update on the portfolio, DAAP plots along the bottom portion of the Morningstar style box, indicating its significant weight to both US and ex-US small caps. I’d call out that 22% of the investment mix is allocated to international equities, which may help from a diversification perspective. I also like that the price-to-earnings ratio has retreated to just 21.4x, likely due to more upbeat EPS expectations for companies held in the fund, now that bitcoin and ether have jumped. DAPP: Portfolio & Factor Profiles Morningstar Zooming in on the sector breakdown, you’ll find that DAPP is deep into the fintech space. The vast majority of the portfolio is invested in crypto mining firms and companies related to providing retail investors with digital currency access. Interestingly, the ETF paid out a significant $0.5808 dividend on December 24, 2024, after two years without distributions. So, the yield is not a guarantee. DAPP: Holdings & Dividend Information Seeking Alpha Turning to seasonality, we are in the throes of what’s usually a tough stretch, affirming my cautious outlook. DAPP has fallen rather sharply, on average, from August through September. I concede that there’s limited price history, so I also pulled a long-term calendar view of bitcoin performance—once again, the back half of the third quarter has not been all that kind to crypto bulls. DAPP: Weak Late-Q3 Trends Seeking Alpha Bitcoin: Often Weak in August and September Barchart The Technical Take With shares potentially more compelling on valuation, but with negative seasonal considerations, DAPP’s technical situation is mixed. Notice in the chart below that resistance is in play at the all-time high from late last year. The fund failed at testing that level during the big Q2 rally that petered out in July. Now, with a bearish negative RSI momentum divergence, the bears are trying to gain control. But take a look at the long-term 200-day moving average. It’s still on the rise despite volatile price action throughout this year and general underperformance to bitcoin (and ether, more recently). Of course, I can’t dismiss the monster rally off the April low. For now, the $15-$16 zone appears to be support, while resistance is apparent between $20 and $21. DAPP: Rising 200dma, but Below the 2024 All-Time High Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line I have a hold rating on DAPP. The crypto-tied equity ETF has more than doubled from the post-Liberation Day nadir, the bulls have their work cut out for them if they want to bring this high-beta fund to new highs amid a weak calendar stretch.",BTC-USD|ETH-USD|DAPP,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-14 03:10:23
