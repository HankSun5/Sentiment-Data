It’s now sitting at $123,334.03, up 2.82%, with traders who tried to short the asset losing big. Coinglass showed that over $397 million got wiped out in market liquidations, and $259 million of that came from short positions that bet against this price climb. JUST IN: Bitcoin hits new ATH of $123,500 pic.twitter.com/ldUksSC5zd — Cryptopolitan (@CPOfficialtx) August 13, 2025 Ether didn’t sit this one out either. It’s now just 3% away from its 2021 high, and helped push total crypto market cap to a record $4.2 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. Ether has been lagging behind for a long time, but it just caught a second wind. A flood of money has moved into Ether-focused investment funds. These funds are, of course, public companies buying Ethereum like Michael Saylor used to buy Bitcoin. Those companies now hold nearly $17 billion worth of ETH, per numbers from StrategicEthReserve.xyz. ETHZilla stock explodes after Ether stash reveal One of those Ether-stacking firms is 180 Life Sciences Corp., now trading as ETHZilla. The firm used to be in biotech, but after it pivoted into crypto and announced that it holds 82,186 ETH tokens, its stock price shot up. The price jumped more than 200% on Tuesday and kept rising, gaining another 50% in premarket trading on Wednesday. ETHZilla is backed by billionaire Peter Thiel, which likely added fuel to the fire. The change in momentum is also visible in trading activity. For the first time ever, nine US spot Ether ETFs recorded more daily trades than Bitcoin ETFs, based on Bloomberg data. In August alone, those Ether ETFs pulled in $1.7 billion, while Bitcoin funds saw a net outflow of $436 million. Traders aren’t just buying ETH, they’re betting on it long-term. Coinglass data showed Ether futures across all exchanges reached $66 billion in open interest, a new record high. There’s a policy angle here too. The GENIUS Act, passed in July, cleared the way for stablecoins to go fully mainstream in the US. That bill is already having ripple effects. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, said stablecoins already account for 40% of blockchain fees, and over half of them run on Ethereum. In his words, “The GENIUS Act should indirectly boost Ethereum’s layer one activity.” With more stablecoin use, Kendrick expects more DeFi action, and DeFi lives on ETH. The bank has now revised its forecast. Standard Chartered moved its year-end 2025 Ether price target from $4,000 to $7,500, citing the ongoing demand spike and ecosystem growth. Bitcoin holds its spot at the top of long-term growth rankings Even with Ether doing numbers, Bitcoin is still the asset everyone’s watching for long-term growth. A new Bitcoin Intelligence Report compared its 10-year gains to other major assets. Over the past decade, Bitcoin’s modeled compound annual growth rate (CAGR) came in at 42.5%. That number crushed everything else. The Nasdaq had a CAGR of 16%, Gold averaged 10.65%, and US M2 money supply grew at just 6% per year. Even adjusted for its limited supply, Gold only hit 12.88%. Right now, the next level for Bitcoin is just above $130,000, where resistance is building. But the year-end forecast remains way higher. Using a mix of power-law trends and quantile analysis, analysts have pinned $200,000 as a realistic top by the end of 2025. The base projection still holds at $120,000, but a cyclical bull phase could push it higher. That’s not where it ends. Looking further ahead, the same models put Bitcoin’s price in 2035 between $1.2 million and $1.5 million. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The agency’s latest regulatory greenlight came in as it accepted the filing for the Invesco Galaxy Spot Solana ETF, a proposed exchange-traded fund (ETF) designed to track the spot price of Solana (SOL). The SEC has said it has received and is reviewing the application for the Invesco Galaxy Spot Solana ETF, which means it is not too far from making a decision that many expect to be an approval. The acknowledgement comes after Cboe BZX Exchange submitted a Form 19b-4 to propose a rule change for listing and trading the ETF, which initiates the SEC’s formal review process. BREAKING: SEC acknowledges Invesco Galaxy Spot $SOL ETF filing pic.twitter.com/utvILTqFEH — Cryptopolitan (@CPOfficialtx) August 13, 2025 Why the acknowledgement matters The filing is the latest Solana ETF to be filed this year and comes after the REX Shares SOL ETF Application was filed in May and marked “immediately effective,” signaling that the launch could happen soon. With the SEC’s acknowledgement, the Invesco filing joins filings from issuers like VanEck, 21Shares, Bitwise, Grayscale, Canary Capital, Franklin Templeton, and Fidelity who are also waiting for the SEC’s nod. Meanwhile analysts have remain optimistic despite the delay with many estimating a high chance that the SEC approves them by October, an optimistic outlook encouraged by Trump’s love of crypto and the existence of CME-listed Solana futures, which strengthens the argument for a spot product. There are kinks to be worked out Despite the Solana ecosystem’s excitement about a future ETF approval, the SEC has remained cautious, delaying decisions while citing the need for further evaluation. There is also the fact that the debate about whether Solana should be classified as a commodity or a security , which could impact approval, is still ongoing. Securities and commodities are regarded as two different financial instruments, and in America, they are regulated by two different government organizations. Where crypto is concerned, a legal determination that a cryptocurrency is either one of those financial instruments has far-reaching implications about how it can be sold, where it can be listed and who has the right to sue in the event an issuer oversteps the mark. If a cryptocurrency is classified as a security, cryptocurrency issuers and exchanges are required to seek the necessary licenses from their securities regulators, which is usually difficult to do. As such, the crypto industry does a lot to ensure that cryptocurrency sales and developments don’t trespass any securities laws. Most avoid violating the securities law through decentralization after all, if a cryptocurrency is created in such a way that a securities regulator is unable to identify a central, coordinated group responsible for pumping the value of the token, the asset is less likely to be considered a security. Any cryptocurrency that is classified as a security risks not getting listed by exchanges who want to avoid fines from the SEC for listing unregistered securities. The debate has heated up this year thanks to all the ETF filings but its outcome is anybody’s guess. One potential result would be some cryptocurrencies getting classified as securities, while others are classified as commodities. However, this could lead to an even more complex regulatory landscape where different cryptocurrencies are subject to varying rules and regulations. Get seen where it counts.

The South Korean newspaper Metro Seoul reported that the Presidential Committee on State Affairs announced its plans at a public briefing on August 13. South Korea Crypto Reform Taking Shape The committee spoke of a five-year plan for state administration, naming 123 state affairs-related tasks. Among these tasks named were “the construction of a digital asset ecosystem” and “developing the domestic cryptoasset market.” Both were identified as “key national tasks” for the administration, which took office in early June this year following the election of President Lee Jae-myung. President Lee Jae Myung on Wednesday laid out a sweeping five-year policy agenda, detailing 123 national tasks ranging from constitutional reform to industrial growth and market fairness. https://t.co/52cb7gzOvi — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) August 13, 2025 Lee has spoken repeatedly about his intention to build up the domestic crypto sector, with deregulation and stablecoin regulation high on his agenda. The President appears keen to let domestic firms issue won-pegged stablecoins . Leading banks and IT companies have reacted by registering scores of stablecoin-related trademarks . Others are hurriedly rolling out crypto-related business plans, aware that this may allow non-financial firms to develop advanced payment platforms. However, one of President Lee’s key campaign pledges was left off the five-year plan, namely the dissolution of the Financial Services Commission (FSC). The FSC is the nation’s top financial regulator. Its Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) polices the country’s crypto exchanges , issuing operating permits and conducting periodic on-site inspections. It also enforces anti-money laundering and terrorist financing protocols at the trading platforms. The Government Complex Building in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: Seoul Institute [CC BY 4.0]) FSC: Vociferous Critic No More? In previous years, the FSC has been a vociferous critic of the crypto sector. But in recent years, as governments have relaxed their hardline stance to the industry, it has spoken in favor of reform. Under the proposal, FSC’s supervisory duties were to transfer to the Financial Supervisory Service. The FSC’s policy-related tasks were due to transfer to the Ministry of Strategy and Finance. But Lee’s plan to scrap the FSC proved controversial, even among senior ministers. While his offices have yet to confirm that the President has shelved the policy, the five-year plan appeared to suggest the proposal may have moved to the back burner. There was no mention of the regulatory reorganization move on the plan. And seven of the 123 tasks were assigned to the FSC. The newspaper added that crypto reforms are a “key focus” for both the government and the National Assembly this year. As such, reforms are “expected to gain momentum” in the weeks ahead, Metro Seoul wrote. ‘Time to Play Catch-up’ Political leaders are concerned that South Korea is being left behind. They note that over the past two years, the global crypto market has expanded by about 262%. While crypto investment has spiked in the US, the European Union, and Japan, driven by institutionalization drives, the same cannot be said for Seoul. The outlet wrote: “Delayed institutional reforms and a lack of legislation in South Korea have left the domestic cryptoasset market significantly lagging in terms of competitiveness.” South Korea says President Lee Jae Myung to visit Japan this month https://t.co/PmtmRcPibF — Nikkei Asia (@NikkeiAsia) August 13, 2025 The FSC has prioritized its plan to allow corporations to buy and sell crypto. It also wants to tak a “more relaxed approach” to regulations. The regulator has previously spoken of its intention to roll out crypto-related regulations before the end of this year. However, skeptics say that a final decision on the fate of the FSC is yet to be taken. Talks to abolish the regulator “may resume in the future,” the newspaper explained. Unnamed financial sector officials opined that the debate over the reorganization of the financial regulators would “continue until the end of the year.” Earlier this month, the Seoul district of Gangnam announced it had recouped $144,057 in unpaid taxes in the first half of this year by seizing coins from tax evaders .

The figure matched June’s reading and came in below the 2.8% forecast, giving traders confidence that inflation is staying under control. Meanwhile, a new coin, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is gaining the attention of large buyers in the market. Latest Development Driving the Surge The news drove Bitcoin to its Monday high of $122,190 before sellers came in and pulled the price down three percent to $118,500. The dip failed to suppress Bitcoin, which was soon able to recover to almost $119,500, with the $120,000 threshold still in sight. One of the important indications of the next thrust would be a daily close above a figure of $119,982. Technical signals continue to suggest the possibility of a bull run. An earlier breakout of a flag pattern this week indicates that the most recent dip was a healthy retest prior to continuation. Market analysts envision an end-year target of $137,000, with a declining trendline breakout noted on Sunday. A break above 120,000 would not just be a psychological break but the first of its kind in the history of Bitcoin, which could potentially lead to the next leg in the current rally. Unless Bitcoin reclaims the $120,000 mark, analysts fear short-term pressure with support at $117,650 and $115,650. MAGACOIN FINANCE Draws Early Interest from Professional Traders Experienced traders are adjusting positions to add MAGACOIN FINANCE prior to its possible breakout. Although Bitcoin steals the show, people regard MAGACOIN as a distinct presale project that has received a select number of community supporters and innovative tokenomics. The presale is already picking up momentum with consistent activity on the blockchain and an increasing number of dedicated investors. Conclusion Bitcoin’s battle around the $120,000 mark is more than just a price story—it sets the tone for the rest of the market. A definite breakout will spark not only the top cryptocurrency but also a series of altcoin surges. Although BTC is well-established, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making quite a name by being one of the hottest presale tokens in 2025. The next few weeks could be crucial to traders who are monitoring the two coins.

A massive Ethereum whale transfer , involving 60,000 ETH, recently moved from Coinbase Institutional to an unknown digital wallet. This intriguing development, valued at approximately $284 million, has naturally sparked considerable discussion and speculation across the crypto community. Such large movements often signal shifts in sentiment or strategic maneuvers by major players. Understanding these transfers is key to grasping the broader market dynamics. What Just Happened? Unpacking the Large ETH Transaction Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking service, reported a substantial movement of Ethereum. Specifically, 60,000 ETH, worth an astounding $284 million at the time of the transfer, departed from a wallet associated with Coinbase Institutional. This massive sum then arrived at a newly created, previously unknown wallet address. This particular large ETH transaction immediately caught the attention of market observers due to its sheer size and the institutional origin. Origin: Coinbase Institutional, indicating a major entity. Destination: An entirely new, unknown wallet address. Value: Approximately $284 million, a significant sum for any single transfer. Such transfers are not uncommon in the fast-paced world of digital assets. However, their scale and the entities involved always warrant closer examination. When an institutional-grade custodian like Coinbase Institutional is involved, it often suggests a strategic decision by a major investor or a large corporate entity. Why Do These Coinbase Institutional ETH Movements Matter? Movements from platforms like Coinbase Institutional ETH accounts are particularly noteworthy because they often represent the actions of large-scale investors, corporations, or even other financial institutions. These entities typically execute well-thought-out strategies rather than impulsive trades. Therefore, a transfer of this magnitude from such a source can be interpreted in several ways: Off-Exchange Custody: The owner might be moving their assets into self-custody or a different cold storage solution for long-term holding, reducing immediate selling pressure on exchanges. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: The ETH could be destined for an OTC desk, facilitating a large private sale that avoids impacting public exchange order books. Strategic Deployment: The funds might be earmarked for a specific decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, staking, or participation in a new blockchain initiative. Understanding the potential motives behind such a move helps analysts predict possible market impacts. It also highlights the growing participation of institutional capital in the Ethereum ecosystem. Understanding Crypto Whale Activity : Who is Behind This Ethereum Whale Transfer ? The term ""whale"" in crypto refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Their actions, known as crypto whale activity , can significantly influence market sentiment and price. While the destination wallet for this Ethereum whale transfer remains ""unknown,"" the identity of the whale itself is often obscured by the pseudonymous nature of blockchain. However, the origin from Coinbase Institutional narrows down the possibilities somewhat. It could be: A hedge fund rebalancing its portfolio. A major corporation moving treasury assets. A high-net-worth individual consolidating holdings. An arbitrage firm adjusting positions across different platforms. The lack of immediate movement from the new wallet often suggests a long-term holding strategy rather than an imminent sale. This can be a bullish signal, as it removes a large block of ETH from potential immediate liquidation on exchanges. What Are the Potential Market Implications of This Unknown ETH Wallet ? The emergence of an unknown ETH wallet holding such a substantial amount of Ethereum naturally leads to questions about its future impact on the market. While the immediate effect of this transfer on Ethereum’s price was minimal, the long-term implications depend heavily on the whale’s intentions. Reduced Selling Pressure: If the ETH is moved to cold storage, it indicates a strong belief in Ethereum’s long-term value, potentially reducing supply on exchanges. Future Volatility: Should the funds eventually move back to an exchange, it could signal an intent to sell, potentially leading to increased supply and price volatility. Market Confidence: Large institutional movements, even to unknown wallets, can boost confidence among retail investors, signaling that major players are still actively engaging with the asset. Observing the future activity of this new wallet will be crucial for understanding its long-term market influence. The crypto community will closely monitor any subsequent transfers or transactions from this address. In conclusion, the recent Ethereum whale transfer of 60,000 ETH from Coinbase Institutional to an unknown wallet is a prime example of the dynamic and often mysterious nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the immediate implications are subject to speculation, such movements underscore the growing institutional interest in Ethereum and the power of large holders to influence market perception. This event reminds us that vigilance and understanding of on-chain data are essential for navigating the exciting world of digital assets. Keep an eye on this wallet; its next move could tell us a lot. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ""Ethereum whale transfer"" mean? A1: An Ethereum whale transfer refers to the movement of a very large amount of Ethereum (ETH) by an individual or entity (a ""whale"") from one wallet to another, often involving millions of dollars. Q2: Why is a transfer from Coinbase Institutional significant? A2: Coinbase Institutional serves large-scale investors and corporations. Transfers from such platforms often indicate strategic moves by major players, rather than typical retail trading activity, making them noteworthy for market analysis. Q3: Does this transfer mean the ETH will be sold soon? A3: Not necessarily. Moving ETH to an unknown new wallet, especially if it remains dormant, can indicate a shift to long-term cold storage or an Over-the-Counter (OTC) deal, rather than an immediate sale on public exchanges. Q4: How can an ""unknown new wallet"" be tracked? A4: While the owner’s identity remains anonymous, blockchain explorers allow anyone to track the activity of any wallet address. The crypto community monitors these large, unknown wallets for any future transactions that might reveal the whale’s intentions. Q5: What are the potential impacts of such large ETH movements on the market? A5: Large ETH movements can influence market sentiment, potentially signaling bullish (if moved to cold storage) or bearish (if moved to an exchange for selling) trends. They can also contribute to short-term price volatility or indicate significant institutional interest. Did this significant Ethereum whale transfer spark your interest?

MAGACOIN emerges as the best altcoin to buy now, attracting ADA and SHIB investors in 2025. Avalanche (AVAX) and XRP have both pushed through important technical resistance levels. Traders are watching these breakouts closely, with price targets well above current ranges. Analysts believe these moves could mark the start of a broader crypto market rally. While the spotlight is firmly on these two heavyweights, another name is starting to appear more often in discussions — MAGACOIN FINANCE. This crypto presale is being talked about as a fresh, exciting addition to the list of the best altcoins to buy now, with some traders shifting funds from older holdings toward this rising contender. Avalanche Breaks $25: Chart Patterns Hint at Bigger Moves AVAX climbed from a 24-hour low of $22.8 to significantly more than $25, breaking above a resistance level that had been topping price action for weeks. Analysts point to a gigantic long-term falling wedge formation, created since the 2021 high, as proof that momentum is possibly building. Elite Crypto suggested that the final phase of this trend could be ending. If AVAX is able to break above its next resistance level — roughly 40% higher than its current price — it could start a bull run to $80. That kind of rally would cement Avalanche’s place among the best altcoins to buy now. For the majority, the question is not if AVAX will probe higher levels, but whether it can sustain them if the rally picks up steam. XRP Clears $3.2: Eyes Set on Higher Targets XRP has gone up over 3%, breaking the $3.2 threshold and reawakening bull hopes in its fans. Analyst Javon Marks stated that based on past bull cycle performance, XRP could be looking to hit ~$9.63, which is likely a possible jump from here. While there is no rally guaranteed, most of the traders see these levels as part of a larger XRP price forecast 2025 picture. Especially if future market triggers play out well. Its capacity to remain above $3.2 will be a short-term observation. Continued gains above could also enhance its position among individuals seeking the best crypto to invest in 2025. Some investors are closely watching the whales’ moves. Accumulation patterns before important price action have historically indicated the direction of the next move, and with more extensive ETF discussions prevailing, speculation is rife. Cardano and Shiba Inu Investors Shift Toward MAGACOIN FINANCE Cardano (ADA) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have long had loyal investor bases, but recent weeks have shown a gradual change in behavior. More holders from these communities are moving capital into MAGACOIN FINANCE. The reason is simple — many see greater growth potential in a project still early in its market journey, rather than in assets that have already experienced multiple major cycles. This shift is being driven by both narrative appeal and potential upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been discussed alongside some of the best crypto presale stories of the year. It has drawn attention from traders looking for high-risk, high-reward plays. Its positioning in market chatter is also growing, especially as it gains traction among those searching for the best crypto to buy now with strong upside targets. The project’s early signs point toward a growing online presence and a narrative that resonates with traders looking beyond the usual big names. If momentum continues, it could climb into the same conversations as the top crypto to invest in 2025.

AVAX eyes a $100 mark by 2030, bolstered in the short term by network growth and expanding DeFi use. RNDR recently crossed $3.60, benefiting from a decisive breakout and broader market recovery. Yet, the most striking figures come from Cold Wallet . At Stage 17, priced at $0.00998, with a fixed launch at $0.3517, the return sits at 3,423%. With over $5.95 million secured, this is more than a speculative hope; it’s a measurable gap ready to close. While AVAX and RNDR build over time, Cold Wallet’s path is direct, steep, and already in motion. Will AVAX Hit $100 by 2030? A Data-Based View Avalanche’s long-term targets spark debate, but numbers suggest varied possibilities. Analyst projections for 2025 range widely, with many pointing to a $26–$33 zone this year if bullish trends hold. Ambitious scenarios project $50 by mid-decade, while some models stretch to $100 between 2026 and 2027, and even higher by 2030 in peak cases. The leap to $100 relies on factors such as ETF approvals, enterprise integrations, and steady DeFi expansion. Timing entries becomes critical, as each presale stage narrows the profit gap. Whether traders focus on AVAX fundamentals or speculative price surges, aligning timing with data remains key. RNDR Maintains Strength Above $3.60 Render’s firm hold above $3.60 reflects renewed confidence after escaping a multi-month descending wedge, where it had hovered between $2.90 and its ceiling. Technical signs, including RSI and MACD trends, point toward building bullish energy. Macro view of a screen of trading terminal with abstract financial graph and digits. Trading and forex concept. 3D Rendering The coin’s recovery from key support and its breakout structure suggest more upward potential, especially with market sentiment improving. While past patterns don’t secure future results, RNDR’s chart now supports an optimistic view if it sustains above $3.60 and market momentum continues. Stage 17: Cold Wallet Nears Final Sub-$0.01 Pricing Cold Wallet approaches a defining point with Stage 17 pricing at $0.00998, one of the last points before crossing $0.01. For market participants, moving past this threshold often signals faster gains ahead. The locked launch price of $0.3517 sets up a 3,423% ROI potential. History shows that later presale stages deliver the sharpest jumps, and with over $5.95 million already raised and 710 million coins sold, the end of Stage 17 will quicken price increases. Larger buyers often act now, aware that scarcity drives momentum when under $0.01 pricing ends. Cold Wallet’s approach centers on securing value before broader awareness lifts demand. Soon, sub-$0.01 will be gone, and those entering now will hold that advantage when listings go live. Final Words Reaching triple digits for AVAX depends on adoption cycles, scaling, and macro conditions. RNDR’s rebound is technically solid but will need sustained traction and market alignment. Cold Wallet stands apart with a fixed ROI model, clear presale momentum, and its final low-cost stage offering a rare entry before launch. From $0.00998 today to $0.3517 at listing, the growth path is built into the numbers. In markets where timing and precision decide gains, Cold Wallet is positioned to turn early action into substantial results.

He opens his note with an unambiguous header—“My Top Altcoin Picks: DOGE”—and then lays out the case in plain language: “We’ve been actively trading Doge for about a week and a half now, and I’ve been sharing updates with you every step of the way. Doge looks extremely bullish on the weekly time frame, potentially closing this week with a bullish engulfing candle if we can manage to close above $0.241. That would be fantastic.” Why Dogecoin Is The Top Altcoin Right Now The weekly DOGE/USDT chart shows price pressing into a well-defined supply band labeled “Resistance” around $0.27–$0.30, where July’s “Higher High” ($0.287) sits. Underneath, a rising weekly trendline that has contained price since mid-2023 currently tracks through the upper-$0.16s to low-$0.17s, with a horizontal “Support” shelf near $0.13 aligned to the prior “Swing Low.” The staircase of “swing low → higher → higher low → higher high” marked on the chart remains intact. The analyst ties the structure to a specific pattern roadmap. “We may also be forming a broadening ascending wedge pattern here, and the potential upside target of this pattern could be as high as the all-time highs at $0.75,” he writes. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $1? Only If This Plays Out, Says Analyst Extending the projection, he adds: “If we extend this further out in time, we could even argue that the 1.618 Fibonacci extension around $1.17 might come into play. Of course, we’d need to break through the resistance levels marked on the chart to see something like that,” before situating the trade in market context: “If the market continues as it is—Bitcoin dominance dropping and ETH continuing its upward momentum—I don’t think this is out of the question for Doge.” Momentum reads argue there is room. On the chart, weekly RSI has turned up from the mid-30s, reclaimed its signal, and now sits in the mid-50s to low-60s—well shy of the overbought band that accompanied the prior thrust. The analyst highlights that runway explicitly: “Using the RSI as an indicator, there’s still significant room for growth before we enter the overbought territory, which is typically when things get exciting.” He also frames the setup within a higher-timeframe impulsive structure: “Technically speaking, Doge has experienced two significant impulses on a higher timeframe, both setting higher highs and higher lows. Now, we’re looking for a third impulse.” Positioning matters to him as well. “Looking at Doge as a top 10 crypto asset, we see that all other cryptos in the top 10, except for Cardano and Solana, have reached all-time highs… Doge remains behind, and I believe the major impulse is still yet to come.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Buy The Dip: $1 Billion DOGE Added On execution, he points to the lower-timeframe tape confirming the bias: “On the lower timeframes, we’re seeing higher highs and higher lows, which suggests that the impulse may have already begun.” That leads to the trade thesis: “With all this in mind, it’s an exciting time for altcoins, and I believe that Doge’s risk-to-reward ratio, especially considering its position as a top 10 asset, makes it an attractive trade even from current levels.” Peer technicians are aligned. In a brief community ping titled “Good boy Doge,” the analyst reiterated the same levels and structure from earlier in the week. Fellow trader CRG explained the patience trade: “Nothing much to update. Price just chilling for now, been consolidating for 6 months making higher lows. DOGE is gonna full send at some point, no doubt in my mind, just gotta be patient.” He summarized the rationale behind positioning with a screenshot captioned, “This is why we are in the $DOGE trade fam.” From here, the immediate trigger is mechanical and visible on the chart: a weekly settlement above $0.241 would print the bullish-engulfing confirmation the analyst is watching at the mouth of resistance. Acceptance through the $0.27–$0.30 band would reopen the path toward the mid-$0.30s and the prior rejection in December last year when DOGE peaked above $0.48, while failure to hold the rising trendline would defer the move to the next demand zones near $0.17 and $0.13. As long as the sequence of higher lows remains unbroken, the wedge continues to frame a credible springboard toward the analysts’ stated targets, with $0.75 as the first historical waypoint and the 1.618 extension at ~$1.17 reserved for a fully developed impulse. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.242.

BlockchainFX (BFX) is closing in on its $5.5 million softcap, already securing $5.08 million from 4,323 backers for its planned multi-asset trading platform covering cryptocurrencies, stocks, ETFs, and commodities. Ozak AI, priced at $0.005 in Stage 4, has passed the $1.7 million mark with a proposition that blends blockchain infrastructure with AI-powered predictive analytics. Strong results for both, but BlockDAG’s momentum is operating at a scale far above the rest. The project has raised $373 million, sold more than 25.1 billion coins, and delivered over 2,660% returns to those who bought in during Batch 1. At today’s Batch 29 price of $0.0276, near-term targets suggest a jump to $1, representing 3,522% potential ROI. With over 200,000 holders and millions mining before launch, every batch sold moves BlockDAG (BDAG) closer to its $600 million goal and pushes early-stage pricing further out of reach. BlockchainFX (BFX) Closing in on Softcap The BlockchainFX presale has now raised $5.08 million, bringing it to 92.45% of its $5.5 million softcap. The project’s pitch outlines a trading platform capable of integrating over 500 assets, ranging from crypto to traditional financial instruments like ETFs and commodities, into one ecosystem. Listed features include daily staking rewards in both BFX and USDT, instant asset swaps, and a revenue-sharing model where up to 70% of trading fees are returned to users. This mix of incentives aims to attract both active traders and long-term participants. Presale numbers show 4,323 contributors so far, with payment accepted in several major cryptocurrencies. BlockchainFX positions itself as a bridge between conventional markets and blockchain-based assets. Whether this integration gains traction will depend on post-launch adoption, user experience, and competition in the multi-asset trading space. Ozak AI Presale Pushing Toward $2 Million The Ozak AI presale, now in Stage 4 at $0.005 per unit, has raised over $1.7 million. The next phase will see the price increase to $0.01. The project plans to merge blockchain capabilities with artificial intelligence, focusing on predictive analytics to support decision-making across multiple sectors. Ozak AI’s proposed ecosystem includes the Ozak Stream Network for real-time data delivery, customizable Prediction Agents designed for specific industries, and a decentralised infrastructure powered by DePIN. This combination of blockchain and AI aims to provide actionable insights while maintaining data security and transparency. While its concept gives it a defined niche, long-term success will depend on how effectively it executes beyond fundraising. Factors like developer engagement, integration with existing data pipelines, and competitive positioning in the AI-crypto crossover space will decide its trajectory. BlockDAG Closing in on $600M Milestone BlockDAG’s original presale roadmap targets $600 million across 45 batches, and that goal is now in clear sight. The project has already secured $373 million in sales, moving more than 25.1 billion BDAG coins into circulation before launch. The speed of this progress has been boosted by large-scale purchases early in the campaign and a growing community eager to secure positions before later price tiers take over. The current active stage is Batch 29, priced at $0.0276. For comparison, those who entered in Batch 1 have already achieved a 2,660% return. Based on a conservative near-term projection of $1, new entries at today’s price could see 3,522% ROI shortly after launch. Beyond that, speculative forecasts of $5, $10, or even $20 hint at much higher upside over time. These numbers sit on top of a foundation that is already built. The network counts more than 200,000 holders, 4,500 developers working on over 300 planned Web3 projects, and 2.5 million active users of the X1 Miner app. In addition, nearly 19,300 hardware miners have been sold, contributing close to $7.8 million to overall sales. Each completed batch not only pushes BlockDAG closer to its $600 million finish line but also reduces the supply available at lower price points. As those tiers disappear, opportunities for cost-effective entry will vanish, leaving open-market pricing to be determined by demand once the coin lists publicly. Which Project Holds the Top Crypto Presale Title? Presales often generate excitement, but the real test is what happens after the first stage of funding. BlockchainFX (BFX) has already raised $5.08 million, 92.45% of its softcap, while promoting a platform that offers daily staking rewards, instant swaps, and a 500+ asset trading lineup. It shows promise, but still faces the adoption test once it launches. Ozak AI is nearing the $2 million mark in Stage 4, with a technology stack designed to merge blockchain and AI-driven analytics. It has an interesting product direction, but must execute effectively after fundraising to stand out in an increasingly competitive market. BlockDAG, on the other hand, combines presale acceleration with a visible and functioning ecosystem. At $0.0276 in Batch 29, early participants from Batch 1 are already up 2,660%, while current buyers could see 3,522% ROI if the coin reaches $1 post-launch. With 200,000 holders, thousands of developers building on its network, and millions mining before the mainnet is even live, BlockDAG’s track record makes it the strongest contender for the top crypto presale right now.

50051654,555365,1755129650,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50051654.jpeg,Bitcoin Treasury Company Metaplanet Reports Strongest Quarter Ever,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-treasury-metaplanet-strongest-quarter-ever/,"Bitcoin treasury firm Metaplanet has just delivered its strongest quarter ever, with revenue rising by 41% compared to the previous quarter. Metaplanet Has Seen A Sharp Flip In Net Income In a new post on X, Metaplanet has shared the numbers related to its Q2 2024 performance, revealing significant quarter-over-quarter growth in several key metrics. The Japanese company recorded a revenue of ¥1.239 billion ($8.4 million) and gross profit of ¥816 million ($5.5 million), up 41% and 38% compared to the last quarter, respectively. The bigger story, however, is the dramatic turnaround in ordinary profit and net income. The former stood at a loss of ¥6.9 billion in Q1, but flipped to a profit of ¥17.4 billion ($117.8 million) in Q2. Similarly, the latter went from -¥5.0 million to +¥11.1 billion ($75.1 million). The firm’s net assets also surged to ¥201.0 billion ($1.36 billion), corresponding to a quarter-over-quarter increase of a whopping 299%. “This is the strongest quarter in Metaplanet’s history,” commented Simon Gerovich, the company’s president. Metaplanet, which transitioned to a Bitcoin treasury model last year, says its strategy is simple: “to prudently and rapidly accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible on behalf of our shareholders.” This approach is similar to the one adopted by Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly Microstrategy). In the past quarter, the strategy has seemingly worked out for Metaplanet, with its record-breaking quarter being backed by the appreciation of its BTC reserves and continued accumulation efforts. On Tuesday, Gerovich announced a new acquisition for the company involving 518 BTC. These tokens were bought at an average price of $118,519, meaning the total stack cost the firm $61.4 million. Following this purchase, Metaplanet’s Bitcoin reserve has grown to 18,113 BTC, with a cost basis of $1.85 billion. At the current exchange rate, these holdings are worth $2.18 billion, putting the firm into a profit of 17.8%. While treasuries like Strategy and Metaplanet are busy buying, some veteran players in the market have been using the bull run prices to sell, as revealed by institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) in an X post . From the above chart, it’s visible that Bitcoin long-term holders have been shedding their holdings recently. This isn’t anything unusual, as the diamond hands of the sector have historically moved to take their hard-earned profits during major bull rallies. What’s different this time, however, is the fact that the selloff has been more gradual than previous cycles. Only time will, though, whether this is an indication that the current cycle is going to be different or if this fact will have no effect on its length. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $120,200, up more than 5% over the last seven days.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Treasury|btc|BTCUSDT|Metaplanet|Metaplanet Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-14 00:00:50

A significant development has just emerged from South Korea: Upbit, a leading crypto exchange, has officially launched its dedicated Upbit Custody platform. This groundbreaking service is specifically designed to meet the sophisticated demands of institutional crypto investors , marking a pivotal moment for digital asset security in the region. What is Upbit Custody and Why Does it Matter? Upbit Custody is more than just a storage solution; it’s a comprehensive crypto custody platform built with enterprise-grade security in mind. Operated directly by Upbit, it provides a trusted environment for corporations and institutions looking to safeguard their valuable digital assets. This launch underscores the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency market, as institutional participation increasingly relies on secure and compliant infrastructure. The platform’s core strength lies in its commitment to secure digital asset storage . Unlike typical online wallets, Upbit Custody utilizes dedicated offline wallets. These are completely isolated from the internet, significantly reducing the risk of online hacking attempts. Imagine your digital wealth locked away in a high-security vault, completely disconnected from any external threats – that’s the level of protection Upbit aims to offer. How Upbit Ensures Unrivaled Digital Asset Security Beyond offline storage, Upbit Custody employs an innovative multi-part secret key distribution system. This advanced mechanism is a critical component of its robust digital asset security framework. By splitting the secret key into multiple parts and distributing them, the system dramatically lowers the risk of both insider leaks and external hacking. It’s a proactive approach to protecting investments, ensuring that no single point of failure can compromise assets. For institutions, this level of security is non-negotiable. They manage significant capital, and any breach could have catastrophic consequences. Upbit’s meticulous design addresses these concerns head-on, providing peace of mind to major players entering or expanding their presence in the crypto space. Key Benefits for Institutional Crypto Investors What advantages does Upbit Custody bring to the table for large-scale investors? Firstly, it offers unparalleled security, which is paramount for managing substantial digital portfolios. Secondly, it provides a compliant and regulated pathway for institutions to engage with cryptocurrencies, reducing regulatory uncertainties. Moreover, the direct operation by Upbit, a reputable exchange, adds a layer of trust and reliability. Enhanced Security: Utilizes dedicated offline wallets and multi-part key systems for maximum protection. Risk Mitigation: Significantly reduces exposure to hacking and insider threats, safeguarding assets. Institutional Trust: Operated by a major South Korean crypto exchange, ensuring credibility and reliability. Compliance Support: Provides a robust infrastructure designed to meet stringent regulatory adherence. This development signifies a crucial step towards broader institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. As more secure and compliant solutions like Upbit Custody emerge, the barrier to entry for traditional financial entities lowers considerably, paving the way for new opportunities. The Future Landscape of Crypto Custody Platforms The launch of Upbit Custody sets a high bar for other players in the market. It highlights a clear trend: as the crypto ecosystem matures, the demand for specialized, highly secure, and regulated crypto custody platforms will only intensify. This focus on security and institutional-grade services is vital for the long-term growth and stability of the digital asset market.

This growth presents a potential opportunity for digital assets such as XRP, which offers low-cost, fast transactions and could be integrated into QR wallet systems to facilitate payments in these underserved regions. Global QR-based payment volumes reached approximately $5.4 trillion in 2024, according to industry data, and are projected by Juniper Research to grow to around $8 trillion by 2029. Currently, QR codes account for nearly half of all mobile wallet transactions worldwide, making them a critical component of digital payment infrastructure. XRP Price Projections in a QR Wallet Adoption Scenario If XRP were to gain significant traction in the QR payment sector, market models suggest substantial price growth could follow. One projection, based on a payment utility framework, estimates that if XRP processed 10% of global QR-based transactions by 2029, equivalent to about $800 billion annually, its utility-based value would be approximately $0.674 per token. However, because cryptocurrency markets often trade at values above their utility price due to investor speculation, applying a market behaviour multiplier suggests a potential range of $6.74 to $33.70. A second projection focuses on capital inflows that could result from widespread adoption. If QR wallet usage in rural and offline markets generates $200 billion in new investment into XRP, historical patterns indicate that such inflows could significantly expand the market capitalization. Using a market growth factor observed in past crypto cycles, the projected valuation would rise to around $4.175 trillion, translating to an estimated XRP price of roughly $70.38 . This figure represents an aggressive growth scenario in which XRP plays a central role in digital payments across developing economies. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Global Indicators Supporting QR Payment Growth Current trends reinforce the expectation that QR wallets will continue expanding, particularly in regions with large unbanked populations. In India, for example, rural and semi-urban areas accounted for 60% of all transactions processed through the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) by 2023. Transaction volumes rose from 18 million in 2017 to over 8 billion in 2023, with total value increasing from $16.7 billion to $1.7 trillion in the same period. In the Asia-Pacific region, digital wallets handled almost two-thirds of global mobile payments in 2023, totaling $9.8 trillion. In Africa, mobile payment platforms such as M-Pesa reported a 32% increase in active users last year, with QR-based solutions contributing to that growth. Technological advancements now enable QR payments to be made without a constant internet connection, utilizing offline methods such as static codes and Bluetooth. These capabilities are particularly valuable for merchants, farmers, and small traders in rural settings, enabling cashless transactions even in areas with limited connectivity. If adoption in these markets continues at its current pace, XRP’s integration into QR wallet systems could position it as a key player in the future of global digital payments.

This incredible milestone highlights Bitcoin’s growing influence and its undeniable presence in the modern financial landscape, signaling a significant shift in how we perceive value and investment in the digital age. What Does This Astounding Bitcoin Market Cap Achievement Mean? This remarkable ascent signifies more than just numbers; it represents a fundamental shift in how the world perceives Bitcoin . For years, skeptics questioned its long-term viability, yet its consistent growth has defied expectations. Reaching the fifth spot globally by Bitcoin market cap places it alongside established behemoths such as gold, silver, and major corporations, underscoring its maturity as a significant financial instrument. It validates the belief held by many early adopters that Bitcoin is not merely a passing fad but a revolutionary force. Validation: This achievement offers strong validation for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, demonstrating the potential for decentralized digital currencies to compete with traditional assets. Mainstream Acceptance: Surpassing a household name like Google in market capitalization brings Bitcoin further into mainstream consciousness, potentially attracting new investors and institutional interest. Economic Impact: As Bitcoin’s influence grows, its movements can have broader implications for global financial markets, impacting investment strategies and wealth management. The Journey: How Bitcoin Became a Leading Digital Asset How did Bitcoin achieve such a monumental feat? Its journey began over a decade ago as a decentralized digital currency, free from traditional banking systems. Initially viewed with skepticism and largely confined to tech enthusiasts, Bitcoin gradually gained traction. Over time, it has evolved into a recognized store of value, often dubbed ‘ digital gold ‘ by proponents. This evolution has attracted both individual investors seeking alternative investments and large institutions looking to diversify their portfolios. The increasing institutional interest, coupled with growing mainstream acceptance, fuels its continued climb as a prominent digital asset . Major corporations, investment funds, and even some countries are now exploring or adopting Bitcoin, further solidifying its position. This sustained interest, despite periods of volatility, demonstrates a fundamental belief in its long-term potential and its role in a digitized future. Is Bitcoin Truly the New Digital Gold? Navigating the Future Many investors now view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, much like traditional gold. Its finite supply, transparent ledger, and decentralized nature make it an appealing alternative for wealth preservation in an increasingly uncertain global economy. While its volatility remains a factor, the long-term trend suggests a strong correlation with its perceived value as a scarce digital asset . This narrative strengthens its position within the broader financial ecosystem, offering a compelling alternative to traditional safe-haven assets. The broader cryptocurrency market is inherently dynamic, and Bitcoin leads the charge. While its ascent is impressive, understanding the nuances of this market is crucial. Investors should always consider market volatility, regulatory developments, and technological advancements when engaging with digital assets. However, Bitcoin’s consistent performance in achieving new milestones, like its current ranking among global assets , demonstrates its resilience and potential for future growth. The future will likely see continued innovation and integration of digital assets into everyday finance. The fact that Bitcoin market cap has eclipsed major corporations like Google is a testament to its disruptive power and increasing acceptance. It solidifies Bitcoin’s role not just as a niche technology, but as a formidable player in the global financial arena. As the world continues to embrace digital transformation, Bitcoin’s journey from an obscure internet currency to a top-tier global asset is truly extraordinary. This milestone invites us all to consider the evolving nature of wealth and the remarkable potential of decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is market capitalization? Market capitalization, or market cap, is the total value of a company’s or asset’s outstanding shares or units. For Bitcoin, it’s calculated by multiplying the current price of one Bitcoin by the total number of Bitcoins in circulation. Q2: Why is Bitcoin’s market cap surpassing Google significant? It’s significant because it demonstrates Bitcoin’s growing economic influence and its increasing acceptance as a legitimate asset class, putting it on par with some of the world’s largest and most established corporations. Q3: Is Bitcoin considered a ‘global asset’? Yes, Bitcoin is increasingly recognized as a global asset due to its worldwide accessibility, decentralized nature, and ability to be traded across borders without traditional intermediaries. Its market cap ranking further solidifies this status. Q4: What factors contribute to Bitcoin’s market cap growth? Key factors include increasing institutional adoption, growing retail investor interest, its finite supply (21 million coins), its role as a hedge against inflation, and its continuous technological development. Q5: What are the risks associated with investing in Bitcoin? While promising, Bitcoin investments carry risks such as high price volatility, potential regulatory changes, security concerns (e.g., hacks), and market manipulation. It’s crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your risk tolerance. If you found this article insightful, please share it with your network!

The recent surge has had ripple effects across the broader crypto landscape—benefiting not only large-cap Layer-1 chains but also boosting attention toward emerging altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE , which is currently in the final phase of its presale. While Solana captures headlines for its robust infrastructure and DeFi liquidity, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing increasing interest from the opposite end of the market: early-stage, high-upside retail speculation. Solana DeFi TVL Hits $14.18 Billion As of August 11, 2025, Solana’s DeFi TVL reached $14.18 billion , up from $10.45 billion just three weeks prior—representing a 36% increase and a 60% gain from prior Q2 lows. The growth has been fueled by a sharp rise in SOL’s market price, which is trading near $195.50, and heightened activity on key protocols like Raydium, Orca, and Meteora , which collectively processed over $22 billion in DEX volume during a single week. Stablecoin inflows have also played a significant role, particularly USDC , which now represents more than 70% of Solana’s stablecoin market share. Analysts attribute this institutional inflow and liquidity growth to Solana’s improving network reliability, ongoing scalability upgrades, and its success in securing strategic partnerships with asset managers and infrastructure firms. While the TVL increase is partly price-driven, the network’s growing user base and expanding DeFi infrastructure point to deeper fundamental growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A High-Risk Contender in a Rising Market In parallel to the institutional rally lifting chains like Solana, a markedly different trend is unfolding at the speculative end of the market. MAGACOIN FINANCE , an emerging altcoin with meme aesthetics but structured tokenomics, has advanced through multiple presale stages and is approaching full allocation. While it does not yet participate in DeFi activity like Solana or Ethereum, its strategic positioning as a low-cap, high-potential launch gives it a different kind of relevance in the current market cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE has successfully completed an independent audit conducted by leading blockchain security firms, receiving a strong rating for its smart contract integrity and overall protocol safety. The audit confirms that MAGACOIN’s codebase meets high security standards, providing investors with greater confidence ahead of its presale completion and official launch. Looking Ahead If current trends continue, Solana is on track to challenge Ethereum’s dominance in DeFi user activity, particularly among fast-moving, cost-sensitive protocols. However, the spotlight is also expanding to include new-generation tokens that represent retail-driven momentum and meme-era virality—now refined through more transparent and deflationary token models. As institutional demand lifts top-tier altcoins , and retail appetite fuels presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE , the remainder of 2025 could showcase not just a market recovery—but a rebalancing between infrastructure and community-led innovation.

Google just provided a significant update regarding its Google Play crypto policy , specifically clarifying the rules for non-custodial wallets . This crucial announcement brings much-needed clarity and relief to the digital asset space. What Sparked the Confusion Around Google Play Store Crypto? Earlier reports caused a stir within the cryptocurrency community. News outlets suggested that Google Play Store would soon require all software wallet developers to obtain a license before publishing their crypto wallet apps. This created uncertainty for many developers and users alike. The initial understanding was that Google’s new policy aimed to “ensure a safe and compliant ecosystem for users.” However, the broad interpretation led to concerns about the future of self-custody tools on the platform. Google’s Official Stance on Non-Custodial Wallets Google quickly addressed the widespread speculation. Through its official “News from Google” account on X, the tech giant issued a definitive statement. It confirmed that “ non-custodial wallets are not in scope of Google Play’s Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Software Wallets Policy.” This clarification means that apps facilitating true self-custody, where users retain full control over their private keys, are exempt from the new licensing requirements. Google also announced it is updating its Help Center to reflect this important distinction, providing transparent information to developers and users. How Does This Clarification Impact the Crypto Wallet Policy? This update significantly impacts the landscape for crypto applications on Google Play. It creates a clear distinction between custodial services and non-custodial wallets . Here’s what this means: Reduced Burden for Developers: Developers of self-custody apps will not need to navigate complex cryptocurrency licenses to publish their applications. This fosters innovation and lowers barriers to entry. User Empowerment: Users retain easy access to tools that promote self-sovereignty over their digital assets. This aligns with the core principles of decentralization in the crypto world. Clearer Regulatory Lines: The clarification helps differentiate between entities that hold user funds (like centralized exchanges, which may still require licenses) and those that simply provide tools for users to manage their own assets. The policy initially applied to 15 jurisdictions, including the EU and the U.S. This broad scope made the clarification even more critical for global developers and users. What’s Next for Cryptocurrency Licenses and App Development? Google’s swift response demonstrates its commitment to fostering a secure yet innovative environment. The company’s focus remains on creating a safe space for users, while also understanding the nuances of the blockchain ecosystem. This decision on the Google Play crypto policy ensures that developers can continue building essential self-custody tools without undue regulatory pressure. It promotes a healthier balance between regulation and technological freedom. In conclusion, Google’s explicit statement regarding non-custodial wallets is a positive development for the entire crypto community. It provides essential clarity, reduces uncertainty, and supports the continued growth of decentralized applications on the Google Play Store. This move helps to reinforce trust and understanding within the evolving digital asset landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main difference between a custodial and a non-custodial wallet? A custodial wallet means a third party holds your private keys and controls your funds, similar to a bank. A non-custodial wallet gives you full control over your private keys and, therefore, your digital assets, meaning only you can access them. Q2: Why did Google introduce this crypto wallet policy in the first place? Google introduced the policy to ensure a safer and more compliant ecosystem for users on its Play Store. This aims to protect users from fraudulent activities and ensure financial service apps meet necessary regulatory standards, especially for services that custody user funds. Q3: Which jurisdictions are affected by Google’s Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Software Wallets Policy? The policy applies to 15 jurisdictions globally, including major regions like the European Union (EU) and the United States (U.S.). This broad application makes Google’s clarification on non-custodial wallets particularly impactful. Q4: Does this mean all crypto apps are now unregulated on Google Play? No, this clarification specifically exempts non-custodial wallets from the licensing requirements. Apps that function as cryptocurrency exchanges or provide custodial services may still be subject to strict licensing and regulatory policies, depending on the jurisdiction. Q5: Where can developers find the updated Google Play crypto policy information? Google is updating its Help Center to reflect this clarification. Developers should refer to the official Google Play policy documentation for the most current and detailed information regarding app requirements and cryptocurrency licenses .

This significant jump from the previous day firmly positions the market in the ‘Greed’ zone. Such a reading suggests that investors are feeling optimistic, perhaps even euphoric, about current cryptocurrency valuations and future prospects. This index provides a unique lens through which to view collective investor psychology . It helps us understand whether the market is driven by widespread panic and selling, or by an enthusiastic buying spree. When the index climbs into the ‘Greed’ territory, it often indicates a period of strong buying interest and positive momentum. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Really Measure? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index operates on a scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 represents ‘Extreme Fear,’ indicating that investors are very worried and likely selling their assets. Conversely, a score of 100 signifies ‘Extreme Greed,’ suggesting that the market is overbought and potentially due for a correction. The current score of 75 sits comfortably within the ‘Greed’ bracket, signalling widespread optimism. This comprehensive index considers six key factors to determine the prevailing crypto market sentiment : Volatility (25%): Measures current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it with average values. Social Media (15%): Scans various social media platforms for crypto-related hashtags and sentiment analysis. Surveys (15%): Gathers investor sentiment through weekly polls. (Note: Currently, this factor is paused). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Assesses Bitcoin’s market share. A rising Bitcoin dominance often indicates a shift from altcoins to Bitcoin, which can signal caution. Google Trends (10%): Examines search query trends for crypto-related terms, indicating public interest. Why is ‘Greed’ Dominating Crypto Market Sentiment Now? The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 75 reflects a prevailing positive outlook across the digital asset space. Several factors likely contribute to this elevated sense of ‘Greed’. Often, sustained price increases in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum can fuel optimism. When prices are consistently moving upwards, investors feel more confident, leading to increased buying activity and a general sense of euphoria. Moreover, positive news cycles, increased institutional adoption, or even anticipation of future market events can significantly boost crypto market sentiment . High trading volumes coupled with strong momentum, as measured by the index, suggest that a large number of participants are actively engaging in the market with a bullish bias. This collective enthusiasm can create a self-reinforcing cycle, pushing the index further into the ‘Greed’ zone. Navigating the Market: Understanding Bitcoin Dominance and Investor Psychology Understanding the components of the index is crucial for effective market analysis . For instance, Bitcoin dominance plays a nuanced role. While a rising index indicates overall greed, a significant increase in Bitcoin’s market share might suggest that investors are moving away from riskier altcoins towards the perceived safety of Bitcoin. This could be a sign of cautious optimism rather than pure speculative frenzy. Furthermore, understanding investor psychology is paramount, especially when the market leans towards ‘Greed’. While it feels good to be part of a rising market, periods of extreme greed can precede market corrections. Historically, when the index hits very high ‘Greed’ or ‘Extreme Greed’ levels, it often signals that the market might be overheated. Smart investors often consider this a time to exercise caution, rather than blindly following the crowd. Beyond the Numbers: Practical Market Analysis Tips The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool, but it should not be your only guide for market analysis . Think of it as a compass for sentiment, not a definitive map for trading. Here are some practical tips: Combine with Other Tools: Use the index alongside technical analysis (chart patterns, indicators) and fundamental analysis (project developments, real-world utility). Understand Context: A high ‘Greed’ score might be sustainable during a strong bull run, but it could also signal an an impending pullback during more volatile periods. Manage Emotions: The index highlights collective emotion. Your goal should be to make rational decisions, not emotional ones. Avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) when the market is overly optimistic. Risk Management: Always prioritize sound risk management strategies, regardless of the index’s reading. In conclusion, the ascent of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 75 underscores a vibrant and optimistic period in the crypto market. While this ‘Greed’ phase reflects strong positive sentiment and buying interest, it also serves as a subtle reminder for investors to remain vigilant. By understanding the underlying factors of the index and balancing emotional indicators with thorough market analysis, participants can navigate the dynamic crypto landscape more effectively. Staying informed and making rational decisions, even amidst collective enthusiasm, is key to long-term success in this exciting space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current sentiment of the cryptocurrency market, ranging from ‘Extreme Fear’ to ‘Extreme Greed’ on a scale of 0 to 100. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? It is calculated based on six weighted factors: volatility, market momentum/volume, social media activity, surveys (currently paused), Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends data. What does a ‘Greed’ reading mean for investors? A ‘Greed’ reading, like the current 75, indicates that investors are feeling optimistic and are actively buying. While positive, extreme greed can sometimes signal an overbought market that may be due for a correction. Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable trading tool? While valuable for understanding market sentiment, the index is not a standalone trading signal. It should be used in conjunction with other forms of market analysis, such as technical and fundamental analysis, to make informed decisions. How does Bitcoin dominance affect the index? Bitcoin dominance, which measures Bitcoin’s market share, is one of the factors influencing the index. A high Bitcoin dominance, especially when combined with high ‘Greed’, can sometimes suggest a shift towards Bitcoin as a safer asset, even amidst overall market optimism.

President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva outlined the initiative as an initial effort to assist affected exporters, with a legislative proposal to be sent to Congress for approval. Lawmakers from different political factions attended the event in Brasília, the first such gathering in months, which observers viewed as a sign of greater political cohesion in response to U.S. trade actions. The plan involves postponing certain tax obligations for companies harmed by the U.S. tariffs, assigning 5 billion reais ($930 million) in tax credits to small and medium-sized enterprises until the close of 2026, and broadening insurance coverage for orders that get cancelled. It also directs public institutions to purchase goods that can no longer be shipped to the U.S. A one-year extension will be granted for tax credits under Brazil’s “drawback” scheme, allowing companies to import materials without tax if used in producing goods for export. Lula calls U.S. move “unpleasant” “We cannot be scared, nervous and anxious when there is a crisis. A crisis is for us to create new things,” Lula said. He called the U.S. move “unpleasant” and argued the justifications for the sanctions “do not exist.” Trump has tied the tariff decision to legal proceedings against his political ally, former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest. Lula accused Washington of using human rights rhetoric as a political instrument, adding that Brazil would seek out new markets for its products. Trump has repeated claims made by Bolsonaro’s supporters that the former president’s prosecution for allegedly attempting to overturn the 2022 election is a violation of due process and a politically motivated effort. Lula responded that Brazil’s judiciary functions independently, free from interference by the executive branch. He emphasized that Supreme Court justices have publicly affirmed they will not yield to political pressure. Bolsonaro’s trial is expected to reach sentencing between September and October. Earlier this month, Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is presiding over Bolsonaro’s case, was sanctioned under the U.S. Magnitsky Act, which targets major human rights violators. De Moraes stated that all defendants were afforded due process and pledged to continue his work despite the sanctions. Shortly after Lula’s remarks, Rubio said the U.S. would restrict visas for officials from Cuba and other governments connected to what he called Cuba’s “exploitative labor export program.” He singled out Brazil’s “Mais Médicos” (More Doctors) program, introduced in 2013, which brought thousands of Cuban medical professionals to underserved parts of the country. Rubio labeled the initiative a “diplomatic scam,” while Brazil’s government maintains that nearly 25,000 doctors are currently working in the program, though it did not specify the number of Cubans among them. Despite the rising tensions, Lula said he would not immediately trigger Brazil’s reciprocity law to raise tariffs on U.S. products. “We like to negotiate. We don’t want conflict,” he said. “The only thing we need to demand is that our sovereignty is untouchable.” Finance Minister Fernando Haddad told attendees that Brazil “is being sanctioned for being more democratic than its aggressor.” The diplomatic dispute shows no signs of cooling, with both countries continuing to exchange measures and accusations while Brazilian exporters wait to see the effects of the new support program.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, Bitcoin (BTC) has achieved an astonishing milestone, soaring above the $124,000 mark. Currently, BTC is trading at an impressive $124,050 on the Binance USDT market. This remarkable Bitcoin price surge has captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, signaling a potentially new era for digital assets. It represents a significant moment, showcasing the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the crypto market. What’s Fueling This Remarkable Bitcoin Price Surge? When Bitcoin experiences such a dramatic ascent, several factors typically contribute to the momentum. A powerful combination of strong buying pressure and overwhelmingly positive market sentiment often drives these movements. Moreover, increased institutional interest can play a pivotal role, as large-scale investments bring substantial capital into the ecosystem. This influx of funds strengthens the overall market, propelling prices upward. Technical indicators also provide valuable insights. Breakouts above key resistance levels can trigger further buying, as traders and algorithms react to these signals. The narrative of Bitcoin’s scarcity, especially with its fixed supply, also continues to attract investors looking for a store of value. Consequently, these combined forces can ignite a powerful cryptocurrency rally , drawing in new participants and reinforcing the upward trend. Navigating the Current BTC Market Update While the excitement of a rapid ascent is undeniable, understanding the market dynamics is crucial. This significant BTC market update highlights the inherent volatility of digital assets. Prices can move swiftly in both directions, presenting both immense opportunities and considerable risks for participants. Therefore, a measured approach to Bitcoin trading is always advisable, regardless of market conditions. For those engaging in Bitcoin trading , careful consideration of strategies is essential. Here are some key aspects to remember: Stay Informed: Continuously monitor market news and analysis. Knowledge empowers better decision-making. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders to limit potential downsides. Diversify: While Bitcoin leads, a diversified portfolio across various digital assets can mitigate risk. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Understand your investment horizon. Short-term trading requires active monitoring, while long-term holding may weather market fluctuations. This current market environment demands diligence and a clear strategy. The Ripple Effect: Unlocking Digital Asset Gains Bitcoin’s performance often acts as a barometer for the broader cryptocurrency market. When BTC experiences a substantial Bitcoin price surge , it frequently creates a positive ripple effect across other digital assets. Altcoins, which are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, often see their values appreciate as investor confidence grows and capital flows from Bitcoin into these alternative assets. This phenomenon can lead to widespread digital asset gains throughout the entire ecosystem. A robust Bitcoin rally can also signal increased mainstream acceptance and adoption of blockchain technology. This wider acceptance, in turn, can attract more developers, businesses, and users to the decentralized space, fostering innovation and further growth. Consequently, the entire digital economy benefits, reinforcing the potential for sustained expansion and broader recognition. This interconnectedness means that Bitcoin’s success often paves the way for a healthier and more vibrant overall crypto landscape. What Does This Mean for Your Portfolio? As the market experiences this exciting period of digital asset gains , it is natural to consider its implications for personal investments. For existing holders, it might represent a validation of their long-term conviction. For prospective investors, it could signal a compelling entry point, albeit one that still requires careful consideration of personal risk tolerance. Always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions. The dynamic nature of the market means that opportunities are always evolving, but so are the potential challenges. In conclusion, the recent Bitcoin price surge above $124,000, as reported by Bitcoin World market monitoring, marks a truly exciting moment in the cryptocurrency space. It underscores the incredible potential of digital assets and the ever-evolving landscape of decentralized finance. While the journey of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be volatile, their ability to reach new highs continues to inspire and challenge traditional financial paradigms.

The Justin Sun lawsuit has just been filed, seeing the prominent Tron founder take on a major media powerhouse, Bloomberg. This legal action centers on the alleged planned release of highly sensitive financial information , sparking widespread discussion about privacy in the digital asset space. What exactly is happening, and what does this mean for the crypto community? What’s Behind the Justin Sun Lawsuit? Tron founder Justin Sun, a well-known figure in the blockchain industry, has initiated a legal challenge against Bloomberg. The core of this Justin Sun lawsuit stems from Bloomberg’s alleged intention to publish personal financial details belonging to Sun. According to a court filing, as cited by the X account “zoomer” (which boasts over 61,000 followers), this information is considered highly sensitive. This development immediately raises questions about the boundaries of financial reporting and individual privacy. It highlights the increasing tension between public interest in transparency and the right to keep personal financial dealings confidential, especially for high-profile individuals in the often-scrutinized crypto sector. The Stakes: Why is Crypto Privacy So Crucial? The concept of crypto privacy is a cornerstone for many in the digital asset space. While blockchain transactions are often public, the identities behind them are typically pseudonymous. However, when a major news outlet plans to reveal personal sensitive financial information , it touches upon fundamental concerns. Individual Rights: Everyone, regardless of their public profile, has an expectation of privacy regarding their personal finances. Security Concerns: The exposure of detailed financial data can potentially lead to security risks, including targeting for scams or hacks. Industry Perception: How such cases are handled can influence public trust in the crypto industry’s ability to protect its participants’ data. This case serves as a critical test for these principles within the evolving landscape of digital finance and media. Examining the Bloomberg Lawsuit The Bloomberg lawsuit brings a significant media entity into the legal spotlight. Bloomberg is renowned globally for its financial news and data services. Their alleged intention to publish this information suggests they believe it falls within the realm of public interest or newsworthiness. Conversely, Justin Sun’s legal team is arguing that such a publication constitutes an unwarranted invasion of privacy. The legal battle will likely hinge on the definition of “sensitive financial information” and whether its public disclosure serves a legitimate public interest that outweighs an individual’s right to privacy. This clash of interests is a common theme in high-profile media disputes. Implications for the Tron Founder and Beyond For the Tron founder , Justin Sun, this lawsuit is more than just a personal matter; it carries broader implications for his public image and the projects he leads, including Tron and BitTorrent. Such legal disputes can divert attention and resources, though they also underscore a commitment to protecting personal data. Beyond Sun, this case could set precedents for how media outlets report on the financial dealings of prominent figures in the cryptocurrency space. It may also influence how individuals, particularly those with significant crypto holdings, manage their public and private financial profiles. The outcome of the Justin Sun lawsuit will be closely watched by many. Navigating Sensitive Financial Information in Crypto The debate surrounding sensitive financial information is particularly complex in the crypto world. While many advocate for decentralization and pseudonymity, there’s also a growing push for transparency, especially concerning large holders or projects. This lawsuit highlights the delicate balance that needs to be struck for crypto privacy . Users and project founders in the crypto space often face unique challenges in maintaining privacy while operating in a largely open ledger environment. This legal action serves as a stark reminder of the potential for personal financial data to become a point of contention, necessitating robust legal and personal strategies for protection. What’s Next in This Developing Story? As the Justin Sun lawsuit unfolds, legal proceedings will determine the fate of this sensitive financial information. The outcome will have significant ramifications, not just for Justin Sun and Bloomberg, but for the broader discussion around media freedom, individual privacy, and the evolving nature of financial reporting in the digital age. We will continue to monitor this developing situation closely. The resolution of this Bloomberg lawsuit could shape future interactions between public figures in crypto and the media, impacting how personal financial data is handled and reported across the industry. In summary, the legal action taken by Tron founder Justin Sun against Bloomberg over the publication of his sensitive financial information marks a pivotal moment. It underscores the ongoing tension between media transparency and individual privacy rights, especially within the cryptocurrency sector. The outcome of this case will undoubtedly influence future discussions and practices regarding financial data and public figures in crypto. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Justin Sun? A: Justin Sun is the founder of Tron, a prominent blockchain platform, and a well-known figure in the cryptocurrency industry. Q2: What is Bloomberg accused of in the lawsuit? A: Bloomberg is accused by Justin Sun of planning to release his “sensitive financial information” without authorization. Q3: Why is this Justin Sun lawsuit important for crypto privacy? A: This lawsuit highlights the ongoing debate about individual financial privacy versus media transparency in the cryptocurrency space, potentially setting precedents for how personal financial data of crypto figures is handled. Q4: What is considered “sensitive financial information” in this context? A: While the exact details are part of the legal proceedings, it generally refers to personal financial data that, if disclosed, could lead to privacy breaches, security risks, or undue public scrutiny. Q5: What could be the potential outcomes of the Bloomberg lawsuit? A: The lawsuit could result in an injunction preventing the publication of the information, a settlement, or a court ruling that defines the boundaries of media reporting on private financial data, impacting future cases involving public figures in crypto.

In the past week, huge sums have flowed into Cardano, Avalanche, and Ethereum, sparking fresh speculation about where these assets could be heading next. From multi-million-dollar token buys to record-breaking on-chain numbers, the signs point to renewed whale interest. While the bigger names grab headlines, a new entrant called MAGACOIN FINANCE is also catching attention, with its fast-shrinking allocation supply adding urgency for those looking for the next breakout. Cardano and Avalanche Attract Heavy Buying Cardano has been in the spotlight following huge holders buying around 200 million ADA, worth around $166 million. It’s one of the largest accumulation periods of ADA over the past couple of months. Those wallets that are undertaking these shifts each contained between 100 million and 1 billion ADA, and their inclination to give more is raising eyebrows from traders following Cardano price prediction trends. Avalanche has also attracted media coverage for non-price reasons. In the third quarter, it hit an all-time high of 7.3 million in monthly active addresses, a clear sign that more individuals are engaging with the network. Many Avalanche price prediction watchers see this kind of activity as a potential boost for AVAX, putting it high on lists of the top altcoins to buy now. Ethereum Sees a Billion-Dollar Whale Entry Ethereum has delivered one of the biggest surprises in recent whale activity. A single buyer picked up 312,052 ETH worth about $1.34 billion spread across ten fresh wallets in just over a week. For traders watching Ethereum price prediction 2025 scenarios, this is a strong display of confidence in ETH’s potential. Not all whale activity has been in one direction, though. The group known as the “7 Siblings,” holding 1.21 million ETH valued at around $5.6 billion, started selling when ETH crossed $4,500. This mix of accumulation and profit-taking leaves traders debating whether ETH will keep pushing higher or take a breather. Supply Tightening: MAGACOIN FINANCE Allocation Spots Reducing Hourly While the big names draw the spotlight, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building its own momentum. Allocation spots are disappearing at a quick pace, with supply shrinking every hour. Early buyers are moving fast to secure their place before the window closes. This urgency is being driven by a growing community and mounting interest from traders searching for the best altcoin to buy now. The limited supply approach adds scarcity, and as demand builds, the conversation around MAGACOIN FINANCE is expanding. Its mix of timing, narrative, and scarcity is helping it break into discussions about the best altcoins to buy 2025. Whale Moves and New Players Shaping the Market The heavy ADA accumulation, record AVAX activity, and billion-dollar ETH buy show that large investors are still willing to make bold commitments in crypto. These moves can set the tone for broader market sentiment, especially for those looking at the top altcoins to buy now. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing that the action isn’t limited to the largest projects. With its supply shrinking fast, it’s positioning itself as an exciting new name heading into 2025.

Imagine the potential for significant growth! However, as the U.S. government allows more avenues for such participation, a crucial warning emerges for those considering crypto retirement plans . While these investments could boost portfolio efficiency, they also introduce a significant vulnerability, particularly during an economic crisis. Understanding Crypto Retirement Plans and Their Appeal Many investors are attracted to the high-growth potential of digital assets. They see cryptocurrency investments as a way to supercharge their long-term savings. The allure of quick gains or substantial returns often overshadows the inherent volatility and unique risks associated with this asset class. People hope to leverage the burgeoning crypto market to secure a more prosperous future. For decades, traditional retirement accounts have relied on stable, collateral-backed assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate. The introduction of cryptocurrencies represents a significant shift. This new frontier promises innovation but also brings uncharted territory for risk management within retirement portfolios. What Are the Hidden Dangers of Cryptocurrency Investments? South Korean firm Meritz Securities recently highlighted a major concern: cryptocurrencies lack collateral. Unlike traditional financial instruments, no underlying physical asset or government entity backs their value. Their prices are driven almost entirely by market sentiment, supply, and demand dynamics. This fundamental difference creates a precarious situation. According to Meritz Securities, a severe economic downturn could trigger a massive sell-off. Without collateral to underpin their value, there would be nothing to prevent crypto prices from collapsing. This scenario poses a direct threat to the stability of any retirement portfolio heavily exposed to these assets. Economic Downturn Impact: A Collateral Conundrum What happens when the global economy falters? During an economic downturn impact , investors typically seek safety in traditional, less volatile assets. Cryptocurrencies, by their very nature, tend to move in tandem with riskier assets, often experiencing amplified price swings. Consider these key differences: Lack of Intrinsic Value: Cryptocurrencies derive value from belief and utility, not physical backing. Market Sentiment Driven: Fear and panic can lead to rapid, uncontrolled price drops. Liquidity Concerns: In a widespread sell-off, finding buyers at reasonable prices can become challenging. Consequently, a portfolio heavily reliant on crypto could face devastating losses during a crisis, jeopardizing years of retirement savings. Mitigating Digital Asset Risks in Your Portfolio Understanding these vulnerabilities is the first step toward smart financial planning. While the potential for growth in crypto remains, a cautious approach is vital. Investors must actively manage digital asset risks within their retirement accounts. This means carefully considering the proportion of your portfolio allocated to cryptocurrencies. Financial experts often advise against putting all your eggs in one basket. For retirement savings, this advice is particularly critical. Diversifying across various asset classes can help cushion your portfolio against extreme market movements in any single sector, including volatile digital assets. Navigating Retirement Portfolio Diversification with Caution The key to a resilient retirement fund lies in intelligent retirement portfolio diversification . While including a small, speculative portion of cryptocurrencies might align with some risk appetites, it should never form the core of your retirement strategy. Traditional assets provide a foundational stability that cryptocurrencies currently cannot. Actionable Insights for Your Retirement Planning: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Understand how much volatility you can truly handle. Diversify Broadly: Include a mix of stocks, bonds, real estate, and other traditional assets. Limit Crypto Exposure: Consider a small, manageable percentage for digital assets that you are prepared to lose. Stay Informed: Continuously monitor market conditions and regulatory changes affecting cryptocurrencies. The Prudent Path Forward While the prospect of including cryptocurrencies in retirement accounts offers exciting potential, it also introduces significant, unbacked risks. The research from Meritz Securities serves as a stark reminder: during an economic crisis, the lack of collateral behind digital assets could lead to a severe price collapse. Therefore, investors must approach crypto retirement plans with extreme caution, prioritizing robust diversification and a clear understanding of the inherent volatility. Your financial future depends on making informed, balanced decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why are cryptocurrencies considered risky for retirement plans? A1: Cryptocurrencies are risky because they are not backed by collateral and their value is primarily driven by market sentiment and supply/demand. This makes them highly volatile and vulnerable to sharp price collapses, especially during economic downturns. Q2: What is the main concern raised by Meritz Securities? A2: Meritz Securities argued that in an economic crisis, the lack of collateral for cryptocurrencies means there is nothing to prevent their prices from collapsing during a severe sell-off, unlike traditional assets. Q3: How does an economic crisis impact cryptocurrency investments? A3: During an economic crisis, investors typically move towards safer assets. Cryptocurrencies, being highly speculative and lacking intrinsic value, often experience amplified price drops, potentially leading to significant losses for portfolios exposed to them. Q4: How can I mitigate digital asset risks in my retirement portfolio? A4: To mitigate risks, diversify your retirement portfolio broadly across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate). Limit your cryptocurrency exposure to a small, manageable percentage that you are comfortable losing, and continuously monitor market conditions. Q5: Is it advisable to put all my retirement savings into crypto? A5: No, it is generally not advisable to put all your retirement savings into cryptocurrencies due to their extreme volatility and lack of collateral. A balanced approach with robust diversification across traditional assets is recommended for long-term financial security. Share This Insight!

Solana (SOL) price analysis shows buyers holding firm above $173, aiming for a move toward $190. At the same time, the Polygon (POL) price chart is testing the $0.27 resistance, with a breakout likely to spark further gains. While these coins are pushing against key levels, BlockDAG (BDAG ) is already giving its community the tools they will use on launch day. With Dashboard V4 offering real-time market conditions, BDAG holders can refine strategies now instead of waiting for listings. The presale has passed $373 million, making BlockDAG’s momentum less about “waiting for the break” and more about acting early. Polygon Price Chart Hovers Near $0.27 Resistance The Polygon (POL) price chart shows the coin holding just under a major $0.27 barrier that has blocked several past attempts. After breaking above a long-term downtrend earlier this year, recent activity has formed higher lows, showing signs of steady strength. The current range is capped at $0.27 on the upside, with mid-$0.20s acting as the main support zone. Deeper support lies in the upper $0.10s to low $0.20s. A confirmed close above $0.27 with strong trading volume could trigger a move toward the low $0.30s. If price slips and fails to hold above the main support, the current consolidation could weaken, delaying any breakout. Solana Price Analysis Holds Above Key Support The Solana (SOL) price analysis highlights a rebound from the important $173 level, after briefly touching $173.43. Buyers quickly lifted it back to $175.43, with highs reaching $186.80 during the day. This recovery shows there is strong demand despite recent swings. Daily volume stands at $603.8 million, keeping market activity steady. The next major resistance is at $190, and a clear break above could set up a return to the $206.30 swing high. Until that happens, SOL appears to be consolidating above its key support while traders watch for fresh upward momentum. BlockDAG’s Dashboard V4 Gives Community Early Trading Experience BlockDAG has launched its Dashboard V4, a live trading interface that looks and works like a professional exchange. It connects wallets, streams real-time prices, and shows complete BDAG market data. This lets holders see exactly how trading will work once BDAG is listed. The presale has crossed $373 million, with over 25.1 billion BDAG coins sold across 29 batches. The current price is $0.0276, and Batch 30 will open at $0.029. Since the first batch, BDAG has climbed 2,660%, with the launch price set at $0.05. Sales also include $7.7 million worth of miners, totaling more than 19,250 units. This shows the network is ready for both trading and mining activity from day one. With each price step higher, the benefit of securing BDAG before launch grows stronger. By giving the community full access to a working trading dashboard, BlockDAG allows holders to test orders, monitor price moves, and prepare strategies under realistic market conditions. When trading officially begins, they’ll already know the platform inside out. The Best Crypto for the Future Could Already Be Moving Polygon’s price chart is pressing against $0.27, and Solana’s analysis shows bulls holding the $173 line. Both show signs of potential, but are still waiting for confirmation moves. BlockDAG is already in motion. It has raised $373 million, sold over 25.1 billion coins, and rolled out a complete trading dashboard before launch. With tools live now, it’s acting like a listed coin before even hitting the market. For those asking about the best crypto for the future, BDAG’s readiness and pace make it hard to ignore. SOL might rally, POL might break out, but BDAG is already building momentum in real time. The launch clock is ticking.

Related Reading: Ethereum Hits $4,300, Restoring Vitalik Buterin’s Crypto Billionaire Status Reports have disclosed the move came with a clear push to support the firm’s large Solana treasury, which has drawn attention from investors and rival corporate treasuries alike. Upexi Deepens Its Solana Bet According to Upexi’s own filings and public statements, the company now holds over 2 million SOL in its treasury. That stake has been built quickly through multiple purchases and capital raises, and publications place its value in the hundreds of millions of dollars depending on the SOL price used. Upexi says it is also using staking to earn yield from the holdings, a move meant to add steady income as it holds the tokens. upexi forms advisory committee, welcoming arthur hayes (@CryptoHayes) as first member arthur is cio of @maelstromfund and brings deep digital asset and institutional finance expertise committee will drive strategy, expand visibility, and unlock capital for our $SOL treasury… pic.twitter.com/lBtzxziL3r — Upexi (@UpexiTreasury) August 12, 2025 Upexi’s hiring of Arthur Hayes — a high-profile figure in crypto circles — is meant to sharpen strategy and help unlock more capital for the firm’s purchase plans. Reports say the advisory committee will guide visibility, partnerships and capital-raising for acquisitions tied to the treasury effort. The move has already helped lift investor interest in the company’s stock. Other Public Firms Join The Push Beyond Upexi, other public companies have made clear Solana bets. Based on reports, DeFi Development Corp. has increased its holdings to nearly a million SOL units after a fresh round of purchases and financing. That placement puts it among the biggest corporate Solana holders and gives it meaningful exposure to the altcoin’s price moves. Meanwhile, crypto miner BIT Mining disclosed purchases around 27,190 SOL and has said it will convert existing crypto holdings to focus on SOL while also launching a validator to stake tokens. These corporate moves are not just headlines. They represent predictable, on-balance-sheet demand that can tighten the available supply held by retail traders and exchanges. At the same time, concentrated positions raise questions about what would happen if any of these holders decided to change strategy or sell quickly.

50054676,555745,1755133258,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50054676.jpeg,Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund’s Indirect Bitcoin Exposure Reaches Over $860M,https://bitcoinist.com/norway-sovereign-wealth-indirect-bitcoin-exposure/,"Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, managed by Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), has increased its indirect holdings of Bitcoin to 7,161 BTC, valued at approximately $862.8 million as of June 30, according to new analysis from K33. This represents an 87.7% rise in the last six months and a 192.7% increase over the past year. The gains stem largely from the fund’s positions in companies with significant Bitcoin treasuries, including Strategy, Block, Coinbase, Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), and Metaplanet. K33 Head of Research Vetle Lunde explained that the calculation is based on NBIM’s shareholdings in these firms, multiplied by the amount of Bitcoin they hold. While Lunde noted the exposure is likely an outcome of NBIM’s broad, diversified investment strategy rather than a targeted bet on Bitcoin, he highlighted it as a clear example of how BTC is becoming part of mainstream financial portfolios, often by default. Growth Driven by Strategy Holdings and Corporate BTC Accumulation The most significant contributor to NBIM’s increased Bitcoin exposure is its stake in business intelligence and corporate BTC treasury firm Strategy. NBIM’s ownership in the company rose to 1.05% of its shares, valued at $1.18 billion at the end of June, up from 0.72% ($514 million) at the end of 2024. Strategy itself expanded its BTC holdings by 145,945 BTC in the first half of 2025, which added 3,340 BTC to NBIM’s indirect exposure over the same period. Additional exposure came from holdings in other public companies with sizeable Bitcoin reserves. Firms such as Block, Coinbase, MARA, and Metaplanet have increased or maintained significant BTC balances, further contributing to the upward trend. Lunde pointed out that per capita, NBIM’s Bitcoin exposure now amounts to roughly 1,387 Norwegian kroner, or about $138, for each Norwegian citizen. Broader Market Context and Currency Considerations Lunde emphasized that this growing indirect exposure aligns with a wider market pattern: any investor with a diversified equity portfolio today is likely to have some exposure to Bitcoin through corporate holdings. He expects this trend to strengthen as more companies allocate to BTC as part of their treasury strategies. “Odds are high that any index investor or broadly diversified investor currently holds a modest BTC exposure through proxies,” Lunde said, adding that the phenomenon is likely to accelerate over time. The report also placed the fund’s Bitcoin exposure within the context of BTC’s recent market performance. In US dollar terms, BTC reached an all-time high of more than $123,000 in July, up 11.9% from its January 20 level. However, gains are less pronounced in other currencies, with BTC up only 1.5% against the US dollar index and still below January highs in euros. According to Lunde, €105,600 remains a key resistance level for BTC in euro terms, highlighting the role of currency fluctuations in assessing Bitcoin’s price performance globally. NBIM’s growing indirect stake in Bitcoin demonstrates how exposure to the asset class can expand organically within large, diversified portfolios. Whether driven by deliberate allocation or as a byproduct of equity investments, the trend reflects Bitcoin’s deepening presence in global financial markets.

The Altcoin Season Index , a crucial metric for understanding cryptocurrency performance , recently hit 40. This signals a clear shift in the broader crypto market , indicating we are in a pronounced Bitcoin Season , where Bitcoin outperforms most other digital assets. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Reveal About Cryptocurrency Performance? The Altcoin Season Index serves as a vital barometer for the health and direction of the crypto market and overall cryptocurrency performance . Compiled by CoinMarketCap, it helps investors understand prevailing sentiment and asset dominance. How it works: This index measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Understanding the score: A score of 75 or higher indicates an Altcoin Season , meaning at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin. Conversely, a score of 25 or lower signifies a Bitcoin Season , where 25% or fewer altcoins have managed to outshine Bitcoin. Scores between 26 and 74 suggest a mixed or neutral market. When the index registers 40, as on August 14th, it suggests Bitcoin leads the pack, absorbing market liquidity. This indicates which assets drive momentum, rather than being a negative market sign. Why is the Crypto Market Currently in Bitcoin Season? The Altcoin Season Index ‘s recent jump to 40, reported by Bitcoin World, firmly places the crypto market in Bitcoin Season . This trend often emerges during market uncertainty, as investors flock to Bitcoin, perceiving it as a safer asset. Several factors contribute to Bitcoin’s dominance during such times: Flight to quality: In volatile environments, Bitcoin often acts as a “safe haven” within the crypto space due to its larger market capitalization. Liquidity concentration: When overall market sentiment is cautious, capital tends to consolidate into Bitcoin, leading to its outperformance. Macroeconomic factors: Broader economic conditions, like inflation concerns, can influence investor behavior, often leading to a preference for less speculative assets like Bitcoin. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for informed decisions. It helps recognize that the current environment is about Bitcoin’s gravitational pull, not individual altcoin strength. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Season: What Should Investors Consider? For investors, recognizing the ongoing Bitcoin Season is key to adapting strategies. This period presents both challenges and opportunities. While many altcoins may struggle, Bitcoin’s strength can pave the way for future altcoin rallies. Challenges: Underperformance of altcoins: Many altcoin portfolios may see stagnant or declining values relative to Bitcoin. Reduced speculative appetite: The market may be less receptive to new or unproven altcoin projects. Actionable Insights: Focus on Bitcoin: Consider accumulating Bitcoin if you believe in its long-term potential. Strategic Altcoin Selection: Prioritize altcoins with strong fundamentals, clear use cases, and established communities. Dollar-Cost Averaging: Continue to invest a fixed amount regularly to mitigate risk. Patience is a virtue during Bitcoin Season . It allows portfolio re-evaluation and strategic positioning for when tides turn towards an Altcoin Season . When Might We See Another Altcoin Season? The transition from Bitcoin Season back to an Altcoin Season is not always predictable, but it follows patterns within the broader crypto market cycle. Historically, after Bitcoin dominance, capital often flows into altcoins as investor confidence grows. Factors that could signal a return to an Altcoin Season include: Bitcoin’s Stability: A period where Bitcoin’s price stabilizes after a significant rally, allowing altcoins to catch up. Increased Risk Appetite: General improvement in macroeconomic conditions or positive crypto news. Technological Breakthroughs: Major developments within prominent altcoin ecosystems, like Ethereum upgrades, drawing attention. Declining Bitcoin Dominance: A sustained decrease in Bitcoin’s market dominance chart. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index regularly, alongside other indicators, provides valuable insights. While Bitcoin leads now, the dynamic nature of the crypto market ensures cycles will evolve. In conclusion, the Altcoin Season Index at 40 unequivocally points to a prevailing Bitcoin Season in the crypto market . This signals the current flow of capital and investor sentiment. Understanding these seasons and adapting your strategy allows you to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency performance with confidence. The crypto world is cyclical; Bitcoin dominance often sets the stage for future altcoin growth. Stay informed, strategic, and always conduct your own research.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. South Korea’s decision to shelve its central bank digital currency pilot in favor of private-sector stablecoins has sparked a wave of activities among fintechs and banks. As CoinDesk previously reported , KakaoBank is weighing both issuance and custody roles, while Upbit and Naver Pay are collaborating on a payments-focused token that could help close the “kimchi premium” gap between local and global crypto prices. The opportunity comes as Korea is moving to extend FX trading hours , allow more foreign participation in its onshore market, and position itself for inclusion in major global bond and equity indices. A regulated KRW stablecoin could fit into these modernization plans, offering faster settlement and tighter integration between banking and digital asset markets. But any Won stablecoin effort is going to run into a massive wall: Korea's currency is not fully internationalized. Since the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997, Korea has kept deliverable KRW trading entirely onshore . Foreign institutions cannot exchange won among themselves abroad, and every dollar–won transaction must be settled through domestic intermediaries under the Bank of Korea's supervision. Authorities in Seoul maintain this system to monitor speculative flows, contain volatility, and preserve monetary policy autonomy. So for a Won stablecoin to work, it would have to be only used with whitelisted, KYC-verified addresses that have some tie to Korea. If a privately issued stablecoin becomes too dominant, it can erode a country’s control over its currency, encourage “unintended dollarisation,” and weaken the central bank’s ability to manage employment and price stability, Vera Yuen, a professor at Hong Kong University's business school told CoinDesk in a note. The question is, just how useful would this on-shore only stablecoin then be? Domestic interbank transfers in Korea settle around the clock, 365 days a year. Sending money from one account to another is immediate, free, and widely used, leaving little payment friction for a KRW stablecoin to solve inside the country. Without a speed or cost advantage in domestic transfers, the token’s primary utility would lie in cross-border settlement — and that is precisely where the onshore-only rule becomes a brick wall. Taiwan faces a similar dilemma. The island's central bank does not impose capital controls on the economy—the Taiwan dollar (NTD) is freely convertible—but it also can't be used offshore, making it of questionable utility as a stablecoin . An NTD-pegged token would be bound by Taiwan’s stablecoin framework issued in June , which requires local bank issuance, 100% onshore reserves, and central bank oversight with foreign exchange reporting, which are designed to stop it from becoming an unregulated channel for moving NTD value abroad. One day, a Won, and NTD, stablecoin may emerge, but its utility will likely be confined largely to domestic use rather than the global crypto market, so it'll play a very niche role. It'd be a different story for a Hong Kong Dollar stablecoin as the currency, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, has no restrictions on being used abroad. Right now, it's wait a wait-and-see mode to determine how much demand there is for non-USD stablecoins and what role they will play in the broader crypto economy. Market Movers BTC: BTC is trading at 123,901.58, supported by broader market momentum as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hover near record highs on softer inflation signals and speculation of Fed easing. ETH: ETH is getting ready to challenge its all-time high, trading above $4700. Gold: Gold rose 0.3% to $3,356.98 as mild U.S. inflation data boosted expectations for a Fed rate cut next month and increased the odds of further easing this year. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets opened mixed Thursday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 0.31% after hitting a record high in the prior session . S&P 500: U.S. stocks climbed Wednesday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting new records as steady inflation data fueled expectations for two Fed rate cuts this year.

This bold move, involving the sale of 2,496 ETH for a staggering $11.83 million in DAI, has sent ripples through the DeFi landscape. It highlights ongoing challenges in blockchain security and raises urgent questions about safeguarding digital assets. This development follows the initial $53 million exploit of Radiant Capital (RDNT), a decentralized finance protocol. The incident underscores the critical need for robust security measures within the rapidly evolving crypto ecosystem. For many, it serves as a stark reminder of the risks inherent in decentralized finance. What Exactly Happened with the Stolen ETH ? About 30 minutes ago, the attacker behind the Radiant Capital breach executed a large transaction. They successfully converted 2,496 ETH into $11.83 million in DAI. This conversion occurred at an approximate rate of $4,741 per ETH. This crucial detail was quickly identified and reported by Onchain Lens on X, a platform known for its on-chain analytics. The swiftness of the sale suggests a calculated effort by the perpetrator to liquidate the assets and obscure their trail. Such actions are common tactics used by malicious actors in the crypto space. The original exploit targeted Radiant Capital, a cross-chain lending protocol. It involved a flash loan attack that manipulated the price oracle, allowing the hacker to drain funds. This type of sophisticated attack often exploits vulnerabilities in smart contract logic or external data feeds. Who is This Crypto Hacker and What’s the Impact on DeFi Security ? While the identity of the perpetrator remains unconfirmed, suspicions point towards a group with known ties to North Korea. These state-sponsored cybercriminal organizations are increasingly active in targeting cryptocurrency platforms, using the stolen funds to bypass international sanctions. The involvement of such sophisticated actors raises serious concerns for overall DeFi security . It indicates that protocols must contend not only with individual opportunistic hackers but also with highly organized and well-funded groups. This escalating threat landscape demands enhanced vigilance and advanced protective measures from all participants in the decentralized finance sector. The impact of such exploits extends beyond financial losses. They erode user trust, deter new investment, and can trigger significant market volatility. Protecting user funds and maintaining system integrity are paramount for the continued growth and adoption of DeFi. Strengthening Blockchain Security : Lessons from the Exploit The Radiant Capital incident provides invaluable lessons for enhancing blockchain security across the entire crypto industry. It highlights several key areas where protocols and users can improve their defenses against future attacks. Consider these vital steps for bolstering security: Rigorous Audits: Regular, independent security audits of smart contracts are non-negotiable. These audits should cover all potential vulnerabilities, including reentrancy attacks, flash loan exploits, and oracle manipulations. Decentralized Oracles: Relying on multiple, decentralized oracle networks can significantly reduce the risk of price manipulation. This approach diversifies data sources and makes it harder for a single point of failure to be exploited. Community Vigilance: An active and engaged community can act as an early warning system. Encouraging bug bounties and fostering a culture of responsible disclosure helps identify and address vulnerabilities before they are exploited. Multi-Signature Wallets: For treasury and large fund movements, implementing multi-signature wallets adds an extra layer of security. This requires multiple approvals for transactions, preventing a single compromised key from leading to catastrophic losses. This incident reminds everyone that the decentralized nature of blockchain does not inherently mean invulnerability. Continuous innovation in security protocols and a proactive approach to threat detection are essential. The Path Forward for Secure DeFi The sale of the stolen ETH from the Radiant Capital exploit is a stark reminder of the persistent threats facing the decentralized finance world. It underscores the sophistication of modern crypto hacker groups and the critical importance of robust blockchain security measures. As the DeFi ecosystem continues to expand, so too does the need for unwavering commitment to security, transparency, and user protection. Protocols, developers, and users must collaborate to build a more resilient and secure future for digital assets, ensuring that such exploits become increasingly difficult to execute. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What was the Radiant Capital exploit? A1: The Radiant Capital exploit was a significant security breach involving a flash loan attack that manipulated the protocol’s price oracle, allowing a hacker to drain approximately $53 million in various cryptocurrencies. Q2: How much ETH was sold by the hacker? A2: The hacker sold 2,496 ETH, converting it into $11.83 million in DAI at an approximate rate of $4,741 per ETH. Q3: Who is suspected to be behind the Radiant Capital exploit? A3: On-chain intelligence suggests a possible link to a North Korea-affiliated cybercrime group, known for targeting cryptocurrency platforms. Q4: What are the main takeaways for DeFi security from this incident? A4: The incident highlights the need for rigorous smart contract audits, decentralized oracle solutions, community vigilance, and the adoption of multi-signature wallets to enhance overall blockchain security.

A recent significant announcement from South Korea’s major trading platform, Bithumb, highlights this. Bithumb has officially declared a temporary Bithumb BERA suspension for both deposits and withdrawals of the BERA token . This crucial move, scheduled to begin at 09:00 UTC on August 27, is in direct support of an upcoming, vital Berachain upgrade . Users of the Bithumb crypto exchange should be aware of this temporary halt to their crypto deposits withdrawals activity concerning BERA, ensuring a smooth transition during this period. What’s Behind the Bithumb BERA Suspension? Bithumb, a leading Bithumb crypto exchange in South Korea, consistently prioritizes the security and stability of its platform. The decision to implement a Bithumb BERA suspension stems directly from the need to facilitate a significant network enhancement.

Meanwhile, market watchers are naming MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the best cryptos to watch ahead of the next bull cycle alongside XRP. XRP ETF Approval Momentum Builds The conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC has opened the door for an inevitable XRP ETF launch. Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg, whose firm is among the ETF applicants, believes approval could come this year. He mentioned newly published listing standards by NASDAQ, NYSE, and CBOE, which would make XRP eligible once its regulated U.S. futures market surpasses six months of activity McClurg argues XRP could outperform Ethereum ETFs for three reasons: no staking opportunity cost, unmatched dominance in cross-border payments, and an exceptionally loyal community base. He said $5 billion in inflows can enter XRP market within the first month of ETF trading, beating Ethereum ETF debut figures. Polymarket odds now place ETF approval likelihood at over 88% in 2025. Price Impact Scenarios for XRP If XRP ETFs indeed attract $5 billion in inflows, the price implications could be surprising. Using market analyst Dom’s 272x market cap multiplier, the capital could push XRP’s valuation to roughly $1.546 trillion, translating to around $26 per token, far beyond the current $3.15. Even under more conservative estimates from Google’s Gemini AI, which applied 10x and 15x multipliers, XRP could still see its market cap rise to between $236.5 billion and $261.5 billion, pricing the token between $3.99 and $4.41. In both cases, these projections are a clear path to breaking the $5.50 barrier in a strong bullish environment. The real question now is whether institutional inflows will match McClurg’s projections and whether retail demand will amplify the momentum in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Best Crypto to Buy Ahead of the Bull Run Analysts are also spotlighting MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch for the next bull run. The token operates on a tax free model with transparent ERC-20 tokenomics. It is also backed by completed audits and an expanding market presence. Its initial sale phase has already outperformed many early-stage projects, which is now boosting predictions of substantial upside in the coming months. Major exchange listings are expected soon, and MAGACOIN FINANCE seeks to be a high-potential coin for those seeking strategic exposure before the next blow off top in crypto. Bottom Line XRP’s potential ETF approval could be a game-changer as forecasts range from modest gains to a multi-trillion-dollar valuation boost.

(ABTC) , a prominent digital asset player, recently made a significant disclosure. This major move involves a substantial increase in their Bitcoin holdings , signaling a bold and strategic approach in the evolving crypto landscape. Investors and enthusiasts are closely watching this development, highlighting growing institutional confidence in digital assets. What’s Behind American Bitcoin Corp’s Massive BTC Acquisition? American Bitcoin Corp. (ABTC) , a well-known cryptocurrency miner majority-owned by Hut 8, has made headlines. The company announced a remarkable BTC acquisition of 1,726 BTC, valued at an impressive $205.6 million, as reported by TheMinerMag. This substantial investment demonstrates a clear commitment to the future of digital assets. Hut 8, in its recent quarterly filing, clarified these strategic purchases. Transactions occurred between July 1 and August 6, at an average price of approximately $119,120 per Bitcoin. This methodical accumulation strategy propelled ABTC’s total Bitcoin holdings to approximately 2,130 BTC as of August 6. Such a move showcases a clear long-term vision for this leading cryptocurrency miner . Why Are Institutional Bitcoin Investments Surging? ABTC’s significant accumulation is part of a broader trend: increasing institutional Bitcoin investment . Corporations and investment firms increasingly recognize Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and a strategic portfolio component. This growing confidence helps legitimize the digital asset space, potentially leading to greater market stability and broader adoption. The decision by American Bitcoin Corp. to expand its Bitcoin holdings underscores a profound belief in the asset’s future appreciation.

This calculated approach reflects a maturing market where sophisticated investors make informed decisions. How Does This Impact the Crypto Mining Company Landscape? For the broader crypto mining company sector, ABTC’s disclosure sets an interesting precedent. By actively increasing their Bitcoin holdings rather than immediately selling mined coins, companies like ABTC are demonstrating a robust “HODL” strategy. This approach can significantly influence market dynamics by reducing immediate selling pressure from miners, traditionally large suppliers of new Bitcoin. This strategy suggests a shift towards greater balance sheet strength and a stronger commitment to accumulating digital assets as core holdings. It highlights evolving business models within the cryptocurrency mining industry, where strategic asset management is becoming as crucial as operational efficiency. Companies able to hold mined BTC may gain a significant competitive advantage. Summary: A Bold Move by American Bitcoin Corp. American Bitcoin Corp.’s disclosure of its substantial Bitcoin holdings marks a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency market. This significant BTC acquisition , totaling 2,130 BTC, not only strengthens ABTC’s financial position but also signals a broader trend of increasing institutional Bitcoin investment and confidence in digital assets.

An anonymous yet powerful investor, previously observed offloading a substantial amount of Ethereum, has now made an even larger re-entry into the market. This bold move raises questions about market sentiment and the potential future direction of the Ethereum price . What Triggered This Astounding ETH Whale Repurchase? Just a week ago, a significant wallet holder sold 10,256 ETH, valued at approximately $39.336 million, at an average price of $3,835. This action caught the attention of many, as large sales can sometimes signal a bearish outlook. However, the narrative took a dramatic turn. Approximately eight hours ago, the same whale astonishingly repurchased 10,730 ETH. This latest acquisition cost a hefty $50.596 million, with an average price of $4,715 per ETH. This data comes directly from on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X, highlighting the transparency of blockchain transactions. Such a swift and substantial reversal in position is uncommon. It suggests a strong conviction about Ethereum’s immediate future or perhaps a strategic play to capitalize on perceived dips and rallies. Understanding these large ETH transactions is key to deciphering market dynamics. Deciphering Large ETH Transactions Through On-Chain Analysis The ability to track such movements comes from on-chain analysis , a powerful tool in the crypto space. This involves examining publicly available data on blockchain ledgers to gain insights into market behavior. For instance, we can see the exact amounts, addresses, and timestamps of these massive transfers. Why do these whale movements matter? Large transactions can influence the overall Ethereum price . When a whale sells, it can create selling pressure. Conversely, a major repurchase like this can signal strong demand, potentially boosting investor confidence and price momentum. It’s like watching a giant ship turn in the ocean; its movement creates ripples. This particular ETH whale repurchase serves as a prime example of how individual, large-scale actions can reflect or even drive market sentiment. It prompts observers to consider the whale’s motivation: Was it profit-taking followed by re-accumulation, or a belief that Ethereum was undervalued at its current level despite a recent rally? Lessons from a Whale’s Crypto Trading Strategy Observing such a sophisticated crypto trading strategy from a whale offers valuable insights, but also critical lessons for the average investor. Whales often have access to significant capital and potentially more advanced market insights or information. However, even their moves are not without risk. Key takeaways from this whale’s actions: Market Volatility: The rapid shift from selling to buying highlights the inherent volatility of the crypto market. Prices can change dramatically in short periods. Conviction: The whale’s decision to repurchase at a significantly higher price ($4,715 vs. $3,835) suggests strong conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value or an expectation of further short-term gains. Risk Management: While we see the successful outcome of this particular trade (so far), it’s crucial to remember that not all large trades are profitable. Every strategy carries inherent risks. For individual investors, it’s important not to blindly follow whale movements. Instead, use on-chain analysis as one piece of a larger research puzzle. Always conduct your own due diligence, understand your risk tolerance, and consider diversifying your portfolio rather than putting all your eggs in one crypto basket. This remarkable ETH whale repurchase underscores the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the crypto markets. It serves as a vivid reminder that significant capital is actively moving, constantly shaping the landscape. Whether this whale’s bold move signals a new bullish trend for the Ethereum price or is simply a speculative play, it certainly adds another fascinating chapter to the ongoing crypto narrative. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an “ETH whale repurchase”? A1: An “ETH whale repurchase” refers to a large-scale acquisition of Ethereum (ETH) by an individual or entity holding a significant amount of cryptocurrency, often enough to influence market prices. In this case, it means a whale bought back a large quantity of ETH after previously selling it. Q2: How was this whale’s activity tracked? A2: This whale’s activity was tracked using “on-chain analysis.” This involves monitoring publicly available transaction data on the Ethereum blockchain. Analysts like @EmberCN use specialized tools to identify large transactions and link them to specific wallet addresses. Q3: Does a whale’s large ETH transaction guarantee future price movement? A3: No, a whale’s large ETH transaction does not guarantee future price movement. While significant buys or sells can influence market sentiment and create short-term volatility, many factors affect the Ethereum price, including broader market trends, technological developments, and macroeconomic conditions. It’s one data point among many. Q4: What can individual investors learn from this whale’s crypto trading strategy? A4: Individual investors can learn about market volatility and the importance of conviction. However, it’s crucial to remember that whales operate with different capital levels and risk tolerances. Retail investors should focus on thorough research, understanding their own financial goals, diversifying portfolios, and avoiding impulsive decisions based solely on whale movements. Q5: What is the significance of the price difference in the whale’s buy and sell? A5: The whale sold ETH at an average of $3,835 and repurchased it at $4,715. This significant price difference ($880 higher per ETH on the buy) indicates that the whale either believes Ethereum’s value will continue to rise significantly from the repurchase price, or they were executing a complex strategy that factored in other market conditions or financial instruments.

50055505,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78317,1755135943,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Updated Timeline for XRP and Cardano ETF Approvals,https://timestabloid.com/updated-timeline-for-xrp-and-cardano-etf-approvals/,"Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, has outlined a revised outlook for when exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on XRP and Cardano could receive regulatory approval in the United States. His comments arrive as the year draws to a close and interest in the launch of additional cryptocurrency ETFs continues to grow. Regulatory Progress Sets the Stage for Approvals According to Geraci, the approval process for new altcoin ETFs could soon accelerate due to recent developments involving the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) , Nasdaq , and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). These major exchanges have submitted applications to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for standardised rules covering cryptocurrency ETF listings. The implementation of these rules would create a consistent framework for approving such products, reducing procedural delays. In addition to these regulatory filings, the exchanges have also lodged 19b-4 applications with the SEC on behalf of various asset managers, targeting ETFs for several cryptocurrencies, including XRP, Solana, and Cardano. Geraci noted that more than 75 cryptocurrency ETF applications are currently under review by the SEC. He believes that once the standardized listing rules are adopted, approval for multiple altcoin ETFs, including those for XRP and Cardano, could follow quickly. Geraci’s assessment suggests that the SEC could finalize the new ETF listing framework within the next two months. If that occurs, he expects a substantial number of new cryptocurrency ETFs to enter the market in a short period. This would mark the beginning of broader institutional access to a wider range of crypto assets. Increasing Demand for Crypto ETFs Market demand for cryptocurrency ETFs remains strong, which could benefit any new XRP and Cardano products. Geraci pointed to 2024 inflows as evidence of investor interest, with over $26 billion moving into crypto ETFs this year. Bitcoin spot ETFs accounted for $19 billion of that figure, while Ethereum spot ETFs attracted $7 billion. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Most of the recent surge in interest has come in the past several months. In July alone, Bitcoin ETFs attracted $6 billion, and Ethereum ETFs collected $5.5 billion. Ethereum products also experienced five of their most active trading days during this period, reflecting growing investor engagement. Geraci attributes this momentum to a favourable regulatory environment, citing measures such as the GENIUS Act , progress on the CLARITY Act, and recent SEC approval for in-kind creation and redemption processes for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The SEC has also launched “Project Crypto,” with Chair Paul Atkins signaling an intention to expand blockchain integration into the broader financial system. Market Expectations for XRP and Cardano ETFs Predictions from decentralized betting platform Polymarket indicate a high probability of approval for both products in 2025. The likelihood of a Cardano spot ETF being approved next year is estimated at 85%, up from 63% the previous week. For XRP, the projected approval probability before the end of 2025 stands at 79%, an increase from 66% as of August 7. Financial analysts, including those at JPMorgan , have suggested that XRP and Solana ETFs could draw between $3 billion and $8 billion in investment once approved, underscoring the significant market potential for these products. With the SEC advancing toward standardized listing requirements and demand for crypto ETFs at record levels, conditions appear promising for the launch of XRP and Cardano ETFs in the near term. If Geraci’s projected timeline holds, approvals within the next two months could position these products to capture substantial investor interest, further expanding institutional participation in the cryptocurrency market.

They confirmed a temporary Bithumb NEAR suspension for both deposits and withdrawals, a measure taken to facilitate an essential network update. This development is crucial for anyone holding or planning to transact with NEAR on the platform. Understanding the Bithumb NEAR Suspension Bithumb, a prominent player in the South Korean crypto market, officially communicated this temporary halt via its website. The suspension for NEAR token services is set to begin promptly at 03:00 UTC on August 18. This action is not uncommon in the fast-evolving world of cryptocurrency, where network upgrades are regular occurrences. Users often wonder why such suspensions happen. Exchanges like Bithumb implement these measures to ensure the safety and integrity of assets during significant network changes. A network update for a token like NEAR Protocol often involves technical improvements, security enhancements, or protocol upgrades that could affect transaction processing. Why is a NEAR Protocol Network Update Necessary? The NEAR Protocol network update is the primary reason behind Bithumb’s decision. Blockchain networks, much like traditional software, require periodic maintenance and upgrades to function optimally. These updates are vital for several reasons: Enhanced Security: Updates often patch vulnerabilities, making the network more resilient against potential attacks. Improved Performance: New features or optimizations can increase transaction speed and network capacity. New Features: Developers might introduce new functionalities that improve the user experience or expand the network’s capabilities. Stability: Regular maintenance helps prevent unforeseen issues and ensures the network runs smoothly. By temporarily pausing services, Bithumb ensures that all user funds are secure and that the transition to the updated NEAR Protocol network occurs without complications. Navigating Crypto Deposit Suspension: Your Action Plan When facing a crypto deposit suspension or withdrawal halt, it is important for users to understand their options and take appropriate steps. For Bithumb users holding NEAR, here is what you should consider: Plan Ahead: If you need to deposit or withdraw NEAR tokens from Bithumb, complete these transactions before the August 18, 03:00 UTC deadline. Monitor Official Announcements: Always rely on Bithumb’s official website or communication channels for updates regarding the resumption of services. Avoid unofficial sources. Consider Alternatives (Temporarily): If urgent transactions are required, explore other reputable exchanges that support NEAR, keeping in mind potential transfer fees and verification processes. However, be cautious and only use trusted platforms. Remember, this is a temporary measure. Once the NEAR Protocol network update is successfully completed and thoroughly tested, Bithumb will resume normal services. Impact on the Bithumb Exchange Community While a temporary suspension might seem inconvenient, it reflects the Bithumb exchange ‘s commitment to maintaining a robust and secure trading environment. Such actions are standard practice across major cryptocurrency exchanges globally when significant network events occur. This proactive approach helps prevent potential losses or technical glitches that could arise from an unmanaged network transition. The community on the Bithumb exchange should view this as a necessary step for the long-term health and stability of the NEAR token on the platform. Transparency in these announcements helps users prepare and manage their assets effectively, fostering trust between the exchange and its users. Preparing for NEAR Token Withdrawals After the Update Users are naturally curious about when NEAR token withdrawals and deposits will resume. While Bithumb’s initial announcement specifies the start of the suspension, it typically follows up with another notice once the network update is complete and services are restored. It is advisable to: Regularly check Bithumb’s official announcements page. Follow their official social media channels for real-time updates. Set up notifications if the exchange offers such a feature for specific token statuses. Patience is key during these periods. The exchange will likely conduct thorough testing post-update to ensure everything is functioning correctly before reopening services to the public. Conclusion: Navigating Temporary Halts with Confidence The temporary Bithumb NEAR suspension for deposits and withdrawals is a standard operational procedure aimed at ensuring a smooth and secure transition during a vital NEAR Protocol network update. While it requires users to be mindful of the August 18 deadline, it ultimately contributes to a safer and more reliable trading experience on the Bithumb exchange . By staying informed through official channels and planning ahead, users can navigate these temporary halts with confidence and continue their engagement with the NEAR token once services resume. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why is Bithumb suspending NEAR deposits and withdrawals? A1: Bithumb is temporarily suspending these services to facilitate a necessary network update for the NEAR Protocol, ensuring security and stability. Q2: When will the Bithumb NEAR suspension begin? A2: The suspension will begin at 03:00 UTC on August 18. Q3: How long will the NEAR services be suspended on Bithumb? A3: The announcement specifies the start time but not the end time. Users should monitor Bithumb’s official channels for updates on service resumption. Q4: What should I do if I need to deposit or withdraw NEAR before the suspension? A4: You should complete any necessary NEAR deposits or withdrawals before the August 18, 03:00 UTC deadline. Q5: Is this suspension common for cryptocurrency exchanges? A5: Yes, temporary suspensions for deposits and withdrawals are common practice for exchanges during significant blockchain network updates, upgrades, or maintenance to protect user assets and ensure smooth transitions.

In a recent development, the perpetrator behind the massive Radiant Capital exploit has made a substantial move, converting a large sum of stolen Ethereum into stablecoin. This action, tracked meticulously through on-chain analysis , highlights the ongoing challenges in maintaining robust digital asset security within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. What Did the Crypto Hacker Do? Just recently, the individual responsible for the $53 million Radiant Capital (RDNT) breach executed a major transaction. This crypto hacker swapped 4,326 ETH for a staggering $20.48 million in DAI. This move was quickly identified by prominent on-chain analysts, including @EmberCN on X, who provided real-time updates to the community. Such conversions are common tactics for attackers. They aim to obscure the trail and convert volatile cryptocurrencies into stable assets like DAI, making it harder for funds to be frozen or recovered. The hacker’s remaining holdings are still substantial, indicating a prolonged effort to manage the illicit gains. The Scale of the Digital Asset Security Breach The scale of the Radiant Capital exploit is truly concerning. Following this recent conversion, the attacker reportedly still holds a considerable sum: 12,326 ETH and $43.93 million in DAI. This brings their combined illicit fortune to approximately $102 million. This immense sum underscores the critical need for enhanced digital asset security measures across all DeFi platforms. The ability of a single entity to control such a vast amount of stolen funds poses a significant threat to market stability and investor confidence. Furthermore, suspicions linking this crypto hacker to a North Korea-affiliated group add another layer of complexity, raising geopolitical concerns about state-sponsored cybercrime in the crypto space. How Does On-Chain Analysis Track Exploits? Understanding how these illicit transactions are tracked is vital. On-chain analysis plays a crucial role in monitoring the flow of funds post-exploit. Blockchain explorers and specialized analytical tools allow experts to follow every movement of stolen assets, from initial theft to subsequent swaps and transfers. This transparency, inherent to public blockchains, provides a powerful tool for investigators. While it doesn’t prevent attacks, it offers valuable insights into hacker methodologies and helps in tracing funds, which can sometimes lead to recovery efforts or at least prevent further laundering. It is a constant cat-and-mouse game between attackers and security experts. What Are the Implications for DeFi Security? The repeated occurrence of incidents like the Radiant Capital exploit raises serious questions about the overall robustness of DeFi security . Each successful hack erodes trust in the decentralized ecosystem, making potential users and institutional investors hesitant to participate. Platforms must prioritize rigorous auditing, bug bounty programs, and continuous vulnerability assessments.

Ethena Climbs 260% & Dogecoin Targets 50% Gain",https://thecoinrise.com/cold-wallet-prepares-for-a-3424-leap-ethena-climbs-260-dogecoin-targets-50-gain/,"Market moves in crypto can shift rapidly, rewarding only those ready to act. Ethena’s recent 260% rise and Dogecoin’s bullish setup show how momentum can build quickly, leading to sharp gains for those entering early. While such trends spark short-term interest, the Cold Wallet presale offers a clearer and measurable advantage. Now in Stage 17 at $0.00998 per CWT and set for a confirmed listing price of $0.3517, it has a built-in 3,424% ROI before it reaches exchanges. This distinct and quantifiable gap places it ahead of most market plays. For those looking for defined entry points with significant growth potential, Cold Wallet stands out as a leading crypto choice in 2025. Last Chance at Low Pricing Before the 3,424% ROI Window Narrows Cold Wallet’s presale sits at a crucial point, giving one of the most clearly defined early-access chances available. At Stage 17, each CWT is priced at $0.00998, while the confirmed launch price is locked at $0.3517. This secures a 3,424% ROI before its exchange debut, not including the potential rise from post-listing demand. The presale has already surpassed $5.95 million in funding, showing strong interest. As more buyers join in, each stage is closing faster, pushing prices up at every step. At the current pace, entry costs could rise soon, reducing this exceptional profit window. Acting before the next price adjustment could be key to securing the highest potential gain. Cold Wallet isn’t only a profit opportunity; it’s built for real-world use. It functions as a self-custody wallet rewarding users for everyday crypto transactions, offering CWT cashback on gas fees, swaps, and fiat transfers. A tiered rewards system encourages holding, sustaining demand beyond the launch. This mix of locked-in ROI potential and ongoing utility makes a strong case for early entry. With the current stage pricing, it presents a rare mix of low cost and high potential return that won’t last long. Right now, the figures are clear: a purchase at $0.00998 could multiply significantly by launch, but waiting risks losing the advantage. Ethena ENA Price Action Hints at Strong Breakout Ethena ENA’s upward trend continues, with a sharp climb of around 260% from $0.25 to $0.81 recently. Analysts now point toward a possible run to $1.18, showing a near-term upside if the rally keeps momentum. Breaking above $0.80 signals firm buying pressure, driven by sustained bullish interest. Traders are watching closely as technical indicators align with further gains. With the target now within reach, entering at current prices could secure notable returns before the next move higher. As momentum builds, each session may push prices closer to that projection. Acting during the climb could make the difference between capturing peak gains and chasing the market later. Dogecoin DOGE Structure Points to a 50% Surge Dogecoin DOGE is forming a bullish ascending triangle pattern, suggesting a possible 50% rally. Price movements show steadily higher lows, while resistance holds near $0.25. This tightening range often precedes a sharp upward break, and a strong move past $0.25 could send it toward $0.28 and $0.36. Technical signals, including a positive MACD crossover and rising trading volume, add weight to the bullish case. With the breakout point approaching, time is limited. Entering early could mean securing a better position, while hesitation risks buying higher after momentum accelerates. The Dogecoin setup is flashing urgency for those ready to act. Final Words While Ethena and Dogecoin present short-term market-driven setups, they require precise timing. Cold Wallet’s presale, by contrast, offers a fixed advantage. With Stage 17 at $0.00998 and launch at $0.3517, the 3,424% ROI is already secured before listing. This measurable edge gives a rare chance to secure value without relying on unpredictable momentum. As stages sell out quickly, delaying could mean paying more. For those seeking high potential returns with a fixed entry price, Cold Wallet remains a top contender for 2025.

50056042,555789,1755136839,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50056042.jpeg,"‘Crypto Mom’ Tells Industry: SEC Acting Now, Not Waiting On Congress",https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-mom-tells-industry-sec-acting-now-not-waiting-on-congress/,"Crypto firms may get fresh guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission even if Congress takes its time, Republican Commissioner Hester Peirce told Bloomberg. Peirce, also known as “Crypto Mom”, said agency staff have been working on guidance since January and that the SEC plans to use its existing authority to clarify how securities laws apply to tokens and on-chain trading. That means rules could shift from internal memos or staff letters rather than new federal statutes alone. Project Crypto Moves Forward According to comments from the SEC, Chair Paul Atkins launched a program called Project Crypto to bring securities rules into line with modern markets. Peirce said the project “is going very well” and that teams across the agency are meeting with industry leaders. Based on reports, those meetings are meant to narrow down how current law should be interpreted for token issuers, trading platforms, and custody services. Draft Bill Faces Industry Pushback Last month the US Senate Banking Committee released a draft market-structure bill meant to address crypto jurisdiction and oversight. Reports have disclosed that companies like Ripple raised concerns that the bill could broaden the SEC’s reach. Peirce described the draft as “a very sophisticated piece of legislation to work out,” and she said the agency is ready to work with members of both the House and the Senate to help shape the final text. Coordination With CFTC Is Ongoing The draft bill aims to draw lines between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Peirce noted that she has worked with the CFTC for many years and that staff from both agencies are coordinating on recommendations. That coordination is focused on preventing conflicting rules and on determining which agency should handle different types of crypto products. Companies operating in token markets should assume guidance and enforcement could come from the SEC even before Congress acts. That means compliance teams should document how their products fit under current securities tests and be prepared for staff inquiries. Peirce’s remarks suggest the agency will try to provide practical guidance, but she also reminded audiences that enforcement powers remain available while guidance is being developed. On Clarity & Uncertainty Investors may see market reactions when the SEC releases guidance or when Congress updates the draft bill. Two separate tracks — administrative guidance from the SEC and possible legislation from Congress — could produce quicker clarity on some issues, while creating uncertainty on others. Based on recent statements, the SEC intends to act within its current authority while the legislative process continues. That approach could speed some answers for the industry, but it also keeps enforcement risk alive and leaves open questions about the final division of power between the SEC and the CFTC.

At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $120,499, maintaining its position near a key resistance zone between $119,000 and $120,000. Market data indicates that traders are watching this price area closely, given its significance in previous price action during July. Recent analysis from CryptoQuant contributor Arab Chain shows that Bitcoin’s open interest (OI) on Binance has climbed to around $13.7 billion, approaching its mid-to-late July highs. This metric, which tracks the total value of outstanding futures contracts, is often used to gauge market participation and potential volatility. The current levels suggest a notable build-up of speculative positions as the price approaches critical resistance. Related Reading: Bitcoin At Risk Of Pullback As Binance Miner Distributions Spike, Analyst Says Bitcoin Leveraged Positions and Potential Market Outcomes According to Arab Chain, a simultaneous rise in both price and open interest typically signals the entry of new speculative liquidity, most likely from traders taking long positions. While this can support short-term price increases, it also raises the market’s sensitivity to corrections. If open interest grows faster than price, the rally can become overleveraged, leaving the market vulnerable to a long squeeze in the event of a sharp pullback. The $119,000–$120,000 range has acted as a decision point in recent months. A breakout above this level with stable or slightly declining open interest could indicate the move is driven by spot buying or short covering, which generally carries less liquidation risk. In this scenario, Arab Chain sees potential for BTC to target the $122,000–$124,000 range. However, a sharp rejection at these levels with elevated open interest could trigger liquidation-driven declines toward nearby support. Monitoring Open Interest Trends for Confirmation Open interest is currently just below the all-time high of approximately $14 billion, leaving limited room for further leveraged build-up before reaching historic extremes. Arab Chain notes that after a decline in both price and OI from late July to early August, indicating capital exiting the market, both have since rebounded together, suggesting renewed confidence among derivatives traders. The analyst cautions that a significant jump in open interest without a corresponding price advance, or worse, with a price decline, would point to an overleveraged environment. Related Reading: Two Forces Can Launch Bitcoin To $1 Million, Says Mike Novogratz Conversely, price stability or gains above $120,000 while open interest holds steady or declines slightly would be a healthier sign, indicating the move is supported by actual buying rather than excessive leverage. At present, the intraday trend remains bullish, but the sustainability of this move depends on whether leverage levels stabilize as Bitcoin tests resistance. Traders are likely to focus on how BTC behaves around the $120,000 mark in the coming days, with open interest dynamics serving as a key signal for the next directional move.

Investors are rapidly entering into Solana, Ethereum and Chainlink with renewed energy as price targets turn bullish for all three assets. Among this run we are seeing some new names emerge and gaining traction quickly. One such name, gaining serious attention, is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana Pushes Toward $250 as Treasury Demand Soars Solana continues to rise, currently trading at nearly $215 after breaking resistance at $200 for the first time this month. Analysts are looking towards the $220-$230 area as the next short-term hurdle, while the breakout target is now $250. Whale accumulation, high on-chain activity, and continuous institutional adoption are driving the surge. The DeFi Development Corporation recently disclosed treasury holdings of over $250 million in SOL, which is a major vote of confidence from long-term players. Besides, Solana has recorded over 21.9 billion total transactions—showing the strength and scalability of its ecosystem. Ethereum Holds Strong at $4,600 Amid ETF Boom After breaking out earlier this week on the back of historic ETF inflows, Ethereum climbed to and held above $4,600. Call option traders have paid over $5 million betting to break $5,000 price level, widely considered the next psychological hurdle. ETFs bought by BlackRock and Fidelity have attracted more than $1.01 billion in inflows in a single day, setting a record for Ethereum and surpassing Bitcoin ETFs in net flows. Firms like BitMine and SharpLink have stepped up ETH accumulation. BitMine now holds over 1.2 million ETH, currently worth nearly $5 billion. Chainlink Surges 15% as Institutions Accumulate In the last week, Chainlink has experienced a 15% increase in price, surpassing $24 as a result of significant whale activity and high-profile integrations. The token reached a seven-month peak after news broke of Chainlink’s partnership with Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) to bring on-chain real-time FX and commodity pricing. In the last two months, LINK exchange balances are down nearly 10%, which is a sign of less selling pressure. Expect the price to be $29 and even $35 in short time, with momentum building. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Momentum Before Listing Events Featured on 2025’s best Altcoins to buy now watchlist by top researchers , MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction among analysts who cite its scarcity-driven tokenomics, strong community growth, and strategic market positioning. Backed by increasing whale accumulation and institutional interest, the project’s momentum is building ahead of anticipated exchange listings and utility rollouts. With both retail and smart money closely monitoring its trajectory, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a standout contender for significant gains in the upcoming market cycle. Final Thoughts With Solana nearing a major breakout, Ethereum showing stability above $4,600, and Chainlink seeing rising demand from institutions, the outlook for the altcoins remains bullish for the end of August. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the most awaited projects, thanks in part to the recognition it has received through research and the community backing, which points to significant upside.

BlockchainFX (BFX) is closing in on its $5.5M softcap, pulling $5.08M from 4,323 participants for its multi-asset trading platform spanning crypto, stocks, and commodities. Ozak AI, now in Stage 4 at $0.005, has passed $1.7M with a pitch that fuses blockchain with AI-driven predictive analytics. Strong figures, but BlockDAG’s (BDAG) scale is in a league of its own: $373M raised, 25.1 billion coins sold, and early buyers already securing ROIs of over 2,660%. With today’s $0.0276 price and a $1 near-term projection, new entries eye 3,522% potential ROI. Behind the numbers are 200,000 holders and millions mining before launch. Each batch sold pulls BlockDAG closer to its $600M target and pushes early pricing further out of reach. BlockchainFX (BFX) Presale Nears Softcap Milestone The BlockchainFX (BFX) presale has raised over $5.08 million, reaching 92.45% of its $5.5 million softcap. According to project details, the platform plans to integrate over 500 assets, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, ETFs, and commodities, into a single trading environment. Features listed include daily staking rewards in BFX and USDT, instant asset swaps, and up to 70% of trading fees returned to users. The BlockchainFX presale reports 4,323 participants, with payment options spanning multiple major cryptocurrencies. The platform positions itself as bridging traditional finance and blockchain, though market adoption will ultimately determine its impact. Ozak AI Presale Approaches $2 Million Milestone The Ozak AI presale, now in Stage 4, has raised over $1.7 million with tokens priced at $0.005. According to project materials, the next phase will raise the price to $0.01. The platform aims to combine blockchain infrastructure with AI-driven predictive analytics, incorporating components such as the Ozak Stream Network for real-time data streaming, customizable Prediction Agents, and DePIN-based decentralized infrastructure. With its mix of blockchain infrastructure and AI-powered predictive tools, the platform has a defined niche; whether it secures long-term traction will depend on adoption rates, competitive positioning, and the execution of its roadmap beyond the initial fundraising phase. Closing in on $600M: Is BlockDAG’s Presale Ending Soon? BlockDAG set out to raise $600M across 45 presale batches. That target is now coming into sharper focus, with more than $373M already secured and 25.1+ billion BDAG sold. The pace has been fast, helped along by large buyers locking in significant allocations early and a growing community eager to secure their share before the final batches disappear. Batch 29 is active at $0.0276. For context, those who joined in Batch 1 have already seen a 2,660% rise. With a near-term projection of $1, the potential ROI for current entries stands at 3,522% shortly after launch. That’s without even factoring in long-term forecasts of $5, $10, or even $20, which paint an even more compelling profit picture. Behind these numbers is a network that is already taking shape. More than 200,000 holders are on board, alongside 4,500 builders preparing 300+ web3 projects to go live on BlockDAG’s infrastructure. Over 2.5M people are using the X1 Miner app, while nearly 19,300 miners have been sold, adding almost $7.8M to the presale total. Each batch sold moves the project closer to its $600M goal and further away from the entry prices available today. As the total climbs, the remaining supply at current pricing shrinks. The end of the presale will also mark the end of these early-stage opportunities, shifting BDAG into open market trading where supply and demand will set the pace. Which Is the Top Crypto Presale Right Now? Presales can be exciting, but the smartest money looks beyond early promises to see what’s already in motion. BlockchainFX (BFX) has raised over $5.08M, 92.45% of its softcap, offering daily staking rewards, instant swaps, and a 500+ asset trading environment, but adoption will ultimately test its model. Ozak AI is closing in on $2M in Stage 4, with AI-powered predictive analytics and blockchain infrastructure on the roadmap, though its success depends on execution after fundraising. BlockDAG pairs presale momentum with a visible buildout. At $0.0276 in Batch 29, early buyers from Batch 1 are up 2,660%, and current entries project 3,522% ROI toward a $1 post-launch target. With 200,000 holders and 4,500 builders already engaged, its track record makes it the top crypto presale right now.

Reports indicate that Bain Capital Ventures, a major early investor in Compound, might be preparing for a substantial Bain Capital Ventures COMP sale . This move involves a considerable amount of COMP tokens, valued at millions of dollars, and it has naturally captured the attention of investors and the wider crypto community. What Does This COMP Token Sale Involve? The core of this news revolves around 349,000 COMP token s, valued at approximately $18.85 million. Bain Capital Ventures originally received these tokens five years ago as part of their early investment in Compound. The recent activity, as reported by @EmberCN on X, shows a wallet linked to Bain Capital Ventures moving this entire stash. Specifically: About nine hours ago, the full 349,000 COMP was transferred to an institutional trading platform. From this initial transfer, 87,250 COMP, worth about $4.73 million, has already been sent to major cryptocurrency exchanges. These exchanges include prominent names like Binance, OKX, Bybit, and Gate.io, indicating a clear intention to sell. This large-scale movement of COMP token s by a foundational investor is a notable event, raising questions about its implications. Understanding the Institutional Crypto Sales Landscape When an entity like Bain Capital Ventures, a well-known venture capital firm, undertakes such a significant transaction, it falls under the category of institutional crypto sales . These sales often carry more weight than individual retail transactions due to their sheer volume and the perception of informed decision-making by large investors. Such actions can sometimes signal broader trends or shifts in investor sentiment. For the broader crypto market impact , large sales can: Increase supply on exchanges, potentially leading to price pressure. Influence market sentiment, as other investors might interpret the sale as a bearish signal. Test the liquidity and resilience of the underlying asset’s market. Therefore, tracking these movements provides valuable insight into the market’s dynamics. The decision by Bain Capital Ventures to potentially offload a substantial portion of its Compound token holdings is certainly a development worth monitoring closely. What’s Next for the Compound Token and Its Community? The potential Bain Capital Ventures COMP sale naturally brings the Compound token and its decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol into sharp focus. Compound is a leading DeFi lending protocol, and COMP is its governance token. Holders of COMP can vote on proposals that shape the future of the protocol. The community will likely be watching closely to see how this significant supply influx affects the token’s price and market stability. While large sales can create short-term volatility, the long-term resilience of a project like Compound depends on its fundamental utility, ongoing development, and active community engagement. It’s important to remember that investors often take profits, and such sales are a part of the natural investment cycle. Ultimately, the true impact of this move will unfold over the coming days and weeks. The crypto market is dynamic, and various factors influence asset prices. Keeping an eye on the trading volumes and price action of COMP on the mentioned exchanges will provide clearer indications. Summary: A Watchful Eye on COMP The potential Bain Capital Ventures COMP sale represents a significant event for the Compound ecosystem and the broader crypto market. With $18.85 million worth of COMP token s on the move, including millions already hitting exchanges, the market is bracing for potential shifts. While institutional crypto sales can introduce volatility, the long-term outlook for the Compound token will depend on the project’s continued strength and community support. Investors and enthusiasts alike should remain vigilant and informed as this situation develops. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the main news about Bain Capital Ventures and Compound?

Greenidge Generation Holdings, a prominent Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency miner , recently made headlines with its impressive Q2 performance. The company officially announced via a Business Wire press release that it successfully produced 110 BTC during the second quarter, marking a significant milestone in its Greenidge Bitcoin mining operations. Unpacking Greenidge’s Impressive BTC Production Greenidge Generation Holdings is not just any mining company; its listing on Nasdaq signifies a level of corporate governance and public scrutiny often absent in the broader crypto space. This public announcement provides valuable insight into their operational efficiency and commitment to the digital asset sector. The reported BTC production of 110 Bitcoins in Q2 highlights the company’s active role in securing the Bitcoin network while generating revenue. For a publicly traded entity, such consistent reporting of mining output is crucial for stakeholder confidence. However, it is worth noting that the company’s press release focused solely on production figures. Details regarding Bitcoin sales or current holdings were not disclosed. This is a common practice for some miners, yet it leaves room for speculation regarding their treasury management strategy. What Do These Q2 Results Mean for the Cryptocurrency Miner? Understanding the context of these Q2 results requires a brief look at the Bitcoin mining landscape. Mining Bitcoin involves solving complex computational puzzles to verify transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. This process requires substantial computing power and energy, making efficiency a critical factor for profitability. Operational Efficiency: Producing 110 BTC indicates robust operational efficiency and potentially optimized hardware utilization within Greenidge’s facilities. Market Position: As a Nasdaq-listed entity, Greenidge is under public scrutiny, and its mining output contributes to its market narrative as a serious player in the Greenidge Bitcoin mining industry. Revenue Generation: Each Bitcoin mined represents a potential revenue stream, although the actual value depends on the Bitcoin price at the time of sale. While the press release did not elaborate on the specifics of their mining fleet or energy sources, the consistent production suggests a well-managed infrastructure capable of handling the increasing difficulty of Bitcoin mining. Navigating the Challenges of Digital Asset Mining The journey of a cryptocurrency miner is not without its hurdles. The profitability of mining is heavily influenced by several external factors: Bitcoin Price Volatility: Fluctuations in Bitcoin’s market price directly impact the fiat value of mined BTC. Mining Difficulty: As more miners join the network, the difficulty of mining increases, requiring more computational power to earn the same rewards. Energy Costs: Energy consumption is the single largest operational expense for miners. Access to affordable and sustainable energy sources is a significant competitive advantage. Greenidge’s ability to maintain its BTC production amidst these variables speaks to its strategic planning and operational resilience. The company’s unique position as a power generator in some of its facilities likely provides a hedge against fluctuating energy prices. The Future Outlook for Greenidge Bitcoin Mining The Q2 results provide a snapshot of Greenidge’s performance, but what does the future hold? The company’s continued operation and reported output suggest a commitment to expanding its presence in the digital asset space. As the Bitcoin network grows and evolves, so too will the demands on miners. Investors and market observers will be keen to see how Greenidge continues to adapt to changing market conditions, technological advancements, and regulatory landscapes. The strategic decisions made regarding hardware upgrades, energy procurement, and treasury management will be pivotal in shaping its long-term success. In conclusion, Greenidge Generation Holdings’ announcement of 110 BTC mined in Q2 underscores its significant operational capacity as a Nasdaq-listed Greenidge Bitcoin mining entity. While the full financial picture awaits further disclosures, this production figure solidifies its position as a notable player in the competitive cryptocurrency mining industry. It highlights the ongoing efforts of publicly traded companies to bring greater transparency and accountability to the burgeoning world of digital assets.

That’s the spirit driving today’s meme coin frenzy, where creativity, internet culture, and earnest money meet head-on. For those who know how to spot the real deals, the rewards can be staggering. At the front of the pack is Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) —a project weaving a vivid storyline with concrete financial incentives. Alongside it, Popcat (POPCAT), Osaka Protocol (OSAK), and Daddy Tate (DADDY) each bring their spark. Arctic Pablo’s meme coin presale is already pulling in whale wallets and sharp investors, and its combination of narrative, staking, and deflationary mechanics cements it as the top new meme coin to invest in now. 1. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) – The Icy Expedition With Sky-High Rewards In a world where most tokens are just code on a blockchain, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out by taking investors on a mythical snowmobile ride through frost-covered lands in search of hidden wealth. The central character, Arctic Pablo, uncovers shimmering $APC coins said to hold ancient magic and the promise of fortune. The project’s 66 % Annual Percentage Yield staking program lets holders lock in tokens for two months after launch and watch them grow while staying part of this global adventure. It’s this blend of fantasy and financial firepower that has made it a standout among the top new meme coins to invest in now. Arctic Pablo’s staking program isn’t an afterthought—it’s designed to reward commitment. The more you stake, the more you earn, all while being part of a narrative that keeps the community invested emotionally as well as financially. In a market full of disposable meme coins, this one builds a story you want to hold onto. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale – Stage 36 Is Almost Out Right now, Arctic Pablo Coin is in Stage 36 (Horizon Haven) of its meme coin presale , with more than 98 % already snapped up. The current price is $0.0008, and the tally has crossed $3.36 million. Early birds from the first stages have already clocked gains of 5,233.33 %. Even buyers entering now are looking at a 900% return at the listing price of $0.008, and if analysts’ projections of $0.1 come true, Stage 36 entries would yield a staggering 12,400% profit. Here’s how it plays out: a $30,000 buy at the current price secures 37,500,000 APC tokens. At $0.008, that becomes $300,000. The difference between catching it before this stage closes and missing it could be life-changing. The project also burns any unsold tokens weekly during the presale, and whatever is left afterward, permanently reducing supply and driving scarcity. It’s this structured deflation, combined with story-driven marketing and whale participation, that makes Arctic Pablo Coin impossible to ignore as the top new meme coin to invest in now . 2. Popcat (POPCAT) – The Meme That Keeps Climbing Popcat proves that sometimes the simplest ideas are the most powerful. What started as a playful internet meme has grown into a community-fueled phenomenon on Solana, with traders and collectors alike pushing it forward. The project thrives on constant conversation, clever content, and a culture that rewards engagement as much as holding the token itself. Its viral nature means Popcat often finds itself in front of fresh audiences without even trying, a rare trait in the meme coin space. It earns a place among the top new meme coins to invest in now for showing how a lighthearted concept can sustain serious momentum when backed by consistent community energy and creative execution. 3. Osaka Protocol (OSAK) – Built on Community Roots Osaka Protocol carries a sense of loyalty and shared history that’s rare in the fast-paced meme coin arena. Its origins are tied to rewarding early crypto believers, a move that instantly bonded the project with a strong base. Since then, Osaka has leaned into that ethos, fostering a culture where participation and contribution matter as much as speculation. From online discussions to coordinated initiatives, the community’s involvement shapes its direction. That ability to grow while staying anchored in its original values is why it stands out in this list of the top new meme coins to invest in now—Osaka shows that when a project respects its roots, it can keep attracting new supporters without losing its identity. 4. Daddy Tate (DADDY) – Branding With a Punch Daddy Tate is proof that personality-driven branding can be a powerful force in crypto. Inspired by the unapologetic style of its namesake influencer, the coin attracts holders who connect with boldness, controversy, and high energy. Its online presence is loud, confident, and impossible to ignore, keeping it in constant conversation across social media. While the meme coin space is full of playful mascots, Daddy Tate leans into a persona that sparks debate as much as it inspires loyalty. This blend of strong branding and community engagement secures its spot among the top new meme coins to invest in now as a token that knows exactly how to command attention and keep it. The Verdict Data shows meme coin volumes have surged dramatically in recent months, and Arctic Pablo Coin is positioned to ride that wave straight through its presale finale. With its narrative of hidden worlds, staking yields that turn heads, and a presale nearly sold out, it stands as the top new meme coin to invest in now . Stage 36 won’t stay open long. The gains outlined aren’t theoretical—they’re math in motion. The moment to secure APC before it lists is now, not later. The blend of creative storytelling, deflationary tokenomics, and staking incentives makes Arctic Pablo Coin a presale entry worth serious consideration.

50056946,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=189298,1755138310,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/50056946.jpeg,AguilaTrades Loss: Shocking $1.85 Million Wipeout on Hyperliquid,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/aguilatrades-loss-hyperliquid-trading/,"BitcoinWorld AguilaTrades Loss: Shocking $1.85 Million Wipeout on Hyperliquid A stunning event recently unfolded in the fast-paced world of decentralized finance, highlighting the immense volatility and inherent risks of high-stakes crypto trading . A prominent figure known as AguilaTrades, a whale trader operating on the Hyperliquid decentralized exchange, suffered a significant financial blow. This AguilaTrades loss amounted to a staggering $1.85 million, incurred over just eight hours with a 0% win rate across six consecutive trades. What Led to the Catastrophic AguilaTrades Loss? The recent series of unfortunate events for AguilaTrades began with the closure of previous Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) positions. Following this, the trader embarked on six new positions within an eight-hour window. On-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X brought these details to light, revealing that every single one of these trades resulted in a loss, accumulating to a total of $1,846,000. This perfect losing streak serves as a stark reminder of how quickly fortunes can turn in the highly unpredictable crypto markets. Understanding the Whale Trader’s High-Stakes Game on Hyperliquid Who exactly is AguilaTrades ? This individual is recognized as a ‘whale trader’ – a term used to describe market participants holding significant amounts of cryptocurrency, whose large trades can influence market prices. Their activity on Hyperliquid , a decentralized exchange, means they operate in an environment known for its high liquidity and often, opportunities for substantial leveraged trading . Currently, AguilaTrades holds a massive 25x leveraged long position of 21,050 ETH. This position is valued at an astonishing $99.93 million, having been entered at an ETH price of $4,750.06. Such high leverage amplifies both potential gains and, as seen, potential losses significantly. It underscores the immense capital at play in the DeFi ecosystem. The Perils of Leveraged Crypto Trading: Lessons from AguilaTrades The incident involving AguilaTrades underscores the extreme risks associated with leveraged trading in the volatile cryptocurrency market. While leverage allows traders to control large positions with a relatively small amount of capital, it also magnifies losses if the market moves against their prediction. A 25x leverage, for instance, means a mere 4% price drop can wipe out the entire initial capital, leading to a swift liquidation. What can we learn from this devastating AguilaTrades loss ? Risk Management is Crucial: Even experienced traders can face severe setbacks without proper stop-loss orders and meticulous position sizing. Market Volatility: The crypto market is inherently unpredictable. Sudden price swings can liquidate highly leveraged positions rapidly, regardless of market sentiment. Emotional Control: Consecutive losses can lead to impulsive decisions, further exacerbating the situation and potentially leading to greater financial exposure. The recent multi-million dollar AguilaTrades loss on Hyperliquid serves as a powerful cautionary tale for anyone involved in crypto trading . It highlights that even whale traders, with their vast resources and experience, are not immune to the market’s unforgiving nature, especially when engaging in high-leverage strategies. This event reminds us all about the critical importance of prudent risk management and understanding the magnified dangers of leveraged positions in decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is AguilaTrades? A1: AguilaTrades is identified as a prominent whale trader , meaning an individual or entity with significant capital whose trades can influence market prices, particularly on platforms like Hyperliquid . Q2: What is Hyperliquid? A2: Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that facilitates high-speed crypto trading , often allowing for significant leverage on various cryptocurrency pairs. Q3: What does ’25x leveraged long position’ mean? A3: A 25x leveraged long position means the trader is borrowing funds to amplify their exposure to an asset (in this case, ETH) by 25 times, betting that its price will increase. While it magnifies potential gains, it also drastically increases potential losses. Q4: How did AguilaTrades lose so much money? A4: AguilaTrades incurred a $1.85 million loss by opening six consecutive positions over eight hours, all of which resulted in losses. This 0% win rate, likely compounded by high leverage, led to the substantial AguilaTrades loss . Q5: What are the main risks of high-leverage crypto trading? A5: The primary risks include magnified losses, rapid liquidation of positions due to small price movements, and the potential for emotional trading decisions after significant setbacks. It requires robust risk management. Did you find this article insightful?

A recent CoinDesk report shines a light on the formidable challenges hindering the development of such a digital asset in South Korea. It appears the nation’s stringent South Korea currency controls are proving to be a major hurdle, potentially stifling a key area of digital currency innovation . Understanding these limitations is crucial for anyone interested in the future of stablecoins and global finance. Understanding South Korea’s Currency Controls: A Historical Context South Korea’s tight currency regulations are not new; they are a direct legacy of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. This pivotal event led to the implementation of strict rules designed to safeguard the nation’s financial stability. Essentially, these regulations limit deliverable won trading almost exclusively to domestic markets. This means foreign institutions are explicitly prohibited from exchanging the currency overseas, a significant barrier for any aspiring won-backed stablecoin looking for international adoption. Moreover, every single dollar–won transaction must navigate through domestic intermediaries. This entire process operates under the vigilant oversight of the Bank of Korea. These measures, while effective for traditional financial stability, create a challenging environment for new digital financial instruments, especially those aiming for global reach like a true won-backed stablecoin . The very nature of these South Korea currency controls limits the natural expansion of digital assets. Why Won-Backed Stablecoins Face Hurdles for Cross-Border Settlement One might wonder, why would South Korea even need a stablecoin for its domestic transactions? The answer lies in the existing efficiency of its traditional banking system. In South Korea, interbank transfers already boast remarkable features: They settle instantly, ensuring immediate fund availability. They operate year-round, providing uninterrupted service. They incur virtually no fees, making them highly cost-effective. Given this advanced infrastructure, a stablecoin offers little in the way of improvement for internal payments. Its most compelling application, cross-border settlement , is precisely where the nation’s currency rules become an insurmountable barrier. The requirement that all trading remains onshore directly conflicts with the global, borderless nature of stablecoins, thus hindering the full stablecoin potential . This situation isn’t unique to South Korea. Taiwan faces a similar predicament. The Taiwan dollar (NTD), while freely convertible, cannot be used outside its borders. This restriction significantly limits its potential as a stablecoin, mirroring the challenges seen with the potential won-backed stablecoin and the broader implications for cross-border settlement . The Broader Impact on Stablecoin Potential and Digital Currency Innovation The implications of these rigid South Korea currency controls extend beyond just the won. They cast a shadow over the broader stablecoin potential within the country and, by extension, the nation’s capacity for rapid digital currency innovation . While South Korea is a tech-forward nation, its conservative approach to currency management creates a paradox for its burgeoning crypto industry. For a stablecoin to truly thrive, it needs the freedom to move across borders, facilitate international trade, and offer a seamless digital alternative to traditional remittances. When a currency is tethered so tightly to its domestic market, the fundamental utility of a stablecoin – its ability to bridge fiat and crypto globally – is severely curtailed. This regulatory environment necessitates a careful balance between financial stability and fostering innovation in the digital currency innovation space. Navigating the Future: Overcoming Regulatory Challenges for Digital Won The path forward for a won-backed stablecoin , and indeed for greater cross-border settlement efficiency, requires a thoughtful re-evaluation of existing currency frameworks. While the reasons for the current regulations are understandable, the global financial landscape is evolving rapidly with digital assets. Policymakers face the complex task of adapting these rules to accommodate new technologies without compromising financial security. Dialogue between regulators, financial institutions, and blockchain innovators will be crucial. Exploring regulatory sandboxes or controlled environments for pilot programs could offer a way to test the waters. Ultimately, for South Korea to fully embrace the future of finance and unlock the full stablecoin potential , it must find innovative ways to reconcile its historical South Korea currency controls with the demands of a globally interconnected digital economy. This evolution is vital for truly realizing digital currency innovation . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a won-backed stablecoin? A won-backed stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged 1:1 to the South Korean Won. This means its value is intended to remain consistent with the national currency, unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. 2. Why does South Korea have such strict currency controls? South Korea implemented stringent currency controls after the 1997 Asian financial crisis. These measures were put in place to protect the nation’s financial stability by limiting the international flow and exchange of its currency, the won. 3. How do South Korea’s existing payment systems compare to stablecoins? South Korea already boasts highly efficient domestic payment systems. Interbank transfers are instant, operate year-round, and incur virtually no fees. Therefore, a stablecoin offers little improvement for internal transactions within the country. 4. What is the primary use case for stablecoins that is blocked in South Korea? The primary blocked use case for a won-backed stablecoin in South Korea is cross-border settlement. Current regulations require all won trading to remain onshore, preventing the stablecoin from facilitating international transactions freely. 5. Is South Korea completely against digital currency innovation? While South Korea has strict currency controls, it is a technologically advanced nation that has shown interest in blockchain and digital assets. The challenge lies in balancing financial stability and regulatory oversight with fostering new digital currency innovations. Did you find this article insightful?

Many investors are also keeping an eye on MAGACOIN FINANCE as market moves gain pace. The next few weeks could set the performance tone of altcoins for the rest of the year. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum crossed $4,600 on Wednesday. It climbed 8% in the last 24 hours and hit $4,715, just shy of its $4,867 all-time high from November 2021. Onchain data from Glassnode shows bids for ETH are strengthening. The asset is serving as a barometer of the larger altcoin market. Spot Ethereum ETFs are experiencing enormous inflows as investor demand grows. The streak of inflows in the past six days has been worth $2.3 billion. Monday alone broke records, registering a $1 billion net inflow. The performance is also good on daily activity. On Tuesday, Ethereum recorded more than 1.87 million transactions. The number of transactions in July 2025 was approximately 50 million, a record in more than a year. XRP (XRP) Crypto analyst Ali Martinez predicts XRP could rally to $12.60. His chart shows a multi-year symmetrical triangle that recently broke upwards. The bullish breakout suggests a possible long-term rally. Martinez expects the peak in November. XRP was trading at $3.1840 at the time of his post. This would imply an increase of more than 395 percent in the event that his goal is achieved. Martinez has gotten it right in the past. His prediction of $3.34 unfolded following the conclusion of the Ripple vs. SEC case on August 7. The resolution has now provided a clarification on the regulatory status of XRP, which can facilitate its better growth. Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche is testing the $26 resistance level. A close above this could trigger a significant rally. The weekly chart shows AVAX has been moving inside a descending parallel channel since March 2024. It bounced in April and reclaimed $20 as support. The wave count is bullish. According to analysts, AVAX has already undergone a long-term correction, and the coin might enter a bullish period. There are target prices of $74 and $110 on the rally. This move should be confirmed by a weekly close above $26. Experienced whale investors are currently pumping large amounts of capital into MAGACOIN FINANCE in an indication that they have high expectations of its growth. These big players tend to detect the spot market opportunities earlier than retail traders, and their early presence signifies that the project may have large momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE is on track to become a serious player during the new market cycle. Conclusion Ethereum, XRP, and Avalanche all have robust charts in anticipation of ETF approval. Technical indicators and increasing inflows suggest potential breakouts. There is an extra layer of interest with MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the purchase of whales indicates an initial placement before the mood of the market changes. Combined momentum among these projects may determine the next big altcoin bull run in case ETF approvals arrive shortly.

Experts say MUTM is clear winner,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/14/mutm-vs-ada-which-hits-5-first-experts-say-mutm-is-clear-winner/,"In the competitive world of cryptocurrencies, Cardano’s ADA has long been recognized as a leading player with a well-established market presence and a strong developer community. However, a fresh contender is emerging on the scene with a unique approach designed to accelerate growth and adoption— Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . While ADA’s steady progress is commendable, MUTM’s innovative dual lending system, Layer-2 integration, and strategic roadmap put it in a prime position to reach the $5 mark faster than ADA. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s is developing a dual lending model separating Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, enabling a more flexible and efficient ecosystem. This system caters to both blue-chip assets and more speculative coins, broadening its appeal and usability. This versatility is a significant edge that MUTM holds over ADA, whose platform, though robust, lacks this degree of lending innovation. Investors looking for projects with tangible utility and rapid expansion opportunities find MUTM’s model far more dynamic, laying the groundwork for accelerated price appreciation. Strong presale momentum and upcoming beta launch At the heart of MUTM’s rise is its impressive presale performance. Currently in Phase 6, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $14.33 million at a price of $0.035 per token, attracting over 15,200 holders. With 15% of the tokens already sold at this stage, the demand clearly indicates growing confidence in the project’s vision and future prospects. This level of early support is critical for building momentum and signaling to the market that MUTM is more than just a speculative token. Looking ahead, the upcoming beta launch will serve as a pivotal moment for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). This phase will allow real users to interact directly with the platform’s lending, borrowing, and staking features, turning theoretical value into practical utility. Unlike many projects that remain intangible for extended periods, MUTM is set to make its utility tangible, which will increase organic demand for the token well beyond speculation alone. Layer-2 integration further strengthens MUTM’s position by addressing two critical issues that often slow down blockchain projects: transaction speed and cost. By leveraging Layer-2 technology, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer significantly faster transactions and lower fees compared to many existing blockchains, including ADA’s current structure. This technological leap not only enhances user experience but also makes MUTM more accessible to a broader audience, driving higher platform activity and token demand. Stablecoin and early investment advantage The planned introduction of a decentralized stablecoin is another game-changing feature for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). This stablecoin will boost the lending ecosystem by enabling safer and more efficient borrowing and staking activities. By adding this financial instrument, MUTM expands its use cases and positions itself as a serious contender in the DeFi lending space, setting it apart from ADA’s more generalized approach. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap reflects steady progress with major milestones lined up, including exchange listings on some of the industry’s biggest names—Coinbase, Binance, KuCoin, and Kraken. These listings will dramatically enhance liquidity and token accessibility, inviting more investors and traders to join the MUTM community. Increased liquidity often correlates with price stability and upward momentum, making this a critical factor in MUTM’s potential to hit $5 sooner. To put this into perspective, early investors who bought MUTM tokens during the initial presale phases at prices well below $0.035 are now positioned to realize significant gains as the token approaches its anticipated $0.06 listing price. When compared to ADA’s more gradual ascent, MUTM offers a clearer path for those seeking rapid and substantial returns. With the next presale phase poised to increase the token price by 15% to $0.040, investors have a final opportunity to secure MUTM tokens at a discount before prices rise further. In the race between MUTM and ADA to reach the $5 milestone, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out for its innovative lending infrastructure, forward-looking technology, and strong market traction. Its ability to combine real utility with strategic growth plans makes it a top choice for investors aiming to capitalize on the next wave of DeFi expansion. The clock is ticking for those who want to join MUTM early—waiting too long means missing out on a critical phase of growth that is already underway.

Bitcoin (BTC)’s historic surge, which multiplied some early investors’ wealth by 1000 times, set a benchmark few projects have matched since. Now, leading analysts who accurately forecasted that remarkable BTC run have identified a new contender as the next major growth opportunity beyond Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH): Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Positioned as a high-potential decentralized finance platform, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing keen attention for its innovative approach to crypto lending and borrowing, coupled with a well-structured presale that offers an accessible entry point well below $0.04 per token. While BTC and ETH remain the giants of the space, the anticipated growth in DeFi and stablecoin ecosystems is creating a fertile environment for new projects to shine. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dual lending model, combining Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer systems, presents a fresh and dynamic opportunity that investors will find difficult to ignore as the crypto market goes beyond 2025. P2C lending example: steady yields from blue-chip crypto Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending mechanism allows users to deposit widely recognized cryptocurrencies into lending pools that generate consistent returns while enabling borrowers to access liquidity with reasonable loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. Consider an investor who deposits 80 AVAX tokens, worth around $2,800, into a P2C lending pool. With an LTV of 68%, this user can borrow $1,904 in DAI stablecoins, unlocking liquidity without selling their assets. On the lending side, providing liquidity to a MATIC lending pool with $100,000 could yield an impressive 11% annual percentage yield (APY), translating to $11,000 per year in returns. This system offers an attractive blend of security and profitability, appealing to investors who want to earn passive income while maintaining exposure to valuable crypto assets. As Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s beta launch nears and Layer-2 enhancements are implemented, lending efficiency and demand will rise, making these returns even more rewarding. P2P higher yield: capturing premium returns on speculative tokens In addition to its P2C pools, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) features a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending model tailored for higher-risk, higher-reward scenarios. Unlike the shared pools in P2C, P2P loans are directly negotiated between lenders and borrowers, allowing for flexible terms and elevated interest rates reflecting the risk profile of speculative tokens. Take the example of the popular PEPE token. An investor might lend $6,000 in USDT stablecoins on a 30-day loan, secured by PEPE tokens as collateral, at an APY of 27%. This high-yield arrangement allows lenders to capitalize on short-term opportunities with carefully managed risk. This distinctive P2P approach diversifies the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform, attracting both conservative users and those chasing premium returns in speculative crypto markets. The combination of P2C and P2P lending offers a comprehensive DeFi experience that is rare in the current market. Presale data: solid foundations for growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.035. The project has successfully raised approximately $14.33 million, supported by a vibrant community of more than 15,200 holders. Only 15% of tokens have been sold so far, indicating significant room for growth and adoption. Security and trust are paramount for any emerging DeFi project, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has completed a full CertiK audit, providing assurance on the safety and reliability of its smart contracts. This thorough third-party validation reinforces the platform’s commitment to protecting investors and users. With Phase 7 approaching, token prices are expected to rise to $0.040, offering an immediate 15% price appreciation for presale participants. This pricing step-up adds a clear incentive for early supporters to join before the next phase. Trust builders: incentives that strengthen the ecosystem Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enhances user confidence through its $50,000 Bug Bounty program, encouraging ethical hackers to identify and report vulnerabilities before any malicious exploitation can occur. This proactive security stance is a strong signal of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dedication to maintaining a robust and safe ecosystem. Alongside this, the platform is running a $100,000 giveaway to reward community members and broaden token distribution. These programs not only build trust but also actively engage the community, fostering a loyal and enthusiastic user base poised to support future growth milestones. ROI angle: early investors reaping big rewards Early investors in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are positioned for remarkable returns. For example, a Phase 2 participant who invested $40,000 worth of ETH tokens at the $0.015 price now holds MUTM tokens valued at $93,300 based on current presale prices. When the token lists on centralized exchanges, expected to be at $0.06, this investment will be worth approximately $160,000 on paper. Looking further ahead, with the launch of the platform’s beta version and multiple exchange listings planned, the value of that investment will climb even higher, reaching or surpassing $320,000. These projections highlight Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s enormous potential to deliver returns that rival or exceed those of established cryptos like BTC and ETH in their early days. Top analysts who have accurately predicted crypto’s biggest moves are now ranking Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the best alternative to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) for substantial growth post-2025. Combining innovative lending mechanisms, strong security foundations, an engaged community, and a compelling presale valuation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands ready to become a defining project in the next phase of crypto evolution. Investors looking beyond BTC and ETH for outsized returns will find MUTM an essential addition to their portfolios.

This coin eyes huge gains as SOL hits $185 on volume surge,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/14/from-0-035-to-4-this-coin-eyes-huge-gains-as-sol-hits-185-on-volume-surge/,"The cryptocurrency market has witnessed some remarkable moves recently, with Solana (SOL) surging to an impressive $185 amid a sharp increase in trading volume. This surge has captured widespread attention, highlighting the value of strong technology and user engagement in driving token prices. Yet, while Solana (SOL) basks in the spotlight, another promising project is quietly building a foundation for explosive growth— Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Positioned at an entry price of just $0.035 during its presale, Mutuum Finance is rapidly becoming a top choice for investors seeking substantial upside in the DeFi space. Solana (SOL) hits $185 Solana (SOL) surged 12.6% to $185, driven by a massive 140% decentralized exchange (DEX) volume spike to $1.4 trillion in July 2025, per blockchain.news. The rally, with a 24-hour trading volume of $5.2 billion, reflects growing institutional interest and user activity, per CoinGecko. Technical indicators show SOL breaking $180 resistance, with RSI at 67 and support at $170, per Cryptopolitan. On-chain data highlights 6 million daily active addresses and whale accumulation of $200 million, boosting sentiment. The Alpenglow upgrade, achieving 100ms finality in testnets, enhances Solana (SOL)’s scalability, per BlockBeats. However, macro pressures like U.S. tariffs and a 17% memecoin activity drop pose risks. Analysts project a $211 target if $188 clears, but a drop below $170 could test $158. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Unlike many tokens chasing quick hype, Mutuum Finance is focused on delivering real-world utility through an innovative dual lending system that separates Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. This unique model is being designed to provide users with flexible borrowing and lending options, catering to a broad spectrum of crypto assets—from blue-chip tokens to more speculative coins. This approach sets MUTM apart, attracting a diverse user base ready to engage with the platform’s upcoming features. Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance has already raised a substantial $14.33 million and grown its community to over 15,200 holders. With 15% of tokens sold at the current $0.035 price, early investors are showing strong confidence in MUTM’s long-term potential. This level of support underlines the growing momentum and signals that more investors will be joining as the project progresses. The near-future beta launch at the time of listing is set to be a turning point for Mutuum Finance. This phase will allow real users to interact with the platform’s lending, borrowing, and staking functions, turning what has been theoretical into tangible experiences. The platform’s integration of Layer-2 blockchain technology will further accelerate its appeal by delivering faster transactions at significantly lower fees. This leap forward will make MUTM’s platform far more accessible and cost-effective than many traditional Layer-1 blockchains, offering a clear advantage that will drive user adoption. A standout feature that will expand Mutuum Finance’s utility is the introduction of its decentralized stablecoin. This stablecoin will empower users to borrow against their crypto collateral with peace of mind, while maintaining the system’s overall balance through automatic minting and burning mechanisms. As stablecoins have become essential tools for liquidity and lending in DeFi, this addition will create a fresh, continuous demand driver for MUTM tokens and further solidify the platform’s position in the market. CEX listing Mutuum Finance’s roadmap reflects steady and consistent progress, with carefully planned milestones designed to enhance both platform functionality and market presence. Following the beta launch, the project aims to secure listings on major exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, KuCoin, and Kraken. These listings will boost MUTM’s visibility and liquidity, attracting new users and traders, which in turn will support higher trading volumes and sustained price growth. For investors watching Solana (SOL)’s rise, Mutuum Finance presents a compelling alternative—an undervalued token backed by robust technology, a clear path to real-world application, and a growing community ready to support its expansion. The combination of Layer-2 speed, the stablecoin’s borrowing capabilities, and upcoming exchange listings provides a powerful foundation for significant price appreciation. As the presale enters its next phase, the price of MUTM will increase by 15% to $0.040. Given that only a limited supply of tokens remains at the current $0.035 price, now is the crucial window for investors to secure their positions. This is the moment to get in before the price moves higher and the platform’s utility begins to translate into broader market demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another token waiting for the market to notice; it is a well-structured DeFi project building momentum through real technology and strategic growth. For those looking beyond the headlines to find a project with the potential to move from $0.035 to $4 and beyond, MUTM is one to watch closely. The opportunity to enter early and benefit from this growth is available now—but will not last long.

This impressive figure marks the seventh consecutive trading day of positive Ethereum ETF inflows , signaling robust and sustained investor interest in the second-largest cryptocurrency. What’s Driving These Remarkable Ethereum ETF Inflows? This consistent influx of capital into ETH ETF products highlights a growing confidence among institutional and retail investors alike. The continuous positive flows suggest a maturing market where investors increasingly view Ethereum as a legitimate and accessible investment vehicle. Many factors contribute to this trend. Increased Accessibility: ETFs offer a regulated and familiar way for traditional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This ease of access significantly lowers barriers to entry. Market Maturation: The approval and launch of these ETFs indicate a broader acceptance of digital assets within the traditional financial system. This institutional validation can attract more cautious investors. Ethereum’s Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum’s foundational role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and various Web3 applications continues to drive its utility and long-term appeal, making it an attractive asset for diversified portfolios. The steady stream of capital suggests that market participants are not just dipping their toes, but actively committing to Ethereum through these regulated investment products.

Institutional Validation: Large inflows from major financial institutions via ETFs provide a stamp of approval, potentially encouraging more conservative investors to explore the crypto space. Market Liquidity and Stability: Increased investment through regulated products can contribute to greater market liquidity and potentially reduce volatility for Ethereum, making it a more attractive asset class. Future Growth Potential: Sustained inflows could pave the way for more diverse crypto-backed financial products and further integration of digital assets into mainstream investment portfolios. However, investors should always consider market volatility and conduct thorough research. While these inflows are positive, the crypto market remains dynamic. This trend undeniably strengthens Ethereum’s position as a foundational asset in the evolving digital economy.

With $704.32 million flowing in on August 13 alone, and a seven-day streak of positive movements, it is clear that institutional and retail investors are increasingly embracing Ethereum as a core component of their portfolios.

This ease of access is vital for drawing in a broader base of investors, including those new to digital assets. Moreover, the transparency and oversight associated with ETFs provide a layer of confidence. As more investors embrace these funds, we could see a ripple effect across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. This institutional validation helps legitimize Bitcoin as a serious asset class, potentially paving the way for further adoption and innovation. Looking Ahead: What Do These Trends Mean for the Crypto ETF Market? The consistent net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are a strong positive signal for the future of the crypto ETF market . It demonstrates robust demand and liquidity. While the remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings for August 13, the significant contributions from the leading funds paint a clear picture of momentum. This trend suggests a maturation of the market, where regulated products play an increasingly important role in connecting traditional finance with the burgeoning world of digital assets. Investors should continue to monitor these flows as they provide valuable insights into market sentiment and the health of the institutional crypto landscape. These figures are not just numbers; they represent tangible capital commitments from a diverse range of investors. Conclusion: A Resilient Path Forward for Bitcoin ETFs The latest data on U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs paints an optimistic picture, showcasing impressive net inflows for the sixth consecutive day.

The future looks bright for Bitcoin investment funds. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF? A U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin. It allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through a regulated investment vehicle, trading on traditional stock exchanges, without directly owning the cryptocurrency. Why are Bitcoin ETF inflows important? Bitcoin ETF inflows are important because they indicate strong investor demand and confidence in Bitcoin. Consistent inflows suggest that more capital is entering the Bitcoin ecosystem through regulated channels, which can contribute to market stability and price appreciation. Which U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw the most inflows on August 13? On August 13, ARK Invest’s ARKB led with $36.58 million in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC ($26.70 million), Grayscale’s mini BTC ($11.42 million), Bitwise’s BITB ($7.32 million), and Invesco’s BTCO ($4.90 million). How do these inflows impact the broader crypto market? These inflows generally have a positive impact on the broader crypto market. They signal increasing institutional and mainstream adoption of Bitcoin, which can enhance its legitimacy as an asset class. This can lead to increased liquidity, greater market stability, and potentially attract more investment into other digital assets. Are Bitcoin ETFs a safe investment? While U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a regulated way to invest in Bitcoin, all investments carry risks. The value of Bitcoin can be highly volatile, and ETF performance will reflect these fluctuations. Investors should conduct thorough research and consider their own financial situation before investing. Did you find this article insightful?

Solana (SOL) is riding a rally forecast backed by a strong technical breakout pattern, while Chainlink (LINK) is building momentum as it nears a resistance level that could see its value almost double. Although SOL and LINK have established reputations, active networks, and credible growth records, Cold Wallet with 50x ROI projection and rewards-focused model stands apart. By turning routine crypto usage into a source of earnings, it offers a fresh take on how people might view top-performing projects in the years ahead. Solana (SOL) Rally Forecast Analysts see the Solana (SOL) rally pushing toward $260, driven by a “cup and handle” breakout pattern. This setup is supported by growing trade volume, favorable RSI signals, and steady institutional backing. Solana’s speed and scalability continue to draw developer interest, strengthening its case for long-term value. Outside of chart analysis, Solana’s growing footprint in DeFi, NFTs, and payment solutions reinforces its role among the top projects for sustained growth. A confirmed move beyond $260 could open paths to even higher valuations in 2025, fueling stronger market activity. Still, while Solana’s outlook is attractive, it remains centered on price growth. Cold Wallet offers an added layer with utility-driven returns, appealing to those looking beyond established Layer-1 networks. Chainlink (LINK) Bullish Momentum The Chainlink (LINK) rally outlook grows stronger as it approaches a major resistance zone. Breaking through could prompt a rally of around 95%, taking prices toward $40. This view is backed by its vital role in providing oracle services for DeFi and real-world asset platforms, making it a critical part of blockchain infrastructure. Expanding adoption across multiple networks has helped cement Chainlink’s reputation for interoperability. These strengths make its rally potential more than just a short-term play; it reflects long-standing utility. While LINK’s fundamentals are robust, even optimistic targets don’t match Cold Wallet’s 50x ROI forecast. The real choice comes down to dependable growth versus the potential for substantial returns. Cold Wallet’s Rewards Model and 50x Growth Target Cold Wallet offers more than just secure storage; it rewards users for engaging in everyday crypto activities. The $CWT utility coin transforms actions like paying gas fees, swapping assets, or transferring funds on or off-chain into automatic rewards. There are no extra steps or hidden terms, just usage that leads to earnings. Gas cashback is a standout feature, offering returns on transaction fees of up to 100% for top-tier holders. Swap rewards follow the same approach: the more CWT you hold, the greater your cashback on in-app trades. Even fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat movements generate value back to the user in CWT. These benefits are backed by a dedicated reserve designed to scale with real usage. Tier-based rewards maintain ecosystem balance, while a halving schedule supports long-term viability. This structure ties growth directly to ongoing user activity. Now in Stage 17 of its presale at $0.00998, with over $5.9 million raised and more than 707 million coins sold, Cold Wallet is targeting a launch price of $0.3517, offering early buyers a 50x potential return. With its utility-driven design, it stands apart from projects whose appeal is mainly tied to price charts like the Solana (SOL) rally and Chainlink (LINK) rally. Final Say The Solana (SOL) rally forecast shows clear potential for higher pricing, supported by strong technicals and ecosystem growth. The Chainlink (LINK) rally is equally appealing, with its key role in blockchain connectivity driving value. Cold Wallet, however, combines a 50x ROI projection with a model that turns transactions into direct rewards. While SOL and LINK may provide steady gains, Cold Wallet’s mix of practical use and high growth potential positions it as one of the most promising crypto options for long-term returns in 2025.

Leading the pack is BlockDAG (BDAG), now past the halfway mark toward its massive $600 million target. With Dashboard V4 turning the presale into a live-market playground, $373 million already banked, and Batch 1 holders sitting on a 2,660% paper gain, BlockDAG (BDAG) isn’t just moving, it’s flying. Then there’s Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), closing in on its $10 million milestone with lightning-fast Layer 2 plans for Bitcoin. And don’t sleep on Magacoin Finance (MAGAFINANCE), the political meme play stacking whales under $1. Three very different stories, one shared trait, momentum so strong it’s making the market impossible to ignore. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) Targets $10 Million Milestone The crypto market’s value has climbed to nearly $4 trillion, gaining about 10% in the past month. Bitcoin (BTC) leads the charge, trading just under 3% from its record high of $123,091. This renewed strength has fueled interest in Bitcoin-focused projects with high growth potential. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) has emerged as a standout, aiming to deliver the fastest DeFi-ready Layer 2 network for Bitcoin. Having raised $8.4 million so far, its $110,000 whale buy has sparked more momentum. As its presale nears $10 million, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) is positioning to improve Bitcoin’s speed and cost-efficiency with Solana Virtual Machine tech, enabling scalable, near-instant transactions while reducing fees, a move that could attract millions to Bitcoin’s network. Megacoin Finanace Gains Momentum Under $1 Price Range The crypto market is seeing renewed energy, and attention is shifting toward affordable altcoins under $1 with strong upside potential. While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain steady, emerging names are gaining momentum, one of the most discussed being Megacoin Finanace. This politically charged meme altcoin is drawing notice for its low entry price, expanding network activity, and growing appeal among large holders. Recent on-chain data shows consistent whale accumulation, suggesting a potential price breakout. The surge in transaction volume reinforces its increasing adoption beyond hype. The opportunity to get Megacoin Finanace under $1 may not last long, as rising demand and community strength point toward a faster climb ahead, making it one to watch in the current market shift. BlockDAG Dashboard V4 Gives Users a Head Start BlockDAG’s latest Dashboard V4 isn’t just an upgrade; it’s an early taste of the live market. Landing right as the project moves past the halfway mark toward its $600 million target, the release transforms the presale into a fully interactive trading space. Instead of a static counter, Dashboard V4 offers a real-time BUY/SELL system, instant price updates, and in-depth tracking that mirrors the tools holders will use post-launch. This means participants are no longer just watching numbers climb—they’re actively engaging in a simulation of the actual BDAG exchange. The market is moving fast: $373 million raised, over 25 billion BDAG sold, and the Batch 29 price sitting at $0.0276. The next move to $0.029 is already in sight, while the $0.05 launch price remains locked in. Early Batch 1 entrants are sitting on a 2,660% paper gain, proof that timing matters here. For traders, seasoned or new, the dashboard offers a chance to test strategies in an environment identical to the one coming after mainnet. For the project, it’s a way to build familiarity, reduce friction on day one, and keep the momentum sharp in these final stages. Every price shift now feels like a countdown, each batch edging closer to the point where BDAG goes live. By blending user experience with real market conditions before launch, BlockDAG has given its community a rare edge, one that cements its status as a top crypto buy heading into 2025 Final Thoughts Momentum in the crypto presales to invest in arena is building fast, and the market’s latest movers are proving it. BlockDAG (BDAG) continues to dominate headlines with $373 million raised, an advanced V4 Dashboard that mirrors live trading, and a launch price locked at $0.05. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) is closing in on its $10 million mark while introducing high-speed Layer 2 capabilities for Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Magacoin Finance (MAGAFINANCE) is attracting whales and community growth while still under $1. Together, they show that early positioning can be the edge that separates observers from those capturing the next big run. The question now isn’t whether these projects can move, it’s how far they’ll go once the market really opens.

Ethereum’s price performance has prompted Standard Chartered, one of the UK’s largest financial institutions, to significantly revise its price projections for the cryptocurrency. Ethereum Consolidates 4% Below All-Time Highs Currently, the Ethereum price is consolidating above the $4,600 level, which could serve as a crucial support point as if ETH breaks through its previous all-time high of $4,878 reached in 2021, it may enter a new phase of price discovery. Presently, a mere 4% gap separates Ethereum’s current price from that record, but analysts at Standard Chartered, led by Geoff Kendrick, are optimistic for a new bullish phase for the cryptocurrency. They forecast a bullish trend that could nearly double the Ethereum price by the end of the year, raising their year-end target from $4,000 to $7,500. Furthermore, they have set an ambitious 2028 target of $25,000 for ETH. Related Reading: The Grand Bitcoin Roadmap: Crypto Expert Says $160,000 Still In The Works Several key factors underlie this optimistic outlook. Firstly, the recent approval of Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has led to significant market activity. Ethereum ETFs recently recorded $1 billion in inflows, marking the largest daily influx to date. Year-to-date, these exchange-traded funds tracking ETH’s price have attracted $8.2 billion, representing around 1.5% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. Additionally, legislative progress in the United States, particularly with the passage of the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, has bolstered Ethereum’s prospects. These developments are expected to enhance liquidity in the Ethereum ecosystem, as a substantial portion of stablecoins—often considered a stealth bullish driver for ETH—are issued on the Ethereum blockchain. Currently, major stablecoins like USDC, issued by Circle (CRCL), and USDT, developed by Tether, primarily operate within Ethereum’s ecosystem, further supporting the altcoin’s price performance. Greater Impact From Institutional Investments Beyond these bullish developments, there is a growing trend among public companies adopting Ethereum treasury strategies similar to those employed by Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) with Bitcoin (BTC). As reported by NewsBTC on Tuesday, approximately 865,000 ETH is now held by these companies, reflecting a broadening interest from institutional investors looking to capitalize on Ethereum’s long-term potential. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price Crash Below $3, But There’s Good News Adding to the bullish sentiment, analyst VirtualBacon has shared forecasts suggesting that if Bitcoin approaches $150,000 and the ETH/BTC ratio rises to 0.044, Ethereum could reach prices between $6,000 and $7,000 this year. The analyst noted in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), that Ethereum’s smaller market capitalization means that each dollar from institutional investors has a more pronounced effect on its price compared to Bitcoin. VirtualBacon identifies $3,350 as a potential floor for ETH, unless Bitcoin experiences a significant downturn. He emphasizes that the pivotal moment for Ethereum will be clearing the $4,850 resistance level, which could quickly propel ETH above $6,000. As of this writing, ETH trades at $4,636, registering a 4.3% surge in the 24-hour time frame.

Chainlink, Ethereum, XRP, and an emerging player, MAGACOIN FINANCE, are standing out as some of the best crypto to buy. Chainlink Price Heads to $24: Is $30 Next Chainlink (LINK) has been on a notable run, gaining over 51% in the past week and holding near $23. On-chain data reveals over 2 million LINK worth $46 million have been withdrawn from exchanges in just 48 hours. The best crypto to buy often shows strong accumulation, and Chainlink’s On-Balance Volume (OBV) indicator confirms steady buying pressure. Additionally, its Total Value Secured in DeFi is now above $93 billion. Technical charts show $24.86 as the next target to beat, as a break above it will open the door toward the $29–$30 range. Ethereum Heads To All-Time Highs Ethereum has grown past $4,700, closing in on its all-time high of $4,867. Glassnode says ETH’s recent strength is being pushed by a six-day streak of spot ETH ETF inflows totaling $2.3 billion, including a record $1 billion in a single day. Major accumulation is also rising, with treasury holdings exceeding $16.5 billion, and more than 30% of ETH staked, limiting immediate sell pressure. Network activity is equally good, with daily transactions at 1.87 million and total value locked in DeFi at $95 billion. Cryptoquant analysts see $4,750 as the next resistance, with a decisive break sending ETH into a “price discovery” phase. Other forecasts range from $7,500 to $13,000, with long-term prices as high as $20,000. These factors make Ethereum one of the best crypto to buy ahead of a possible Q4 price frenzy. XRP Could Reach $11 to $50? While XRP hovers around the $3 mark, optimism is growing within the community. Technical analyst Dark Defender and other prominent voices argue that $3 is not XRP’s ceiling. They cite promising multi-year chart patterns like the triangle formation and flag break out setup. Predictions vary: Mario Nawfal suggests $10 by the end of 2025 as Bitcoin hits $225,000. Ali Martinez targets $11–$12, and Patrick Riley sees $30 in this cycle. Some extreme projections, like $50 or even $1,000, stem from XRP’s role as a settlement layer for global currencies. With improved regulatory clarity and institutional buying, XRP’s long-term case remains healthy, making it among the best crypto to buy. MAGACOIN FINANCE Recognized as a Prime Entry Crypto MAGACOIN FINANCE has also been gaining attention as one of the best crypto to buy for long-term, growth-focused investors. The project operates on a security-first framework and has been audited to ensure safety. Currently, in its initial phase, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a powerful market entry, with industry watchers noting its potential ahead of incoming exchange listings. Conclusion Chainlink, Ethereum, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are all presenting compelling cases as the best crypto to buy now. However, MAGACOIN holds a more promising position as it is in its early phase and exchange listing is coming soon. You can learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE via the official website.

Per official details, the firm manages over $27 billion in total assets. Choreo Reveals Exposure To Bitcoin ETF According to a new filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Choreo LLC now holds stakes in multiple Bitcoin ETFs. Its largest position is in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), with 51,679 shares valued at more than $3 million as of June 30. The firm also holds 22,976 shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), worth around $1.9 million at current market prices. Further, it also holds 8,314 shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF (BTC), valued at nearly $400,000. Additionally, Choreo owns 13,607 shares of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), valued at approximately $1.3 million. Data from SoSoValue shows that BlackRock’s IBIT leads in total net assets, currently worth $89.11 billion. Notably, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded four consecutive months of positive inflows, attracting over $17 billion between April and July . In August, however, the ETFs faced a net outflow of $321 million. Meanwhile, the total net assets tied to spot BTC ETFs have surged to over $155 billion. This amount represents 6.48% of BTC’s total market cap. Beyond wealth management firms like Choreo, an increasing number of educational institutions’ endowment funds are also steadily increasing exposure to BTC ETFs. Recently, Harvard disclosed a $117 million stake in BlackRock’s IBIT ETF. Most recently, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund increased its indirect exposure to BTC by 192%, year-on-year. The fund’s total exposure now stands at 7,161 BTC. BTC ETF Euphoria Grips Crypto Market While BTC continues to trade on the verge of a new all-time high (ATH) – exchanging hands at slightly above $120,000 at the time of writing – institutional interest in BTC ETFs has also been rising at a rapid pace. For instance, BlackRock’s IBIT ETF reached a whopping $70 billion in assets under management in under a year, marking a record for rapid adoption of BTC-focused regulated financial products. In the same vein, following US President Donald Trump’s November 2024 election victory, his social media firm – Trump Media – has accelerated its crypto ambitions. Last month, the firm filed for a third ETF, which will track the performance of five different cryptocurrencies. That said, the financial watchdog is carefully evaluating new ETF applications due to the inherent risks of digital assets. At press time, BTC trades at $121,444, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin ETF|Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds|BlackRock IBIT ETF|btc|BTCUSDT|Choleo|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|FBTC|Grayscale Bitcoin ETF,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-14 03:00:52

For traders navigating the complex world of derivatives, understanding market dynamics is crucial. One key indicator of market sentiment and volatility is crypto perpetual futures liquidation . This process occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is automatically closed due to insufficient margin to cover potential losses. Over the past 24 hours, we have witnessed substantial liquidation events across major digital assets, offering a stark reminder of the inherent volatility in the perpetual futures space. What Exactly is Perpetual Futures Liquidation? In the high-stakes environment of the cryptocurrency derivatives market , perpetual futures contracts are a popular tool. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely. However, they come with leverage, meaning traders can control large positions with a relatively small amount of capital. This leverage amplifies both potential gains and losses. When the market moves against a leveraged position, and the trader’s margin balance falls below a certain threshold, the exchange automatically closes the position. This is known as liquidation. It serves as a protective mechanism for the exchange to prevent negative balances. These events can trigger cascading effects, especially when large positions are involved, leading to further price movements and more liquidations. A Deep Dive into Recent Crypto Liquidation Data The past 24 hours have revealed significant activity in crypto liquidation , particularly on the short side. This means that a large number of traders who bet on prices falling (short positions) saw their positions closed out as asset prices moved upwards. Let’s break down the key figures: Ethereum (ETH): A staggering $141.80 million in ETH perpetual futures positions were liquidated. A substantial 64.46% of these were short positions. This indicates a strong upward price movement for Ethereum, catching many short sellers off guard. Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin saw $129.84 million in liquidations. An overwhelming 89.03% of these were short liquidations. This high percentage highlights a significant short squeeze in the BTC market, as Bitcoin rallied, forcing bearish bets to close. Solana (SOL): Solana experienced $30.01 million in liquidations, with 58.61% being short positions. While lower in absolute terms compared to ETH and BTC, this still represents a notable amount for SOL, suggesting a similar upward trend challenging short positions. These figures collectively paint a picture of a market where bullish momentum prevailed, leading to substantial losses for those holding bearish positions. Understanding these short liquidations provides valuable insight into recent price action and market sentiment. Why Do Short Liquidations Dominate? The prevalence of short liquidations in this 24-hour period suggests a rapid upward price movement, often referred to as a “short squeeze.” When prices begin to rise, short sellers face increasing pressure. As their losses mount, their margin levels deplete. This triggers liquidations, which in turn can push prices even higher as exchanges buy back the underlying asset to close positions, creating a positive feedback loop. This phenomenon is common in volatile markets like cryptocurrency. For traders, this serves as a critical reminder about the risks associated with high leverage, especially when betting against the prevailing market trend. Even seasoned traders can be caught off guard by sudden shifts in momentum. Actionable Insights for Traders Navigating the perpetual futures market requires a robust strategy. Firstly, always manage your risk. High leverage can lead to quick and significant losses. Consider using stop-loss orders to limit potential downside. Secondly, understand market sentiment. While shorting can be profitable, betting against strong bullish trends, especially when driven by significant buying pressure, can be perilous. Finally, keep an eye on liquidation data. Platforms often provide real-time liquidation charts, which can signal potential turning points or confirm strong trends. This data helps you gauge the broader market’s health and the intensity of certain price moves. Concluding Thoughts on Crypto Liquidation The recent crypto perpetual futures liquidation data underscores the dynamic and often unforgiving nature of the cryptocurrency derivatives market. The significant short liquidations across Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana highlight a period of strong upward price action, punishing bearish positions. For anyone involved in trading, these events are a powerful lesson in risk management, the impact of leverage, and the importance of adapting to rapid market shifts. Staying informed about these crucial metrics can help you make more informed decisions and potentially avoid becoming another liquidation statistic. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are crypto perpetual futures? A1: Crypto perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without an expiry date, often using leverage. Q2: How does crypto liquidation work? A2: Liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position loses too much value, and their margin balance falls below a required level. The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses. Q3: Why were short liquidations so high in the past 24 hours? A3: High short liquidations suggest that the price of the underlying cryptocurrencies moved significantly upwards, catching many traders who had bet on prices falling (short positions) off guard. Q4: What is a “short squeeze”? A4: A short squeeze happens when a rapid increase in an asset’s price forces short sellers to buy back the asset to limit their losses, which further pushes the price up, creating a cascading effect. Q5: How can traders avoid liquidation? A5: Traders can reduce the risk of liquidation by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders, monitoring their margin levels closely, and having a robust risk management strategy.

DAPP has outperformed the S&P 500 since February and offers exposure to digital asset transformation but remains highly volatile and concentrated. Liquidity concerns persist with DAPP, and investors should use limit orders; the fund's high yield is not guaranteed given inconsistent distributions. While DAPP benefits from crypto's rally, especially in ether, the late-Q3 period is historically weak, warranting continued caution for new highs. Ether has taken Wall Street by storm. The Ethereum network's fuel, the digital asset is a medium of exchange and utility token within that ecosystem. Often considered a younger brother of sorts to bitcoin, “ETH” has taken off since notching a sharp low in April. At one point, ether was down 57% on the year, but, after a remarkable comeback, it is now up 34%. That’s above bitcoin’s strong return and better than what spot gold has produced. Tom Lee, Chairman of Bitmine (BMNR), has taken on a similar strategy as Michael Saylor, CEO of Strategy (MSTR). The Fundstrat co-founder now stands behind ether, which has perhaps prompted a fresh wave of optimism across the crypto space. The GENIUS Act was another bullish catalyst. Unfortunately, not everything linked to bitcoin and ether has gone to the moon. Today, I’m revisiting the VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP). I had a hold rating on the fund back in February , and shares are up a solid 12% since then, outperforming the S&P 500. While the valuation is more favorable, I see resistance on the chart, which keeps me cautious and sticking with a hold rating. Ether Now Beating Bitcoin & Gold In 2025 Stockcharts.com According to the issuer , DAPP aims to invest in companies at the forefront of the digital assets transformation while offering investors diversification through exposure to exchanges, miners, and infrastructure firms. The issuer states that fund offers access to companies that have the potential of earning 50% of revenue from digital assets. DAPP is a small ETF with just $277 million in assets under management as of August 11, 2025. Its annual expense ratio is moderate at 51 basis points, while the trailing 12-month dividend yield is actually high at 3.48%. Share-price momentum has been strong for much of this year, but I will note later that the fund has pulled back from its 2025 high, despite the crypto rally. DAPP is also a highly risky product , given elevated historical annualized volatility trends and a concentrated portfolio. Liquidity can be a concern—its median 30-day bid/ask spread is somewhat wide at 17 basis points, while average daily volume is near 600,000 shares. So, I encourage prospective investors to use limit orders, particularly around the market open. For an update on the portfolio, DAAP plots along the bottom portion of the Morningstar style box, indicating its significant weight to both US and ex-US small caps. I’d call out that 22% of the investment mix is allocated to international equities, which may help from a diversification perspective. I also like that the price-to-earnings ratio has retreated to just 21.4x, likely due to more upbeat EPS expectations for companies held in the fund, now that bitcoin and ether have jumped. DAPP: Portfolio & Factor Profiles Morningstar Zooming in on the sector breakdown, you’ll find that DAPP is deep into the fintech space. The vast majority of the portfolio is invested in crypto mining firms and companies related to providing retail investors with digital currency access. Interestingly, the ETF paid out a significant $0.5808 dividend on December 24, 2024, after two years without distributions. So, the yield is not a guarantee. DAPP: Holdings & Dividend Information Seeking Alpha Turning to seasonality, we are in the throes of what’s usually a tough stretch, affirming my cautious outlook. DAPP has fallen rather sharply, on average, from August through September. I concede that there’s limited price history, so I also pulled a long-term calendar view of bitcoin performance—once again, the back half of the third quarter has not been all that kind to crypto bulls. DAPP: Weak Late-Q3 Trends Seeking Alpha Bitcoin: Often Weak in August and September Barchart The Technical Take With shares potentially more compelling on valuation, but with negative seasonal considerations, DAPP’s technical situation is mixed. Notice in the chart below that resistance is in play at the all-time high from late last year. The fund failed at testing that level during the big Q2 rally that petered out in July. Now, with a bearish negative RSI momentum divergence, the bears are trying to gain control. But take a look at the long-term 200-day moving average. It’s still on the rise despite volatile price action throughout this year and general underperformance to bitcoin (and ether, more recently). Of course, I can’t dismiss the monster rally off the April low. For now, the $15-$16 zone appears to be support, while resistance is apparent between $20 and $21. DAPP: Rising 200dma, but Below the 2024 All-Time High Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line I have a hold rating on DAPP. The crypto-tied equity ETF has more than doubled from the post-Liberation Day nadir, the bulls have their work cut out for them if they want to bring this high-beta fund to new highs amid a weak calendar stretch.",BTC-USD|ETH-USD|DAPP,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-14 03:10:23

50059131,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=189312,1755141910,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/50059131.jpeg,Stablecoins: Revolutionary Path to Sharply Cut Financial Costs,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stablecoins-financial-costs/,"BitcoinWorld Stablecoins: Revolutionary Path to Sharply Cut Financial Costs The world of finance is constantly evolving, and at its forefront, Stablecoins and decentralized finance ( DeFi ) are emerging as powerful tools poised to dramatically reshape how we conduct transactions and access credit. Imagine a financial system where every dollar you spend or borrow carries significantly lower fees. This isn’t a distant dream; experts suggest it’s becoming a tangible reality, promising to alleviate immense economic friction within the global economy. How Stablecoins Reduce Economic Friction ? Jamie Coutts, the Chief Crypto Analyst at Real Vision, recently highlighted on X the immense potential of stablecoins. He posits that these digital assets, pegged to stable values like the US dollar, could eliminate trillions in economic friction that currently weigh down global commerce. This reduction in friction brings several compelling benefits: Boosting Merchant Profit Margins: By cutting down on traditional payment processing fees, businesses can retain a larger portion of their sales. Enabling New Value Transfers: Stablecoins facilitate micro-transactions and cross-border payments more efficiently and affordably than conventional methods. Accelerating Monetary Circulation: Faster and cheaper transactions mean money moves through the economy more rapidly, stimulating economic activity. This efficiency can unlock significant value, making commerce more fluid and profitable for everyone involved, directly addressing inherent financial costs . Can DeFi Sharply Cut Your Credit Costs ? Beyond stablecoins, the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem is also emerging as a major disruptor, particularly in the realm of credit. Coutts emphasized that DeFi is set to sharply reduce credit costs , citing supporting data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This shift promises more affordable borrowing options for individuals and businesses alike. Consider the tangible impact already visible in the United States. Blockchain providers are now offering home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) at rates more than 1% cheaper than those from traditional financial institutions. With an impressive $11 billion already outstanding in these blockchain-powered HELOCs, the market is clearly responding to these more competitive rates. What Global Economic Value Can We Unlock by Reducing Financial Costs ? The combined impact of stablecoins reducing transaction friction and DeFi lowering credit costs is truly monumental. Jamie Coutts estimates that this synergistic effect could unlock up to a staggering $1 trillion in global economic value each year. This isn’t just about saving a few dollars here and there; it’s about fundamentally reshaping the cost structure of global finance. Imagine the ripple effect: businesses can invest more, consumers have more disposable income, and capital can be deployed more efficiently across industries. The reduction in these inherent financial costs acts as a powerful stimulant for economic growth, fostering innovation and creating new opportunities worldwide. This innovative approach helps to mitigate overall economic friction . In conclusion, the insights from Jamie Coutts underscore a pivotal shift in the financial landscape. Stablecoins and DeFi are not just niche technologies; they are powerful engines capable of dismantling outdated, inefficient financial structures. By sharply reducing economic friction and credit costs , these innovations promise a future where finance is more accessible, affordable, and efficient for everyone. The journey towards unlocking trillions in economic value has truly begun, signaling a bright future for the global economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are stablecoins? Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically by being pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar or a commodity like gold. This stability makes them suitable for transactions, savings, and lending, avoiding the volatility often associated with other cryptocurrencies. Q2: How do stablecoins reduce economic friction? Stablecoins reduce economic friction by offering faster, cheaper, and more efficient payment processing compared to traditional banking systems. This leads to lower transaction fees for merchants, quicker settlement times, and easier cross-border transfers, boosting profit margins and accelerating monetary circulation. Q3: What is DeFi, and how does it lower credit costs? DeFi, or decentralized finance, refers to financial services built on blockchain technology that operate without traditional intermediaries like banks. DeFi platforms can lower credit costs by streamlining the lending process, reducing overheads, and fostering competition, leading to more competitive interest rates for borrowers. Q4: What is the estimated global economic impact of these innovations? According to Jamie Coutts, the combined impact of stablecoins and DeFi could unlock up to $1 trillion in global economic value each year. This is achieved by significantly reducing overall financial costs and improving the efficiency of capital flow. Q5: Are there real-world examples of DeFi reducing credit costs? Yes, in the U.S., blockchain providers are already offering home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) at rates more than 1% cheaper than traditional options, with billions of dollars already outstanding. This demonstrates a tangible reduction in credit costs for consumers. Did you find this analysis insightful?

The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value rose 3.6% to $124,457, during early Asian trading, crossing the previous peak set in July. Ether , the second-largest digital asset, also advanced, touching $4,780.04, its strongest level since late 2021. $BTC is now the 5th largest asset in the world by market cap, surpassing Google. $BTC – 2.456T $GOOG – 2.450T pic.twitter.com/THBXQsiXBR — CoinGecko (@coingecko) August 14, 2025 Trump Support, Rate-Cut Expectations Add Fuel to Bitcoin’s Climb Bitcoin has now gained nearly 32% in 2025, supported by regulatory wins for the crypto sector following President Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Trump, who calls himself the “crypto president,” and his family have deepened their involvement in the industry over the past year. Markets are almost fully pricing in a Fed rate cut on Sept. 17, reports show, with a small chance placed on a larger half-point reduction. Trump has been openly critical of Fed Chair Jerome Powell for holding rates steady for too long and has even threatened to remove him before his term ends in May. Adding to the speculation, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Wednesday that the Fed should deliver a “series of rate cuts” and could begin with a half-point move. Such policy shifts, analysts say, could provide further tailwinds for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Continued ETF inflows, supportive regulatory signals and strategic corporate moves have reignited the rally, paving the way for Bitcoin’s climb above its previous high of $123,091, registered on July 14, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin ETFs Hold Steady Amid Strong Weekly Inflows Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a daily net inflow of $86.91m on Aug. 13, according to SoSoValue data , bringing cumulative net inflows to $54.76b since launch. Total net assets for US spot Bitcoin ETFs now stand at $156.69b, representing about 6.48% of Bitcoin’s market cap. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust leads with $89.11b in net assets, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at $24.77b. The rise in inflows for Bitcoin ETFs points to a shift in institutional strategy, with large investors treating the two as complementary assets rather than rivals. The diversification helps mitigate asset-specific risks while allowing participation in the distinct growth narratives of each network. Institutional Interest in Bitcoin Remains Strong Alongside strong demand for Bitcoin ETFs, corporations and institutions are steadily expanding their BTC holdings. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net, a total of 3.65 million BTC is currently held by various entities, with the largest share in ETFs and other funds, followed by public companies, governments, private companies, DeFi/smart contracts, and exchanges/custodians. The site tracks 291 entities holding Bitcoin, an increase of 16 over the past 30 days. The United States leads with 99 entities, followed by Canada (43), the United Kingdom (20), Germany (10), and China (9). Source: BitcoinTreasuries.net Trump Administration Pushes Pro-Crypto Agenda The new ATH also comes as the Trump administration advanced its pro-crypto agenda last week with a series of policy and regulatory moves. President Trump signed an executive order urging regulators to remove barriers that prevent 401(k) plans from including alternative assets such as cryptocurrencies. If implemented, the reforms could allow millions of Americans to allocate retirement funds to Bitcoin and other digital assets through regulated channels. Trump also nominated economist Stephen Miran , a digital asset advocate, to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, signaling continuity in his administration’s pro-crypto stance. In a separate executive order, Trump moved to end “debanking” practices that target lawful crypto firms. The Blockchain Association praised the measures as a “historic shift” that would expand consumer choice, empower wealth-building, and reduce operational barriers for blockchain businesses. The SEC added to the positive momentum by clarifying that certain liquid staking models, such as those involving receipt tokens like stETH, are not securities. SEC Chair Paul Atkins reinforced his commitment to keeping crypto innovation in the US, pledging a proactive approach to regulation and a shift away from enforcement-led policymaking. Market Sentiment and Future Outlook Bitcoin market sentiment remains firmly in “Greed” territory, with the Fear & Greed Index currently at 75, according to data from Alternative.me as of Aug. 14. This marks a slight uptick from yesterday’s reading of 73 and a notable rise from last week’s 62, though it is up from last month’s “Greed” score of 73. Source: Alternative.me The index, which measures investor sentiment on a scale from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed), suggests continued optimism among traders despite recent market fluctuations. The index’s upward momentum over the past week reflects sustained buying interest and confidence in the broader crypto market, likely fueled by strong ETF inflows and institutional participation. While sentiment is not yet in the “Extreme Greed” zone, the current level signals that investors remain bullish, potentially increasing the risk of overbought conditions if the rally accelerates further.

The coin’s immediate support lies at $0.731. Short-term indicators show that buyers are intact, despite the slight pullback. Optimism 1-day price chart The daily chart for OP/USDT as of August 14 reveals a strong upward momentum that has carried the token from support levels around $0.700 to the current price of $0.853. The price is currently testing the upper Bollinger Band at $0.863, which has acted as immediate resistance and triggered the recent 2.40% decline. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The middle Bollinger Band sits at $0.731, providing dynamic support should any deeper correction materialize, while the lower band at $0.600 represents a significant floor that remains well below current trading levels. The MACD histogram shows positive momentum, indicating that the current bullish drive remains intact despite the slight pullback. Volume analysis through OBV at 943.35M suggests sustained buyer interest, though the recent red candle formation warns of potential short-term consolidation before the next big move. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour OP/USDT price chart, the Alligator indicator reveals all three lines in bullish alignment with the jaw at $0.792, teeth at $0.808, and lips at $0.822, confirming the underlying upward trend remains undisturbed. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView However, the RSI reading of 66.36 approaches the 70 threshold that typically signals overbought conditions, suggesting traders should exercise caution in the near term. The 24-hour volume of 65.56M shows healthy participation during the recent advance, though the formation of red candles after testing the $0.875 resistance level indicates profit-taking activity.

OP is set for consolidation between $0.822-$0.863 before targeting a breakout above $0.875 resistance toward $0.900. Strong volume and bullish Alligator alignment support this upward trajectory, though traders should wait for RSI to cool off before entering new positions. A break below $0.731 would trigger a deeper correction to $0.700 support. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

High crypto treasury fees might be silently eroding your potential long-term investor value , a crucial detail many overlook. This analysis delves into how these often-hidden costs can significantly impact your digital asset portfolio over time. What Are These High Crypto Treasury Fees Costing You? Firms managing digital assets for investors are frequently charging significant fees. Protos recently highlighted this issue, referencing an August 12 BitMEX Research paper. This research suggests these steep charges could steadily diminish the value promised to those holding for the long term. Consider Inflection Points Inc., an entity affiliated with Anthony Pompliano and trading under the BRR ticker. This firm entered a substantial $750 million initial deal. Its advisory fee structure is quite telling about how some crypto treasury fees are set up. The company receives 10 million shares, estimated by BitMEX Research to be about 5% of its total outstanding stock. Additionally, they claim 15% of any gains in Bitcoin’s price between the deal’s signing and completion. The remaining 85% goes to equity investors. This arrangement clearly impacts potential shareholder returns . How Do High Fees Affect Your Investor Value? Earlier this year, large crypto acquisitions saw investors paying heavy premiums for public companies in the space. However, the BitMEX report issues a stern warning: ongoing high crypto investment fees will weigh heavily on investor value and overall shareholder returns for years to come. This isn’t just about a one-time charge; it’s a continuous drain on your investment. Over time, these charges can compound, significantly reducing your ultimate financial gain. Understanding this compounding effect is vital for protecting your wealth. What Are the Challenges Posed by Steep Crypto Investment Fees? Reduced Gains: A significant portion of any appreciation in asset value is siphoned off by these fees, leaving less profit for the actual investor. Compounding Effect: Over extended periods, these fees compound, drastically reducing the final portfolio value. This hidden cost can be more damaging than many realize. Misaligned Interests: Some fee structures might inadvertently incentivize short-term gains for the managing firm rather than focusing on the sustained, long-term growth for investors. Safeguarding Your Long-Term Investor Value: What Can You Do? Understanding the fee structure before committing your capital is absolutely vital. Investors must scrutinize the fine print of any agreement. Being proactive can save you significant amounts in the long run. Actionable Insights for Investors: Read the Fine Print: Always understand all fees involved. This includes advisory, performance, management, and any potential exit fees. Transparency is key. Compare Providers: Don’t settle for the first option you encounter. Research and compare fee structures across different crypto treasury firms to find the most competitive and fair terms. Calculate Impact: Take the time to estimate how various fees will affect your projected returns over 5, 10, or even 20 years. This reveals the true cost of the service. Seek Transparency: Choose firms that are transparent about their fee models and provide clear performance calculations. A reputable firm will have nothing to hide. By taking these crucial steps, you can better protect your hard-earned capital and ensure that your long-term investor value isn’t quietly eroded by excessive charges. Your vigilance today can secure your financial future tomorrow. The hidden cost of high crypto treasury fees poses a significant threat to the promised investor value in the long run. As the crypto market matures, vigilance regarding fee structures becomes paramount for protecting your shareholder returns and ensuring your investments truly work for you. Don’t let excessive crypto investment fees diminish your financial future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are crypto treasury fees? Crypto treasury fees are charges levied by firms that manage digital assets or cryptocurrencies on behalf of investors. These can include advisory fees, performance fees, or a percentage of assets under management. How do high fees impact long-term investor value? High fees can significantly erode long-term investor value by reducing the net returns on investments. Over time, even small percentages can compound, leading to a substantial decrease in the total value of your crypto holdings and ultimately impacting your shareholder returns. Can you provide an example of such fees? Yes, for instance, a firm might charge an advisory fee in shares (e.g., 5% of outstanding stock) and also take a percentage of any gains (e.g., 15% of Bitcoin’s price appreciation), as seen with Inflection Points Inc. This directly reduces the profit for equity investors. What should investors do to protect their investments from excessive crypto investment fees? Investors should thoroughly read and understand all fee structures, compare charges across different providers, calculate the long-term impact of fees on their projected returns, and prioritize firms that offer clear and transparent fee models. Are these fees common in the crypto industry? While fee structures vary, the BitMEX Research paper highlighted that some crypto treasury firms are indeed charging steep fees. As the industry matures, investors must be more vigilant about these costs. Understanding the impact of crypto treasury fees is crucial for every investor.

According to CNBC data , the stock, trading under the ticker name BLSH, quickly attracted attention, reaching a halt at around $102.44 per share. This signals strong investor interest in the digital asset sector, as firms are increasingly flocking to go public under a new regulatory dawn in the US. Bullish Prices IPO Above Expectations Bullish priced its IPO significantly higher than the anticipated range of $32 to $33 earlier this week, and even above last week’s initial expectations of $28 to $31. This pricing strategy valued the company at approximately $5.4 billion before trading commenced. Bullish is led by former New York Stock Exchange President Tom Farley and backed by tech billionaire Peter Thiel, focusing on providing a crypto exchange platform tailored for institutional investors with the goal to merge decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols with the security of a centralized financial entity. In an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street,” Farley expressed optimism about the future of institutional investment in cryptocurrency . He noted that while the previous decade saw retail investors dominate the market, the tide is shifting. “The institutional wave has begun,” Farley further stated during the interview, emphasizing the significant reception the exchange has received during its initial public offering process. Resurgence Of Crypto IPOs Bullish’s debut comes amid a favorable regulatory environment under President Donald Trump’s administration, which has encouraged other companies to pursue public listings. For instance, stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) recently made a successful stock market entry, raising over $1 billion. The stablecoin issuer also saw its CRCL stock rise over 168% in its first day on the NYSE back in June. Other firms, including Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital and the trading app eToro, have also transitioned to Nasdaq, further contributing to a resurgence in crypto-related IPOs . Companies like BitGo and Gemini are also preparing to file for US listings. Despite the excitement surrounding its public offering, Bullish reported a significant loss of $349 million for the quarter ending March 31, a stark contrast to the $105 million profit recorded in the same quarter the previous year. Alongside Bullish’s IPO, World Liberty Financial (WLFI) celebrated the closing of a $1.5 billion offering at the Nasdaq MarketSite in Times Square on Wednesday. The event was marked by the ringing of the Opening Bell, attended by key figures including Zach Witkoff, Co-Founder and CEO of World Liberty Financial, and President Trump’s son Eric Trump .

At the time of writing, ETH trades at $4,662, putting it within range of the $4,750–$4,800 resistance zone that has historically marked a key supply area for the market. This price move coincides with unprecedented network activity and notable on-chain flows that analysts say could influence the short-term price direction. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Once-In-A Decade Bull Signal, Says Analyst Ethereum Record Network Activity Meets Price Resistance Data from CryptoQuant contributor CryptoOnchain shows that daily Ethereum transactions have reached a record high of approximately 1.875 million. This surge in activity signals elevated demand for block space and heightened engagement across the network. The confluence of strong on-chain metrics with a critical price level creates a technical and fundamental intersection that could determine Ethereum’s next move. According to CryptoOnchain, Ethereum’s current position represents a decision point. A breakout above $4,750, accompanied by sustained transaction volume, could propel ETH into a price discovery phase, potentially surpassing its historical peak. Conversely, if sellers defend this level, a consolidation phase or a retracement toward the $3,950 support area is possible. The analyst also cautioned that while peak network activity often accompanies bullish price action, it can also signal a near-term overheating of the market. In such cases, even with strong fundamentals, prices may pause or retrace as participants adjust their positions. This dynamic is particularly relevant as Ethereum tests a historically significant resistance zone while network usage is at an all-time high. Exchange Outflows Suggest Continued Buying Pressure In a separate analysis, another CryptoQuant analyst, Burak Kesmeci, examined Ethereum’s net flow data across all exchanges. Using the 30-day simple moving average (SMA30), Kesmeci found that ETH net flows remain in strongly negative territory, at around –40,000 ETH as of August 12, 2025. This represents an average daily outflow of 40,000 ETH over the past month, a trend that has coincided with the asset’s recent price increase. Negative net flows indicate that more ETH is leaving exchanges than entering, often interpreted as a sign of reduced immediate selling pressure and increased holding behavior. Kesmeci linked the recent outflow strength to spot ETH ETF activity, suggesting that institutional demand has been a major factor supporting prices. He noted that as long as the SMA30 stays in negative territory, the upward trend is likely to continue. A shift into positive territory, however, could signal a change in market sentiment and potentially weaken buying momentum.

The price has repeatedly approached $120K in recent weeks. However, things are starting to look a little stagnant. Every higher break attempt has attracted new interest from traders, but caution is showing more frequently in the market. Global liquidity conditions are having a greater effect than many anticipated, and this has created divisions in the market. An aggressive move out of here can be a precursor to the next large rally or the beginning of the next pullback. Amidst this, MAGACOIN is silently gaining its own wave in trading circles. MAGACOIN is being mentioned increasingly on the trader chat and watchlists. Early purchasers appear to be keen on reserving slots when the project is still at its initial phases. Investors may use code EXTRA50X to claim a 50% EXTRA BONUS. Global Liquidity Change Signals Market Strain According to market analysts, fluctuations in world liquidity tend to play a critical part in the price movements of Bitcoin. Risk assets like Bitcoin tend to attract capital inflow when central banks flood the market with new money. The rise in Bitcoin in earlier cycles occurred during times of liquidity expansion. Bitcoin Tests $120K With Mixed Signals Crypto market analyst Crypto Patel notes that Bitcoin is now trading at less than its ATH at $119.6K. The daily chart has seen several reversals of rejections at this point, which makes it a notable resistance region. Patel thinks that a daily close above $120K could provide a path to $150K. Nevertheless, he cautions that a third rejection could drive the price to the demand zone of around $111K. He states that the value that will determine the short-term and macro direction of Bitcoin is $120K. Bitcoin is currently trading at $119,660 with a 24-hour trading volume of over $48.5 billion. The change is a 0.81% increase in the last 24 hours and a 5.34% increase in the last 7 days. The market mood is still split. There are those traders who think that greater liquidity will be required to see a breakout, and some who feel the move will occur despite the lack of liquidity due to buying pressure at these levels. Conclusion The historical trends indicate that Bitcoin might rally to $150K earlier than anticipated if global liquidity turns positive. Currently, the $120K price point is one to watch. A breach above $120k will allow BTC to hit the $150k target. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN is continuously staking its claim as one to watch in an evolving market landscape.

Billions of fresh capital are potentially setting the stage for increased trading activity and asset appreciation. USDT and USDC’s combined growth means investors are positioning for further upside across the crypto market. Billions in Fiat Pour Tether’s USDT saw its market cap climb from $120 billion before the US election in November 2024, when Donald Trump secured a victory, to the current $165 billion, according to data shared by Matrixport. During the same period, Circle’s USDC leaped from $34 billion to $65 billion. This $76 billion influx of fiat into crypto through just two stablecoins is indicative of a renewed investor confidence as major political and economic events approach. The pace of growth, closely following the improving regulatory clarity, points to the early stages of a potentially transformative trend. These inflows strengthen the industry’s liquidity base and position stablecoins as a crucial driver of crypto’s next phase of expansion. The passage of the GENIUS Act has been crucial in catalyzing this growth trajectory. Signed into law by President Trump on July 18, this legislation represented the first major cryptocurrency regulation passed by Congress. The act aims to establish a clear regulatory framework for payment stablecoins. As a result, many financial companies in the US are gearing up to launch their own dollar-backed crypto tokens. Circle Goes Public, Tether Won’t With regulatory frameworks now in place and billions flowing into the sector, major stablecoin players are making bold moves to capitalize. For instance, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, Circle, has made headlines following its June IPO, which raised approximately $1.2 billion at an offering price of $31 per share. In its first quarterly earnings report as a public company, revenue and reserve income surged 53% year-over-year to $658 million, beating expectations. Despite a considerable net loss of $482 million driven by IPO-related non-cash charges, Circle’s stock rallied significantly to around $163, which is more than five times its debut price. The company also announced plans to roll out its Arc Layer 1 blockchain later this year to further boost stablecoin utility across payments, capital markets, and FX. Its rival stablecoin issuer, Tether, on the other hand, has no intention of going public.

As Asia FX Performance strengthens and major global currencies experience shifts, understanding these dynamics becomes crucial for every investor, including those deeply entrenched in digital assets. Significant movements in the US Dollar or the Japanese Yen can ripple through global liquidity, impacting everything from commodity prices to investor risk appetite, ultimately influencing the flows into and out of the crypto market. What exactly is driving these shifts, and what do they mean for your portfolio? Unveiling Strong Asia FX Performance Recent market movements have highlighted a notable firming of Asian currencies, a trend that signals shifting investor sentiment and economic recalibration. This resilience in Asia FX Performance is largely attributed to a combination of factors, including improved regional economic outlooks, robust trade balances, and, significantly, the broader weakening of the US Dollar. As the prospect of interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve becomes more concrete, capital flows are beginning to re-enter Asian markets, seeking higher yields and growth opportunities. Currencies like the Korean Won (KRW), Singapore Dollar (SGD), New Taiwan Dollar (TWD), and Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) have shown particular strength, reflecting confidence in their respective economies. For investors, this trend in Asian currencies can create attractive carry trade opportunities, where one borrows in a low-interest-rate currency (like the Yen historically) and invests in a higher-yielding one. However, the dynamics are complex, as even within Asia, individual country fundamentals and central bank policies play a critical role. The collective strength, nevertheless, points to a broader narrative of diversification away from the dollar. Understanding the Accelerating Dollar Decline A pivotal force behind the recent shifts in global currency markets is the accelerating Dollar Decline . The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar against a basket of major currencies, has been under significant pressure. This weakening is primarily driven by mounting expectations that the US Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in the near future. Recent economic data, including cooling inflation figures and a softening labor market, have reinforced these bets, prompting traders to price in multiple rate cuts throughout the year. Why is this significant? When a central bank cuts rates, it typically reduces the attractiveness of holding that currency, as investors can earn less on their deposits and fixed-income investments. This makes other currencies, especially those from regions with stable or potentially rising rates, more appealing. The “higher for longer” narrative, which had underpinned dollar strength for much of the past year, appears to be fading, paving the way for a more balanced global currency landscape. This shift has profound implications, not just for forex traders but also for commodity prices, as a weaker dollar generally makes dollar-denominated goods cheaper for international buyers, potentially boosting demand. Consider the following key drivers of the dollar’s recent trajectory: Fed Rate Cut Expectations: Market participants are increasingly confident that the Federal Reserve will initiate rate cuts, possibly as early as the first half of the year. Inflation Data: Persistent signs of disinflation reduce the urgency for the Fed to maintain restrictive monetary policy. Economic Growth Concerns: While the US economy has shown resilience, some indicators suggest a slowdown, prompting a dovish pivot from the central bank. Yield Differentials: As US bond yields fall in anticipation of rate cuts, the yield advantage of holding dollar assets diminishes relative to other currencies. The Remarkable Yen Rebound and BOJ Policy Shift Perhaps one of the most compelling narratives in the current forex market is the remarkable Yen Rebound . For years, the Japanese Yen (JPY) has been one of the weakest major currencies, largely due to the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) ultra-loose monetary policy, including negative interest rates and yield curve control (YCC). However, speculation is now rife that the BOJ is on the cusp of a historic policy shift, potentially ending negative rates and adjusting its YCC program. What’s fueling this speculation? Recent comments from BOJ officials, rising wage growth in Japan, and increasing inflationary pressures are all pointing towards a normalization of monetary policy. A decision by the BOJ to raise rates, even marginally, would be a monumental shift, marking the end of an era of unconventional easing. This prospect has ignited strong buying interest in the Yen, as investors anticipate a significant increase in its yield attractiveness. The implications of a BOJ Policy Shift are far-reaching: End of Negative Rates: This would be a symbolic and practical change, increasing the cost of borrowing and potentially boosting domestic demand. Impact on Carry Trades: A stronger Yen makes carry trades (borrowing JPY to invest elsewhere) less profitable and riskier, potentially unwinding some of these positions and leading to JPY repatriation. Global Liquidity: As the Yen strengthens, it could affect global liquidity, especially if Japanese investors bring capital home. Inflation Management: The BOJ aims to achieve stable 2% inflation, and a rate hike would signal confidence in reaching this target sustainably. The market is closely watching upcoming BOJ meetings for definitive signals, as any concrete move would likely send the Yen soaring further, impacting everything from global equity markets to commodity prices. Global Rate Cut Bets: A New Era for Markets? Beyond the specific dynamics of the US Dollar and Japanese Yen, the overarching theme driving currency markets is the widespread expectation of Global Rate Cut Bets . Major central banks, including the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BoE), are also signaling a potential pivot towards monetary easing. This synchronized shift from a tightening cycle to an easing cycle marks a significant turning point for financial markets worldwide. The anticipation of lower borrowing costs fuels optimism across various asset classes. Lower interest rates generally reduce the cost of capital for businesses, encourage investment, and can boost consumer spending. This environment is typically supportive of risk assets, including equities and, importantly, cryptocurrencies. When traditional fixed-income investments offer lower returns, investors often seek higher-yielding or growth-oriented alternatives, which can include digital assets. However, the timing and magnitude of these cuts remain a subject of intense debate and depend heavily on incoming economic data. Any deviation from market expectations could introduce volatility. Key factors influencing these bets include: Inflation Trends: Sustained declines in inflation are a prerequisite for central banks to ease policy. Economic Activity: Evidence of slowing economic growth or recessionary pressures can accelerate the timeline for cuts. Labor Markets: Weakening employment figures often prompt central banks to consider stimulus measures. Geopolitical Stability: Major global events can disrupt economic forecasts and central bank plans. The narrative is shifting from combating inflation to supporting growth, and this paradigm shift is reshaping investor strategies across the board. Navigating the Evolving Forex Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities While the current environment presents compelling opportunities, it is not without its challenges. The forex market, by its nature, is subject to high volatility, and rapid shifts in sentiment can lead to significant price swings. For investors, understanding these nuances is critical. The interplay between interest rate differentials, economic growth prospects, and geopolitical developments creates a complex web of influences. Challenges to Consider: Central Bank Communication: Any miscommunication or unexpected policy move from major central banks can trigger sharp market reactions. Geopolitical Risks: Ongoing global conflicts and political uncertainties can introduce sudden risk-off sentiment, impacting currency flows. Data Dependency: Economic data releases (inflation, GDP, employment) are paramount, and any surprises can alter rate cut expectations dramatically. Unwinding Carry Trades: A stronger Yen, for instance, could lead to a rapid unwinding of carry trades, causing turbulence in other currencies. Actionable Insights for Investors: Diversify Portfolios: Consider exposure to a basket of currencies rather than concentrating on one, especially with the dollar’s uncertain path. Monitor Central Bank Statements: Stay updated on speeches and minutes from the Fed, BOJ, ECB, and other major central banks. Track Economic Indicators: Pay close attention to inflation, employment, and GDP data from major economies. Assess Risk Appetite: Understand how shifting interest rate environments impact overall market risk appetite and its potential spillover into digital assets. The current forex landscape demands a proactive and informed approach. Investors who grasp these macro trends will be better positioned to navigate the opportunities and mitigate the risks. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Global Currencies The global currency market is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by evolving central bank policies and shifting economic fundamentals. The firming of Asia FX Performance , the accelerating Dollar Decline , and the remarkable Yen Rebound , spurred by an anticipated BOJ Policy Shift , all underscore a broader narrative of Global Rate Cut Bets . This collective movement suggests a potential new era for financial markets, one characterized by easing monetary conditions and a potential resurgence of risk assets. While opportunities abound, vigilance remains key, as central bank actions and economic data will continue to dictate the pace and direction of these powerful currency trends. Staying informed about these macro shifts is not just for forex traders; it’s essential for anyone seeking to understand the broader currents shaping the investment world, including the volatile realm of cryptocurrencies.

It instructs federal agencies to accelerate approvals for launch and reentry, a step expected to benefit the broader industry and SpaceX, led by former ally Elon Musk. According to a White House fact sheet , the measure directs the Secretary of Transportation to review federal requirements and cut “outdated, redundant, or overly restrictive rules for launch and reentry vehicles.” The aim is to speed licensing while preserving safety for operators and the public. Trump also told the department to “reevaluate, amend, or rescind” Part 450, the Federal Aviation Administration regulation that governs commercial launch licenses. Though intended to simplify approvals, many in the industry say the framework has become cumbersome and confusing. Trump’s new order could affect SpaceX directly How the order is implemented could directly affect SpaceX, now among the world’s most frequent launch providers, as it readies further test flights of its Starship system. Musk and Trump were once aligned, before a public spat reported by Cryptopolitan , that followed Musk’s criticism of the president’s tax-and-spending package. Officials emphasized that the directive extends beyond any single company. It could also assist other operators, such as Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin LLC, United Launch Alliance LLC, and Rocket Lab, as they look to scale up operations. Part 450 dates to Trump’s first term, when the administration sought to streamline commercial launch licenses. The rule allows a firm to obtain one license that covers multiple missions of the same vehicle, provided it meets performance-based safety benchmarks and conditions set by regulators. SpaceX urged Washington to revise those provisions, arguing that the FAA’s implementation has not matched the original intent. In a September 2024 post on its website, the company wrote: “We continue to be stuck in a reality where it takes longer to do the government paperwork to license a rocket launch than it does to design and build the actual hardware.” Another component of the order would make the head of the FAA’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation a political appointee, increasing White House influence over how licensing priorities are set and carried out as the agency oversees commercial spaceflight. The directive also elevates the Office of Space Commerce, currently within NOAA, to report directly to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Supporters say the shift would raise the profile of commercial space issues within the department and improve coordination. Further instructions ask the Transportation Secretary to work with the chair of the Council of Environmental Quality to shorten or fast-track environmental reviews tied to launch and reentry operations. Criticism from environmental advocates is expected That change could prompt pushback from environmental groups and concerns about protecting launch ranges and nearby habitats in coastal states such as Florida, California, and Texas. The order creates a new position at the Transportation Department to advise on innovation and deregulation, and calls for an “Associate Administrator for Commercial Space Transportation” at the FAA to lead regulatory reforms. It also tells departments to assess whether states are hindering spaceport construction under the Coastal Zone Management Act, and to align procedures to reduce overlapping rules and speed spaceport projects. Lastly, the order requires a “streamlined process for authorizing novel space activities,” defined as missions not covered by existing regulatory systems. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

This event highlights the critical importance of robust security measures in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. It serves as a stark reminder that even industry leaders face unique challenges in maintaining ironclad crypto security . What Exactly Happened with the Coinbase Smart Contract ? Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, recently incurred a loss of approximately $300,000. This wasn’t a hack in the traditional sense, but rather a consequence of a misconfigured Coinbase smart contract approval. Essentially, Coinbase’s internal systems mistakenly granted approval for token transfers to the 0x Project’s “swapper” contract. This particular contract is not designed to handle such approvals and, unfortunately, proved vulnerable to exploitation. The Block initially reported on this development. A security researcher from Venn Network, known as “deeberiroz” on X (formerly Twitter), quickly identified that a maximal extractable value (MEV) bot capitalized on this misconfiguration. The bot efficiently drained tokens from Coinbase’s fee receiver account, demonstrating the speed and precision with which these automated entities operate in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Understanding the MEV Bot Exploit and Its Impact Many people wonder, “What exactly is an MEV bot exploit ?” In simple terms, MEV bots are automated programs that look for profitable opportunities on blockchain networks by reordering, inserting, or censoring transactions within a block. In this case, the bot detected the misconfigured approval on the 0x swapper contract and swiftly executed transactions to extract the available tokens. This rapid response is a hallmark of an MEV bot exploit, showcasing their ability to react instantly to on-chain vulnerabilities. This event serves as a prime example of a decentralized exchange incident , even though it involved Coinbase’s corporate DEX wallet. It underscores the inherent complexities and potential pitfalls in managing interactions with various smart contracts across different protocols. While the incident was contained, it offered a glimpse into the sophisticated methods employed by automated agents to capitalize on network inefficiencies or configuration errors. Was Customer Wallet Security Compromised? Perhaps the most crucial question for many users is regarding the safety of their funds. Coinbase Chief Security Officer Philip Martin promptly addressed these concerns, confirming that the incident was entirely isolated. He emphasized that the loss was limited to a corporate decentralized exchange (DEX) wallet, meaning customer funds were not impacted . This assurance is vital for maintaining user trust in the platform’s ability to protect assets. Martin also detailed the swift resolution actions taken by Coinbase. These included: Revoking allowances: Immediately removing the problematic approvals granted to the 0x swapper contract. Moving assets: Transferring remaining assets from the compromised corporate wallet to a new, secure wallet. These decisive steps were critical in containing the breach and preventing further losses, showcasing effective wallet security protocols in action post-incident. Crucial Lessons for Enhancing Crypto Security The Coinbase incident, while contained, provides valuable lessons for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem regarding crypto security . It highlights several key areas where projects and users alike must remain vigilant: Rigorous Smart Contract Audits: Before deployment or interaction, all smart contracts, especially those handling approvals or funds, must undergo thorough and independent security audits. Careful Approval Management: Users and platforms should regularly review and revoke unnecessary token allowances granted to smart contracts. This minimizes the attack surface. Proactive Monitoring: Continuous, real-time monitoring of blockchain transactions and contract interactions can help detect and respond to unusual activity quickly. Understanding DeFi Risks: Engaging with decentralized protocols requires a deep understanding of their unique risks, including potential interactions with MEV bots and smart contract vulnerabilities. This event reinforces the idea that even the most established entities are not immune to the complexities of decentralized technology. These lessons are vital for enhancing overall crypto security within the industry. It serves as a reminder that vigilance and continuous improvement in security practices are paramount for everyone involved in the crypto space. In conclusion, the Coinbase incident involving a misconfigured Coinbase smart contract approval led to a $300,000 loss from a corporate wallet. However, prompt action ensured customer funds remained safe. This event underscores the ever-present need for robust crypto security measures, meticulous smart contract management, and a keen awareness of automated exploits like the MEV bot exploit in the evolving world of decentralized finance. It’s a testament to the resilience of the ecosystem when such a decentralized exchange incident is swiftly contained, reinforcing the importance of continuous vigilance for all aspects of wallet security . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What was the cause of Coinbase’s $300,000 loss? A1: Coinbase incurred a $300,000 loss due to a misconfigured smart contract approval, which mistakenly allowed transfers to the 0x Project’s “swapper” contract, a contract not designed for such approvals. Q2: Were Coinbase customer funds affected by this incident? A2: No, Coinbase Chief Security Officer Philip Martin confirmed that the incident was isolated to a corporate decentralized exchange (DEX) wallet and did not impact customer funds. Q3: What is an MEV bot exploit? A3: An MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) bot exploit occurs when automated programs detect and capitalize on profitable opportunities on blockchain networks, such as misconfigured smart contract approvals, by quickly executing transactions to extract value. Q4: How did Coinbase resolve the smart contract issue? A4: Coinbase resolved the issue by promptly revoking the problematic allowances granted to the 0x swapper contract and moving the affected assets from the compromised corporate wallet to a new, secure wallet. Q5: What lessons can be learned from this Coinbase incident for crypto security?

Gas fees, swap fees, bridge fees, they all pile up and add friction to every transaction. Early adopters might shrug it off, but for the next billion users, those costs are a dealbreaker. Cold Wallet (CWT) is built on a straightforward idea: if crypto is going to scale, wallets can’t act like silent tax collectors. They need to give back. CWT’s answer is a cashback model that returns part of the gas, swap, and bridge fees to users in CWT tokens, creating a loop where activity funds more activity. Why Cashback Could Be the Key to Real Adoption Every major industry that has reached mass adoption, from credit cards to online retail, has relied on incentives to keep customers coming back. Rewards programs aren’t just nice extras, they shape behavior. In crypto, where price swings already test user confidence, adding a steady and predictable reward transforms every transaction into a positive experience. Cold Wallet makes this happen without staking, lockups, or complex steps. Just connect, transact, and watch CWT flow back into your wallet. The more you use it, the more you earn, and the more likely you are to stay engaged. This creates a retention loop that strengthens the network. Users keep participating, the ecosystem grows, and value compounds over time. The Plus Wallet Acquisition: Jumpstarting the User Base Normally, building a large enough user base to make a rewards system viable takes years. Cold Wallet bypassed that timeline by acquiring Plus Wallet for $270 million. That deal instantly brought in over 2 million active users. This isn’t just buying infrastructure, it’s securing a ready-made audience. At launch, Cold Wallet won’t be searching for its first users, it will already be rewarding them. Plus Wallet’s existing framework fits neatly into Cold Wallet’s self-custody design, enhanced by the cashback model. It means the usual post-launch “dead zone” that drains most new projects is effectively eliminated. Cold Wallet is active from day one. Presale Entry with a Clear ROI Map Cold Wallet’s presale structure offers complete transparency on returns. The launch price is fixed at $0.3517, and the presale is divided into 150 stages, each with a higher price. Stage 17, the current phase, is at $0.00998, a 3,423% gain to launch for anyone getting in now. This isn’t a hopeful projection, it’s built into the tokenomics. With $5.9 million already raised and 701 million tokens sold, investors are clearly backing the model. What makes this even more compelling is that the token’s value is tied to a live and expanding utility base, not just hype. Every cashback reward boosts retention, and every retained user increases the long-term value of the ecosystem. Why Retention Matters More Than Headlines Crypto has spent years chasing big “user count” milestones, but without retention, those numbers mean little. Sustainable growth comes from keeping users active, and Cold Wallet’s model makes that part of the experience. By refunding participation costs, it turns a point of friction into a reason to engage. Gas fees become opportunities to earn. That’s a major shift in how users see the product. And with the Plus Wallet base in place, millions will experience that from day one. The loop is simple: transact, earn CWT, reinvest in more activity, earn more CWT. Crypto adoption hasn’t stalled because of a lack of innovation. It’s stalled because the average user feels the system isn’t built for them. Complexity, risk, and high costs keep people out. Cold Wallet addresses all three: it’s user-friendly, it’s a working product, and it financially rewards continued participation. While much of the market chases hype cycles, Cold Wallet focuses on function. The Plus Wallet acquisition accelerates adoption, the cashback model keeps users, and the presale gives early supporters a clear ROI path. The Takeaway Crypto’s big moment won’t come from marketing alone. It will come when staying in the ecosystem makes more sense than leaving. Cold Wallet’s approach, turning unavoidable fees into ongoing rewards, offers a realistic and scalable way to get there. At $0.00998 in Stage 17, with a 3,423% ROI locked in to launch and a ready-made base of 2 million users, CWT combines adoption strategy with attractive entry economics. The $5.9 million already committed shows the market sees the potential. The real question is whether you will be holding tokens when this audience goes live.

Layer 1 projects are expanding their use cases, altcoins are testing crucial resistance levels, and meme coins continue to rake in significant trading volumes. A new wave of opportunities is emerging for those paying close attention. BlockDAG is leading the charge, offering a 30x return potential with just days left in its presale. At the same time, Filecoin is making a strong comeback with a massive surge in trading volume, Litecoin is showing strong technical indicators, and PEPE remains a dominant force in the meme coin market. For those narrowing down their picks for top altcoins to buy in 2025, this mix of utility-driven platforms, tech-focused protocols, and viral tokens offers a snapshot of where the market is gaining momentum. Let’s dive into these top contenders. 1. BlockDAG: Unlocking 30x ROI & Utility BlockDAG is making waves as one of the top altcoins to buy in 2025, and the chance to get in early is almost over. With its current presale price at just $0.0016 per BDAG and a confirmed listing price of $0.05, early buyers are looking at a 3,025% ROI, which is a potential 30x return. And this opportunity isn’t just based on speculation. BlockDAG has raised over $373 million and sold 25 billion coins, attracting more than 200,000 holders. Unlike typical presales, BlockDAG already has a working product. Its Demo Trading Dashboard (V4) is live, allowing users to simulate trades, view live price charts, and get a feel for the system before the token hits exchanges. Additionally, 2.5 million users have downloaded the X1 mobile miner app, and 19,000 ASIC miners have been sold in preparation for the mainnet launch. With the $0.0016 price soon to be a thing of the past, BlockDAG is a top altcoin for 2025 for those seeking high-growth potential with an already functioning product. Don’t miss this opportunity before it takes off. 2. Filecoin: Institutional Interest Fuels 2025 Surge Filecoin has quietly positioned itself as a solid pick for the top altcoins to buy in 2025, particularly for those focused on decentralized storage and Web3 infrastructure. Over the past five days, FIL’s trading volume surged by 176%, reaching approximately $270 million, signaling a rising interest in the network. The token briefly dipped below its $2.38 support level, but this correction triggered substantial institutional trading. As of the latest reports, FIL has rebounded to $2.49, reflecting a 4.3% daily gain. While there have been no major mining updates, this increase in price and volume indicates renewed optimism in Filecoin’s role in decentralized storage. This type of quiet accumulation and price volatility typically precedes significant moves, especially for technically solid projects like Filecoin. As blockchain-based storage becomes increasingly essential for AI and decentralized infrastructure platforms, FIL could be a key player among the top altcoins to buy in 2025. 3. Litecoin: Prepping for Breakout With Strong Indicators Litecoin may not steal the headlines like some of the latest meme coins, but it’s showing the kind of technical strength that savvy traders are closely watching. With a trading price around $122 and daily volume hitting $1.15 billion, LTC is steadily climbing with bullish signals across major technical indicators. Out of 17 key indicators, 12 are signaling a “buy,” and analysts are watching for a breakout above $129.28. If this happens, price targets of $134.51 and even $139 are within reach. Some models even predict a rise to $202 by year-end. Litecoin remains one of the most widely used and tested networks in the crypto world. With low fees, strong network hash power, and growing adoption, Litecoin stands as a stable yet potentially explosive option among the top altcoins to buy in 2025. 4. PEPE: The Meme Coin with Staying Power Whether loved or loathed, PEPE continues to dominate the meme coin space, and its consistent presence proves that meme coins are far from fading away. With a price around $0.00001107 and daily volume surpassing $753 million, PEPE is one of the most traded tokens in the market. Although its 7-day return of 4.8% lags behind the broader market’s 5.4% and Ethereum’s 12.7% return, PEPE maintains its position due to a dedicated fanbase and strong social buzz. While it may not perform as well in the short term, PEPE’s staying power and massive liquidity pool position it as one of the top altcoins to buy in 2025 for those willing to take on higher risk for potential rewards. For many, the appeal of PEPE isn’t just about profits; it’s part of a larger cultural movement. As the meme economy evolves, PEPE could see significant upside as it remains one of the most engaging and talked-about projects. Which Is The Top Altcoin to Buy Now? As we look to the next wave of growth in the crypto space, a few projects stand out as top altcoins to buy in 2025. BlockDAG’s presale momentum, real-time trading tools, and strong $1.1M Bitcoin incentive pool set it apart as an early-stage opportunity with solid fundamentals. Meanwhile, Filecoin’s increased trading volume and decentralized storage utility, Litecoin’s steady growth and breakout potential, and PEPE’s cultural relevance in the meme coin economy provide a diverse range of opportunities. Each of these projects offers unique value, from technical strength and adoption to cultural impact and upside potential. If you’re building your 2025 portfolio, these assets should be on your radar. The next crypto bull run is already forming, and now is the time to position yourself for what could be a big year ahead.

The announcement, however, was met with a swift and negative reaction from investors, resulting in a significant drop in the company’s stock price. First Crypto Treasury Focusing On World Liberty Financial ALT5 Sigma, which trades on Nasdaq under the ticker name “ATLS”, aims to raise $1.5 billion to become the first publicly traded company to hold WLFI, the governance token associated with World Liberty Financial. In a press release dated August 11, the company disclosed that it plans to raise these funds through a registered direct offering and a private placement, which will involve selling up to 100 million shares at a price of $7.50 each. Related Reading: Analyst Says What Happened With Bitcoin Is About To Happen With XRP Notably, the private placement will be conducted using WLFI tokens, which are currently non-transferable and will be treated as an over-the-counter (OTC) transaction. In its regulatory filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), ALT5 Sigma stated that acquiring WLFI directly from World Liberty Financial is currently the only option, as the tokens remain locked and cannot be traded. The filing also warned that if the company fails to acquire the tokens on favorable terms or at all, it may impair its ability to execute its digital asset treasury strategy, potentially requiring a reallocation of assets within the treasury. ALT5 Sigma Shares Plunge 26% Prior to the announcement with World Liberty Financial, ALT5 Sigma’s shares had been performing well, nearing $20 in pre-market trading and more than doubling in value. However, the news of the treasury plans reversed this momentum dramatically. By the close of trading on Monday, shares had plummeted by 26.42%, settling at $6.60. As of the latest reports, ALT5’s stock continues to hover around $6, reflecting a decline of about 10% over the past week. With the treasury acquisition, Zach Witkoff, co-founder of World Liberty Financial, is set to become ALT5’s chairman. Eric Trump, another WLFI co-founder, will join the board as a director. Additionally, Zak Folkman, also a co-founder, will serve as a board observer, while Matt Morgan, CEO of Blockstreet, will take on the role of chief investment officer. Related Reading: Ethereum Retail Mood Still Bearish: Perfect Setup For ATH Break? It’s important to note that the WLFI token, designed as a non-tradeable governance token, was launched in October 2024, with a subsequent announcement of a USD1 stablecoin in March. In mid-July, World Liberty Financial holders voted to allow the token to become tradable, facilitating peer-to-peer transactions and secondary market activity. However, for now, the movement of tokens remains limited, with trade eligibility constrained to a select group of early supporters.

Ethereum has surged close to record highs, Avalanche is building momentum, and traders are watching key resistance levels. Whale investors, always looking for the next opportunity, are beginning to shift their attention to fresh opportunities outside the top-tier names. One such project making waves is MAGACOIN FINANCE — a fast-emerging token that’s gaining traction as a potential breakout in the months ahead. Ethereum Breaks Out Toward Record Territory Ethereum has been on fire, up nearly 27% in the past week and 7% in the past 24 hours alone. Pricing hit $4,670 before correcting slightly to $4,620, with ETH coming in just about 5% off its all-time high of $4,878. Analyst Ted has stated that ETH is poised to break out of a four-year lateral trend. He pointed out that the last time Ethereum broke out like this was when it returned a spectacular 20x in one year. While past performance may not be an assurance of the same, it has raised discussions concerning ambitious Ethereum price prediction 2025 goals, from a $10,000 ETH in the next cycle. This new energy has returned Ethereum to the limelight, one of the best altcoin to buy for those interested in both short-term runs and long-term perspective. Avalanche Targets Higher Levels After Technical Break Avalanche has also closed the gap with a strong rally from a seven-day low of $21 to $25, an 8% rise in 24 hours. As analyst Carl Moon pointed out , AVAX has formed a potential broadening wedge pattern on the one-hour chart with a short-term target of around $26.5. On a bigger level, the traders seek a possible extension that can result in much bigger movements. AVAX has been gaining traction over time, and this formation has some investors looking at it as one of the best altcoins to purchase 2025. With the technical context coming together and good Avalanche crypto news driving sentiment, there is increased speculation regarding the next Avalanche price prediction. Others view the $80 target as longer-term potential should momentum be sustained and the overall market conditions be supportive. Investor Demand for MAGACOIN FINANCE Accelerates as Allocations Rapidly Diminish While Ethereum and Avalanche dominate headlines, a quiet shift is happening beneath the surface. Strategic whale capital — large, sophisticated investors with significant buying power — has started moving into MAGACOIN FINANCE. Interest in the project has surged in recent weeks, with token allocations reportedly being taken up at a much faster pace than anticipated. This demand is being driven by a combination of its growth-focused roadmap, strong community engagement, and the perception that it could deliver outsized returns compared to established players. Whales tend to position themselves early in assets they believe will see a quick value climb. In the case of MAGACOIN FINANCE, the appeal lies in its positioning as a high-potential contender in a market where traders are hunting for the best altcoin to buy now before wider public adoption kicks in. This trend of allocation tightening has caught the attention of smaller investors, who are beginning to weigh it alongside other top altcoins to buy 2025. The narrative around MAGACOIN FINANCE has shifted from being a “project to watch” to something that may require quick action to secure a stake. Final Thought Ethereum and Avalanche are proving that major altcoins still have plenty of life in them, breaking through resistance levels and setting the stage for potentially bigger moves ahead. Traders are watching closely for confirmation of breakouts that could lead to significant gains, with Ethereum news today and Avalanche crypto news driving fresh optimism. At the same time, strategic capital is flowing into newer opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. This suggests that the next market leaders may not be the same as the last cycle. For those scanning the market for the best crypto to buy now, the combination of established strength in ETH and AVAX alongside emerging momentum in MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a compelling mix of options for 2025.

50064792,555945,1755147654,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50064792.jpeg,"A16z, DeFi Education Fund Propose SEC ‘Safe Harbor’ For DApps Developers",https://bitcoinist.com/a16z-defi-education-fund-propose-sec-safe-harbor/,"Venture Capital (VC) firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and nonprofit research and advocacy organization DeFi Education Fund (DEF) have jointly submitted a key proposal to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to protect developers and innovation. A16z, DeFi Group Partner For Crypto Policies On Wednesday, a16z and the DeFi Education Fund sent a letter to SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, urging the regulatory agency to exempt decentralized app (dApp) and developers from broker-dealer rules. The VC firm and the DeFi advocacy group proposed a safe harbor from the broker registration requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for trading interfaces that enable users to interact with blockchains and smart contract protocols, including those related to DeFi services and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces. The letter aims to aid the Commission in creating clear rules for determining which Apps fall within the SEC’s jurisdiction, based on specific criteria and consistent with similar safe harbors recently proposed in federal market structure legislation. DEF’s Executive Directors, Amanda Tuminelli, affirmed that “Developers deserve clarity, and our hope in submitting this proposal is to provide front end developers with clear rules so they can build without worrying they will be subject to unreasonable requirements that are misaligned with the realities of the technology.” According to the DeFi Education Fund’s blog post , the joint proposal seeks to be flexible enough to account for the “ever-evolving nature” of early-stage tech development, while being grounded in the principle that “most web-based or app-based trading interfaces (…) inherently do not engender the risks that the Exchange Act’s broker-dealer regulatory regime was designed to address.” “Only those Apps which do not engender the risks that the Exchange Act’s broker-dealer regulatory regime was designed to address should be eligible; in such cases, registration as a broker under the Exchange Act is unwarranted and inappropriate. Conversely, Apps that do pose traditional risks that broker regulations were designed to address should not be able to avail themselves of this safe harbor,” the proposal reads. Clarity For Developers As the letter explained, apps must meet four objective criteria to qualify for the safe harbor. First, an app must be non-custodial, never taking control of users’ funds, and it must not exercise discretion over the execution of user transactions. Additionally, the app must not actively solicit or provide investment recommendations and may only passively display neutral market data or functionality. Lastly, the underlying protocol must be decentralized, either interfacing with protocols that have eliminated operational control or have demonstrated “good faith intention” to decentralize. The proposal also highlighted a limited exception for early-stage protocols under a certain threshold. According to the letter, this approach would offer three primary benefits, including establishing limits for the application of federal and securities laws to apps that fall within the scope of the proposed safe harbor and safeguarding DeFi developers from being subject to “retroactive application of federal securities laws.” Additionally, the proposal aligns with the SEC’s historical practices concerning broker registration safe harbors and “is consistent with the historical lack of prohibition on persons engaging in private peer-to-peer securities transactions without the participation of a registered broker, as well as Commissioner Peirce’s recent dictum.” As reported by Bitcoinist, the SEC Commissioner recently called for the protection of crypto privacy rights and DeFi developments. Peirce asserted that US authorities should welcome privacy-protecting technologies and safeguard individuals’ right to self-custody their digital assets. We should not ask peers transacting with one another, where no intermediary exists, to collect and report information on each other. Doing so would deputize us to surveil our neighbors—a practice antithetical to a free society. Nor should we require an intermediary to step in the middle of peer-to-peer transactions. Peirce’s remarks followed the official revocation in July of a controversial crypto rule that would have mandated decentralized exchanges to comply with broker reporting obligations. Notably, the US Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) formally scrapped the regulation, which was set to take full effect in 2027. The rule, originally proposed in November 2021 through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, aimed to close the “tax gap” by broadening the definition of “brokers” to include crypto exchanges and other intermediaries, while requiring DeFi platforms to report proceeds from digital asset transactions and detail user transaction information, including names and addresses.",Crypto News|a16z crypto|Andreessen Horowitz|crypto developers|crypto policies|Crypto Regulations|DApps|decentralized apps|DeFi|DeFi Education Fund|ETH|Ethereum|ETHUSDT|Hester Peirce|SEC Commisioner|US SEC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-14 05:00:54

And this time, Ethereum and Chainlink are leading the way. In just the last week alone, over $1.4 billion in whale-sized inflows have been recorded between the two altcoins, suggesting a full-blown altcoin season, according to some analysts. While the major coins get the news, lesser-known but high-conviction tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are attracting serious interest from early-stage investors. Chainlink (LINK) Reclaims Spotlight with Cross-Chain Momentum After whale wallets cumulatively added $740 million in LINK over five days, Chainlink is back in the spotlight. The recent surge in the adoption of a major cryptocurrency is coinciding with the rapid expansion of the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) of Chainlink (LINK). Moreover, there are more than a dozen enterprises that have already onboarded the Chainlink CCIP. In addition, these companies are now using its services to bridge traditional systems and decentralized systems. The LINK token has managed to recover from its June lows and is currently trading around the $19.40 mark with price targets of $24–$26 in the near term. On-chain data indicates big holders are sending coins to cold wallets, which means long-term accumulation. The next CCIP integrations, which some believe could onboard Tier 1 banks, can see much greater upside as real-world assets begin to pick up. Ethereum Sees Record ETF Inflows as Supply Drops Ethereum also had a record-breaking week as institutional capital of $663 million flowed into spot ETH ETFs, thanks to BlackRock, Fidelity and Bitwise. These funds currently hold more than 25 billion worth of ETH. This has further restricted supply on exchanges. ETH’s positive price action appears to be reinforced by ETF flows, while its exchange balance continues to decline, staking continues to grow, and burn via EIP-1559 continues. All together, these fundamentals point to a supply squeeze that can send Ethereum to new heights. ETH price is currently above $4,300, with technical setups targeting $4,700 and $5,000 in the near term. MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Deliver 43x ROI as Whale Accumulation Hits Peak Levels MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver a staggering 43x ROI as whale accumulation hits peak levels, signaling powerful momentum for early investors. Top analysts are tracking unprecedented buying activity from crypto whales, positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most-watched coins in the market. With entry windows still open and smart money flowing in, this high-conviction play offers strategic upside before upcoming exchange listings and platform enhancements drive the next wave of demand. As accumulation surges and market positioning strengthens, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands ready to reward investors with exponential growth potential. Final Thoughts Whales are likely preparing for what they view as the next altcoin breakout cycle. Chainlink and Ethereum may be attracting billions in capital, but smaller-cap, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is revealing the early signs of something bigger. For investors in search of outsized returns in a crowded space, here lies that opportunity – one of the last before the crowd.

According to the firm’s latest trade disclosure , the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) bought 1.7 million shares of Bullish, followed by the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF’s (ARKW) acquisition of 545,416 shares. Meanwhile, the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) also bought 272,755 Bullish shares. All three purchases were made on Wednesday.

The Peter Thiel-backed cryptocurrency exchange made an impressive IPO debut at $37 per share, surpassing expectations of $32 to $33. Bullish Shares Surged Over 200% – Strong Institutional Appetite Shortly after Bullish’s debut, the crypto exchange shares soared to an intraday high of 200% gains from its IPO price. However, the stock was halted for trading later, due to volatility. At the end of the day, the stock finished at $68, rising 84% over 24 hours, Yahoo Finance data revealed. Bullish garnered increased institutional interest ahead of its IPO. At the launch, BlackRock and ARK Investment Management expressed interest in acquiring up to $200 million worth of shares. “I believe that the digital assets industry is at the inflection point of institutional adoption and Bullish is uniquely positioned at the center of this market,” said Bullish CEO Thomas Farley in a letter to investors about Bullish’s offering. Growing IPO Demand With Trump Administration’s pro-crypto agenda, IPO’s are coming back with increasing demand from institutional players. With the recent listing, Bullish has joined the burgeoning list of crypto players eyeing the IPO market. Stablecoin issuer Circle upsized its initial IPO in June, offering 32 million shares, up from a previously planned 24 million. The company revised the range of $27 to $28 per share. The shares have increased more than 400% since then. In July, designer giant Figma went public, disclosing $69.5 million in spot Bitcoin ETFs in its SEC IPO filing. Shares of Figma surged 250% in its market debut by the end of July.

According to recent market monitoring by Bitcoin World, BTC is currently trading at $122,994.01 on the Binance USDT market. This sudden decline has captured the attention of investors and analysts alike, prompting questions about its causes and potential implications for the broader cryptocurrency market . What Triggered This Significant Bitcoin Price Drop? When a digital asset like Bitcoin sees such a notable decline, it often signals a confluence of factors. While specific reasons for this particular Bitcoin price drop are still being fully assessed, several elements commonly influence market movements. These can include large sell-offs by major holders, shifts in global economic sentiment, or unexpected regulatory news. Market Sentiment: Investor confidence plays a crucial role. Negative news or a wave of profit-taking can quickly cascade. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic concerns, such as inflation data or interest rate changes, often influence investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. Liquidation Events: Large-scale liquidations of leveraged positions can accelerate price declines, creating a domino effect. Navigating Crypto Market Volatility: A Deeper Dive The nature of the cryptocurrency market is inherently dynamic, characterized by rapid price swings. This latest event underscores the reality of crypto market volatility , a trait that both attracts and challenges investors. Unlike traditional markets, crypto can react intensely to news, rumors, and even social media trends. Understanding this volatility is critical for anyone participating in the digital asset space. While the potential for high returns exists, so does the risk of swift corrections. Seasoned investors often prepare for such scenarios by maintaining a diversified portfolio and avoiding over-leveraged positions. It is a constant reminder that the digital asset landscape demands careful observation and a measured approach. Re-evaluating Your BTC Price Prediction After the Fall For many, this significant fall below $123,000 prompts a re-evaluation of their existing BTC price prediction . Short-term traders might look for opportunities to enter or exit positions, while long-term holders often view such dips as potential accumulation phases. It is important not to make impulsive decisions based solely on immediate price action. Instead, consider the long-term fundamentals of Bitcoin. Is the underlying technology still robust? Is adoption continuing to grow? These questions are vital for any sound investment strategy. While the current price point is notable, historical data suggests Bitcoin has shown resilience over extended periods, often recovering from significant downturns. Essential Bitcoin Analysis for Prudent Investors In times of market flux, thorough Bitcoin analysis becomes more important than ever. This involves looking beyond just the price chart. Examine trading volumes, funding rates, and on-chain metrics to gain a comprehensive understanding of market health. Additionally, keeping an eye on global economic indicators and regulatory developments can provide valuable context. For those considering their next steps, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never rely solely on headlines. Investigate the underlying reasons for market movements. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of a lump sum, invest a fixed amount regularly to average out your purchase price. Manage Risk: Only invest what you can afford to lose and set clear stop-loss limits if you are actively trading. Ultimately, a robust BTC price prediction is built on a foundation of continuous learning and adaptive strategies. The recent Bitcoin price drop below $123,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility within the cryptocurrency market . While such movements can be unsettling, they also provide valuable lessons and opportunities for those who approach them with informed strategies. Staying updated with accurate Bitcoin analysis and understanding the dynamics of crypto market volatility are key to navigating these exciting yet unpredictable waters. Remember, the journey in crypto is often about patience and conviction, not just short-term gains. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What exactly happened to Bitcoin’s price?

The blockchain entrepreneur says the disclosure would invade his privacy, and put him and his family at risk. In the complaint, Sun alleges Bloomberg approached him earlier this year to be included in its online Billionaires Index , a ranking of the world’s richest individuals. Crypto Holdings Meant to Be Shown Only as Lump Sum, Sun Claims Before agreeing, he says Bloomberg assured him that any asset information he provided would be kept “strictly confidential.” Moreover, this applied especially to his cryptocurrency holdings. He adds that it would be used only to verify his net worth. Source: Sun v. Bloomberg, L.P., 1:25-cv-01007 Sun, who founded Tron in 2017 and has substantial crypto and other assets, says he ultimately agreed based on these assurances. He provided detailed wallet and asset data through a secure channel with Bloomberg’s wealth verification team. His understanding, he claims, was that any reference to his crypto assets in his profile would be limited to a lump sum valuation. He adds that it would not include a breakdown by token type. Bloomberg declined to comment on the matter. Confidentiality Promises Allegedly Broken With Draft Profile Release According to the filing, multiple Bloomberg journalists reiterated this confidentiality in writing. They stated that the data would remain on internal systems and that it would be accessible only to select staff. They also confirmed it would be deleted after verification. Sun’s team also set explicit conditions in March. They stated the information was “for verification purposes only” and “must not be used for any other purpose, including reporting.” Further, the lawsuit says Bloomberg did not object to these terms. In late July, Sun’s team learned that a Bloomberg journalist was using figures from the confidential material for a separate article. Around the same time, Bloomberg provided a draft Billionaires Index profile that included what Sun describes as “numerous inaccuracies” and, critically, a detailed breakdown of his cryptocurrency holdings by type and amount. Detailed Crypto Data Could Help Trackers Link Wallets, Filing Claims Sun argued that such granular disclosure is unusual for Bloomberg’s index. Further, he said it goes beyond what is published for other crypto billionaires, such as Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong or Binance’s Changpeng Zhao. He adds that these details are not shared unless the individuals have already made them public. He claimed the planned publication would allow blockchain trackers to link his wallets. As a result, he believes this could make him a prime target for hackers and thieves. Moreover, he warns it could even expose him to potential physical attacks. The filing notes that public blockchain transparency makes it relatively easy to identify large wallets once the asset composition is known. It also cites past incidents where wealthy crypto holders faced kidnapping or extortion attempts. Further, it references Bloomberg’s own prior reporting on these risks. Sun Argues Asset Breakdown Could Have Lasting Consequences Beyond One Article Sun is suing on two counts, public disclosure of private facts and promissory estoppel. Moreover, he claims Bloomberg’s planned publication clearly breaches the promises that convinced him to share the data. He adds that the harm could be both financial and physical. This is because crypto transactions are irreversible, and attackers can quickly move stolen funds. The lawsuit seeks a temporary restraining order, as well as preliminary and permanent injunctions. These would block Bloomberg from publishing the breakdown. In addition, it requests reimbursement of legal costs. Further, Sun has demanded a jury trial. For Sun, whose public profile is closely tied to Tron and other ventures, the case is about more than media coverage. It touches on a core tension in crypto between the transparency of blockchain data and the personal security of high-value holders. Sun says revealing his detailed holdings could have consequences that extend well beyond a single news profile.

Coinbase’s chief security officer Philip Martin confirmed the mishap and called it an “an isolated issue” tied to a change in one of the exchange’s corporate DEX wallets. He stressed that no customer funds were affected, per an X post. Security researcher “deeberiroz” of Venn Network first flagged the exploit on Wednesday, saying Coinbase mistakenly approved tokens to the swapper contract — a permissionless tool designed for executing swaps but not intended to hold token allowances. That setup opened the door for opportunistic MEV bots, which immediately drained the wallet once approvals were live. MEV, or “maximal extractable value,” refers to the practice of front-running or reordering blockchain transactions to capture profits, or in this case, executing transfers before Coinbase could revoke access. “There appears to have been an MEV bot lurking in the dark, waiting for users to mistakenly approve to this contract — and then drain all their funds,” the researcher wrote on X. “Well, their dream came true thanks to Coinbase … They made a killing by draining the Coinbase fee receiver account of all the tokens they gathered.” Because the contract can be accessed by anyone, the bots were able to call it (a software term requesting services from another program) to transfer out the approved tokens directly to their own addresses. While $300,000 is immaterial for Coinbase, the breach shows how even leading exchanges are vulnerable to small but sophisticated forms of automated trading exploitation. MEV bots have long been a fixture in Ethereum and other blockchain ecosystems, profiting from token launches, NFT mints, and liquidity events by exploiting memepool visibility and transaction reordering. In this case, the bots simply waited for a high-value wallet — like Coinbase’s fee receiver — to mistakenly grant spending rights to an exposed contract, then executed the drain instantly.",Markets|Hack|Coinbase|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|ZRX|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-14 05:34:46

Currently, Bitcoin has reached a new record high, reaching over $124,400. While BTC is hitting a new ATH, Ethereum (ETH) is on the verge of a new ATH. ETH reached $4,780 intraday, its highest level since the end of 2021. Analysts say the rise in Bitcoin is due to rising corporate demand and growing expectations that the Fed will cut interest rates in September. Bitcoin Could Reach $150,000! While the general rise in the market is expected to continue, IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said that the rise is supported by institutional demand and the Fed, as well as the Trump administration’s moves to facilitate cryptocurrency investment. “Technically, a sustained rally above $125,000 could push BTC to $150,000.” The rise may continue until the end of the year! Speaking to The Block, BTC Markets crypto analyst Rachael Lucas also noted that the rally is being fueled by the same catalysts. She added that she expects Bitcoin to maintain its upward momentum through the end of the year. Bitcoin prices are rising due to expanding demand for institutional and spot ETFs. I anticipate a sustained upward trend for the remainder of the year. The combination of supply shortages and strong structural demand will support further increases through the end of the year.” Lucas added that Bitcoin will maintain its upward momentum for the rest of the year, but will experience a period of consolidation in the $120,000 to $125,000 range. *This is not investment advice.

Imagine a future where AI-driven autonomous agents handle financial transactions seamlessly, particularly stablecoin transfers . This isn’t science fiction; it’s a rapidly approaching reality that could revolutionize blockchain e-commerce , as highlighted by insights from Coinbase developers Kevin Leffew and Lincoln Murr. What Are AI Agents and How Do They Connect to the Ethereum Network? AI agents are sophisticated software programs designed to perform tasks autonomously, often learning and adapting over time. Traditionally, these agents have operated within closed systems. However, their integration with blockchain technology, specifically the Ethereum network , opens up a new realm of possibilities. Coinbase developers Leffew and Murr suggest that these AI agents are poised to become the “biggest power users” of Ethereum. Their analysis, shared on Ethereum’s official X account, points to a unique combination of old and new technologies: HTTP 402 “Payment Required” Status: Created nearly three decades ago, this often-overlooked web status code signals that a client needs to make a payment to access a resource. Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 3009: This proposal enables “transferWithAuthorization” for ERC-20 tokens, allowing third parties to initiate transfers on behalf of a token holder, provided they have a signed authorization. Together, these elements create a powerful synergy. AI agents can leverage HTTP 402 to identify payment requirements and then utilize EIP 3009 to execute automated stablecoin transfers directly on the Ethereum blockchain, all without human intervention. Coinbase itself has already implemented this concept through its “x402 payments protocol,” showcasing its practical application. Powering the Future of Blockchain E-commerce: What Does This Mean? The implications of AI agents facilitating automated payments are vast, especially for blockchain e-commerce . Think about online transactions today – they almost always require human confirmation, even for recurring payments. This new paradigm shifts that reliance. Consider an AI agent managing a supply chain or a smart home device that automatically orders consumables. With this integration, the agent could: Receive an HTTP 402 response indicating a payment is needed for a service or product. Automatically initiate a stablecoin transfer using EIP 3009 from a pre-authorized wallet. Complete the transaction instantly and securely on the Ethereum network . This seamless, machine-to-machine payment flow reduces friction, increases efficiency, and opens doors for entirely new business models where autonomous systems interact and transact independently. It’s a significant leap towards truly automated digital economies. Why Are Automated Stablecoin Transfers a Game Changer? The ability for AI agents to perform automated stablecoin transfers is truly transformative. Stablecoins, pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, offer price stability, making them ideal for everyday transactions and predictable financial operations. When combined with AI’s efficiency, the benefits are clear: Unprecedented Efficiency: Transactions can occur 24/7 without human oversight, speeding up processes. Reduced Human Error: Automating payments minimizes the potential for mistakes in manual entries. Enhanced Security: Leveraging the cryptographic security of the Ethereum network for every transaction. New Economic Paradigms: Enabling autonomous agents to participate directly in economic activities, from micro-payments for data access to complex supply chain logistics. This development paves the way for sophisticated decentralized applications (dApps) and autonomous organizations (DAOs) where AI plays a central role in managing finances and executing payments, making HTTP 402 payments a cornerstone of this future. Challenges and the Path Forward for Ethereum Network Growth While the potential for AI agents as power users of the Ethereum network is immense, there are certainly challenges to address. Ensuring the security of wallets authorized for autonomous transfers is paramount. Scalability of the Ethereum network, especially with a potential surge in AI-driven transactions, will also remain a key focus for developers as the network evolves towards Ethereum 2.0. Regulatory clarity for autonomous transactions and the legal standing of AI agents as economic actors will also be crucial for widespread adoption. However, the foundational work by Coinbase and others, like the “x402 payments protocol,” demonstrates a proactive approach to building the necessary infrastructure. As the technology matures and frameworks adapt, the vision of AI agents driving a new era of blockchain e-commerce powered by automated stablecoin transfers on Ethereum moves closer to reality. The convergence of AI and blockchain is not just a technological curiosity; it’s a powerful force poised to reshape our digital economy. With AI agents leveraging the Ethereum network for automated stablecoin transfers , we are entering an exciting new chapter where efficiency, autonomy, and innovation will define the future of online transactions and beyond. Get ready for a world where your digital assistants don’t just remind you to pay bills, but pay them themselves! Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are AI agents in the context of blockchain? AI agents are autonomous software programs designed to perform specific tasks. When integrated with blockchain, particularly the Ethereum network, they can execute financial transactions and interact with decentralized applications independently, without direct human input. Q2: How do HTTP 402 and EIP 3009 enable automated payments? HTTP 402 is a web status code signaling that a payment is required. EIP 3009 allows a token holder to authorize a third party (like an AI agent) to transfer their ERC-20 tokens. Together, an AI agent can detect a payment requirement via HTTP 402 and then execute the stablecoin transfer on Ethereum using the EIP 3009 authorization. Q3: What are the main benefits of AI-driven stablecoin transfers? The key benefits include unprecedented efficiency through 24/7 automated transactions, reduced human error, enhanced security leveraging Ethereum’s cryptography, and the creation of new economic models where AI agents can directly participate in financial activities. Q4: How will this development impact blockchain e-commerce? This will revolutionize blockchain e-commerce by enabling seamless, machine-to-machine payments. AI agents can autonomously handle transactions for services, products, or subscriptions, leading to highly automated supply chains, smart device interactions, and entirely new forms of digital marketplaces.

Analysts say it could outperform by early 2026,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/14/is-mutuum-finance-the-next-link-analysts-say-it-could-outperform-by-early-2026/,"In the dynamic world of decentralized finance (DeFi), Chainlink (LINK) has long been regarded as a benchmark for growth and utility. Now, top analysts are spotlighting a fresh contender that has the potential to outpace LINK by early 2026— Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This rising star is gaining attention not just for its innovative tokenomics but also for its groundbreaking approach to lending, staking, and stablecoin issuance that could establish it as a core DeFi infrastructure in the coming years. Stablecoin and unique staking mechanism At the heart of the excitement is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s pioneering stablecoin protocol, which will be integrated directly with its lending platform. Unlike many projects, MUTM’s stablecoin will be minted strictly when users borrow against collateral, ensuring that the stablecoin supply adjusts dynamically with borrowing demand. This approach tightly links the stablecoin’s value to real-world utility rather than speculative hype, creating a new foundation for scalable and responsible DeFi lending. The platform’s unique mtToken staking model further differentiates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) by allowing users to stake interest-bearing tokens in smart contracts to earn MUTM rewards. Importantly, the project plans to use future platform revenue to buy back MUTM tokens from the market and reward stakers. Fast, scalable, and ready for mass adoption What amplifies Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s potential is its upcoming Layer-2 integration, which promises to dramatically increase transaction speeds and slash fees. These improvements are critical because mass adoption in DeFi depends on platforms that are not only secure but also fast and cost-effective. By addressing scalability early in its roadmap, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself to support high volumes of users and transactions, making it an attractive destination for both retail investors and institutional players. Currently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.035. This phase has already raised around $14.33 million and brought in over 15,200 holders, representing about 15% of total tokens sold. The next phase is expected to raise the price to $0.040, delivering a 15% gain to early buyers and signaling one of the last opportunities to enter at a discounted rate before the token moves closer to its $0.06 listing price. Such well-structured phases make the project accessible yet rewarding for early supporters, fueling healthy demand and liquidity ahead of the exchange launch. The roadmap itself is divided into four distinct phases, with the current progress leading seamlessly toward the beta launch. This crucial milestone will enable the minting of the platform’s stablecoin, triggered by borrowing activity. This mechanism opens up new lending use cases that go beyond traditional models, enhancing the platform’s real-world utility and appeal. Following the beta, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to finalize full smart contract deployments, conduct thorough audits, and prepare for listings on centralized exchanges, all of which are designed to accelerate adoption and growth. Early investors reaping multiples and strong security foundations Investors who recognized Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s potential early on are already seeing impressive paper gains. Consider a Phase 1 buyer who reallocated just 5% of their Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) holdings into MUTM at the $0.01 presale price. This move alone has multiplied their investment 5X unrealized relative to the upcoming $0.06 listing price, with the prospect of even greater returns after the platform’s official launch and exchange listings. Such clear, confident returns make MUTM a compelling addition to any diversified crypto portfolio seeking exposure beyond BTC and ETH. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also takes security seriously, having secured a top-tier CertiK audit with a score of 95 and a Skynet rating of 78. This thorough review covers code quality, vulnerabilities, and attack resistance, providing investors with peace of mind as the platform scales. Additionally, the project’s $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty program incentivizes ethical hackers to find and report critical flaws, offering rewards up to $2,000 per discovery. This proactive security approach ensures that the platform will remain robust and trustworthy amid rapid expansion.

He suggests a potential Ethereum price drop could be on the horizon, urging market participants to exercise extreme caution. This isn’t just a casual prediction; it’s a critical alert about an impending ETH correction and the dangers of engaging in crypto leverage . Understanding the Potential Ethereum Price Drop Ash Crypto, a market analyst with an impressive 1.8 million followers on X, has identified patterns indicating that Ethereum (ETH) might be due for a sudden downturn. He notes that large players, often referred to as ‘whales’ and ‘market makers,’ are currently unwinding their short positions. This action, while seemingly bullish, could precede a more concerning move. What’s the concern? Ash Crypto suggests these powerful entities might then aim to liquidate long positions. This happens when traders, driven by fear of missing out (FOMO), open leveraged long positions, only for the price to drop unexpectedly, forcing their positions to close at a loss. This cascading effect can amplify a simple downturn into a sharp Ethereum price drop . Why Ash Crypto’s Warning Matters Amidst Market Volatility Ash Crypto’s insights carry weight due to his substantial following and consistent analysis of market dynamics. His recent Ash Crypto warning highlights a crucial aspect of cryptocurrency trading: inherent market volatility . Unlike traditional markets, crypto assets can experience rapid, dramatic price swings, often without clear immediate catalysts. He specifically points out the deceptive nature of whale behavior. While unwinding shorts might seem like a signal for upward movement, it can also be a strategic setup. This maneuver could be designed to lure retail traders into vulnerable positions, setting the stage for a significant ETH correction . The Perils of Crypto Leverage: A Crucial Lesson One of the most vital aspects of Ash Crypto’s advice is his strong recommendation to avoid crypto leverage . Leverage allows traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. While it can amplify gains, it equally amplifies losses, making it incredibly risky, especially during periods of high market volatility . Amplified Losses: A small price movement against your position can wipe out your entire capital. Liquidation Risk: Exchanges automatically close your position if your losses reach a certain point, leading to forced sales. Emotional Trading: The pressure of leveraged positions can lead to poor, impulsive decisions driven by fear or greed. In a scenario where an Ethereum price drop occurs, leveraged positions are the first to be hit hard, leading to rapid liquidations that further fuel the downward spiral. Protecting Your Portfolio from an ETH Correction Given the potential for an ETH correction and the Ash Crypto warning , what steps can traders take to safeguard their investments? Responsible trading practices are paramount: Prioritize Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Define your risk tolerance for each trade. Avoid High Leverage: As Ash Crypto emphasized, steer clear of excessive leverage, especially when market conditions are uncertain. Set Stop-Loss Orders: These automatically sell your assets if they drop to a predetermined price, limiting potential losses. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your capital into a single asset like Ethereum. Spread your investments across different cryptocurrencies or asset classes. Stay Informed, Not Emotional: Base your decisions on thorough research and analysis, not on FOMO or panic. Understand that market corrections are a natural part of any financial cycle. In conclusion, Ash Crypto’s timely warning serves as a crucial reminder for all crypto participants. The potential for an Ethereum price drop and subsequent ETH correction , combined with the inherent risks of crypto leverage , underscores the need for vigilance. By understanding the dynamics of market volatility and adopting sound risk management strategies, traders can navigate these challenging periods more effectively and protect their portfolios from sudden downturns. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Ash Crypto and why should I heed his warning? A1: Ash Crypto is a prominent market analyst with 1.8 million followers on X. His warnings are often based on observed market behavior of large entities and provide valuable insights into potential price movements and market volatility , making his advice relevant for traders. Q2: What does ‘unwinding short positions’ mean in this context? A2: Unwinding short positions means that traders who bet on a price decline are now closing those bets. While this can sometimes signal bullish sentiment, Ash Crypto suggests it might be a strategic move by whales before attempting to liquidate long positions, potentially leading to an Ethereum price drop . Q3: Why is crypto leverage so risky during an ETH correction? A3: Crypto leverage magnifies both gains and losses. During an ETH correction , even a small downward price movement can lead to rapid liquidation of leveraged positions, resulting in significant financial losses and contributing to further market instability. Q4: How can I protect my investments from a sudden Ethereum price drop? A4: You can protect your investments by avoiding high leverage, setting stop-loss orders, diversifying your portfolio, and practicing sound risk management. Staying informed and avoiding emotional trading are also crucial. Q5: Is an Ethereum price drop guaranteed based on this warning? A5: No, market predictions are never guaranteed. Ash Crypto’s warning highlights a potential scenario and urges caution. It is a reminder to be prepared for market volatility and to manage risks proactively, rather than a definitive forecast. Q6: What is ‘FOMO’ in crypto trading? A6: FOMO stands for ‘Fear Of Missing Out.’ In crypto trading, it describes the anxiety or apprehension that one might miss out on a profitable investment opportunity, often leading to impulsive decisions like opening leveraged long positions at potentially unfavorable times.

50064795,556035,1755151214,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50064795.jpeg,Crypto Wallets Face Google Play Ban Without Federal Licenses Across 15 Jurisdictions,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-wallets-face-google-play-ban/,"The Google Play Store announced on Wednesday a new policy mandating that developers of cryptocurrency wallet applications secure a license before their software can be published. This policy is particularly focused on 15 jurisdictions, including the European Union (EU) and the United States, and delineates specific regulatory frameworks that developers must adhere to in order to participate in the platform. Google Tightens Regulations On Crypto Wallets The new requirements stipulate that developers in the US must register as a Money Services Business (MSB) with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and comply with stringent Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Counter Terrorist Financing (CTF), and Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols. This represents a significant hurdle for non-custodial wallet developers—those not holding users’ funds—who, under FinCEN’s 2019 guidance, are not classified as money transmitters. As a result, the policy imposes compliance demands that far exceed existing legal requirements, effectively putting many non-custodial wallets at risk of being excluded from the Play Store. According to recent reports , by enforcing such standards, Google risks stifling innovation in the cryptocurrency space and limiting the availability of non-custodial wallets to users. It is believed that developers may find the costs associated with compliance prohibitive, leading to a significant reduction in the diversity of wallet options available on Google devices. Regulation By Commercial Enforcement? In the European Union, the situation mirrors that of the United States. Developers are required to obtain authorization as a Crypto Asset Service Provider (CASP) under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation from relevant national authorities. However, this licensing framework is tailored for entities that manage or hold custody of digital assets, effectively excluding simple non-custodial wallets from obtaining the necessary licenses. Consequently, only licensed CASPs will be able to offer wallet services on the Play Store in the EU, further narrowing the market. This policy aligns closely with the recommendations set forth by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which provides guidance on managing risks associated with virtual assets and their service providers. While FATF’s recommendations are not legally binding, they serve as a regulatory framework for countries to develop their own regulations. This creates a complex landscape where commercial entities like Google may enforce compliance measures that go beyond statutory requirements, driven by the desire to mitigate risk and maintain a secure ecosystem. Moreover, the FATF has acknowledged that even decentralized applications (dApps) may have a central party that exercises some level of control, blurring the lines between custodial and non-custodial services. This ambiguity complicates the regulatory environment further, as developers may find themselves subject to custodial regulations despite not directly managing user funds. Overall, the introduction of these licensing requirements by major platforms like Google marks a shift towards what could be termed “regulation by commercial enforcement.” Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",Crypto News|crypto|crypto news|crypto regulation|crypto wallets|cryptocurrencies|Cryptocurrency|Google|google crypto|Google News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-14 06:00:14

Bitcoin Options ATM IV Has Been Going Down Recently In its latest weekly report, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Bitcoin Options At-The-Money Implied Volatility. Implied Volatility (IV) refers to an indicator that measures how volatile BTC is expected to be in the future, based on the pricing of Options contracts. At-The-Money (ATM) IV, the version of the metric of interest here, specifically calculates this expectation for the contracts that have their strike price closest to the asset’s current spot price. The “strike price” is the predetermined price at which the holder of an options contract can choose to buy (in the case of a call or bullish bet) or sell (put or bearish bet) the underlying asset. Related Reading: Ethereum Retail Mood Still Bearish: Perfect Setup For ATH Break? Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Options ATM IV for all expiry timeframes: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Options ATM IV has been following a downtrend since a while now, indicating the traders aren’t expecting near-term volatility. If the past is anything to go by, though, BTC could go against these traders. “Historically, such subdued volatility expectations have often preceded sharp market moves, making them a potential contrarian indicator,” explains Glassnode. From the chart, it’s visible that such a contraction in Bitcoin Options ATM IV also occurred back in 2023 and what followed back then was a bull rally for the cryptocurrency. It now remains to be seen whether volatility in either direction would also follow this compression. Related Reading: XRP To $12? Analyst Reveals Bold Target From Multi-Year Pattern ATM contracts aren’t the only one expecting low volatility. According to the report, Deribit‘s DVOL index, which tracks a 30-day IV measure for all strike prices, has dropped to historically low levels recently. As is apparent in the chart, the Bitcoin DVOL has been going down in the last few months. The index is currently at lows so extreme that only 2.6% of trading days have witnessed a lower value. The analytics firm explains: Such levels often reflect market complacency and limited demand for hedging against large moves. While these conditions can persist, they leave the market exposed to sudden volatility spikes if a catalyst emerges, as past cycles have shown through sharp, disorderly price swings when risk is rapidly repriced. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $121,600, up 5% over the last week.

Record-breaking inflows into U.S. Ethereum ETFs and shifting institutional sentiment are stirring discussion that ETH could be the standout performer of the upcoming altcoin season. U.S. Ethereum ETFs Post Historic Inflows U.S.-listed Ethereum ETFs shattered previous records on August 11, pulling in $1.019 billion in a single day—eclipsing the prior $726.6 million milestone. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust led the charge with $640 million in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund with $276.9 million. Other issuers, including Grayscale, VanEck, Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, and 21Shares, also contributed notable amounts. The surge lifted total ETF inflows to $10.83 billion and total assets under management to $25.71 billion, which is nearly 5% of Ethereum’s valuation. Analysts credit this momentum to growing optimism over U.S. interest rate cuts and easing regulatory pressure after the SEC’s Ripple case resolution. Industry observers believe this would spark a wave of new ETF products, cementing ETH’s role as a core institutional asset. Analysts Outline Path to $10K ETH Ethereum’s price is now just 4% shy of its all-time high, trading at $4,694. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee says the rally will carry ETH to $10,000 before the end of 2025, with a possible extension toward $12,000–$15,000 if momentum holds. The past eight weeks alone have seen ETH climb 78%, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 15% gain. Lee attributes this to Ethereum’s central role in powering stablecoins, DeFi protocols, and institutional blockchain infrastructure. The recently passed GENIUS Act and the SEC’s Project Crypto are accelerating Wall Street’s migration to Ethereum-based systems—a shift he likens to the early days of the internet. Fundstrat projects ETH could reach a $1.8 trillion market cap by December 2025, driven by both direct holdings and indirect exposure through Ethereum treasury stocks. Strategic Models Highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE’s 64x Potential As Ethereum eyes historic highs, traders are also scanning the altcoin landscape for high-upside plays. Strategic models now flag MAGACOIN FINANCE as a candidate for potential 64x gains ahead of the next altcoin season. The project’s momentum has drawn interest from both whales and institutional players looking to position early in assets with strong DeFi utility and robust market traction. Bottom Line With Ethereum ETFs breaking records and bullish projections from top analysts, ETH’s path to $10,000 appears increasingly plausible. At the same time, emerging plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing attention as traders diversify ahead of the next market cycle. You can learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE via the official website.

This isn’t just a theoretical debate; it directly impacts Circle’s revenue , especially as the issuer of USDC, one of the leading stablecoins. Recent insights from Omar, a Director at Dragonfly, shed light on a potentially significant challenge facing the stablecoin giant. This analysis offers a clear look at what the future might hold for the prominent stablecoin issuer . What Does This Mean for Circle’s Revenue ? Omar’s analysis, shared on X, highlights a stark reality for rate-sensitive companies like Circle. A 100-basis-point cut in U.S. interest rates could have a substantial ripple effect on the company’s financials. Why does this matter so much? Stablecoin issuers like Circle earn a significant portion of their income from holding reserves, often in short-term U.S. Treasury bills, which yield interest. Here’s a breakdown of the potential financial hit: Gross Revenue Reduction: A 100-basis-point cut could reduce Circle’s run-rate gross revenue by an estimated $618 million, representing a 23% drop. Gross Profit Decline: The impact extends to profitability, with gross profit potentially falling by $303 million, a 30% decrease. Margin Compression: Operating margins could also see a squeeze, decreasing by 3.3 percentage points. This detailed breakdown provides a clear picture of the financial pressures Fed rate cuts could impose on a company heavily reliant on interest income from its reserves. How Will the USDC Impact Play Out? To offset the projected revenue loss from lower interest rates, Omar estimates that the supply of USDC would need to increase dramatically. Specifically, the USDC impact necessitates an additional $28 billion in supply to reach a break-even point. This represents a substantial 44% increase over today’s approximately $64 billion USDC circulation. Achieving such growth in USDC supply is a significant undertaking, especially in a competitive stablecoin market. It underscores the challenge of maintaining profitability when a core revenue stream is under pressure. For any stablecoin issuer , diversifying revenue becomes paramount in such an environment. The road ahead for growth will require strategic maneuvers. How is Circle Adapting to the New Crypto Finance Landscape? Understanding these potential headwinds, Circle has already begun implementing strategic maneuvers. The recent $1.5 billion share sale, which occurred just yesterday according to Omar, can be seen as a proactive measure to shore up capital. This move is critical as the company navigates a period of likely Fed rate cuts . This capital infusion provides a cushion against potential revenue shortfalls. Furthermore, Circle is actively pushing to launch new products designed to monetize transaction flow rather than solely relying on interest income from reserves. Initiatives like the Circle Payments Network (CPN) and Circle Chain are examples of this strategic shift. These platforms aim to generate revenue through transaction fees and services, creating more resilient and diversified income streams in the evolving landscape of crypto finance . This strategic pivot is essential for long-term sustainability and maintaining Circle’s revenue . In conclusion, while the prospect of U.S. Fed rate cuts presents a clear challenge to Circle’s revenue model, the company is not standing still. Through capital raises and innovative product development focused on transaction monetization, Circle is actively working to mitigate the impact and ensure its continued growth as a leading stablecoin issuer. The ability to adapt to changing economic conditions will be crucial for its future success in the dynamic crypto space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. How do Fed rate cuts specifically affect stablecoin issuers like Circle? Stablecoin issuers often hold a significant portion of their reserves in interest-bearing assets like short-term U.S. Treasury bills. When the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, the yield on these assets decreases, directly reducing the interest income that stablecoin issuers, including Circle, earn on their reserves. 2. What specific financial impact could Circle face from lower interest rates? According to a Dragonfly director, a 100-basis-point cut could reduce Circle’s run-rate gross revenue by $618 million (23%), gross profit by $303 million (30%), and operating margins by 3.3 percentage points. This highlights the significant potential USDC impact on the company’s financials. 3. How much would USDC supply need to grow to offset revenue loss from rate cuts? To break even and offset the projected revenue loss from lower interest rates, the supply of USDC would need to increase by an estimated $28 billion. This represents a substantial 44% increase over its current circulation, posing a significant growth challenge for the stablecoin issuer . 4. What strategies is Circle employing to counter the impact of rate cuts? Circle is implementing several strategies, including a recent $1.5 billion share sale to raise capital. Additionally, the company is focusing on launching new products like the Circle Payments Network (CPN) and Circle Chain, which aim to monetize transaction flow and diversify its revenue streams beyond interest income from reserves. 5. What are Circle Payments Network (CPN) and Circle Chain? The Circle Payments Network (CPN) and Circle Chain are new product initiatives by Circle designed to generate revenue through transaction fees and services. These platforms aim to facilitate payment flows and build out blockchain infrastructure, contributing to Circle’s diversification in the broader crypto finance ecosystem. Share Your Thoughts!

Developers wishing to publish wallet apps in 15 regions, including the United States and the European Union, will be required to obtain official licenses in those countries. In the US, developers are required to register as a Money Service Business (MSB) with FinCEN and hold a state money transmitter license or operate as a federal/state bank. MSB registration carries stringent compliance requirements, including AML (Anti-Money Laundering), CTF (Counter-Terrorist Financing), and KYC (Know Your Customer). This goes beyond the legal requirements for non-custodial wallets, which are not considered money transmission services under current legislation. Related News: Ethereum Oracle Tom Lee Shares New Record Prediction for ETH Price In the EU, developers are required to hold a Crypto Asset Service Provider (CASP) license under the MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation. MiCA licenses are typically granted to exchanges, trading platforms, and digital asset custodians. This makes it virtually impossible to obtain a license for a simple non-custodial software wallet. The new policy doesn't distinguish between custodial and non-custodial wallets. Experts say this could force most non-custodial wallet developers out of the Google Play Store, restrict open-source software innovation, and impose AML/KYC requirements on all non-custodial wallets built into Android devices.

Part of the funding will go toward “state-of-the-art cryptocurrency mining infrastructure,” with Thumzup already in talks with mining technology providers to speed up deployment. Thumzup Eyes $250M Crypto Portfolio, Expands into Mining Thumzup entered the crypto space in January, initially purchasing Bitcoin. It now holds 19.1 BTC and plans to diversify into Dogecoin, Litecoin, Solana, XRP, Ether, and USDC, with its board authorizing up to $250 million in total crypto holdings. The company’s profile in the sector drew additional attention in early July when Donald Trump Jr., son of U.S. President Donald Trump, purchased 350,000 shares , worth nearly $3.3 million at the time, according to regulatory filings. The timing of Thumzup’s mining push coincides with Bitcoin hitting a record high of $124,128 early Thursday, before easing to $123,683, up 3.6% in 24 hours, per CoinGecko data. Shares of Thumzup (TZUP) rose 7.62% in after-hours trading Wednesday to $10.87, reversing a 1.1% decline during the regular session. The stock is up nearly 194.5% year-to-date, with its latest peak of $15.46 recorded on Aug. 8. However, it slid nearly 33% earlier this week after announcing plans for a public offering of non-voting convertible preferred stock, later revised. Last month, Thumzup received board approval to hold up to $250 million in cryptocurrencies , including Bitcoin and other major digital assets. Thumzup is stepping up its game.

Thumzup offers an app that pays users for product recommendations on Instagram. It recorded a $2.2 million loss on just $151 in revenue in Q1. Still, its stock soared almost 75% over the prior four sessions before tumbling 17% by mid‑Wednesday. In January, Thumzup made a notable pivot by announcing it would hold most of its liquid assets in Bitcoin. Since then, it has accumulated over $2 million worth of BTC. Now, the company plans to diversify further by adding six more coins, using funds raised in its latest round. European Bitcoin Holdings Grow Thumzup’s expansion reflects a broader trend of public companies boosting their crypto treasuries. Stockholm-based health technology firm H100 Group revealed Wednesday it had purchased an additional 45.8 BTC , bringing its total to 809.1 BTC. H100 said it paid an average of under 1.14 million Swedish krona ($119,090) per Bitcoin, for a total outlay of 52.18 million krona ($5.47 million). The purchase ranks H100 as the 42nd largest public company Bitcoin holder globally and the fourth largest in the EU, trailing Germany’s Bitcoin Group SE, which holds 3,605 BTC, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net.

XRP Will Not Overtake Ethereum (ETH),https://timestabloid.com/pro-xrp-lawyer-not-this-cycle-xrp-will-not-overtake-ethereum-eth/,"Technical analyst Charting Guy recently shared his perspective on the market performance of Ethereum (ETH) and XRP, noting a shift in dynamics compared to earlier expectations. He explained that in late 2023 and early 2024, XRP appeared to be on track to surpass Ethereum in market capitalization. However, he stated that this is no longer the case. Charting Guy revealed that he re-entered Ethereum in April at what he considered near its low point, and since then, the asset has demonstrated significant strength. According to him, Ethereum is now only 10% away from reaching its all-time high, whereas XRP may have a maximum potential upside of approximately 2.5 times its current value. Even if such growth occurred, he argued, XRP’s market capitalization would still not match Ethereum’s present level. He advised investors not to be swayed by overly optimistic predictions, recommending instead that they hold both assets and accept the market’s natural course. Charting Guy also emphasized that Ethereum’s recent outperformance was overdue and that he had timed his re-entry to capitalize on it. Bill Morgan’s Response Prominent lawyer and digital asset commentator Bill Morgan responded directly to Charting Guy’s statement, making his stance clear. Morgan stated, “Not this cycle. XRP will not overtake ETH.” His comment signaled agreement with the general premise that Ethereum would maintain its lead over XRP in the foreseeable term, at least within the current market environment. Not this cycle. XRP will not overtake ETH https://t.co/YyVgPgaoOS — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) August 12, 2025 Community Inquiry on Ripple Banking License Impact The conversation extended further when an X user, Sherrie, posed a question to Morgan. She asked whether, in the event Ripple obtained a banking license , XRP could thereafter have the potential to overtake Ethereum. Morgan addressed the scenario directly, stating, “Not in 2025/this market cycle.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This reinforced his earlier view, indicating that even a major development such as Ripple securing a banking license would not, in his opinion, be sufficient to shift the market capitalization standings between XRP and Ethereum before the end of the current cycle. Morgan’s comments align with a cautious approach to market forecasts, underscoring that while XRP has strong advocates and potential catalysts, these factors alone may not be enough to surpass Ethereum’s market position in the short to medium term. His stance suggests a recognition of Ethereum’s entrenched market dominance, supported by its broader adoption and performance trajectory over recent months. While XRP supporters often highlight potential institutional adoption, cross-border payment utility, and legal clarity following its recent regulatory outcomes, Morgan’s statements point to the broader reality that market dominance depends on a complex mix of factors.

However, an analyst suggested that this week’s performance will be key for the long-awaited price discovery rally. Related Reading: SUI Set Up For Another Leg? Analyst Forecasts $10 Target For Potential Breakout Ethereum Eyes Last Major Resistance Over the past week, Ethereum has had a remarkable performance, jumping nearly 30% to a multi-year high of $4,750 on Wednesday afternoon, just 3.3% away from its ATH of $4,848, recorded in November 2021. Notably, the King of Altcoins has seen a 40% recovery from the start-of-month pullback, finally breaking from its local range and reclaiming the crucial $4,000 barrier last Friday. Since then, ETH has continued to soar, reclaiming the $4,400-$4,500 area on Tuesday. The cryptocurrency has been hovering between $4,600-$4,750 throughout the day, while attempting to break out of this range to potentially tackle “the final boss” of resistance around the $4,800 area. Analyst Rekt Capital discussed ETH’s recent performance, highlighting that it had successfully broken out of its multi-year resistance and turned it into support after its post-breakout retest at the start of the month, which has enabled the current move to the final Macro Range, between $3,762 and $4,631, that could precede new highs. However, he noted that the altcoin’s price “historically upside wicked beyond this final major Weekly/Monthly resistance for 3 straight weeks in a row” last cycle. As the analyst explained, in late 2021, Ethereum was rejected from the $4,631 resistance after hitting its ATH and attempting to turn it into support in the weekly timeframe, which was followed by an 80% retracement. This suggests that “how ETH treats $4,631 over the coming days will be pivotal” for the cryptocurrency’s upcoming performance, as it could potentially hit a new ATH but get ultimately rejected. Therefore, weekly closing above the Macro Range breakout level is crucial to “go against the grain of history.” Is A Rejection Next? Holding the $4,630 mark on the first attempt “would be a huge signal of strength,” the analyst asserted, but warned that “more often than not, price tends to get rejected but in a shallower manner.” If Ethereum fails to reclaim this level, the King of Altcoins could see an 18% drop to the Macro Range lows, around the $3,762 support, which would fulfill a key recently opened CME Gap on ETH’s chart. The Weekly CME gap, created this week, sits between the $4,091-$4,261 area, leading Rekt Capital to suggest that a more volatile retest of the CME gap could briefly send the price to the Macro Range lows. Meanwhile, if Ethereum reclaims the final major weekly resistance as support, ETH’s price discovery rally above the $5,000 mark will be next.

Notably, Ali Martinez suggested that once the $4,800 barrier is turned into support, the cryptocurrency will be poised for a rally to the $5,200 and $6,400 levels, according to the MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,748, a 56% increase in the monthly timeframe.

Investors are now eyeing big moves as ETF approval talk spreads. The excitement has also helped Cardano and Litecoin join the day’s top gainers. MAGACOIN FINANCE traders are especially watching XRP because a strong ETF launch could shake up the altcoin rankings. A forecast from Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg is driving this optimism. He says XRP could see a huge rally if ETFs attract $5 billion in inflows within the first month. His firm is among those seeking approval to launch such a product. He shared his thoughts on the Paul Barron podcast. XRP ETF Advantages Over Ethereum ETFs McClurg explained why XRP ETFs may have a stronger appeal than Ethereum ETFs. Ethereum holders can stake ETH directly for 2% to 3% returns. That makes ETFs less attractive since staking rewards are not included. XRP has no staking option. Therefore, ETF buyers lose nothing compared to holding XRP directly. https://x.com/digitalassetbuy/status/1954247851741204661 He also said that Ethereum faces heavy competition from other smart contract networks. XRP, on the other hand, dominates the payments niche with fewer direct challengers. This leadership could draw more interest from traditional investors. Market analyst Dom noted that $61 million in buying pressure once boosted XRP’s market cap by $16.6 billion. That is a 272x multiplier. McClurg applied the same figure to his $5 billion inflow projection. His math suggests XRP’s market cap could jump by $1.36 trillion. At the moment, XRP trades at $3.15 with a market cap of $186.5 billion and 59.3 billion tokens in circulation. If his projection comes true, the market cap would hit $1.546 trillion. That could push the price near $26 per token. Cardano and Litecoin have also seen strong gains alongside XRP. Both coins are benefiting from renewed risk appetite in the altcoin market. Solana and XRP Whales Reallocating Into MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is starting to gain more attention in whale circles. Big holders of Solana and XRP are moving part of their portfolios into MAGACOIN FINANCE ahead of the next quarter. Solana and XRP whales reallocating into MAGACOIN FINANCE ahead of Q4 2025 altcoin opportunities has become a talking point in trading groups. Many believe MAGA could benefit from the same bullish wave that is lifting top altcoins. Conclusion Optimism around an XRP ETF is lifting sentiment across the cryptocurrency market. Cardano and Litecoin are among the altcoins gaining from this renewed interest. Analysts believe a major ETF launch could ignite more rallies in the months ahead. While XRP remains in focus, MAGACOIN FINANCE is also catching early attention from investors looking to ride the momentum.

Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to increase to a maximum level of $0.4724 in 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $4.67 The Pi Network is experiencing a wave of uncertainty as 268.4 million Pi tokens were unlocked in July 2025, marking the largest token release in the project’s history. The unlock began on July 4, this unlock has raised concerns around selling pressure and market instability, especially as the current Pi sentiment remains cautious. Historically, similar events have triggered sharp declines in Pi coin price, and with over $215 million worth of tokens entering the market, the downside risk remains significant.The Pi2Day 2025, ran from June 28 to July 7 and featured the highly anticipated Ecosystem Challenge. 2.6 million new users participated, exploring new releases such as Pi App Studio, Ecosystem Directory Staking, and updated Node tools. The event highlighted Pi’s growing ecosystem, with more than 21,700 dApps created and over 37.7 million PI staked to promote apps within the network .Despite this momentum, volatility has intensified. As of August 2, 2025, Pi has hit a new all-time low of $0.341, down 86.48% from its February high of $2.98 ,with a market cap of $3.14B, day trading volume of $91.35M, and an FDV of $40.52B.PI Still, has no major exchange listings or capital inflows, Pi’s short-term price trajectory may remain under pressure.

Support is forming at $0.3840, the session’s low, which is preventing further downside movement. Resistance is near $0.4047, the highest price reached in the latest period, acting as a barrier to short-term upward moves. On August 13, Pi Network (PI)showed a moderate rebounce, with its price up by 1.86% to close near $0.40. The move came after recent sideways trading, suggesting cautious buying interest at lower levels. Technical indicators showed mixed sentiment, with short-term strength. Pi 1-day price chart: Price consolidates below $0.40 resistance On 24hour price chart shows Pi/USDT opening at $0.3923, hitting a high of $0.4047, and a low of $0.3840 before closing at $0.3996, marking a 1.86% gain. The MACD is at a reading of 0.0067, showing moderate bullish pressure, but the MACD line at -0.0174 remained below the signal line at -0.0240. The RSI closed at 46.94, reflecting neutral momentum as price consolidates just below the $0.40 resistance zone. Pi/Usdt Chart By TradingView Pi/USDT 4-Hour Chart The Pi/USDT 4-hour chart opened at $0.3969, reaching a high of $0.4007, and a low of $0.3942 before closing at $0.3992, up by 0.60%. The MACD histogram posted a moderate negative reading of -0.0005, while the MACD line at 0.0018 above the signal line of 0.0024, indicating emerging short-term bullish momentum. The RSI stood at 54.76, signaling moderate buying pressure as the price holds above the $0.3950 support area.

From the current Pi price analysis, the next move will likely depend on whether buyers can push above the $0.4047 resistance zone. If Pi/USDT breaks and sustains above this level on strong volume, it could open the way toward the $0.4100–$0.4150 range. However, failure to clear resistance may see the pair drift back to test the $0.3950–$0.3900 support area. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.3610 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is the Pi price up today? Pi Network (PI) rose 3.17% in the past 24h, because of whale accumulation. A single wallet bought 984,914 PI ($393k) in 24h, signaling confidence. Technical rebound reclaimed key moving averages after a 7% weekly rally. Also there was a wide market-momentum where most altcoins gained as Bitcoin dominance fell to 58.7%. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to reach $10 by 2033. Recent Pi News/Opinions On July 25, 2025, Analyst Dr Altcoin pointed out in an X post that some Pi users are reporting compromised wallets and stolen passphrases.

Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited.

A monumental USDC transfer , totaling an astounding 276,310,577 USDC, recently landed on the popular exchange Binance . This massive cryptocurrency transaction , valued at approximately $276 million, was first brought to light by the vigilant blockchain tracking service, Whale Alert . Such a significant movement of funds always sparks curiosity and speculation within the market. What could this large crypto transfer signify for the broader digital asset landscape? When an “unknown wallet” moves such a substantial amount of a stablecoin like USDC to a major exchange, it immediately captures attention. Stablecoins like USDC are pegged to the US dollar, making them a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the volatile crypto markets. This particular event highlights the immense scale of activity occurring daily in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space and centralized exchanges. Understanding the Significance of a Large USDC Transfer Why does a transaction of this magnitude matter? A large crypto transfer , especially involving stablecoins, can have several potential implications. It’s not just about the raw dollar value; it’s about what such a move might signal about the intentions of a major holder, often referred to as a “whale.” Potential Selling Pressure: One common interpretation is that the funds are being moved to an exchange to be sold. If a whale intends to convert a large sum of USDC into other cryptocurrencies or even fiat currency, bringing it to an exchange is a necessary step. This could potentially increase liquidity for certain trading pairs or, if converted to fiat, reduce the circulating supply on exchanges. Market Making or Liquidity Provision: Alternatively, the funds might be intended for market-making activities. Whales often provide significant liquidity to various trading pairs, helping to facilitate smoother transactions and tighter spreads. By moving USDC to Binance, this entity could be preparing to engage in high-volume trading strategies. Arbitrage Opportunities: Large holders frequently look for arbitrage opportunities across different exchanges. Moving USDC to Binance could be a precursor to exploiting price discrepancies for other assets between Binance and other platforms. Strategic Asset Allocation: The transfer could simply be a strategic reallocation of assets. The unknown wallet might be consolidating funds, preparing for a new investment, or diversifying their portfolio within the Binance ecosystem. The precise motive behind this USDC transfer remains speculative without further on-chain data or official statements. However, the sheer volume ensures it’s a topic of keen interest for traders and analysts. How Does Whale Alert Track Such Cryptocurrency Transactions? Whale Alert plays a pivotal role in bringing these massive movements to public attention. But how do they do it? Whale Alert is an automated system that monitors large cryptocurrency transaction s across various blockchains. They scan for transactions exceeding a certain threshold, which helps identify significant fund movements by large holders or institutions. Their reporting is crucial for market transparency. By highlighting these large transfers, Whale Alert provides valuable insights that can help traders and investors understand potential shifts in market dynamics. It’s like having an early warning system for significant capital flows in the crypto space. The anonymity of the “unknown wallet” is typical in blockchain transactions, where addresses are public but the identity of the owner is not always disclosed. The Impact on Binance and the Broader Ecosystem The influx of such a large amount of USDC into Binance underscores the exchange’s position as a dominant player in the global crypto market. Binance consistently handles immense trading volumes, and this large crypto transfer further solidifies its role as a primary destination for significant capital. For Binance, receiving such a large sum means increased liquidity, which can benefit all users by enabling smoother and more efficient trading. What about the broader stablecoin ecosystem? USDC, issued by Circle, is one of the most widely used and trusted stablecoins. A substantial movement like this confirms its utility as a reliable medium for large-scale value transfer. It also highlights the ongoing demand for stablecoins as a safe haven or a transactional currency within the volatile crypto landscape. Such events reinforce the underlying infrastructure and trust in these digital assets. What Should Investors Consider After This Whale Alert? For everyday investors, a Whale Alert like this serves as a reminder to stay informed about market movements. While a single large transaction doesn’t necessarily dictate market direction, it’s an indicator of significant activity. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Market Reactions: Observe how the market reacts in the hours and days following such a transfer. Does it correlate with increased volatility in specific altcoins or Bitcoin? Research Deeper: If possible, look for any follow-up transactions from the receiving Binance wallet. While often obscured, sometimes patterns emerge. Understand Stablecoin Utility: Recognize that stablecoins are not just for stability but also for efficient large-scale transfers, often preceding significant market moves. Diversify and Manage Risk: Never put all your eggs in one basket. Large transfers can signal shifts, making risk management even more critical. In conclusion, the recent USDC transfer of over $276 million to Binance, as reported by Whale Alert, is a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often opaque nature of large-scale cryptocurrency movements. While the exact motives of the “unknown wallet” remain unconfirmed, such a large crypto transfer provides valuable insights into potential market activities, liquidity dynamics, and the continued prominence of major exchanges like Binance in the digital asset world. Staying vigilant and understanding the potential implications of these massive cryptocurrency transaction s is key for navigating the evolving crypto landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a USDC transfer? A USDC transfer refers to the movement of USD Coin (USDC), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, from one blockchain address to another. These transfers facilitate value exchange within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Why is a $276 million USDC transfer significant? A transfer of this size is significant because it involves a massive amount of capital, often indicating potential strategic moves by large holders (whales), which could influence market liquidity, trading activity, or even signal future intentions regarding other crypto assets. Who is Whale Alert? Whale Alert is a popular blockchain tracking service that monitors and reports large cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. Their alerts provide transparency into significant fund movements by whales and institutions. What does it mean if funds are transferred to Binance? When a large sum of funds like USDC is transferred to an exchange like Binance, it often suggests the holder intends to trade, sell, or utilize the funds for market-making, arbitrage, or other strategic allocations within the exchange’s ecosystem. Is this a common occurrence in crypto? While the exact amounts vary, large cryptocurrency transfers by whales are a regular occurrence in the crypto market. Whale Alert frequently reports such movements, highlighting the continuous flow of capital within the digital asset space. Did you find this analysis helpful?

While this prediction did not materialize, the number remained a recurring point of interest among XRP supporters. Diana notes that over time, speculation shifted from the belief that the number was strictly tied to price targets toward the idea that it might represent a sequence of events or a symbolic timeline connected to XRP’s future. THE 589 XRP CODE — DECODED What started as a wild $589 meme has evolved into a hidden roadmap backed by gematria, numerology, and eerie real-world coincidences. Here’s why 589 might be the most important number in XRP history pic.twitter.com/WgoRVAbGGD — Diana (@InvestWithD) August 13, 2025 Gematria and Symbolic Associations Diana’s breakdown of the theory incorporates elements of Hebrew gematria, a numerological system assigning numerical values to words and phrases. She highlights that the number 589 corresponds to “December Thirteenth,” “Donald Trump,” and “A Storm is Coming.” She suggests that these connections have taken on greater significance due to ongoing political developments and the potential impact of such events on the cryptocurrency market. In her view, the alignment between these gematria phrases and current geopolitical and financial shifts cannot be dismissed outright. Numerology and Market Phases The post also references numerology as another lens through which the 589 code can be interpreted. Diana associates the digits individually with key concepts: 5 representing change, 8 representing abundance, and 9 representing completion. She then applies this framework to XRP’s potential market trajectory, proposing that the number outlines a three-phase progression consisting of change, followed by a period of wealth creation, and concluding with the completion of a broader market cycle. Proposed Timeline and Potential Price Targets In addition to symbolic interpretations, Diana presents a speculative timeline for XRP’s price action based on the 589 code. She suggests that between September 10 and September 29, 2025, XRP could reach approximately $5, potentially linked to regulatory clarity. She then forecasts a move toward $8 on November 23, 2025, driven by anticipated institutional involvement in the market. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The final stage, according to her outline, would occur on December 13, 2025, where XRP could hit $9. This final date is notable because of its direct connection to the gematria phrase “December Thirteenth,” which she views as the symbolic conclusion of the cycle. Diana emphasizes what she calls “the convergence” of multiple factors, such as political developments, symbolic dates, and projected market phases, which all tie back to the number 589 . She notes that “Donald Trump” equating to 589 in gematria aligns with the possibility of his presidency overlapping with these projected market events. Likewise, “A Storm is Coming” is tied to expectations of a market shake-up before the final rally. In her assessment, the frequency of these overlaps lends weight to the idea that 589 is more than a meme, but rather a coded sequence potentially playing out in real time. Diana concludes her explanation by questioning whether the XRP community is currently living through the 589 prophecy, leaving open the possibility that it may represent an unfolding roadmap rather than a past prediction.

This significant disparity, particularly as BTC hits record highs, offers crucial insights into the evolving landscape of digital assets adoption and institutional engagement. The Striking Disparity in Bitcoin Holdings Recent findings from The Maeil Business Newspaper highlight an incredible gap in national Bitcoin reserves. The United States now holds nearly 16 times more Bitcoin than South Korea. This isn’t just a minor difference; it represents a fundamental divergence in how these nations are engaging with the leading cryptocurrency. A comprehensive survey, spanning cryptocurrency exchanges, government agencies, companies, and ETFs in both countries, shows the sheer scale of this divide. The U.S. boasts a staggering 3,587,163 BTC in total holdings. In contrast, South Korea’s total stands at 218,076 BTC, which is approximately 6.1% of the U.S. total. This data underscores a significant imbalance in global crypto market influence and investment. How US Bitcoin ETFs Transformed the Landscape What caused this gap to widen so dramatically? The answer lies predominantly in the introduction of US Bitcoin ETFs . The launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds in January last year proved to be a game-changer, fundamentally reshaping the investment landscape. Before the ETF debut, the U.S. held 1,657,697 BTC. This was already roughly eight times more than South Korea’s holdings at the time. Post-ETF launch, American holdings saw an additional influx of 1.29 million BTC. These investment vehicles made it significantly easier for institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. This accessibility fueled a massive accumulation phase in the U.S. Consequently, the ETFs acted as a powerful catalyst, accelerating U.S. Bitcoin acquisition at an unprecedented pace. South Korea’s Position in the Global Digital Assets Arena While the U.S. saw a surge, South Korea’s accumulation remained relatively stable in comparison. This raises important questions about regulatory environments, investor sentiment, and market infrastructure in the region. South Korea has a vibrant crypto community and a strong interest in digital assets , yet its institutional adoption pathways might differ. Key considerations for South Korea include: Regulatory Frameworks: The pace and nature of regulatory approvals for crypto investment products can significantly impact institutional inflows. Market Maturity: While retail crypto trading is robust, the development of sophisticated institutional products like spot ETFs might be slower. Investor Preferences: Local investment habits and preferences might lean towards direct crypto ownership or other asset classes. Understanding these factors is crucial for assessing South Korea’s future trajectory in the global Bitcoin landscape. Navigating the Digital Assets Landscape: What’s Next? The vast difference in Bitcoin holdings between these two nations underscores the impact of regulatory clarity and accessible investment vehicles. For investors and market watchers, this data highlights the growing institutionalization of Bitcoin, particularly in jurisdictions with supportive regulatory frameworks. What could this mean for the future of the crypto market ? Global Race for Bitcoin: Other nations might accelerate efforts to create similar investment products to attract capital and boost their own reserves. Policy Influence: South Korea and other countries might look to the U.S. ETF model as a blueprint for expanding their institutional crypto offerings. Market Stability: Increased institutional participation could potentially lead to greater market stability and broader acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. The current scenario serves as a powerful case study in how financial innovation can rapidly reshape the distribution of digital wealth globally. The remarkable divergence in Bitcoin holdings between the U.S. and South Korea is a testament to the transformative power of accessible investment products like spot ETFs. As the U.S. continues to accumulate vast amounts of Bitcoin, it reinforces its position as a dominant player in the global crypto market. This trend encourages other nations, including South Korea, to evaluate their strategies for integrating digital assets into their financial ecosystems. The journey of Bitcoin’s mainstream adoption is clearly picking up pace, driven by innovative financial instruments and evolving regulatory landscapes. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the primary reason for the large disparity in Bitcoin holdings between the U.S. and South Korea? The main reason is the launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in January last year. These ETFs made it significantly easier for institutional and retail investors to invest in Bitcoin, leading to a massive accumulation of over 1.29 million BTC in American holdings. Q2: How much more Bitcoin does the U.S. hold compared to South Korea? According to The Maeil Business Newspaper, the U.S. holds nearly 16 times more Bitcoin than South Korea. The U.S. total is 3,587,163 BTC, while South Korea holds 218,076 BTC. Q3: Did the U.S. always have significantly more Bitcoin than South Korea? Before the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs debuted, the U.S. held approximately 1,657,697 BTC, which was already about eight times more than South Korea’s holdings at that time. The ETFs dramatically widened this existing gap. Q4: What are US Bitcoin ETFs? US Bitcoin ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin without directly owning the cryptocurrency. They trade on traditional stock exchanges, offering a regulated and accessible way to invest in digital assets. Q5: What could South Korea do to potentially increase its Bitcoin holdings? South Korea could explore introducing its own regulated spot Bitcoin ETFs or similar investment products to provide easier access for institutional and retail investors. Additionally, fostering a clear and supportive regulatory environment for digital assets could encourage more investment and accumulation. Share This Insight!

These 2 Coins Could Be Better Buys Than Shiba Inu",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/shib-chart-turns-bullish-start-of-a-comeback-or-just-a-dead-cat-bounce-these-2-coins-could-be-better-buys-than-shiba-inu,"As the Shiba Inu (SHIB) chart shows a notable 2.57% increase in the past 24 hours, traders are wondering: Is this the beginning of a serious rebound, or just another short-term ""dead cat bounce""? With the price currently at $0.00001267, Shiba Inu has been climbing steadily from its recent low of $0.00001234, suggesting some renewed optimism. Investors looking for better opportunities in the meme coin space might want to keep an eye on two emerging competitors that are quickly gaining traction: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) and its innovative Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 blockchain, and the rapidly growing token backed by strong security and community involvement. Shiba Inu: Short-Term Bullish Momentum, But Potential Resistance Ahead SHIB is indicating near-term bullish activity in its price action. Trading volume increased by 122.98% over the last 24 hours, indicating an increase in interest in the market. The recent growth in the price of SHIB is comparable to the growth in the overall market value of the asset, which currently stands at $7.53 billion as the market cap. Investors are, however, advised to be wary of SHIB, which is set to touch possible resistance points of the price in the range of $0.0000127. Cardano (ADA) Shows Bullish Momentum with 3.73% Increase Cardano (ADA) has recorded a 7.44% surge and is trading at around $0.7906 . This is shown by the bouncing of the price at the relatively low price of $0.7413 following a bullish direction with an increase in the market sentiment. The increase in volume was 102.46%, which was a sign of greater market participation. There was also an increasing market cap to 28.01 billion, which further strengthens the momentum in the upswing of ADA. Nonetheless, ADA may meet some resistance at a mark of about $0.792 that may restrict its increase in the short term. Conversely, there is support at $0.7376, and as long as this support holds, ADA could have a bullish price run. Little Pepe: A Meme Coin With Real Utility LILPEPE is unlike many other meme coins that use solely hype. The memecoin is becoming a serious crypto project by launching its Ethereum-compatible layer-2 chain. This latest innovation makes Little Pepe have an advantage over other meme tokens since the currency has higher transaction speeds, reduced costs, and improved scalability. This is an essential set of features of a project that is based on high levels of community participation and active trading. The reason most people are talking about Little Pepe isn’t just because it taps into meme culture, but also due to its focus on utility and infrastructure. Built on a Layer-2 Ethereum-compatible blockchain, it enables decentralized applications (dApps), liquidity pools, and other features that help establish a healthy ecosystem where both users and developers can participate. Additionally, with anti-sniper bot protection, LILPEPE aims to create a fair trading environment by preventing automated bots from manipulating token issuances and market activity. With the stage 10 presale of LILPEPE nearing completion and more than 11.59 billion tokens already sold, the demand for LILPEPE is undeniable. Currently priced at $0.0019, the token price is set to increase to $0.0020 in the next stage, offering an incentive for early investors to buy now. CertiK Audit: Proven Security for Investors Besides innovative blockchain features, Little Pepe has also been through a CertiK audit, which is one of the most well-regarded security-side verifications in the crypto world. LILPEPE is demonstrating its intentions concerning security and transparency with its strong audit score of 95.49%. The audit includes the functionality of smart contracts, the known vulnerabilities, and the compliance to the ERC-20 standard, so that investors are confident that they can deal with the Little Pepe ecosystem. Why Little Pepe Might Be Superior to SHIB as a Purchase The advantage of the market demand, a successful presale, and a safe, scalable, layer-2 infrastructure put Little Pepe ahead of the pack of meme coins.

The duo sealed the initiative through a signed memorandum of understanding at a business forum in Seoul attended by corporate leaders from both nations. Dunamu, which operates South Korea’s crypto exchange platform, Upbit, hopes to export Korea’s exchange model and technology into Vietnam. MB Bank was founded in 1994 as a Ministry of National Defense subsidiary and ranks among Vietnam’s five largest banks. Vietnam eyes Dunamu due to its proven expertise on Upbit MB Bank, which serves 33 million customers with total assets nearing 50 million, agreed that Dunamu will serve as its key strategic partner. According to local media outlet The Korea Herald, the Upbit operator will offer its advisory capabilities on regulatory compliance, investor protection, and talent development. The Vietnamese government tapped into Dunamu due to its proven expertise on Upbit, where it transformed the exchange to help shape Korea’s broader crypto ecosystem. The company’s vice chair and co-founder, Kim Hyuong-nyon, pledged Dunamu’s commitment to Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh towards the country’s crypto industry. At the time of publication, Upbit has nearly $4 billion in trading volume in the last 24 hours, and manages over $11 billion in digital assets. Vietnam ranked on Chainalysis Statista as the 5th globally in overall interest in cryptocurrencies. The country also has the fifth-largest inflow of blockchain-based assets, with over 20 million crypto holders and over $800 billion in trading volume. “When this growth potential meets the Upbit model, it will be a chance to build not just an exchange but Vietnam’s entire digital financial infrastructure on a foundation of trust.” -Oh Kyoung-suk, CEO of Dunamu. MB Bank Chair Luu Trung Thai also acknowledged that the financial institution will work with Upbit as a trusted partner to advance Vietnam’s digital finance market. On-chain data showed that Upbit has a 65% market share coming from South Korea. Dunamu also stated that Upbit has a trading volume of $1.1 trillion, ranking it third globally. Sogang University professor Yoon Seok-bin said Dunamu was one of the most profitable companies in Korea in terms of operating margin. He argued that the company should tap into the global markets to continue its growth momentum. The professor also believes that Vietnam is the right choice since it is expected to experience rapid growth in the digital asset markets. Vietnam approves crypto legislation The Vietnamese government also approved the Law on Digital Technology Industry on June 14, which brought digital assets under regulatory oversight. The country’s National Assembly said the legislation will take effect on January 1, 2026. Vietnam also passed a draft framework to legalize the pilot operation of digital asset exchanges, which will be realized by August. Deputy Minister of Finance Nguyen Duc Chi said at the government’s Wednesday conference that the initiative on crypto assets had been completed. Chi acknowledged that the criteria of market participants, technical conditions, financial capacity, operation procedures, and expertise of service providers were already established. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, Vietnam launched its own national blockchain platform, NDAChain. The Vietnamese government also passed a resolution on the establishment of an international financial center (IFC). It said the project’s resolution is being finalized and submitted to the government for approval and is expected to be issued within August or September. Chi also mentioned that the pilot phase will allow several exchanges to operate in order to create a healthy competitive environment. Deputy head of the Market Development Department, To Tran Hao, revealed that the draft would set strict regulations for establishing businesses providing digital asset services. The draft indicates that the management of virtual assets will focus on trading, transfers, and anti-money laundering measures.

Back then, that money would have bought you about 3.57 trillion SHIB tokens. Now, let's skip ahead to August 2025, when SHIB is selling for about $0.00001233. At that price, your tiny 2020 buy would mean your $200 is now worth about $44.01 million. This dramatic increase is a clear example of how meme coins can deliver astonishing results. SHIB once peaked even higher, but with its current price around 86% lower than that all-time high, it shows how quickly values can swing in crypto. Still, SHIB made millionaires out of early believers. The question now is: What could be the next SHIB? Two meme coins have recently captured attention for their explosive potential. One is already showing massive traction, and another is building serious hype among early adopters. At the top of this list is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin That’s Making Waves Before Its Launch Little Pepe (LILPEPE) isn’t just another frog-themed token; it’s the future face of meme coin innovation. Built on a Layer 2 blockchain tailored for meme-driven ecosystems, it offers lightning-fast transactions, ultra-low gas fees, and full support for dApps. This makes it perfect for both traders and builders in the meme coin space. The ongoing presale has been nothing short of explosive. Beginning at just $0.0010 in Stage 1, Little Pepe is now in Stage 10 at $0.0019, and each round has sold out quicker than the last. The project has already drawn millions of unique wallets, and with only 26.5% of the 100 billion tokens available in the presale, the demand has been off the charts. At the expected launch price of $0.0030, early buyers are already sitting on strong paper gains. But that’s just the beginning. With analysts forecasting a potential rally that could see LILPEPE mirror SHIB’s trajectory, some believe a $200 investment now could climb past $45 million by 2027 if similar growth plays out. Little Pepe isn’t riding the meme wave; it’s setting the tone for where meme coins are headed next. Anti-bot Architecture: Built with protective layers to stop sniper bots, Little Pepe ensures fairer launches and trading environments. Smart Community Building: The project is backed by multiple anonymous developers with a history of successful meme coin launches. Their marketing strategy has already resulted in LILPEPE being listed on CoinMarketCap before even hitting DEXs. Legendary Lore: Little Pepe’s story is gaining attention. From the “swamps of Solidity” and “jungles of JavaScript,” this hero frog symbolizes transparency, decentralization, and unstoppable green candles. A “CryptoWomb” Roadmap: With listings, staking features, NFT integration, and dApp partnerships on the schedule, LILPEPE is preparing for a major breakout post-launch. Crypto investors are noticing. Many are pouring capital into LILPEPE presale allocations, betting big on what could be the next historic meme coin pump. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): Cute Faces, Serious Gains While LILPEPE may be the freshest contender, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is another meme coin making waves. Priced around $0.0356, PENGU has already racked up a market cap of $2.25 billion, a sign that it’s more than just a cute face. The recent surge in trading volume, up 150% in 24 hours to $907 million, shows that investors are paying attention. Its breakout above $0.03 resistance now puts the coin on track to potentially soar, especially with whale interest increasing. Catalysts like the upcoming Pudgy Party game on the TON blockchain, and hints at a possible ETF filing with the SEC, have created a positive buzz that could carry PENGU even further, soaring your investment just like Shiba Inu did. The Next Big Breakout Meme coins continue to prove that they’re more than just jokes; they’re serious vehicles for growth when paired with timing, hype, and community momentum. For those hunting the next big breakout, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) offers early positioning, an unstoppable presale, and all the energy of a frog ready to leap over the moon. Add PENGU to the watchlist, but if you’re looking for something still under the radar, LILPEPE is where the noise is getting louder by the minute. $200 in SHIB made millionaires. Who’s next?

The giveaway not only brings in new investors but also sends out the message that the project will do everything to keep its user base loyal and long-term. Mutuum to Launch USD-Pegged Stablecoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The project has also undergone auditing by CertiK. Other than investor trust in integrity and honesty in the codebase, the auditing process being carried out is so that the project winds up developing a secure DeFi protocol. Mutuum Finance’s presale hype continues to build at an alarming rate, having already raised over $14.35 million in funds from over 15,200 investors. The token’s price has risen by 16.17% in the current stage to $0.035, with a further rise of 14.29% planned in the next stage at $0.04. Early investors are looking at in-excess-of-300%-post-launch returns backed by the project’s game-changing dual-layer lending protocol, upcoming USD-pegged stablecoin, and a verified 95.0 trust score with CertiK. Growth-sustaining, community-driven initiatives like a $100,000 giveaway and a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program complement the evidence of growth, security, and investor-focused promises made by the team.

In a market where stablecoin holders want more than just price stability, exchanges are stepping in with offerings that combine the reliability of stable assets with the opportunity to earn passive income. Two such products, BGUSD from Bitget and RWUSD from Binance, are emerging as popular choices. Both target a similar user base, but the way they operate, their transparency levels, and the freedom they grant to users reveal key differences. In many ways, BGUSD’s model doesn’t just stand apart from RWUSD, it sets a new benchmark for what a yield-bearing stable asset can be. A Quick Overview: What Are BGUSD and RWUSD? BGUSD is Bitget’s yield-bearing stable asset certificate, launched in May 2025. It’s backed by a diversified portfolio of tokenized U.S. Treasury funds, most notably Superstate’s USTB, and is fully integrated into the Bitget platform. RWUSD is Binance’s flexible-term yield product tied to real-world asset (RWA) yields. Crucially, it does not give users direct ownership of those assets.

This feature allows multiple transactions to be executed atomically as a single unit. This allows complex, multi-step transactions to either succeed completely or be completely rolled back. Ripple stated that this innovation will pave the way for new use cases such as atomic swaps, conditional token generation, and integrated fee management. Tests conducted by the RippleX performance team revealed the impact of Batch Transactions on ledger throughput, consensus latency, and resource utilization. The tests, conducted under different scenarios (“All or Nothing,” “Only One,” “Until Failure,” and “Independent” modes), examined transaction response times and potential bottlenecks. Furthermore, the goal was to maintain a network consensus latency of 5 seconds even under high transaction load. Related News: Binance Security Officer Explains the Biggest Threat Facing Cryptocurrencies According to test results, the addition of Batch Transactions did not negatively impact XRPL's total ledger throughput. However, it was noted that Batch packages containing a maximum of eight subtransactions could significantly burden the network's transaction throughput. Ripple stated that this potential impact should be considered in performance decisions. There is currently no clear information on when the new feature will be added to the XRP network. *This is not investment advice.

Surpassing $12.8 million in funding in record time amid massive retail and whale demand, experts consider it the best new crypto to invest in. Its projected 415% rally from $0.009 to $0.05 makes it a bullish wave not to miss. The BNB Coin Approaches a New High; Is a Pullback Close? As the overall crypto market cap increased, exceeding $4 trillion, so did the BNB coin price. The exchange-based token surged by 10% over the past seven days to $830, approaching a breakout above its July ATH of $859. With daily trading volume surpassing $2.8 billion (a 2% increase) and a broader market rally, the BNB coin could enter price discovery soon. However, despite the optimistic token price outlook, technical indicators, notably the RSI and MACD, suggest it is in an overbought area and could decline. Nevertheless, a sustained rally, plus accelerating momentum, could send the BNB coin price higher, echoing Josh’s $920 target. However, if current support is lost, the altcoin price could retest its 30-day low of $675. Cardano Crypto to $1 Soon? The Layer-1 crypto ADA skyrocketed, marked by a 15% increase in the Cardano crypto price to $0.8. Surging forward, the market cap has also increased by 7% to $29.7 billion, cementing its position among the top 10 cryptocurrencies. At the same time, the daily token trading volume has exceeded $2 billion (a 40% increase). As momentum accelerates, a breakout above $1 seems imminent, presenting a bullish and optimistic price outlook. Meanwhile, a breakout above $0.9 could ignite a significant run, positioning the Cardano crypto among the altcoins to watch. Furthermore, according to Messari , mindshare is “very high,” rising by 13% in the past week. This on-chain metric suggests growing investor interest and positions the Cardano crypto for higher upside. However, a dip below $0.75 could ignite a cascading sell-off toward $0.68, its 30-day low. Unilabs Finance (UNIL) — Can This New AI Token Outshine Top Altcoins? Following a 142% rally from $0.004 to $0.009, its current price in the sixth ICO stage, Unilabs Finance (UNIL) has been on investors’ radars. Still in its early stages, participation in the presale will yield a 415% gain at the listing price of $0.05, making it arguably the best new crypto to invest in. With many looking beyond its anticipated gain, another of its biggest attractions is its bullish narrative. Compared to other DeFi protocols, Unilabs Finance (UNIL) intersects with artificial intelligence and traditional finance. It will be the world’s first AI-driven DeFi asset manager, poised to reshape the financial landscape and primed for adoption. As it nears its debut, experts are optimistic about it outshining other protocols in the DeFAI category. For instance, while SUPRA has a $70 million market size and PAAL has a $110 million market cap, UNIL is on track for massive growth. This is because of features like staking and governance, as well as the sharing of 30% of the generated fees to token holders. Closing Thoughts Amid soaring presale demand, the UNIL ICO has crossed $12.8 million in funding and skyrocketed by 142%. With a 415% increase programmed on the launch day at $0.05, experts believe it is the best new crypto to invest in, potentially outshining the BNB coin and Cardano crypto.

Active addresses reach 42,309 as trading volume jumps to 2.21 billion ADA during the rally. $5.8M in short liquidations push ADA higher after the price crosses the $1.00 level. Cardano Surge Clears Key Trendline Cardano (ADA) has moved above a descending trendline that had held since late 2024. This move came with a weekly gain of over 22% at one point, which helped ADA surge to just over $1. The trendline break appears on strong volume, showing firm activity around this level. Meanwhile, the breakout marks ADA’s best weekly performance in several months. The price now sits above former resistance, and traders are watching to see if it can stay there. A close above this level over the coming days may support a further move up the chart. CryptoPulse shared price levels that may serve as possible targets if the breakout continues. These are $1.13, $1.31, and $1.54. Each of these lines up with zones that acted as support or resistance in past trading periods. ADA is also near the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $0.92, which may slow price movement in the short term. Cardano Weekly Outlook $ADA has broken above its descending trendline and is showing strong momentum this week (+22%). If buyers can hold this breakout, the path toward higher targets looks promising. Targets: TP1: $1.13 TP2: $1.31 TP3: $1.54 Invalidation: Drop back… pic.twitter.com/HB9XsJcgKP — CryptoPulse (@CryptoPulse_CRU) August 14, 2025 If buyers push through $0.92, the chart shows possible next steps toward $1.07, $1.28, and $1.63. On the downside, traders are watching $0.80. A move below this level may indicate that the breakout has failed, and the price could drop back toward the $0.55 to $0.60 zone, which served as support earlier in the year. Network Use and Volume Rising Recent network data from Santiment shows a sharp rise in usage. Daily active addresses reached 42,309, and 24-hour trading volume climbed to 2.21 billion ADA. Both figures show growing interest in the network and in ADA’s price move. Source: Santiment At the same time, development activity has dropped to 25.76, the lowest since early July. While users and traders are more active, work on the codebase has slowed during this period. Shorts Liquidated as Price Surges According to Coinglass, ADA liquidations totaled $5.79 million on August 14. Most of this came from short positions, with $4.83 million in losses. Longs saw around $956,000 cleared. The sharp move above $1.00 forced many traders out of their bearish bets, adding fuel to the rally. Source: Coinglass Meanwhile, Grayscale has created a Delaware-based trust for ADA. This has led to new discussion around a possible spot ETF tied to the asset, which some traders see as a sign of growing interest from institutions.

Chainlink is the number one winner from the institutionalization of crypto and the explosive growth of stablecoins, tokenization, and real-world assets (RWAs), he added. The network is primely positioned for the multitrillion-dollar shift to tokenized RWAs, serving as the essential oracle infrastructure that all tokenized assets require to bring their value on-chain. Chainlink Is A Top Bet There are several factors that could drive explosive growth for Chainlink. Firstly, the massive expansion of the tokenized RWA sector is now worth more than $25 billion. Even the POTUS is pumping RWAs. IT’S HAPPENING!!! pic.twitter.com/MFFTQq5c5J — Real World Asset Watchlist (@RWAwatchlist_) August 13, 2025 Additionally, institutions recognize that the legacy SWIFT system is slow and broken, and they don’t want fulfillment fragmentation, he said before adding: This is why Wall Street giants like BlackRock are pushing for tokenization and why corporations like Stripe and Circle are building their own chains. “The fragmented, multi-chain world requires a universal translator, and Chainlink provides the solution.” Chainlink has an 84% market share of the oracle market on Ethereum and a 68% market share across all of DeFi, positioning it as the industry standard for price oracles. Deutscher concluded that Chainlink already has TradFi integrations and has a robust tokenomics model that generates a flywheel effect with a “perpetual, automated buyback mechanism, turning adoption directly into buying pressure.” More DeFi adoption of Chainlink —-> More LINK in the Chainlink Reserve More TradFi adoption of Chainlink —-> More LINK in the Chainlink Reserve As Chainlink scales in adoption, so does the Chainlink Reserve. pic.twitter.com/Q4JzLOji3S — Chainlink (@chainlink) August 13, 2025 “It’s hard to know what the winning layer-1 will be, especially with the raft of new corporate chains entering the market, and we also don’t know what the winning RWA DApp will be,” he said before concluding: “But we know that Chainlink is powering it all. It becomes the ultimate pick-and-shovel play.” LINK Price Outlook LINK prices have returned to $24 over the past day or so, adding a whopping 50% since the beginning of the month, just two weeks ago. Analysts are now talking about three-figure price targets, but LINK remains down 55% from its May 2021 all-time high of $52.70, so it has a long way to go. The asset now needs to break resistance at $30, where it was last halted in December. Meanwhile, on-chain activity has also surged with the most active LINK addresses in 8 months, and most whale transactions in 7 months, reported Santiment.

This substantial movement of funds, reported by the popular blockchain tracker Whale Alert , saw 276,310,577 USDC move from the major exchange Binance to an unknown crypto wallet . Such a significant crypto transaction naturally sparks curiosity and speculation within the digital asset community, prompting questions about its purpose and potential implications. What Just Happened? Decoding the Massive USDC Transfer On a recent date, Whale Alert , a prominent blockchain tracking service renowned for its real-time notifications, flagged a colossal transaction. This involved the transfer of precisely 276,310,577 USDC. USDC, or USD Coin, is a leading stablecoin designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged 1:1 with the US dollar. The funds originated from Binance , which consistently ranks among the world’s largest and most active cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volume. The destination of this immense sum was an address identified only as an unknown crypto wallet . The sheer scale of this USDC transfer , equating to roughly $276 million, makes it a noteworthy event in the ongoing saga of large on-chain movements. It immediately raises questions about the motivations behind such a significant shift of capital. Transaction Amount: 276,310,577 USDC moved. Origin Point: Binance exchange. Destination: An unidentified crypto wallet address. Approximate Value: $276 million USD. The Role of Whale Alert and Binance in Crypto Transactions Whale Alert plays an indispensable role in providing transparency within the often-opaque blockchain ecosystem. By diligently monitoring and reporting large cryptocurrency movements, it empowers the community to track significant fund flows. These reports can sometimes precede major market shifts, indicate institutional activity, or simply highlight the vast scale of wealth transfer occurring on blockchains. Its timely alerts on key crypto transactions ensure that even massive movements are brought to public attention. Meanwhile, Binance stands as an undisputed titan in the crypto space, facilitating billions of dollars in trades and transactions daily. As a central hub for trading, holding, and staking digital assets, it is common to observe substantial transfers originating from or destined for its extensive network of wallets. However, a USDC transfer of this magnitude, especially when directed to an unknown crypto wallet , always warrants closer examination and analysis from market observers. Unraveling the Mystery: Who Owns the Unknown Crypto Wallet? The identity behind an unknown crypto wallet receiving such a substantial USDC transfer remains the primary point of discussion and speculation. While blockchain transactions offer unparalleled transparency regarding addresses and amounts, the actual owners of these pseudonymous addresses are often not publicly known. Several plausible possibilities exist for such a significant movement: Institutional Investor Activity: A large investment fund, hedge fund, or corporation might be moving assets for strategic rebalancing, a major acquisition, or to prepare for a large investment into other digital assets. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deal Settlement: This could represent the settlement of a private, off-exchange transaction between two large parties. OTC desks facilitate massive deals to avoid impacting market prices on public exchanges. Exchange Internal Relocation: Although Whale Alert typically distinguishes these, it’s possible Binance or another major exchange is moving funds between its own cold storage, hot wallets, or operational reserves for security or liquidity management. Market Maker Adjustments: A large market-making entity could be adjusting its liquidity positions across various platforms or consolidating funds. High-Net-Worth Individual (Whale): A wealthy individual might be consolidating their digital assets, preparing for a significant investment, or simply moving funds for personal security reasons. Determining the exact purpose of this particular crypto transaction without further information is inherently challenging. However, the movement of a stablecoin like USDC often suggests a strategic decision focused on preserving value or facilitating large settlements, rather than pure speculative trading. Implications of Large-Scale USDC Transfers on the Market While a large USDC transfer itself does not directly impact the price of volatile cryptocurrencies, its sheer scale can sometimes signal broader market sentiment or upcoming strategic moves. For instance, if a significant amount of stablecoins moves off exchanges to an unknown crypto wallet , it could imply preparation for large investments into other cryptocurrencies, signaling potential bullish sentiment. Conversely, it could also represent a move to stable assets for enhanced security or future deployment, suggesting a cautious stance. This particular crypto transaction from Binance underscores the continuous and dynamic flow of capital within the digital economy. It also highlights the inherent transparency of public blockchains, where even massive movements are meticulously recorded, yet the identity of the transacting parties often remains obscured by pseudonymity. The event serves as a powerful reminder of the intricate and sometimes enigmatic nature of large-scale fund movements in the fast-evolving crypto world. In conclusion, the recent USDC transfer of $276 million from Binance to an unknown crypto wallet , meticulously reported by Whale Alert , is a testament to the immense value and constant activity within the cryptocurrency market. While the exact purpose and ultimate owner of the destination wallet remain a mystery, such significant crypto transactions are always worth monitoring closely for potential insights into broader market trends or the strategic maneuvers of major players. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is USDC? USDC (USD Coin) is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, meaning its value is designed to remain consistently at $1.00. It is fully backed by reserves of US dollars and short-duration US government treasuries, making it a popular choice for traders seeking stability in the volatile crypto market. What is Whale Alert? Whale Alert is a popular service that tracks and reports large cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains in real-time. It provides insights into significant movements by “whales” – large holders of cryptocurrencies – which can sometimes influence market sentiment. Why are large crypto transfers to unknown wallets significant? Large transfers to unknown crypto wallets are significant because they involve substantial sums of money whose purpose is not immediately clear. These movements can represent institutional activity, OTC deals, security transfers, or even preparations for major investments, all of which can potentially impact market dynamics or indicate strategic shifts by major players. Can the owner of an unknown crypto wallet be identified? While blockchain transactions are public, the identity of the wallet owner is often pseudonymous. Unless the wallet is linked to a known entity (like an exchange with KYC/AML policies) or the owner publicly reveals their identity, tracing the real-world individual or entity behind an unknown crypto wallet is generally very difficult. Does this USDC transfer affect the crypto market price? Directly, a USDC transfer (a stablecoin) does not usually cause price fluctuations in volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. However, such a large movement can indirectly signal potential future activity. For example, if the funds are moved to an exchange, it might suggest an intent to buy other cryptocurrencies, potentially creating upward price pressure. What is the difference between a hot and cold wallet? A hot wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet connected to the internet, offering convenience for frequent transactions but with higher security risks. A cold wallet (or cold storage) is offline, providing enhanced security against hacks but is less convenient for quick access. Large transfers often involve movements between these types of wallets for security purposes. Enjoyed this article? Share it with your friends and fellow crypto enthusiasts!

Younger heirs are more comfortable with digital assets, access is smoother through ETFs and on-chain funds, and the infrastructure around custody and reporting finally looks institutional grade. If even a modest slice of this inheritance wave lands in crypto, the next decade will not look like the last. A number of ETH whales are also carving out allocations to MAGACOIN FINANCE as a high-ROI opportunity heading into the next upcycle. What the $4.6 Trillion Math Actually Say Tephra Digital reinterpreted UBS’s $75 trillion wealth transfer projection over the next two decades as a major potential inflow for cryptocurrencies. The model will initially allocate 1% in 2025, increase linearly to 10% in 2049, and average approximately $183 billion per year – money that will flow into digital assets. To give some perspective, in 2024, approximately $38 billion was put into spot Bitcoin ETFs in terms of net inflows. A longer-term, programmatic part of the allocation of hundreds of thousands of billions annually would be a difference of order. Some observers think the ceiling is higher. A Bank of America datapoint highlighted that a large share of affluent American millennials prefer crypto over traditional assets. Why Younger Money Goes Digital The same way is pointed by surveys. The investment by millennials often puts crypto at or near the top of their portfolio, and the wider mood is turning toward acceptance of Bitcoin in a modern reserve cocktail. Including the possibility of tastes changing, the trend over the years has been the same, which is relevant when one considers the time horizon in decades. Institutions are Signaling With Actions, Not Just Words Legacy finance is no longer on the sidelines. BlackRock went from skepticism to leadership, now operating the largest Bitcoin ETF and a sizable on-chain money market fund. The takeaway is practical rather than ideological. Access is easier, reporting is cleaner, and the rails are familiar to pensions, endowments, and family offices. This lowers the friction for incremental allocation as inheritances are rebalanced. Focusing on Major Early-Stage Opportunities In that context, there are a small number of richer ETH-holders looking at MAGACOIN FINANCE for incredible ROI opportunities. Smaller caps are more prone to react explosively in response to the introduction of new liquidity, and in the event everything aligns in 2025 and 2026, they represent a very small position with a lot of potential to move the needle without gaining more BTC and ETH exposure. How Does it Affect Market Structure The total crypto market sits near $4 trillion. A sustained inflow profile of the size Tephra modeled would deepen liquidity, fund more experimentation, and support wider adoption across retirement and wealth accounts. History suggests that flows drive prices. The 2024 ETF wave that brought in $38 billion coincided with sharp appreciation. How fast the allocations scale will be affected by policy and tax policy on inheritances, as well as how fast new ETFs are approved and the macro cycle. Changes of heart and survey responses are not etched in stone, however, and the fact that demographics, access, and institutional involvement gives a long-term argument in favor of gradual inflows and against short bursts. Conclusion The transfer of wealth is not a top-story; it is a timeline. The thesis is simple. In transferring ownership of capital to younger generations, crypto will enjoy both taste and usability. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the key ones, whereas newer ones such as MAGACOIN FINANCE present unbelievable opportunities upon the arrival of the following parabolic flame.

However, if the Manta price successfully breaks above $0.270, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.351. MANTAUSD Price Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Manta’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.191, resulting in a correction to $0.156. Is MANTA a good investment? Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price up today? Manta price has triggered a strong bullish rally toward $0.25. This occurred after buyers gained confidence and accumulated heavily around $0.21. Will Manta price recover? If bulls hold the price above $0.25, we might see further recovery toward immediate resistance channels. Will Manta price reach $10? In recent months, the Manta network expanded its offerings and established multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment, the MNT price might take several years to reach the $100 milestone. We expect the Manta price to achieve $100 by 2060. Will Manta reach $1000? $1000 is a distant dream for Manta price. However, if everything remains in favor of the altcoin market, we might even see the MNT price hitting $1K. Is Manta a good long-term investment? Investors are bullish on Manta, which has gained significant attention in recent months. If developers continue to build robust utilities for Manta and the roadmap fulfills user demand, it can be a good long-term investment option. Recent MANTA news/ opinions Kenny Li, one of the co-founders of Manta Network, was recently almost tricked by a phishing scam carried out by the well-known hacking group Lazarus. He talked about the incident in a post on X (formerly Twitter), describing how he came very close to being caught but managed to avoid it just in time. MANTA price prediction August 2025 If the altcoin market witnesses a surge in buying pressure this month, we might see a rebound in the MANTA price. In August, we expect Manta’s price to record a minimum of $0.17 and a maximum of $0.29. The average price is expected to be around $0.2. Manta Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Manta Price Prediction August 2025 $0.17 $0.2 $0.29 Manta price prediction 2025 Due to the impact of Bitcoin’s halving, Bitcoin and leading altcoins could reach new highs in 2025.

This particular movement involved 43,379 ETH, valued at approximately $205 million, moving from an unknown wallet to Ceffu. Whale Alert, a trusted blockchain tracking service, brought this colossal transaction to light, prompting discussions across the crypto community. Understanding the Colossal ETH Transfer When such a substantial amount of Ethereum changes hands, it naturally raises questions. This specific ETH transfer of 43,379 ETH is not just a number; it represents a significant chunk of value in the digital asset space. The sheer size of this large ETH transaction means it has the potential to influence market sentiment and liquidity. We often see these large movements, known as crypto whale activity , which are closely monitored by analysts and investors alike. The destination, Ceffu, also plays a crucial role in understanding the context of this transfer. What Does This Unknown Wallet to Ceffu Move Mean? The origin of the funds, an unknown wallet , adds an element of intrigue. While the identity of the sender remains private, such transfers often originate from institutional investors, over-the-counter (OTC) desks, or even large individual holders. They might be rebalancing portfolios or preparing for future transactions. The fact that the funds moved to Ceffu provides a vital clue. Ceffu is a prominent institutional-grade custody solution, offering secure storage and services for digital assets. This suggests the transfer is likely a strategic move by a large entity seeking secure, compliant custody for their Ethereum holdings. Analyzing Crypto Whale Activity Observing crypto whale activity offers insights into potential market shifts. When whales move large sums, it can sometimes signal upcoming buying or selling pressure, although not always directly. For instance, a move to a custodial service like Ceffu often indicates a long-term holding strategy rather than immediate market liquidation. These large transactions highlight the increasing institutional interest and participation in the Ethereum ecosystem. Understanding these movements helps us gauge the overall health and maturity of the crypto market. The Role of Ceffu in Large ETH Transactions Ceffu provides a secure, regulated environment for institutions to manage their digital assets. For a large ETH transaction like the one reported, using a trusted custodian minimizes risks associated with direct wallet management. Key benefits of using services like Ceffu include: Enhanced Security: Protecting assets from hacks and unauthorized access. Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to financial regulations, which is crucial for institutional players. Operational Efficiency: Streamlining the management of significant crypto holdings. Therefore, this ETH transfer to Ceffu points towards professional asset management. Navigating the Future of Ethereum Movements As the cryptocurrency market evolves, monitoring significant transfers like this ETH transfer becomes even more important. These movements reflect the growing confidence and sophisticated strategies employed by large players. While an unknown wallet sending funds to Ceffu doesn’t always signal immediate market action, it reinforces the narrative of increasing institutional adoption and the need for robust custodial solutions in the digital asset space. Staying informed about these developments allows us to better understand the broader trends shaping Ethereum’s future. In conclusion, the recent ETH transfer of 43,379 ETH to Ceffu, valued at $205 million, underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. This significant large ETH transaction , stemming from an unknown wallet , is a prime example of ongoing crypto whale activity . It highlights the growing importance of institutional-grade custody solutions like Ceffu for managing substantial digital asset holdings securely and compliantly. Keeping an eye on such movements provides valuable insights into the evolving landscape of the Ethereum network and the broader crypto ecosystem.

Key Takeaways: US spot Ethereum ETFs drew $729.1M on Wednesday, their second-largest daily inflow since launch. Ethereum ETFs have pulled $2.2B over three days, nearly seven times Bitcoin ETF inflows. ETH’s price hit $4,775, up 60% in a month, as institutional demand tightens supply. BlackRock’s ETHA led the day with $500.9 million in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FETH with $154.7 million. Four other Ether ETFs also saw positive flows, capping a three-day run that began with Monday’s record $1.02 billion inflow and continued with $523.9 million on Tuesday. Ethereum ETFs Pull $2.2B in Three Days, Outpacing Bitcoin Sevenfold Ethereum’s momentum is dwarfing Bitcoin’s. Data shows ETH ETFs attracted $704 million on Wednesday compared to just $86.7 million for Bitcoin funds. Over the past three days, Ethereum products have taken in $2.2 billion, nearly seven times the $330.9 million added to Bitcoin ETFs. The surge has pushed ETH’s price to $4,775 as of early Thursday, within 4% of its November 2021 all-time high near $4,900, per CoinGecko. The token is up more than 60% over the past month. The rally has punished bearish traders, with $127.4 million in short positions liquidated over 24 hours, according to CoinGlass. Spot eth ETFs post 3rd best inflow day ever… Over $700mil. 3 of top 6 inflow days since launch have come *this week*. $3bil new $$$ over past 7 trading sessions. On another heater. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) August 14, 2025 Institutional demand is contributing to a growing supply squeeze. Monthly Ethereum ETF inflows have reached $2.3 billion, equivalent to 500,000 ETH, while only 450,000 ETH has been issued since the September 2022 merge upgrade. Crypto treasury firms are also stepping up purchases. BitMine Immersion, the world’s largest corporate holder of Ethereum , disclosed plans to increase its fundraising target by $20 billion, to $24.5 billion in total, for further ETH acquisitions. The move marks a sharp expansion from its previous $4.5 billion stock offering. Buterin Warns Against Risks Behind ETH Treasury Boom While ETH’s latest run has been bolstered by institutional inflows and corporate treasuries holding Ether, Buterin has voiced caution over the trend. In a recent interview, he warned that excessive leverage within ETH treasuries could pose long-term risks. “If you woke me up three years from now and told me that treasuries led to the downfall of ETH… my guess would basically be that somehow they turned it into an overleveraged game,” he said. Meanwhile, Bitcoin advocate Samson Mow has suggested that Ethereum’s latest rally could be setting up a reversal , with capital eventually flowing back into Bitcoin. Mow, CEO of Bitcoin adoption firm Jan3, claimed that many long-term ETH holders , particularly early insiders from the ICO era, already own significant amounts of Bitcoin. According to him, these investors are rotating BTC into ETH to “pump it on new narratives” such as the emergence of Ethereum treasury companies. Once prices rise sufficiently, he predicts they will sell their ETH, leaving “new generational bagholders,” and move the profits back into Bitcoin. “No one wants ETH in the long run,” he said. He also warned that it could be “challenging” for Ether to surpass its previous all-time high, arguing that the closer the market gets to that psychological level, the stronger the incentive to sell, what he called the “Bagholder’s Dilemma.” The post Spot Ether ETFs See $729M in Second-Biggest Daily Inflows, Outperform Bitcoin ETFs appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|Bitcoin|ETFs|Ethereum,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-08-14 07:50:44

Recently, a truly enormous USDT transfer caught the attention of market watchers, sparking conversations across the digital asset space. This particular transaction involved an eye-watering 256,206,944 USDT, which equates to approximately $256 million, moving from an unidentified wallet directly to Ceffu. Such a substantial large crypto transfer always prompts questions about its origins and potential implications. What Just Happened? Decoding the Latest Whale Transaction Blockchain tracking service Whale Alert, known for reporting significant cryptocurrency movements, first brought this monumental USDT transfer to light. The report indicated that a staggering 256,206,944 USDT departed from an anonymous digital wallet. Its destination? Ceffu, a prominent institutional-grade custody solution. The transaction’s value stood at roughly $256 million. The sender’s wallet remains undisclosed, adding an element of mystery. The recipient, Ceffu, is a key player in institutional crypto services. This kind of movement is often referred to as a ‘ whale transaction ‘ because it involves an exceptionally large amount of cryptocurrency, typically held by a single entity or a group of entities with substantial holdings. Such transfers can often signal shifts in institutional strategies or significant market plays. Why Does a Large Crypto Transfer Matter to the Market? A large crypto transfer , especially one involving stablecoins like USDT, can carry significant weight for the broader crypto market impact . When hundreds of millions of dollars worth of digital assets move, it’s rarely without purpose. These movements can sometimes precede major buying or selling activities, or they might indicate institutional rebalancing of portfolios. Consider these potential reasons why such a transfer is noteworthy: Institutional Activity: Large transfers to custody solutions like Ceffu often suggest institutional involvement. Institutions require secure, compliant platforms for managing their digital assets. OTC Deals: These transactions could be part of an over-the-counter (OTC) deal, where large blocks of crypto are traded directly between parties without impacting exchange order books. Liquidity Provision: The funds might be moved to facilitate liquidity for new products, services, or even large-scale arbitrage opportunities. Understanding Ceffu’s Role in the Crypto Market Ecosystem The destination of this massive USDT transfer , Ceffu, is crucial to understanding the context. Ceffu is a secure, institutional-grade digital asset custody solution. It is closely affiliated with Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, and provides enterprise-level security and compliance for managing large volumes of digital assets. For the crypto market , entities like Ceffu are vital. They bridge the gap between traditional finance and the volatile crypto space, offering the security and regulatory adherence that large institutions demand. When funds move to Ceffu, it often suggests a strategic decision by a major player to either: Securely store assets for long-term holding. Prepare funds for deployment into various trading or investment strategies. Comply with regulatory requirements for asset management. This highlights the increasing maturity of the cryptocurrency industry, where specialized services are emerging to cater to the unique needs of institutional investors. Implications for the Crypto Market: What’s Next? While a single whale transaction doesn’t always dictate market direction, it certainly adds to the ongoing narrative and speculation within the crypto market . Such a significant USDT transfer could indicate an impending strategic move by a major entity. It might suggest preparations for a large investment in other cryptocurrencies, or perhaps a consolidation of assets for greater security. Market participants often monitor these large transfers for clues about future price action or shifts in market sentiment. While the direct impact on USDT’s peg to the dollar is minimal due to its stablecoin nature, the movement of such a large sum can influence broader liquidity and investor confidence. It serves as a reminder that behind the charts and prices, powerful entities are constantly making strategic decisions that shape the digital asset landscape. Ultimately, this substantial USDT transfer from an unknown wallet to Ceffu underscores the dynamic and often opaque nature of large-scale movements in the crypto world. It highlights the growing presence of institutional players and the critical role of secure custody solutions like Ceffu in managing significant digital asset holdings. As the crypto market continues to evolve, keeping an eye on these ‘whale’ movements remains a fascinating aspect of market analysis. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a ‘whale transaction’ in cryptocurrency? A ‘whale transaction’ refers to the movement of an exceptionally large amount of cryptocurrency, typically by an individual or entity (a ‘whale’) holding a significant portion of a particular digital asset. These transactions are often monitored closely for potential market impact. What is USDT and why is its transfer significant? USDT (Tether) is the largest stablecoin, pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Its transfer is significant because it represents real-world value moving on the blockchain, often indicating preparations for trading, investments, or liquidity provision in the crypto market.

It provides secure and compliant services for managing large volumes of cryptocurrencies for institutional clients, bridging traditional finance with the crypto ecosystem.

While many projects rely on speculation to drive targets, FUNToken’s approach combines a proven deflationary model, community-powered adoption, and a clear roadmap. Here is a closer look at why analysts and early supporters believe this path is more than wishful thinking. The First Milestone: How $0.10 Became Realistic Throughout 2025, FUNToken has laid the groundwork for the initial price leg up to $0.10, powered by several tangible achievements: Consistent BurnsIn June 2025 alone, 25 million tokens were burned, with future burns projected to grow as revenue scales. User Growth Through TelegramOver 105,000 active players are already using FUNToken’s Telegram bot . As more games launch, this number is expected to double. Expanding Wallet AdoptionThe project’s roadmap targets 500,000 wallets by the end of Q4 2025, creating a broad base of participants who transact daily. These fundamentals have created real upward price pressure, and reaching $0.10 is increasingly seen as the natural outcome of this progress rather than a speculative spike. What Will Drive the Next Phase to $0.33? Moving from $0.10 to $0.33 will require not just momentum but a different scale of adoption, engagement, and disciplined supply reduction. Here are the core drivers expected to power this next phase of growth: 1. Scaling the Game Catalog By early 2026, FUNToken plans to operate 30 or more live games across Telegram, iOS, and Android platforms. Each release has three important effects: Daily Active Transactions: Every new game generates thousands of daily micro-transactions, each contributing to platform fees and demand for FUN tokens. This steady activity base helps support liquidity and price floors. Revenue for Burns: As usage grows, so does platform revenue. This revenue is then recycled into quarterly buybacks, removing tokens from circulation in a predictable, transparent way. Referral Growth: New titles give existing players reasons to invite friends, further expanding the user base. Telegram’s built-in referral tools make it simple for users to share links and earn bonuses. With the roadmap targeting 10 million players by Q2 2026, the impact on demand could be substantial. No other gaming token project has laid out this level of detail for scaling both content and community. 2. The $5 Million Giveaway’s Ongoing Impact Unlike many promotional campaigns that last only a few weeks, the $5 million giveaway is structured to run over an extended period, rewarding not just early adopters but also those who stay engaged. This initiative drives growth in several ways: It incentivizes users to hold and stake their tokens, reducing circulating supply. It motivates new players to join, play, and refer friends to earn rewards. It creates sustained buzz across Telegram communities and social media channels. As more participants qualify for rewards, the program is expected to bring the community into the hundreds of thousands, increasing both awareness and transaction volumes. 3. Staking as a Scarcity Engine Staking will become a cornerstone of FUNToken’s strategy once the dedicated FUN Wallet app launches in the coming quarters. Here is why staking is so important: Predictable Lock-Ups: Tokens staked in smart contracts are effectively removed from the trading supply for a set period, reducing liquidity and sell pressure. Incentives to Hold: Players will have reasons beyond passive yields to stake, including access to exclusive games, higher rewards, and premium features. Accessibility: Integrating staking directly into the wallet app eliminates the need for separate DeFi platforms, making it easy for casual users to participate. If even 20–30% of the growing base of wallet holders stake some of their tokens, the cumulative impact on supply could be significant, supporting a sustained price climb toward $0.33. 4. Compounding Deflation One of FUNToken’s most powerful mechanics is its commitment to quarterly burns funded by real platform revenue. Over time, the effect of these burns compounds: Each quarter, fewer tokens remain in circulation. As the user base grows, the volume of burns increases. A smaller supply means each incremental buy order has more impact on price. In June 2025, the project burned 25 million FUN tokens. With the planned expansion in games, staking, and active users, future burns could grow substantially. Historically, this combination of shrinking supply and rising demand has been the catalyst for major price movements in other deflationary ecosystems. What the Timeline Looks Like Here is a simplified view of how this journey could unfold: Milestone Estimated Period Target Price Range $0.10 achieved Q4 2025 $0.08 – $0.10 1M wallets and 10M players Q2 2026 $0.15 – $0.20 Sustained burns and staking growth Q3 – Q4 2026 $0.25 – $0.33 While no outcome is guaranteed, this roadmap demonstrates a clear, staged approach to scaling both utility and token scarcity. What Sets FUNToken Apart Here are a few reasons FUNToken’s strategy is different from other gaming tokens: Proven ExecutionEvery major milestone so far has been delivered transparently. Accessible OnboardingWith frictionless Telegram integration and a simple wallet app, the project is attracting casual users, not just crypto traders. Community-Driven GrowthThe combination of staking, referrals, and the giveaway creates incentives for long-term holding and organic expansion. Final Thoughts FUNToken’s journey from $0.10 to $0.33 will depend on continued execution and community engagement. But unlike projects that rely on hype cycles, FUNToken’s fundamentals are rooted in measurable adoption, regular burns, and a roadmap the team has consistently delivered on. For investors and supporters watching closely, 2026 could be the year this unique combination of gaming, deflation, and community incentives translates into one of the most significant price surges in the Web3 space.

Data shared by popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez indicates that these large market participants have bought 320 million XRP in just three days, a fortune that is valued at roughly $1 billion at today’s prices. 320 million $XRP bought by whales in the last 72 hours! pic.twitter.com/i1Hx6qNKMq — Ali (@ali_charts) August 13, 2025 Such substantial purchases could have a multi-fold positive effect on the underlying asset’s price. After all, they reduce the immediate selling pressure and might serve as an example to retail investors who tend to follow whales’ moves. Recall that Ripple whales began to stack up considerable XRP portions in mid-July, which eventually led to an impressive price rally and a new all-time high above $3.60. However, they started to lock in some gains in the following days, and XRP dipped below $2.80 as a result. Such massive accumulations being the catalyst of price surges are not limited to Ripple’s cross-border token. Recall that Dogecoin and Cardano whales went on a buying spree in the past week as well. Those buying the meme coin purchased over a billion tokens in a single day earlier this month. At the time, DOGE traded at $0.20 before it soared by 25% to the current $0.25. ADA whales accumulated 200,000,000 coins at the beginning of the current business week, when the asset’s price struggled below $0.80. Since then, the token has soared to a multi-month peak of just over $1. XRP has been trailing behind the most recent broader crypto market rally, failing to copy the aforementioned gains or the price performances of BTC, which charted a new all-time high today, or ETH, which is inches away from its 2021 peak.

The deal signed on Tuesday is a structural game-changer for Vietnam’s crypto scene, following its recent legalization of digital assets . According to the Korea Herald , the partnership will bring Dunamu’s Korean exchange model and technology to its overseas-led initiative. The signing of the initiative saw crypto leaders from both nations. Dunamu will also serve as the advisor for MB Bank’s regulatory compliance, investor protection and talent development. “MB and Upbit will work together as trusted partners to advance Vietnam’s digital finance market,” said MB Bank Chair Luu Trung Thai. Vietnam Brings Crypto Under Formal Radar In June, the Southeast Asian nation passed the Law on Digital Technology Industry that defines, classifies and outlines crypto management. Vietnam has officially legalized crypto assets, introducing its first legal framework to regulate digital currencies and virtual assets. Here's what the new law covers. #Vietnam #CryptoLaw https://t.co/p3SC5jp9UL — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 16, 2025 The legislation came after years of regulatory ambiguity and international pressure, ever since Vietnam remained on the Financial Action Task Force’s “grey list.” The country was scrutinized for its lack of insufficient anti-money laundering safeguards around virtual assets. In July, Dunamu Vice Chair and co-founder Kim Hyoung-nyon met Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, promising that the company would commit to Vietnam’s digital economic cooperation. According to Oh Kyoung-suk, Dunamu CEO, Vietnam has potential with over 20 million crypto holders, $800 billion in trading volume. It is also the fifth-largest in the global crypto adoption index last year, per Chainalysis data . “When this growth potential meets the Upbit model, it will be a chance to build not just an exchange but Vietnam’s entire digital financial infrastructure on a foundation of trust,” Kyoung-suk added. Dunamu Sees Three-Fold Increase in Cash Dividends Further, Dunamu disclosed a sharp rise in annual profits, announcing a threefold increase in cash dividends to common shareholders. The company revealed in March that it has allocated nearly 300 billion won ($204.5 million) for cash dividends under its retained earnings distribution plan. It also reported an 85.1% year-over-year increase in operating profit. Dunamu attributed the strong performance to increased investor interest due to optimism surrounding pro-crypto regulations across various jurisdictions.

This has resulted in what looks like the beginning stages of a price pullback that could result in a notable crash. There are also fair value gaps (FVGs) that are yet to be fully filled, suggesting that the uptrend may see a pause before resuming. Bitcoin Momentum Pulling Toward Bearish As crypto analyst TehThomas explains in an analysis, the Bitcoin price action shows that it has moved toward a key rejection block. This rejection block was around the $122,000 level, explaining why the cryptocurrency saw a pushback from here. Related Reading: How Western Union’s Acquisition Of Intermex Is A Win For Ripple And XRP Given this, Thomas explains that this movement points to exhaustion in the market. This could suggest more sellers are beginning to take profit, and with buyers taking a step back, there is not enough demand to hold off the supply being poured into the market. If this continues, then there will be a shift into the bearish territory for this. Moreover, the fact that he rejection block aligned with the 4-Hour charts shows there is a strong confluence zone for sellers. This puts bears in charge at this level, and with the price closing within this confluence zone, it gives more strength to the reversal trend and could push for a further retracement. Buying Into The Fair Value Gap There is currently a fair value gap that is yet to be filled above $112,000. This makes this level the first target in the event of a price retracement. The likelihood of a retracement to this level is high because historically, fair value gaps tend to be filled first before there is a continuation of the bullish momentum. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price Crash Below $3, But There’s Good News Additionally, there is also the fact that the Bitcoin price moved “through a cluster of resting liquidity above recent highs.” This was the level that acted as the trap for late buyers and longs and triggered a wave of liquidations as the price moved downward again. If this bearish scenario does play out, then the analyst expects that the Bitcoin price will actually crash back as low as $110,000 to fill the gaps. However, a completion of this move would serve as the setup for the next upward wave toward the peaks.

The positive sentiment boosted LINK to a three-month high in addition to the general crypto market recovery. Chainlink (LINK) is enjoying the best sentiment for 2025, as its community of ‘marines’ is expressing the most bullish sentiment in months. LINK is now standing at a three-month high, trading at $23.79, with a spike in volumes to $2B in 24 hours. As Cryptopolitan recently reported , Chainlink expanded its role due to demand for ETFs and RWAs tokenization, requiring high-speed, and reliable data streams. The technology of Chainlink was also mentioned as one of the top examples of oracle usage in the recent White House digital asset frameworks, giving further exposure to the project. Over the past few months, LINK has retained its general bullish outlook, expecting a hike to a higher price range. LINK is one of the top utility tokens, which has yet to regain its all-time high. Recently, the asset got a boost from repurchases originating from one of the project’s wallets. The token contract received buybacks after engaging with Uniswap V3, acquiring over 40K LINK in an hour, based on Etherscan data . LINK rallies on its expanded role as top oracle token LINK is also riding on the RWA narrative, as the main provider of infrastructure and reliable pricing data for multiple projects. Due to demand for DeFi services and complex products, Chainlink now secures a record amount of funds, with a peak share of the oracle market. Chainlink now secures over $62B in total value, making up around 61% of the oracle market. The oracle serves 453 projects on 21 chains, focusing on the most liquid protocols. Other oracles specialize in different niches, but none has managed to catch up with the first-mover advantage of Chainlink. LINK also has a prominent position among RWA tokens , with a $15.9B market cap, out of a total of $57B. LINK also expanded, despite the overall RWA narrative losing a net 5% in the past three months. The token is also an outlier as a part of the ‘Made in USA’ narrative, where LINK is among the top 10 selected assets. The recently adopted favorable regulation of crypto in the USA is seen as an opportunity for the oracle project. Chainlink gets a boost with peak transactions The recent LINK rally coincided with one of the year’s busiest periods in terms of active daily transactions. The Chainlink network still carries a relatively low baseline of active wallets, but that number of participants is generating a significant number of transfers. The LINK token is tied to oracle services, signaling the growing demand for price information requests. The other major source of demand for Chainlink is the usage of its cross-chain protocol, CCIP. Demand for cross-chain transfers picked up in July and August, coinciding with the overall demand for crypto and DeFi usage. USDC and LBTC are the top assets using CCIP, with activity picking up since July. | Source: Dune Analytics . The CCIP is driven mostly by cross-chain movements of stablecoins, especially USDC. It’s seen as one of the more secure protocols, offering better safeguards compared to standard bridges. CCIP also reflects the increased usage of L2 chains, with the most traffic coming from Arbitrum and Base. As a whole, the Chainlink project benefits from the general increased usage of the Ethereum ecosystem. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The clarification, posted by Google’s official communications account on X late August 13, came after lawyers, developers, and high-profile Bitcoiners blasted an earlier interpretation of revised rules that appeared to force Anti-Money-Laundering and Know-Your-Customer checks on self-custody software in the United States and effectively box out indie wallet teams across the European Union. “Non-custodial wallets are not in scope of Google Play’s Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Software Wallets Policy. We are updating the Help Center to make this clear,” Google wrote . The initial backlash was swift. VP of Regulatory Affairs at Paradigm Justin Slaughter called it a “surprising move… amid [Google’s] antitrust litigation,” arguing that “pure coding should not require a federal license,” while Jack Dorsey summed up the mood with a one-word verdict: “terrible.” By nightfall in the US, crypto analyst Pentoshi declared “Breaking news Google has unbanned self custodial wallets,” while Pierre Rochard praised the course correction: “All companies make mistakes, great companies listen to online feedback and course-correct. Google Play can’t afford to ban itself from Bitcoin.” Google Bow To Crypto Community (Partially) Under the policy actually taking effect, Google is synchronizing Play Store distribution with licensing in roughly 15 jurisdictions for custodial products—crypto exchanges and custodial “software wallets”—with enforcement to begin on October 29, 2025. In practice that means US developers must operate under a federal or state banking charter or register with FinCEN as a money services business and obtain state money transmitter license; in the EU they must hold authorization as a MiCA crypto-asset service provider. France and Germany have transitional windows before MiCA fully displaces national licensing. Google’s own policy pages and the updated explainers published Wednesday night underline that non-custodial wallets—apps where users retain their private keys and no third party takes custody—are outside this licensing scope. The pivot capped a confusing news cycle. Several outlets reported during the day that Google would require licenses for all wallets, custodial and non-custodial alike, before clarifications on X and in follow-up coverage reversed that reading. Google’s statement confirms that self-custody apps are exempt, while noting that the Play Store will still gate custodial apps and exchanges in the US, EU, UK, and other listed markets. The net effect: the compliance burden shifts squarely onto entities that hold user funds, not the open-source code that enables users to hold their own. Even with Google’s clarification, edge cases remain. Francis Pouliot, CEO of Bull Bitcoin, pressed the company to explain whether the policy captures non-custodial wallets that embed optional gateways to regulated exchanges, with access controls enforced inside the app rather than via Play Store geo-targeting. That unresolved ambiguity matters to builders who have stitched together self-custody with fiat on-ramps through partner integrations, and who must now assess whether those features nudge a wallet into “custodial software wallet” territory for Play’s purposes. Developers also reported inconsistent enforcement as the policy story evolved. Adam Simecka, founder of the self-custodial Manna Wallet, said the app was de-listed from Play search “with no warning, notice, or recourse,” then later observed that visibility differed across devices and regions: “Some people are able to see it in their Play Store… Out of our family’s 3 Android devices, it is showing on 1.” He added that positive reviews had disappeared alongside search visibility. For users and developers, the path ahead is clearer but not frictionless. The Help Center’s country-by-country matrix now anchors distribution for custodial apps to local licensure—FinCEN MSB and state money transmission in the US; CASP authorization under MiCA in the EU; FCA registration in the UK; and comparable regimes in Switzerland , the UAE, Japan, South Korea , and others—with France and Germany granted interim national options before their MiCA deadlines. Google states the blockchain content policy update becomes effective October 29, 2025, with additional Help Center links added to reflect the new requirements. In parallel, Google has reiterated—now on the record—that non-custodial wallets are outside the scope of these licensing checks.

Best Crypto to Buy,https://bitcoinist.com/best-crypto-to-buy-bitcoin-hit-124k-due-to-future-rate-cut/,"Bitcoin just hit a new all-time high, days after breaking a previous record, proving yet again why it’s the greatest investment asset – certainly from an accessibility point of view – of the 21st century. $BTC climbed to $124,501 in the early hours today , edging past its previous all-time high of $123,217 by the slimmest of margins. Yet the move is still highly significant. Why? Because it signals that the broader crypto market has now priced in the strong likelihood of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September. Prediction market Polymarket shows that an overwhelming 88% of users expect the Fed to lower interest rates by at least 25 basis points. Such a move would likely ignite risk-on sentiment, funneling fresh capital into traditionally higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. And Bitcoin is naturally positioned at the center of that inflow. Keep reading to learn more about the factors pushing $BTC to new highs – and which is the best crypto to buy to ride this wave. Top Catalysts Behind Bitcoin’s Surge to Record Highs To understand what’s really propelled $BTC to become the sixth-largest asset in the world by market cap, overtaking long-standing juggernauts like Google and Amazon, it helps to rewind to July, when Bitcoin previously set a fresh all-time high. That month saw a wave of pro-crypto policy changes, starting with the GENIUS Act , which is the first major U.S. legislation aimed at establishing a clear regulatory framework for digital assets. Then came Project Crypto , a government-backed initiative to integrate blockchain solutions into public infrastructure, boost transparency, and foster adoption at the institutional level. Also in the mix was the 401(k) Crypto Asset Expansion , which opened the door for retirement accounts to include approved digital assets. This is a major step toward democratizing crypto investment and unlocking a fresh wave of mainstream capital. Even better? On the charts, yesterday’s daily candle closed above the previous ATH. This is a far stronger bullish signal than if the price merely touched it and closed lower. A decisive close above resistance shows the bulls are firmly in control and aiming to drive the price higher. Looking to capitalize on crypto’s newfound explosiveness? Here are 3 top altcoins you can consider including in your portfolio. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – New Bitcoin Layer 2 for Solana-Like Performance Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is developing the first true Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin built to speed up transactions, slash costs, and bring Solana-like programmability and full Web3 compatibility to the network. Currently, Bitcoin processes just 7 transactions per second, which is around 400 times slower than what Solana, aka the go-to blockchain for high-frequency traders, NFT creators, and dApp developers. $HYPER’s Layer 2, however, will change this thanks to its Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration and a decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge. The SVM will allow developers on Bitcoin to build smart contracts and decentralized applications with the same ease and functionality they enjoy on Solana. Next, the canonical bridge will convert your native $BTC into ‘wrapped’ $BTC, fully compatible with Hyper’s Layer 2. It’s worth noting that original Layer 1 $BTC won’t function on Layer 2, which is why the canonical bridge is so essential. These wrapped tokens can then be used to access Hyper’s Web3 ecosystem, including DeFi trading platforms, NFT marketplaces, lending and staking protocols, DAOs, and gaming dApps. Buying $HYPER will unlock a bunch of exclusive perks, including: Potential 2,400% in gains over the next few months, with $HYPER predicted to hit $0.32 by year-end . Staking rewards, currently yielding 116% Lower gas fees (paid in $HYPER) Governance rights over the network’s future Bitcoin Hyper has already raised a whopping $9.3M in early investor funding, and each token is currently priced at just $0.0127. Visit $HYPER’s official website for more information. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Native Crypto of a Non-Custodial, User-Friendly Crypto Wallet Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is a top altcoin perfectly positioned to capitalize on the booming crypto wallet market – a segment that’s been growing at a staggering 31.9% CAGR . At its core, $BEST is the native cryptocurrency of Best Wallet , a free crypto wallet with an ambitious goal to capture over 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet market by 2027. How does it plan to do so? By offering a solid mix of top-tier security and ease of use. Best Wallet is non-custodial, meaning you’re the only one with access to your private keys. This is paired with state-of-the-art encryption, MFA options including biometric login, and safeguards against hacks, scams, and phishing websites, giving you complete peace of mind. But buying $BEST isn’t just about security; it gives you access to a long list of exclusive perks you won’t find in other wallets: Reduced trading and gas fees on Best Wallet Staking rewards, currently offering 91% APY Early-bird access to new meme coins in presale Voting rights on key platform decisions Even better? Our $BEST price prediction suggests the token could surge up to 180% by the end of 2025, potentially reaching $0.072. Each token is currently available for a low price of $0.025475, and the project has in total raised over $14.7M in early investor funding. Learn all about $BEST by visiting its official website. 3. Cardano ($ADA) – Mainstream Crypto Poised for Another Leg Up The ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Cardano ($ADA) is a utility-focused token built to provide a secure, scalable network for decentralized applications and smart contracts. $ADA, too, has surged on the back of growing expectations for a rate cut and a wave of pro-crypto policy changes in recent weeks. In fact, it has soared an eye-popping 28% in just the past three days and is now holding firm above the crucial $1 level. Interestingly, DeepSeek recently set an ambitious $3 price target for Cardano, pointing first to the rapidly increasing likelihood of an ADA ETF approval in 2025 . According to Polymarket, the chances of the SEC approving a Cardano ETF this year have surged from 69% on August 8 to a staggering 85% on August 13. Why’s this important? Because an ETF approval would open the door for traditional investors to gain exposure to $ADA through regulated channels, likely unleashing a wave of fresh institutional demand for the token. The technicals look solid, too. The token recently broke out of a descending triangle pattern, and based on this setup, it could climb to $1.32610 (the triangle’s previous high) within the current rally itself. Wrapping Up With Bitcoin firmly in uncharted territory, powered by a mix of pro-crypto regulatory shifts and bullish technicals, smart high-risk, high-reward investors are turning their attention to projects like $HYPER and $BEST as prime contenders for the next crypto to explode . However, kindly bear in mind that none of this is financial advice. The crypto market is highly unpredictable, and you must always do your own research before investing.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-14 08:01:33

BAGY: New Bitcoin Income ETF In Town,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4813482-btci-vs-bagy-new-bitcoin-income-etf-in-town?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"Summary The NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF has been a go-to for many investors seeking insane yields with the potential to ride Bitcoin's growth. New ETFs have emerged with similar but critically different strategies, such as the Amplify Bitcoin Max Income Covered Call ETF. BAGY uses a different options strategy and has, in its very short lifespan, outperformed both BTCI and Bitcoin itself. This raises questions about whether BAGY has found a structural advantage or just got lucky on timing. Risks are everywhere with these funds, but so are rewards, and investors should tread carefully. BAGY also suffers from being very small and young, compared to BTCI's longer history and much larger AUM. Introduction I've covered quite a few Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) income ETFs on Seeking Alpha, but my work is never done, as there is a seemingly constant stream of new covered call ETFs, including those targeting BTC, regularly hitting the market. I began researching for this article with the intent of writing an update about the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF ( BTCI ), which I first covered back in May, but I was distracted by a newcomer fund that has made a solid run at BTCI since its debut this year, the Amplify Bitcoin Max Income Covered Call ETF ( BAGY ). Data by YCharts BTCI vs. BAGY Overview On the surface, both funds have the same strategy and incredibly similar holdings. They buy Bitcoin exposure through ETFs and derivatives like futures and write short call options against that exposure to produce income. This is the ""covered call"" strategy, and is incredibly popular with income investors. Here's a quick rundown of these two funds, for context: BTCI BAGY Inception 10/17/2024 04/29/2025 Price $65 $60 AUM $544M $10M Distribution Rate* 27.92% 30.94% Distribution Frequency Monthly Monthly Derivative BTC Exposure** CBTX MBTX BTC ETF Exposure HODL IBIT Options Expiration Monthly Weekly Options Strategy Credit Spreads Dynamic Overwrite Actively Managed Yes Yes Expense Ratio 0.98% 0.65% * All dividends paid in the last 30-days divided by the current price, not TTM. **The differences between CBTX and MBTX futures can be found here . Warning: BAGY is Young and Small First things first, let's address that BAGY has a very low AUM. Its managers, Amplify Investments, manage almost $13B across 32 ETFs, and BAGY is one of the newest, so it makes sense that it has a low AUM currently. Their largest fund, at $4B in AUM, is the DIVO ETF, which I covered back in February this year. There is tremendous risk investing in low-AUM ETFs, especially if you intend to make a very large investment, because there can be a lack of liquidity in shares that causes irregular pricing. I do not see any risk of the fund being closed anytime soon, but it should be of note that most ETFs that delist/close and return money to investors do so because of a lack of investor interest in the fund. Too low AUM for too long and the fund ends up being a money sink, so they close them. Just a heads-up for folks used to investing in funds like BTCI, which have far greater liquidity due to the $500M+ in assets. But BAGY Carries a Higher Yield... The folks at Amplify Investments are always looking for a wrinkle in the market, or a way to take advantage of some inefficiency. Their wrinkle in the DIVO ETF is to write calls against individual stocks instead of an index. In BAGY, their wrinkle is weekly active management and dynamic overwriting. By selling options weekly instead of monthly (although NEOS does sometimes manage BTCI's monthly options more than once a month), BAGY is able to be more flexible in its positioning, enabling BAGY to capture up to 5% of Bitcoin's upside per week, and an expected yield of 30-60% — huge range, but that's what Amplify is comfortable saying in their fact sheet . Currently, they are at the short end of that range, but BAGY hasn't had a full year to make distributions yet. Time may be needed to see where the yield ends up, and it may depend on how Bitcoin moves as well. BAGY, despite having a lower share price than BTCI, has begun outproducing in dividend amounts over the last two months. Again — to shoot a time frame to say anything meaningful yet, but it is impressive. Data by YCharts ...And a Higher Total Return It's a common adage when discussing income products that investors shouldn't expect outperformance of the underlying asset. This makes sense from a technical perspective: having a covered call component necessarily means limiting the upside of the long position. However, BAGY has actually outperformed BTC since its inception (too short a timeline to say anything conclusive, but how interesting to see). See the first chart in this article. We haven't seen how BAGY will do in a downturn, but I expect it to suffer the same as BTCI, which is to say that they will likely receive almost all the drawdown of BTC, less the income received. BTCI vs. BAGY Major Difference The most important distinction between the two funds is their options management. On top of the timing differences mentioned earlier, BTCI employs bear call spreads (credit spreads) where they offset their short position with long call options at times. It's unclear how often these are deployed by NEOS management — I've heard from interviews with the fund managers that they have never been deployed in the S&P 500 version of the fund, SPYI, but the possibility exists. This system could fill in some missing upside in BTCI, but also could add excess risk if Bitcoin continues to fall. It is something to watch, but so far it seems that NEOS has deployed the strategy conservatively or not at all yet, favoring just the covered call mechanic on its own for now. BAGY employs a ""dynamic overwrite"" strategy, meaning that they modulate how much of their BTC holdings they sell calls against. This assists the managers in that they can limit their upside cap during times they believe they could achieve growth. We can see some difference in how these funds have diverged between their price and total returns; the gap between these are dividends paid. Data by YCharts The reason for BAGY's outperformance of BTCI and BTC proper during this period is unclear to me. It could just be a well-time options trade that worked out perfectly for the portfolio managers at Amplify and this timeline is too short to weed out those ""lucky"" moments. However, it could also be a sign that the structural ""wrinkle"" I mentioned earlier, actively managing weekly MBTX options that allow for 5% capital appreciation per week in a dynamic overwrite strategy might be a structural advantage. Time will tell, but those interested in BTCI should consider adding BAGY to their watch list, or taking a small position to diversify between managers (""key man risk""). Suitability: Risk & Taxes It's important to note that investing in these two funds both involves significant risk, not only of underperforming the underlying (which may still happen despite recent performance), but also in the risk of Bitcoin itself. BTC has historic drawdowns that are eye-watering, and investors need to be able to stomach these kinds of 70-80% drawdowns. While institutional ownership of Bitcoin means that we may see lower drawdowns in the future as there will be more buyers with deeper pockets, nothing is guaranteed. Data by YCharts Notably, these funds are suitable for taxable investment accounts due to the way their dividends are set up. Derivatives gains and losses (i.e., options premium) is distributed to ETF shareholders as return-of-capital (""RoC""). This means that distributions from these two ETFs are not taxed as they are distributed, but instead are subtracted from one's cost-basis. The taxable event comes when the shares are sold, and capital gains (difference between cost-basis and sale price) are had. For most investors, long-term capital gains tax rates are lower than income tax rates, making this style of distribution popular among many investors. If you get to zero on your cost basis (AKA ""house money""), new RoC distributions would be considered long-term capital gains and are taxed in the year you receive them, but at the (most likely) lower LTCG rate, according to this IRS publication . A nondividend distribution reduces the basis of your stock. It is not taxed until your basis in the stock is fully recovered. This nontaxable portion is also called a return of capital; it is a return of your investment in the stock of the company. If you buy stock in a corporation in different lots at different times, and you cannot definitely identify the shares subject to the nondividend distribution, reduce the basis of your earliest purchases first. When the basis of your stock has been reduced to zero, report any additional nondividend distribution you receive as a capital gain. Whether you report it as a long-term or short-term capital gain depends on how long you have held the stock... Example 1. You bought stock in 2010 for $100. In 2013, you received a nondividend distribution of $80. You did not include this amount in your income, but you reduced the basis of your stock to $20. You received a nondividend distribution of $30 in 2023. The first $20 of this amount reduced your basis to zero. You report the other $10 as a long-term capital gain for 2023. You must report as a long-term capital gain any nondividend distribution you receive on this stock in later years. Conclusion Ultimately, both BTCI and BAGY have impressed in the Bitcoin income space. Income investors are likely very happy to have owned either of these for the times they have been on the market, but those have only been during a BTC bull run. Interestingly enough, BAGY has outperformed both BTCI and BTC proper since it launched in May, but the timeline is so small that idiosyncratic rewards (""luck"") may be affecting the data. ""Time will tell,"" is the current last word on BAGY. In the meantime, BTCI investors (and those interested in Bitcoin income ETFs more broadly) should consider following BAGY as it may have found a ""market wrinkle,"" an advantage that allows them to eke out just that much more juice. Will it lead to a larger drawdown? I don't believe so, and that's the magic part: it may lead to more upside and a similar downside to BTCI, but again, time will tell. The fund is still too new and too small to say definitively. I maintain my buy rating on BTCI, as it is still one of the best Bitcoin income ETFs and should be one of the go-to for Bitcoin income seekers — although my favorite is still MAXI. BAGY has also earned a buy rating from me based on its unique strategy and the impressive short-term performance of that strategy. This fund has its drawbacks and risks to be aware of, but those may improve over time as the fund gains more traction.

In a recent video tweet, he suggested that an investor could theoretically turn $500 into millions under specific market conditions. In his breakdown, CryptoSensei calculated that at XRP’s current price, a $500 purchase would acquire approximately 162 XRP tokens. He then applied several hypothetical future price points to show potential returns. If XRP reached $100 per token, the investment would grow to $16,286. At $500 per token, the value would rise to $81,000. Should XRP reach $1,000 , the holdings would be worth $162,000. At $5,000, the total would be $814,000. Finally, if XRP reached $10,000, the $500 investment would be valued at $1.628 million. TURN $500 INTO MILLIONS WITH #XRP !!! pic.twitter.com/sToNrgBQPg — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) August 13, 2025 Considering Different Investment Amounts CryptoSensei also explored scenarios involving larger initial investments. Using the same price projections, he explained that allocating $1,000 instead of $500 could further amplify returns, potentially enabling long-term financial benefits such as funding a child’s college education or purchasing a first home. He suggested that such an investment could be stored securely in a hardware wallet and placed in a safe deposit box to hold it for a decade or more. According to his remarks, this approach represents a way to plan for future generations without requiring a large upfront capital outlay. He emphasized that if XRP can achieve the growth many in the community anticipate, even a modest allocation could become a substantial financial asset over time. Long-Term Holding Strategy CryptoSensei’s comments reflected a long-term perspective on digital asset investment. He stressed the importance of securing any holdings safely and privately, recommending a ledger device or other secure storage solutions to prevent loss or theft. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The underlying strategy, in his view, is to treat the investment as a multi-year or even multi-decade hold, giving the market sufficient time to mature and potentially reach ambitious price targets. By focusing on smaller, affordable entry points such as $500 or $1,000, his example aims to make the concept of digital asset investing accessible to individuals who may not have large sums to commit. He positioned this method as a low-barrier approach to potentially building significant wealth in the future, provided the asset meets or exceeds these speculative valuations. Potential and Assumptions Behind the Projection CryptoSensei’s projection is based on hypothetical price targets that are significantly higher than XRP’s current market value. While he did not address the probability of reaching these levels in the near term, his message was centered on the potential upside if XRP achieves the broader adoption and market role many of its supporters expect. His scenario assumes that the token will experience exponential growth over the next decade or more, aligning with some long-term bullish forecasts within the cryptocurrency sector.

The emergence of IEByte mining machine cloud mining platform has perfectly solved this problem, making low-cost and high-return mining possible. What Is Cloud Mining? Cloud mining is a method to mine cryptocurrencies by leasing equipment or renting computing power from data centers. It negates the process of individually setting up physical mining hardware, getting a high-speed internet connection, sourcing electricity, and maintaining the hardware. What are the advantages of cloud mining? The main advantage of cloud mining is that it allows easy access to cryptocurrencies without a large initial investment. You do not need to spend a lot of money on mining equipment, and you can monitor the performance of these machines by accessing them through the most common devices (PC, tablet, smartphone, etc.). In addition, this is an activity that everyone can participate in, even complete beginners, since it does not require any special expertise. Profits can be obtained simply by renting the services of miners through cloud mining platforms. What are the disadvantages of cloud mining? Among the main disadvantages of cloud mining, we can cite the risk of fraud (which, unfortunately, still exists in this market) and the low decision-making power of mining. In addition, most of such platforms offer long-term contracts with fixed subscriptions (1 or 2-year commitments), which is risky given the large fluctuations in the prices of the cryptocurrency market. If a currency collapses, then an attractive yield today may be harmful in the future. Is cloud mining safe for me? Cloud mining is safe if you choose a reputable platform. Which Is The Best Cloud Mining Available In The Market Today? Best cloud mining depends on factors, like trustworthiness, mining fee, contract duration, and coin to mine.

In his latest video , he compared Google search interest for XRP with its price chart. He noted that in July 2024, a surge in search volume coincided with the major price breakout. However, in August 2025, despite XRP reaching new highs, search activity has not matched previous peaks. This, he explained, represents a bearish divergence where price makes higher highs while retail attention declines. Steph stated that such a pattern indicates that the current rally is likely being driven by institutions, whales, and long-term holders rather than new retail buyers. He cautioned that although this is not an immediate signal for a market crash, historically, such divergences have often preceded local or cycle tops. I JUST CHANGED MY #XRP PRICE PREDICTION BASED ON THIS! pic.twitter.com/hmhTYFNlRk — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 13, 2025 Relative Strength Index and Resistance Levels Steph also compared XRP and Bitcoin price trends on the weekly timeframe. He observed that while both assets have made higher highs since 2024, their Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been forming lower highs, indicating potential weakening momentum. He emphasized that repeated touches of the current RSI trendline have often been followed by sell pressure, which could lead to a larger correction. For XRP, Steph identified potential resistance between $4 and $5, while for Bitcoin, he estimated resistance between $125,000 and $130,000. Profit-Taking Risk and Whale Inflows Another metric Steph highlighted was XRP’s percentage of total supply in profit, which currently sits above 95 percent. He pointed out that such high profitability levels have historically aligned with local tops as profit-taking activity increases. Although XRP has sustained these levels before without immediate correction, he warned that any sentiment shift could trigger heavy selling. Supporting this caution, Steph referenced data showing the second-largest whale inflow to Binance in XRP’s history. The largest was recorded in December of the previous year, shortly before a multi-month correction. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Altcoin Market Conditions and Macroeconomic Factors Steph also examined broader market conditions, noting that the Altcoin Season Index currently stands at 53, leaving room for further growth before reaching the 75 level, where historically multi-week or multi-month corrections have followed. He also discussed comments from Treasury Secretary Bessent suggesting the Federal Reserve consider a 50 basis point rate cut, with market odds for such a move in September now at 90 percent following recent U.S. CPI data. Steph suggested that markets may rally into September as rate cut expectations are priced in, but cautioned that September has not historically been a strong month for cryptocurrency markets. Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) Technical Outlook In addition to XRP, Steph analyzed Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR), noting that it has broken above the Gaussian channel on the weekly timeframe, a pattern he previously observed in 2021 before a major rally. He believes HBAR is positioned for further gains and could reach new all-time highs, possibly as soon as this month. He added that trading above the EMA ribbons on the weekly timeframe supports the view that the bull market remains intact, projecting that HBAR could reach around $0.50 in the near term. Steph concluded by reiterating his belief that XRP has further upside potential . However, he stressed the importance of monitoring resistance levels between $4 and $5.50 and remaining aware of market signals indicating potential corrections.

Bitcoin also surged to a new all-time high on Thursday, August 14, gaining 3.4% on the day and trading at $124,457. With a market cap of $2.456 trillion, BTC is now the fifth largest asset in the world, surpassing even Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). The cryptocurrency gained a lot of momentum due to growing expectations of easier monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, reignited institutional inflows, and broader market optimism following the resolution of the Ripple v. the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) case. Also beneficial were President Donald Trump’s initiatives favoring the inclusion of alternative assets in 401(k) retirement plans, which opened up a path for $12 trillion in retirement funds to be invested in Bitcoin. Policies such as these have allowed the crypto market’s total capitalization to reach $4.18 trillion, a 67% increase from $2.5 trillion in November 2024, when Trump won the election.

Michael Saylor, the Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, certainly believes Wall Street is still missing the bigger picture regarding Michael Saylor Crypto insights. He suggests that the broader digital asset ecosystem, led by Bitcoin, holds an extraordinary, yet often overlooked, value proposition for investors and corporations alike. Michael Saylor Crypto: Unveiling Overlooked Value Michael Saylor recently shared his compelling perspective on Fox Business, highlighting the significant disconnect between traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto world. He pointed out that Bitcoin’s average annualized return remarkably exceeds 50%. This impressive performance starkly contrasts with more conventional investments. Saylor emphasized that the entire crypto ecosystem remains undervalued by many institutional players. He argued that firms heavily relying on assets like Treasurys could find themselves lagging by approximately 10% annually. Conversely, businesses and investors who embrace a “Bitcoin standard” might see their portfolios outperform the S&P 500 by a substantial 40% each year. Consider MicroStrategy itself. Saylor noted that his company ranks among the S&P 500’s most profitable entities. Yet, traditional metrics such as Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratios often discount its true value, as reported by Wu Blockchain on X. This discrepancy underscores a fundamental misunderstanding of how to evaluate a company with significant Bitcoin holdings. Why Wall Street Crypto Adoption Lags What causes this persistent underestimation by Wall Street? One primary reason is the entrenched mindset within traditional finance. Many analysts and institutions continue to apply outdated valuation models to new asset classes like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They often struggle to integrate the unique characteristics of digital assets, such as decentralization, scarcity, and network effects, into their existing frameworks. The journey towards widespread Wall Street Crypto Adoption faces several hurdles: Regulatory Uncertainty: A fragmented and evolving regulatory landscape makes it challenging for large institutions to commit fully. Lack of Familiarity: Many financial professionals lack deep technical understanding of blockchain technology and its applications. Risk Aversion: Traditional finance is inherently conservative, and the volatility associated with crypto markets can deter adoption. Despite these challenges, the conversation is shifting. More institutions are exploring ways to participate, signaling a slow but steady move towards broader integration. Unlocking Digital Asset Potential: A Bitcoin Investment Standard? Saylor’s vision of a “Bitcoin standard” suggests a paradigm shift in corporate treasury management and investment strategy. Instead of holding significant cash reserves that depreciate due to inflation, companies could convert a portion into Bitcoin. This strategic move aims to preserve and potentially grow capital. What does this mean for the average investor seeking a sound Bitcoin Investment ? Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an attractive hedge against inflation, unlike fiat currencies. Growth Opportunity: Its historical performance suggests significant growth potential, far surpassing traditional assets. Portfolio Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can offer diversification benefits, as its price movements are often uncorrelated with traditional markets. Embracing this standard could unlock substantial Digital Asset Potential for both individual and institutional investors, fostering long-term wealth creation. The Broader Crypto Market Undervaluation Explained Beyond Bitcoin, the wider Crypto Market Undervaluation stems from Wall Street’s focus on short-term metrics rather than long-term innovation. The crypto ecosystem is not just about digital money; it encompasses groundbreaking technologies like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Web3 applications. These areas are building the foundation for a new digital economy. The value in these emerging sectors lies in their ability to: Disrupt traditional industries (finance, art, gaming). Create new forms of ownership and digital scarcity. Empower individuals with greater control over their data and assets. As these technologies mature and gain mainstream adoption, their true value will become increasingly apparent, challenging the current undervaluation. A Glimpse into the Future Michael Saylor’s assertions serve as a powerful reminder that the financial landscape is evolving rapidly. While traditional institutions may be slow to adapt, the undeniable performance and innovative potential of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market continue to demand attention. As more data emerges and regulatory clarity improves, Wall Street’s understanding of this transformative asset class is bound to catch up, potentially leading to a massive re-evaluation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does Michael Saylor mean by Wall Street underestimating crypto? Michael Saylor believes traditional financial institutions and analysts do not fully grasp the long-term value and growth potential of Bitcoin and the wider crypto ecosystem. They often evaluate digital assets using outdated metrics, leading to a significant undervaluation. Q2: How does Bitcoin’s performance compare to traditional investments, according to Saylor? Saylor states that Bitcoin has an average annualized return exceeding 50%. He suggests that firms adopting a “Bitcoin standard” could outperform the S&P 500 by about 40% annually, while those relying on Treasurys might lag by 10%. Q3: What is the “Bitcoin standard” concept Saylor advocates? The “Bitcoin standard” refers to a strategy where companies or individuals convert a portion of their cash reserves into Bitcoin. This aims to protect against inflation and potentially generate greater returns compared to holding traditional fiat currency or low-yield assets. Q4: Why is MicroStrategy a relevant example in this discussion? MicroStrategy, under Saylor’s leadership, has famously adopted a significant Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Saylor uses his company’s performance to illustrate how a Bitcoin-centric approach can lead to profitability, even if traditional metrics don’t always capture its full value. Q5: What are the main barriers to broader Wall Street Crypto Adoption? Key barriers include regulatory uncertainty, a lack of deep understanding among financial professionals, and inherent risk aversion within traditional finance towards volatile new asset classes.

This strategic shift comes as blockchain activity and price momentum surge across these major networks, but the emerging narrative is that savvy investors aren’t just riding current market leaders — they’re positioning early for what could be the next breakout story in the crypto space. Avalanche’s ecosystem momentum Avalanche is experiencing a surge in development, with more than 150 projects building under the $40 million Retro9000 grants initiative. The program’s targeted funding for layer-1 solutions is driving innovation on the network’s testnet, reinforcing its position as a competitive blockchain for high-performance applications. Technically, AVAX remains in a strong position, trading above key support with chart patterns hinting at sustained upside. Still, a segment of AVAX investors is hedging by adding MAGACOIN FINANCE to their portfolios — widely regarded as the top emerging altcoin for 2025 — as a way to balance Avalanche’s steady growth with the potential for explosive gains from a rising project. Solana’s DeFi and payments growth Solana continues to dominate in blockchain activity, surpassing 26 million active addresses and achieving a record-breaking 156% surge in stablecoin supply to over $13 billion. This liquidity boost reflects growing DeFi adoption, while BitPay’s integration of Solana enables seamless payments, gift card purchases, and asset management with minimal transaction costs. The network’s security has also strengthened, with the Solana Foundation resolving a critical zero-day vulnerability without any reported exploitation. Amid these wins, a growing number of SOL holders are adding MAGACOIN FINANCE to their holdings. They see it as a high-potential cryptocurrency poised for breakout performance in 2025, offering diversification while retaining exposure to Solana’s established ecosystem. Cardano’s ETF potential and whale accumulation Cardano is gaining renewed investor focus as speculation builds around a possible ADA exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in 2025 — a move that could fuel a rally toward the $3 mark. Whale activity has intensified, with large holders steadily adding to positions despite price resistance near $1. Analysts project short-term targets between $0.95 and $1.05 by late August, contingent on volume gains. Some of these whales are strategically positioning in MAGACOIN FINANCE, drawn by its status as one of the most promising new altcoins this year , blending ADA’s long-term potential with an early-stage growth opportunity. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is on the Radar Long-term AVAX, SOL, and ADA holders are strategically diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE ahead of anticipated major developments. Rumors of upcoming partnerships, new product rollouts, and ecosystem expansion are feeding speculation that this emerging project could deliver outsized returns in the next market phase. As history has shown, the biggest winners in crypto are often those spotted early — and with the current wave of quiet accumulation, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the next breakout story.

While established names like Cardano (ADA) continue to advance their blockchain ecosystems, fresh coins are drawing increasing attention from analysts and investors. One standout is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized credit protocol trending for its innovative approach to lending and liquidity efficient borrowing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is going for $0.035 in presale phase 6. In phase 7, the price will increase by 14.29% to $0.04. Early adopters will have a minimum of 200% ROI as MUTM grows. Mutuum Finance has already garnered over $14.35 million in capital and has over 15200 investors on board. Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a potential breakout player in the upcoming market cycle. Cardano Forecast: Eyes on $1.50 as 2025 Momentum Builds Cardano (ADA), currently trading around $0.81, is garnering renewed attention from analysts projecting a rise to the $1.50–$1.80 range by year-end, representing over a 50% upside if bullish momentum holds, particularly amid technical continuation patterns and ecosystem activity. More moderate estimates still suggest ADA could reach $0.85 to $1.70 in 2025, depending on factors like ETF approval and broader adoption across DeFi and enterprise use cases. In the shifting crypto landscape, ADA’s trajectory is increasingly compared alongside newer DeFi entrants like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Presale Is Now Open Mutuum Finance is in presale Stage 6 now, and the tokens are being sold at $0.035, an increase of 16.17% from the previous stage. The subsequent price hike will put the price at $0.04, an increase of 14.29%. Presale has been successful so far with over 15200 holders and over $14.35 million raised to date, reflecting strong and growing interest in the project. Mutuum Finance is a P2C and P2P lending protocol where customers can yield high returns with complete control over funds. It’s a DeFi end-to-end experience perfectly tailored to the customer’s needs and more secure, transparent, and flexible than centralized lending products. US Dollar–Pegged Stablecoin Mutuum Finance will launch a USD-pegged stablecoin that is fully collateralized on the Ethereum blockchain. The project is also audited and certified by CertiK. Together with the investors’ guarantee of transparency and integrity of code base, the auditing guarantees that the project will indeed build a safe DeFi protocol. The project also initiated a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. Four kinds of vulnerabilities to be rewarded are classified as critical, major, minor and low. Mutuum Finance Launches Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway to hype up its base. 10 investors stand to win $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. The giveaway not only attracts new investors, but it’s also a sign that the project is willing to go the extra mile to build a long-term community. Mutuum Finance Scores 95.0 Trust Score in CertiK Audit CertiK smart contract audit has flagged Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as safe with a trust score of 95.0/100. The platform is offering a secure environment to conduct DeFi operations. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is connecting new lending potential with the strength of an ecosystem, and with a clear direction towards the future of DeFi. Mutuum Finance’s presale has already surged past $14.35 million with over 15,200 investors, locking in a 16.17% price gain at its current $0.035 stage and gearing up for a 14.29% jump to $0.04 in the next phase. With early adopters looking at a potential 200% ROI, a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin, and a 95.0 CertiK trust score, the project is solidifying itself as a top contender for 2025’s DeFi boom. Cardano’s steady climb toward the $1.50 mark shows the strength of established players, but MUTM’s momentum, innovative lending model, and aggressive growth strategy make it one of the most better altcoin plays.

Analysts say a breakout could deliver up to 5x returns — but some market watchers believe other emerging assets may run even hotter. Whales drive DOGE accumulation to multi-month highs Dogecoin whales are on an aggressive buying spree, adding over 680 million DOGE in August alone, pushing their total holdings to the highest level since December. This month’s accumulation brings whale-controlled supply to nearly 98.56 billion DOGE, effectively removing a significant chunk from active circulation. Institutional players appear unfazed by short-term volatility, a bullish sign historically associated with upcoming price surges. Open interest in Dogecoin futures climbed 9%, showing heightened positioning in the derivatives market, though daily trading volume in futures contracts slid nearly 23%. Meanwhile, options activity dropped sharply, but open interest still rose over 10%, hinting that larger traders may be locking in medium-to-long-term bets on price growth. DOGE price outlook: golden cross sparks bullish targets Dogecoin recently surged above $0.25 for the first time in weeks after forming a rare golden cross — where the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day average. Historically, this pattern has delivered powerful rallies for DOGE, with past examples leading to gains of 130% or more in just a month. Current resistance sits around $0.2407, with technical analysts eyeing the $0.28 level next, followed by a potential run toward $0.42–$0.48. A break above $0.36 could trigger a sharper rally toward the all-time highs near $0.70. Despite choppy macro conditions, whale buying pressure, elevated spot demand, and potential ETF approval have combined to create an environment ripe for a breakout. However, traders remain watchful of profit-taking at key resistance points, as meme coin rallies can often be volatile and short-lived without sustained institutional inflows. MAGACOIN FINANCE: institutional accumulation could outpace DOGE gains MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly attracting early-stage accumulation patterns that some analysts believe could deliver far greater upside in the next market leg. The project is built on a security-first infrastructure and has already passed a HashEx audit, with a CertiK audit ongoing. Its presale performance has outpaced many early-stage meme tokens, bolstered by strong market positioning and growing institutional interest. The ERC-20 compatibility and verified wallet support make it an appealing target for both swing traders and longer-term holders seeking frictionless transactions. Analysts note that this combination of transparency, security, and accessibility could allow MAGACOIN FINANCE to capitalize on capital rotation from larger-cap meme assets like DOGE into emerging plays. If accumulation trends persist, its growth trajectory could eclipse Dogecoin’s forecasted 5x rally in the upcoming bull cycle. Bottom line Dogecoin’s whale-driven momentum, golden cross breakout, and ETF speculation position it for significant upside, potentially testing 2021 highs. But with accumulation patterns forming in projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, the next market leaders could emerge from outside the current top-tier tokens.

BTC’s Latest ATH After the sluggish start of the month, when BTC slipped beneath $112,000, the asset managed to turn the tables by the second week. In fact, it had recovered to over $115,000 before the bulls truly took control of the market and initiated a few consecutive rallies as the current week began. At first, they pushed the cryptocurrency to over $122,000 on Monday where it faced an immediate rejection and was driven south to $118,000. However, the bulls returned within a day and initiated another leg up that made history. Earlier today, bitcoin skyrocketed by several grand and topped $124,500 to set a new all-time high, a month after the previous peak. However, the asset fell in the following hours to under $112,000 as of press time, perhaps due to some profit-taking. Its market cap has jumped to over $2.4 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts remains well below 58% amid altcoin speculations. BTCUSD.

Cardano’s native token has stolen the show from the larger-cap alts. ADA has skyrocketed by over 12% on a 24-hour scale and trades at approximately $1 for the first time since early March.

The sophisticated scams combine multiple exploitation tactics, offering false hope to victims desperate to recover funds from previous crypto frauds while stealing additional personal data and money. Source: IC3 The alert updates a previous June 2024 warning, providing additional red flag indicators as scammers increasingly target victims who lost money in cryptocurrency schemes. The FBI received over 149,000 crypto fraud complaints in 2024, recording $9.3 billion in losses , representing a 66% increase from 2023’s $5.6 billion. Americans aged 60 and older suffered the highest losses at $2.83 billion, representing nearly 30% of total crypto fraud damages. The elderly demographic’s vulnerability makes them prime targets for secondary victimization through fake recovery services. Sophisticated Impersonation Tactics Target Desperate Victims Scammers impersonate actual lawyers and legitimate law firms while producing fictitious documents with authentic letterhead and insignia. They falsely claim partnerships with multiple US and foreign government entities, despite no law firms being officially authorized partners of US agencies. The fraudsters reference fictitious regulatory bodies like the International Financial Trading Commission while demonstrating detailed knowledge of victims’ previous wire transfers, including exact amounts and dates. They claim victims appear on government-affiliated lists of scam victims eligible for fund recovery through “legal channels.” Victims receive referrals to “crypto recovery law firms” and instructions to register accounts at foreign banks with seemingly legitimate but fraudulent websites. Scammers place victims in WhatsApp group chats with supposed foreign bank processors and attorneys demanding bank fees for identity verification. The schemes exploit victims’ emotional states and financial desperation while providing false safety through government impersonation. Scammers request payments in cryptocurrency or prepaid gift cards, refusing video verification or license documentation while maintaining communication secrecy. In an interview with Cryptonews , Crystal blockchain analytics CEO Navin Gupta identified increasing sophistication in crypto fraud tactics, with AI enabling hyper-personalized attacks using leaked data and victim profiling. How are scammers stealing billions in crypto? We sat down with @CrystalPlatform CEO Navin Gupta as he breaks down the psychology, AI-powered tactics, and the #1 mindset shift that could prevent most fraud. #CryptoScam #Deepfake https://t.co/9WQQvGSuED — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 24, 2025 “Assume every unsolicited message is a potential attack,” Gupta advised as the ultimate defense against crypto fraud. Gupta emphasized that this “mental shift alone filters out 80% of threat vectors” while warning that scammers exploit urgency, secrecy, and flattery to manipulate victims. He stressed that deliberate doubt serves as the best defense in an industry where technical solutions alone cannot protect against human psychological manipulation. Investment Fraud Dominates Growing Crypto Crime Investment fraud, including “ pig butchering ” schemes, remains the largest crypto scam category, with victims targeted through online relationships before the introduction of fraudulent investment opportunities. Source: Chainalysis Chainalysis data shows pig butchering scams increased 85-fold since 2020 , with individual victims losing $2-4 million. The FBI notified 4,323 cryptocurrency investment fraud victims, achieving estimated savings of $285 million. However, 42 victims required suicide intervention referrals, which shows the devastating psychological impact of crypto fraud losses. California suffered maximum crypto fraud losses exceeding $1.39 billion, followed by Texas with $738 million. The FBI confirmed that reported figures likely understate actual losses, as many victims never report crimes. Aside from individualized targets, organized crime is also growing. North Korean hackers alone stole $1.34 billion from crypto platforms in 2024. The scale of the attacks is massive and systematic, just like the Bybit $1.4B hack earlier this year . As it stands now, the threats are growing beyond individual scammers targeting minor victims to now institutional platforms and infrastructure. Ransomware complaints rose 9% in 2023 as the most prevalent critical infrastructure threat. The FBI notified over 5,400 targeted victims between January 2024 and April 2025, with most unaware of ongoing targeting attempts. The agency recommends “ zero trust ” models, assuming no unsolicited contact should be trusted by default, just like Gupta advised as well. Victims should request video verification, documentation of law licenses, notarized identity proofs, and verification of government employment claims before proceeding with any transactions or communications.

Among these, three standout memecoins are gaining attention as potential breakout stars. With recent activity from big investors, these coins are primed for substantial growth. Find out which ones are poised to multiply in value and drive the next wave of excitement in the crypto world. Pudgy Penguins: Strong Growth, Strategic Resistance, and Trading Opportunities Over the last month, PENGU registered a 25.91% gain while the six-month change soared by 272.27%. Recent weekly results show a 12.83% increase, continuing a path of progressive gains. Price behavior over these periods reflects growing investor confidence with notable upward movement that underscores market interest. The trend has shifted from modest beginnings to remarkable performance, mirroring conviction among traders and collectors. Historical performance indicates that PENGU is emerging as a favorite in the altcoin arena, its price steadily climbing while capturing attention as a potential breakout candidate. The current price hovers near a critical resistance at $0.0643, with a higher barrier at $0.0972 representing a challenge for bullish traders. Technical indicators show slight upward momentum, with the momentum indicator at 0.0025 and the Awesome Oscillator at 0.0028, while the RSI stands at 56.69, suggesting buying interest. Price action appears balanced between buyers and sellers, with bulls holding a modest edge as the coin approaches its resistance levels. Accumulating near $0.0643 can be an opportunity, provided stop losses are tight. A clear break above $0.0972 might lead to a surge, while failure to breach these levels could result in consolidation. Turbo's Ascent Amid Market Waves and Growing Momentum Turbo 's price history shows steady gains with an 11.46% increase in the past month and a robust 43.41% surge over the last six months. Weekly activity climbed by 17.68%, indicating consistent buying interest. Trading has remained within a range of $0.0029 to $0.0066, reflecting a gradual buildup of value and momentum over time. Turbo currently trades between $0.0029 and $0.0066. The nearest resistance is at $0.0086, with another ceiling near $0.0124, while a key support level exists at $0.0013. Price momentum shows mixed signs with a neutral RSI reading of 53.87. Bulls exert control on dips near support, but no strong trend has formed, leading to choppy action. Trading ideas include buying on dips near $0.0013 and watching for a breakout above $0.0086, with stops above resistance levels to manage risk effectively. SPX6900 Price Surge: A 6-Month and Monthly Overview SPX6900 showed strong momentum over the recent month with a 15.44% change and an impressive 143.53% increase over six months. The coin recorded steady gains that signal broad upward movement, with the one-month performance hinting at a developing bullish narrative while the half-year stretch underscores significant long-term strength. The weekly change of nearly 10% adds to the picture of consistent gains. The numerical trends suggest that traders who held during the recent period have enjoyed notable returns, with gradual accumulation boosting the price level over time. No resistance barriers in the short term hindered its progression, revealing investor enthusiasm contributing to the upward trend. Current prices range from $1.03 to $2.25, with a key support level at $0.44 and a near-term resistance at $2.89. A second resistance at $4.11 offers a target for bullish moves. Market sentiment points to cautious optimism with bulls making measured advances while lacking a firm, established trend. Within these levels, trading ideas revolve around entering on dips near support and considering quick profits as prices approach resistance. Indicators like the RSI near 52 and modest oscillator readings suggest that major overextensions have not yet occurred, allowing room for further upward movement if buyers continue to step in. Conclusion PENGU , TURBO , and SPX show strong potential to grow five times in the current cycle. They are gaining traction as institutional interest boosts market recovery. These coins are emerging as significant players. Their unique appeal and growing community support contribute to their upward momentum.

Investors are curious if current prices make them smart buys for future growth. This article examines the potential of these digital assets, highlighting factors that could influence their value. Filecoin (FIL) Price Analysis: Short-Term Gains Amid Longer-Term Decline Filecoin experienced notable short-term gains with a 14.51% increase over one week and a 4.16% rise over the past month. However, over the last six months, the coin recorded a 21.77% drop in value. The recent price activity shows rapid recoveries in the near term, even though a longer-term downtrend remains evident. These performance changes illustrate an environment where quick rallies contrast with an overall decline, presenting traders with a mixed picture that reflects both transient optimism and longer-term caution. Currently, Filecoin trades between $2.04 and $2.89, creating a distinct trading window that requires close attention. The nearest support level is at $1.69, with secondary support at $0.84. Resistance is noted at $3.39 and $4.23. Bulls have made short-term gains, but bears still hold influence. Technical indicators show an Awesome Oscillator of 0.0104, a momentum reading of 0.32, and an RSI slightly above neutral at 56.46. Trading strategies should focus on accumulating on dips near support while considering profit-taking near resistance. With no clear trend, traders must remain vigilant for market shifts. Arweave: Short-Term Surge Amid Long-Term Correction Arweave showed a mix of gains and setbacks last month and over the past six months. The coin posted a strong one-week increase of 20.36% and marked a 16.67% gain in the last month, reflecting a burst of buying interest. In contrast, an 11.92% decline over the past six months reveals longer-term pressure and market pullbacks. Price activity ranged between $4.93 and $8.91, capturing short-lived surges amid sustained selling trends. The data hints at moments of recovery after previous downturns, illustrating a history of volatility that suggests both risk and reward for traders. Currently, Arweave trades in a range with clear key levels. Nearest resistance is at $10.88, while solid support sits at $2.92, with a secondary resistance at $14.86. Bulls have nudged the coin upward in the short term, yet lingering bearish sentiment from past declines keeps the overall trend mixed. Trading ideas emerge where buyers might step in near support with targets around resistance levels, while sellers watch for stalling or reversals near $10.88. A cautious approach is advisable until the coin confirms a clear break to the upside or a sustained move downward. Conclusion FIL and AR offer potential for long-term growth due to their unique roles in decentralized storage. FIL, with its established network, and AR, with its permanent data storage solution, both aim to capitalize on the increasing demand for secure and reliable data preservation. Their current pricing may present an opportunity for accumulation for those believing in the future of decentralized storage solutions. However, careful consideration of market trends and each project’s advancements should guide any investment decisions. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Whales bought 320 million XRP in just 72 hours, as per Ali Martinez. Price is holding above $3.20 support, with short-term targets at $3.55–$3.70. XRP has been on a steady rise over the past week, gaining more than 8% to trade around $3.24. The move comes after the token broke out of a consolidation wedge pattern, rejecting its channel support and pushing higher. Traders are now watching closely as XRP tests the $3.33 resistance level, a key price point that could decide its next big move. Strong Support Levels in Play On the daily chart, XRP is holding firm above the 20-day EMA at $3.14, with the 50-day EMA at $2.93 providing an additional cushion if prices dip. As long as the price stays above $3.20, the bullish outlook remains in place. This stability gives buyers confidence to target higher price zones, with short-term goals in the $3.55–$3.70 range.

Estonian Banker's Lost Ethereum Wallet Worth Over $1.2 Billion At that time, in an interview with Estonian public radio, Lõhmus said, “There are 250,000 Ethereum in the wallet, anyone who wants can calculate the value themselves,” and stated that he would consider it if a credible rescue offer came. Coinbase product director Conor Groga soon linked a wallet address to Lõhmus. With Ethereum briefly surpassing $4,700 on Wednesday and returning to 2021 highs, the value of these lost assets has reached approximately $1.2 billion. This figure is nearly triple what it was in October 2023, when Ethereum was around $1,600. According to Arkham Intelligence data, the wallet remains intact, with the exception of a few small transfers. “Perfect decentralization also has risks that are not often considered,” Lõhmus said, describing the feeling of losing his passwords and keys, recalling a small Bitcoin purchase he lost access to in the past. It's common in the crypto world for assets to be lost forever, whether through lost passwords or accidentally discarded hardware.

50072796,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78346,1755164698,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Researcher Presents Direct Code Linking XRP to ISO 20022 and SWIFT,https://timestabloid.com/researcher-presents-direct-code-linking-xrp-to-iso-20022-and-swift/,"A recent tweet from prominent XRP community member SMQKE has drawn attention to specific code linking XRP’s infrastructure to both the ISO 20022 messaging standard and SWIFT systems. In his post , SMQKE presented two screenshots of code files. The first image displays part of RippleNet’s “Payment Object – Supporting Information Schema” in JSON format. Within this schema, an “externalclearingsystem” definition is shown with a description explicitly stating that it is “based on ISO 20022 ExternalClearingSystemIdentificationCode list.” The enum values listed in the code represent various clearing system identifiers from around the world, directly tying RippleNet’s payment structure to the ISO 20022 framework. SMQKE emphasized that this is not a conceptual or indirect association but rather a technical integration within RippleNet’s architecture. By building the schema on ISO 20022’s ExternalClearingSystemIdentificationCode list, RippleNet aligns its payment messaging standards with the same framework used globally by banks, payment providers, and SWIFT-enabled institutions. If you want to see direct code linking XRP to ISO 20022 and SWIFT, here it is: • RippleNet’s Payment schema directly references the ISO 20022 ExternalClearingSystemIdentificationCode list — proof XRP’s infrastructure is built on ISO 20022 standards. • R3 Corda’s codebase… pic.twitter.com/hazbPh51zm — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 12, 2025 Integration of XRP and SWIFT Functions in R3 Corda Codebase The second screenshot SMQKE shared comes from R3 Corda’s finance module codebase. In this section, multiple import statements are visible, including modules such as “XrpPayment,” “XrpSettlement,” “SWIFTService,” and “SWIFTPaymentStatusType.” The presence of these modules within the same system suggests a technical environment in which XRP transaction functions and SWIFT-related services can coexist and potentially interoperate. According to SMQKE, this integration is significant because it demonstrates that XRP-related processes and SWIFT messaging services are accessible within the same financial software framework. Given that SWIFT has mandated ISO 20022 compliance for all participants, having XRP functions coded into a SWIFT-compatible platform implies that XRP is technically positioned to connect and settle transactions with any SWIFT-enabled institution. Why This Matters SMQKE argued that any token or entity interacting with SWIFT must meet ISO 20022 compliance requirements. By showing code that includes both ISO 20022-based schema elements and combined XRP-SWIFT modules, he claims the evidence confirms XRP’s readiness to operate in a standards-compliant global payments environment. His view is that this positions Ripple, through the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and its associated payment solutions, to integrate with the existing banking infrastructure without barriers to settlement. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Context from Previous Industry Discussions According to a previous Times Tabloid article, the subject of XRP and ISO 20022 compliance has recently been debated in the community. In that earlier report, XRPL validator Vet responded to comments from business leader Jake Claver, who claimed XRP was the first cryptocurrency to prioritize ISO 20022 compliance. Software engineer Nik Bougalis clarified that ISO 20022 is a messaging standard and that XRP, as a digital asset, is not directly “ISO 20022 compliant.” He explained that while Ripple’s commercial software products can support ISO 20022, this does not apply to XRP or the XRP Ledger itself. SMQKE’s latest evidence focuses on the software architecture level, showing direct references to ISO 20022 elements within RippleNet and the technical coexistence of XRP and SWIFT modules in R3 Corda’s environment. While this does not change Bougalis’ earlier distinction between messaging standards and digital assets, it highlights that the infrastructure supporting XRP transactions can be built in full alignment with global banking standards.

On-chain market intelligence platform Glassnode recently shared a remarkable insight: an astounding 99% of the entire Bitcoin supply is currently in profit . This figure is not just a fleeting moment; it highlights a profound underlying strength in the overall BTC market structure . What Does “99% Bitcoin Supply in Profit” Truly Mean? When we talk about Bitcoin supply in profit , it refers to the percentage of circulating BTC that is held at an unrealized gain. In simpler terms, if a Bitcoin was acquired at a lower price than its current market value, it contributes to this “in profit” statistic. Glassnode, a leading authority in on-chain insights , meticulously tracks these metrics. Their recent update on X confirmed this near-universal profitability for Bitcoin holders. This metric is a powerful indicator of investor confidence and market health. It shows that the vast majority of participants who bought Bitcoin, regardless of when they entered the market, are currently seeing positive returns on their investment. This scenario often leads to less selling pressure and a more stable market environment. BTC Market Structure: Resilient Through Volatility What makes this statistic even more compelling is its persistence. Glassnode noted that even during the market pullback in July, the ratio remained remarkably high, hovering around 95%. This demonstrates exceptional crypto market resilience . Investors continued to “anchor around unrealized gains,” as Glassnode put it, reinforcing a strong market structure even when faced with price fluctuations. Strong Holder Conviction: The high percentage suggests that long-term holders are not easily swayed by short-term dips. They believe in Bitcoin’s future potential. Reduced Panic Selling: When most holders are in profit, the likelihood of widespread panic selling during minor corrections decreases significantly. Foundation for Growth: A resilient market structure provides a solid foundation for future price appreciation. Unpacking On-Chain Insights: How Glassnode Sees It Glassnode specializes in transforming raw blockchain data into actionable on-chain insights . They analyze every transaction, every wallet address, and every movement of coins to understand the behavior of market participants. This deep dive into the blockchain allows them to determine the acquisition cost of nearly every Bitcoin in circulation. Their analysis offers a transparent and objective view of the market, free from speculative narratives. These insights are invaluable for investors and analysts alike. They provide a clear picture of where the market stands from a fundamental perspective, offering a counterpoint to often volatile price action. Understanding the cost basis of the Bitcoin supply in profit helps predict potential support and resistance levels, further solidifying the BTC market structure . Implications for Cryptocurrency Gains and Investor Sentiment The fact that almost all of the Bitcoin supply in profit is a huge psychological boost for the market. It cultivates positive investor sentiment , encouraging new capital inflows and reinforcing the belief in Bitcoin as a store of value and a profitable asset. What are the implications for potential cryptocurrency gains moving forward? Bullish Signal: A high percentage of supply in profit is generally considered a bullish indicator, suggesting accumulation rather than distribution. Reduced Supply Shock: With fewer people incentivized to sell at current prices, the available supply on exchanges might tighten, potentially driving prices higher if demand increases. Attracting New Entrants: Consistent profitability can attract institutional and retail investors who were previously hesitant, boosting overall investor sentiment . In conclusion, Glassnode’s data paints a compelling picture of Bitcoin’s current health. The near-universal profitability of its supply, coupled with remarkable resilience through volatility, underscores a robust market structure. This powerful statistic is a testament to the strong conviction of Bitcoin holders and bodes well for future cryptocurrency gains , reinforcing positive investor sentiment across the board. It truly showcases Bitcoin’s enduring appeal and its ability to deliver value to its dedicated community. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is “Bitcoin supply in profit”? A1: “Bitcoin supply in profit” refers to the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply where the current market price is higher than the price at which those Bitcoins were last moved or acquired. Q2: How does Glassnode determine this metric? A2: Glassnode uses sophisticated on-chain insights and analysis to track every Bitcoin on the blockchain. By examining transaction history, they can estimate the “cost basis” (acquisition price) for each Bitcoin and compare it to the current market price. Q3: Why is 99% in profit significant for the BTC market structure? A3: A high percentage of Bitcoin supply in profit indicates strong holder conviction and reduced selling pressure. It shows that most investors are not underwater, contributing to a more resilient and stable BTC market structure even during pullbacks. Q4: Does this guarantee future cryptocurrency gains? A4: While a high percentage of Bitcoin in profit is a positive indicator and can foster bullish investor sentiment , it does not guarantee future price movements. The crypto market remains volatile, and various factors influence prices. Q5: How does this data impact investor sentiment? A5: Seeing that the vast majority of Bitcoin holders are profitable can significantly boost positive investor sentiment . It reinforces confidence in Bitcoin as a viable investment and can attract new capital into the market, potentially leading to further cryptocurrency gains .

However, it faces mounting pressure from rivals that are eroding its dominance and revenue streams. According to blockchain analytics firm Nansen, Ethereum processed more than 1.7 million transactions on Tuesday, placing daily activity close to historic highs. Yet, that figure is overshadowed by the performance of newer networks. Layer-2 platforms like Arbitrum handled over 3.4 million transactions, while Base processed a staggering 8.6 million. Aptos, a competing layer-1 blockchain, registered 3.8 million transactions on Monday, according to data from The Tie. Active addresses on Ethereum have remained relatively stable over the years, fluctuating between 400,000 and 600,000 since 2018, with occasional surges above the one-million mark. The flat trend suggests that while it remains a top-tier smart contract platform, much of its transactional flow is migrating to other chains. Impact of Layer-2 Growth and Fee Reductions A major driver of this shift has been Ethereum’s own ecosystem. The March 2024-launched Dencun upgrade significantly lowered transaction fees for layer-2 networks operating atop Ethereum. While this improved affordability for users, it also encouraged them to conduct activity away from the base layer, reducing direct fee revenue. At its peak, Ethereum base-layer fees could reach $50 per transaction during high congestion, a pain point that layer-2 solutions have largely resolved. These cheaper alternatives have become attractive destinations for users seeking faster, more cost-effective transactions, leaving mainnet with less direct usage. Meanwhile, competing layer-1 networks like Solana and Sui are offering high throughput at lower costs, drawing further attention and liquidity away from Ethereum. Strategic Crossroads for Ethereum The Ethereum Foundation now faces a critical decision on how to respond to these market shifts. Some industry leaders caution against engaging in a direct performance race. Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron recently argued that trying to match newer layer-1s on raw throughput could be “dangerous” for ETH, potentially compromising its long-term stability and security. Instead, the network may need to double down on its strengths — security, decentralization, and developer community — while refining its scaling strategy to ensure that both its base layer and ecosystem of layer-2s can thrive in a competitive environment. With Ether nearing a key psychological price level and the competition intensifying, the next phase of its evolution could determine whether it retains its crown as the premier smart contract platform or cedes further ground to faster-moving challengers.

This marks the start of community distribution, well before the Token Generation Event (TGE). Unlike a TGE — which unlocks token liquidity and market trading — the current public sale phase allows early supporters to secure allocations at a discounted rate ahead of exchange listings and full ecosystem activation. The initial distribution phase begins alongside the first phase of ReactorTrade’s public rollout — the Trade Aggregation Engine — with yield aggregation vaults scheduled for Q4 2025 and dynamic perpetuals set to follow in early 2026, forming a multi-phase product roadmap designed to steadily expand user capabilities. DeFi Market Momentum Supports $REACT’s Public Sale The timing coincides with a surge of interest across the DeFi sector. As of June 2025, the combined market capitalization of top DeFi tokens reached $98.4 billion, representing a 38% year-over-year surge from $71.2 billion. Across the sector, the numbers show investors are once again interested in productive, infrastructure-focused crypto assets. According to industry data , DeFi was June’s top-performing category with a roughly 10.9% increase in total value locked, even as the broader crypto market remained flat. Meanwhile, the Coinbase COIN50 index showed a strong increase in TVL across DeFi assets. This all but confirms sustained momentum at a time when the broader market and other sectors are showing flat or even declining trends. ReactorTrade’s token sale taps into this trend, positioning $REACT amid a DeFi upswing that is valuing utility, governance power, and yield mechanics. More About $REACT $REACT launches with a maximum supply based on a $30M starting fully diluted valuation (FDV), with an FDV of $100M projected at TGE. The current price of the token is $0.03, increasing to $0.10 at the TGE. $REACT will be available on BNB Chain and Base. The global token distribution follows a deflationary supply model: for every token sold to the community, an equal token is permanently burned. The token allocation is 20% LP tokens, 25% community tokens, 5% team tokens (locked for 12 months, then vested linearly over 24 months), 20% ecosystem growth, 2% KOLs, 3% advisors, and 25% burned. Under the burn-on-sale model, the “community tokens” share is flexible — for every token sold, an equivalent token is earned for distribution, and the undistributed portion adjusts accordingly. For example, if 35% of the supply is sold, 35% will be earned for distribution and the undistributed share will drop proportionally. In terms of utility, $REACT acts as the core economic and governance layer for ReactorTrade. Holders can vote on protocol decisions like new market listings and feature priorities, with voting power tied to holdings or staking levels. Stakers can also earn trading fee discounts, liquidity reward multipliers, and access to event-based promotions. Token holdings will determine membership tiers, to be introduced after the first stage of the sale, offering varying bonuses and perks for participants. Certain premium features, such as early market access, advanced trading bots, exclusive analytics, and alpha/beta testing participation, are token-gated and require either a minimum holding or staking commitment. This mechanism ties token scarcity directly to platform adoption — a rarity among DeFi governance models — creating a clear link between network growth and tokenholder value. To further widen community participation, ReactorTrade is introducing its “ConvertDrop” program, allowing early supporters and partner protocol communities to swap certain assets or stake holdings in exchange for recurring $REACT airdrops, reinforcing grassroots ownership from day one. About ReactorTrade and the $REACT Token ReactorTrade is a decentralized trading and yield platform combining spot trading, permissionless perpetuals, and meta-governance yield aggregation in one interface. By unifying liquidity aggregation, yield strategies, and governance, it solves a core DeFi pain point — switching between multiple tools to trade, farm, and vote. Its hybrid architecture blends aggregated AMM liquidity, on-chain order book access, and automated strategy vaults for deep liquidity, fast execution, and reduced MEV risk. Built with a community-first approach and backed by seed funding, ReactorTrade is designed for progressive decentralization, with its $REACT token powering governance, incentives, and long-term value alignment across the ecosystem.

Exploring $REACT's Utility and Tokenomics $REACT is introduced at an initial price of $0.03, with expectations to rise to $0.10 by the TGE. It will be accessible on well-known chains like BNB Chain and Base, with a meticulously planned token distribution to ensure sustainable supply and demand dynamics. The token's utility extends beyond simple transactions; it encompasses voting on protocol decisions, staking for rewards, and access to premium platform features.

The approval of LIP-021 authorizes a massive ListaDAO token burn of 200 million LISTA tokens. This move is not just a number; it represents a substantial 20% reduction in the token’s total supply, signaling a strong commitment to the project’s long-term health and value. What Does This ListaDAO Token Burn Mean for LISTA Holders? The recent approval of LIP-021, publicly announced on X, marks a pivotal moment for the ListaDAO ecosystem. Burning 200 million LISTA token units directly impacts the token’s scarcity. When the supply of an asset decreases while demand remains stable or grows, its value can potentially increase. This strategic decision reflects a proactive approach to managing the token’s economy. Reduced Supply: A 20% reduction makes LISTA more scarce. Potential for Value Appreciation: Scarcity can lead to higher demand and price. Commitment to Ecosystem Health: Shows the DAO’s dedication to sustainable growth. This ListaDAO token burn is a clear signal of the community’s intent to foster a robust and valuable asset for its participants. Strengthening the lisUSD Stablecoin Ecosystem Through Crypto Tokenomics While the focus is on the LISTA token, this burn also has implications for the lisUSD stablecoin . LISTA plays a vital role within the ListaDAO ecosystem, often used for governance, staking, and incentivizing liquidity. A stronger, more valuable LISTA token can contribute to the overall stability and attractiveness of the entire platform. Effective crypto tokenomics are essential for any successful decentralized project. By strategically managing the supply of its native token, ListaDAO aims to create a more resilient and appealing environment for users who mint or utilize lisUSD. This ensures a healthier foundation for the stablecoin, which relies on the stability and perceived value of its underlying ecosystem. The Power of DeFi Governance: Why Community Votes Matter The approval of LIP-021 highlights the true power of DeFi governance . This significant decision was not made by a centralized entity but through a community vote. This democratic process allows LISTA token holders to directly influence the protocol’s direction and economic policies. It showcases the decentralized nature of ListaDAO and the collective decision-making process that defines Web3 projects. The success of this proposal demonstrates: Active Community Participation: Engaged token holders are vital for a DAO’s success. Transparency: Decisions are made openly through on-chain voting. Accountability: The community holds itself accountable for the project’s future. This democratic approach builds trust and ensures that the protocol evolves in a way that benefits its broad user base. Looking Ahead: The Future of LISTA and Decentralized Finance The ListaDAO token burn is more than just a one-time event; it’s a strategic move designed to bolster the project’s long-term viability within the competitive decentralized finance landscape. By reducing the circulating supply, ListaDAO aims to enhance the value proposition of LISTA, which in turn can strengthen the security and utility of the lisUSD stablecoin. This action sets a precedent for how decentralized autonomous organizations can actively manage their token economies to promote sustainable growth and benefit their communities. As the DeFi space continues to mature, such strategic tokenomic decisions will become increasingly important for projects aiming for longevity and widespread adoption. The future looks promising for ListaDAO as it continues to innovate and empower its community. Summary: A Bold Step for ListaDAO ListaDAO has taken a bold and decisive step by approving the burn of 200 million LISTA tokens. This substantial ListaDAO token burn , representing 20% of the total supply, is a testament to the project’s commitment to strengthening its ecosystem and enhancing the value of the LISTA token. It underscores the power of DeFi governance and proactive crypto tokenomics, setting a positive trajectory for both LISTA and the lisUSD stablecoin within the broader decentralized finance arena. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the ListaDAO token burn? The ListaDAO token burn refers to the recent approval of LIP-021, which authorizes the permanent removal of 200 million LISTA tokens from circulation, equivalent to 20% of the total supply. Why did ListaDAO decide to burn LISTA tokens? ListaDAO decided to burn LISTA tokens to reduce the total supply, which can increase the scarcity and potentially the value of the remaining tokens. This is a strategic move to improve the overall health and tokenomics of the ecosystem. How does the LISTA token burn affect the lisUSD stablecoin?

U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Robinhood is making a strategic play, actively seeking a Robinhood Dubai license . This significant move signals their intent to establish a strong foothold in the dynamic Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, a vibrant hub for digital asset innovation and a key area for future cryptocurrency exchange expansion . Why is Robinhood Targeting the MENA Crypto Market? The Middle East and North Africa region is rapidly emerging as a hotspot for digital finance. With a young, tech-savvy population and governments keen on fostering innovation, the MENA crypto market presents immense growth opportunities. Robinhood’s application to the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) is a clear indication of this potential. The demand for robust and accessible UAE trading services is on the rise. Untapped Potential: The region boasts a burgeoning retail trading market, with increasing interest in cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. This offers a vast new user base for platforms like Robinhood. Favorable Regulations: Dubai, in particular, has been proactive in creating a regulated environment for digital assets, attracting major players. This regulatory clarity is crucial for secure operations. Strategic Gateway: Operating from Dubai provides a crucial base for wider cryptocurrency exchange expansion across the entire MENA region, acting as a bridge to other emerging markets. This strategic pivot allows Robinhood to tap into a market ripe for new trading platforms and services, diversifying its global reach beyond its established U.S. operations. It’s a bold step for Robinhood Dubai license aspirations. Navigating Dubai Financial Services: What Does the DFSA License Mean? Securing a license from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) is a rigorous process, highlighting Dubai’s commitment to robust financial oversight. Robinhood’s application isn’t just for crypto; it also includes foreign exchange and other trading services. This comprehensive approach underscores their ambition to offer a broad suite of UAE trading services , positioning them as a versatile financial platform within the Dubai financial services ecosystem. For users in the UAE and potentially beyond, this means: Regulated Access: If approved, Robinhood will operate under the DFSA’s supervision, offering a heightened level of trust and security for investors. Diverse Offerings: Beyond crypto, users could access foreign exchange and other trading instruments, significantly expanding their investment opportunities on one platform. Local Presence: A Dubai base facilitates better understanding and catering to local market needs and preferences, fostering a more user-centric experience for UAE trading services . However, it is important to note that Robinhood’s services remain unavailable to local users until full regulatory approval is granted. This waiting period is standard for any significant entry into new financial markets, especially those governed by strict Dubai financial services regulations, ensuring consumer protection and market integrity. Robinhood’s Broader Vision: Global Cryptocurrency Exchange Expansion Robinhood’s pursuit of a Robinhood Dubai license is a pivotal step in its broader global strategy. The company has openly expressed its intentions to expand internationally, and the MENA region is a logical next frontier for cryptocurrency exchange expansion . This move signifies a proactive approach to becoming a truly global player in the digital asset space, moving beyond its primarily U.S.-centric operations. The success of this venture could pave the way for further cryptocurrency exchange expansion into other promising markets, building on the experience gained in Dubai. It demonstrates Robinhood’s commitment to growth and adapting its services to meet diverse global demands, particularly in the rapidly evolving MENA crypto market . As the world becomes increasingly interconnected through digital finance, platforms like Robinhood are positioning themselves to serve a wider, international audience, offering comprehensive UAE trading services . In essence, Robinhood is not just looking to enter a new market; it is aiming to become a significant force in the evolving landscape of global digital trading. The outcome of their Robinhood Dubai license application will be closely watched by the entire industry as a benchmark for future international ventures. Conclusion: Robinhood’s strategic push for a Robinhood Dubai license marks a significant moment for the company and the broader MENA crypto market . By seeking to offer comprehensive UAE trading services under the stringent framework of Dubai financial services , Robinhood is clearly signaling its ambitious plans for global cryptocurrency exchange expansion . While regulatory approval is still pending, this move highlights the growing appeal of the Middle East as a vibrant hub for digital asset innovation. The coming months will undoubtedly reveal the full impact of this exciting development on both Robinhood’s trajectory and the regional digital finance ecosystem.

Analysts like Altcoin Sherpa and KALEO foresee a strong rally, with targets including a new ATH and even $6.94; DOGE’s RSI has cooled from overbought levels (80) to 54, potentially setting the stage for further gains. They Know Something We Don’t? The popular X user Ali Martinez revealed that big Dogecoin investors, specifically those holding between 100 million and one billion coins, purchased two billion DOGE in the past seven days alone. The USD equivalent of the scooped-up amount is almost $500 million, while those whales increased their total possessions to 27.6 billion tokens, or roughly 18.3% of the meme coin’s circulating supply. DOGE has performed quite well in the past week, with its price surging by 17% to the current $0.24. The massive accumulation from the large investors caused some to speculate that they might have inside information about an important development that could trigger additional gains. “2B DOGE in 7 days? Either they know something we don’t … or we’re about to find out the hard way, “ one X user commenting on the post said . The potential approval of the first spot DOGE ETF in the USA is expected to have a positive impact on the price, and one can hypothesize that this is what the whales are waiting for. According to Polymarket, the odds for a green light before the end of 2025 stand at 61% which , in fact, marks a serious decline from the 79% witnessed on August 10 . DOGE ETF Probability, Source: Polymarket The Next Targets The crypto community seems quite optimistic about the OG meme coin, envisioning an impressive rally in the short term. X user Altcoin Sherpa believes “the environment is finally pretty good for it to have a run soon. “ The analyst predicted that DOGE would surge to a new all-time high once bitcoin (BTC) does so. It is important to note that a few hours ago, the biggest cryptocurrency soared to a fresh record of over $124,000 , so it will be interesting to see whether the OG meme coin will follow its steps . KALEO is also very bullish, arguing the DOGE/BTC chart looks like “it’s ready to make the same type of move” witnessed in January of 2021. The analyst thinks it’s only a matter of time before companies start buying billions of dollars of the meme coin, setting $6.9420 as a target. Meanwhile, DOGE’s RSI (Relative Strength Index) is now longer in bearish territory, slipping from over 80 on August 9 to the current 54. Typically, readings beyond 70 suggest the asset is overbought and could be headed for a pullback, while anything below 30 can be interpreted as a bullish signal.

Following the high, the price retraced to just above $121,000. While the crypto market is very bullish, buyers are starting to lose steam. Could buyer exhaustion bring the price further down? Excitement continues to grow The good news for crypto just keeps on coming, at least in the US, which is the main market for alternative assets. Only just last week, President Trump signed an executive order allowing Americans to invest their 401(k) retirement savings accounts into crypto. Looking into the future, this move alone could open the door to some of the more than $12 trillion that is invested into these plans. With Bitcoin just having hit a new all-time high it might be expected that this surge continues. Excitement is growing by the day and the US stock exchanges are riding high, making their own all-time highs with mounting regularity. A note of caution However, Bitcoin is just on the edge of the overbought zone. Therefore, two possible scenarios could play out. Firstly, the market could continue to climb higher, but eventually reach a point where buyer exhaustion causes a precipitous plunge back to earth. The other potential scenario is that the Bitcoin price starts to track sideways again until the momentum indicators for the shorter term time frames have reset. This is still a bull market One thing to bear in mind is that this is a bull market, and it is entering what could be its final stage. The trend is up, and is likely to remain so. There will probably be more corrections to come, but in the main, this market is likely to go higher. $BTC in healthy trend higher Source: TradingView The short-term time frame shows that since leaving the bull flag the $BTC price has continued higher, but in a very healthy ebb and flow manner, without surging madly. After making the all-time high, the price has come back to test the tops of the candles from the last upward impulse. The Fibonacci levels for this entire bull flag move reveal that the price is now beyond the 0.786 level. The 1.618 extension level is overhead, pretty much exactly at $130,000. Finally, the ascending trendline (faint dotted line) is still being respected. So until it’s not, this particular upside impulse is probably set to continue. $BTC continuation of this upside move? Source: TradingView The daily time frame illustrates the trend break in the RSI. The indicator line broke up through the descending trendline and this was reflected in the bull flag breakout in the price action. Now this recent upward trend (faint dotted line) has reached the point where it will either continue, or it will break down. A bounce of the indicator line from this ascending trendline would signal a continuation of the upside move. $BTC price follows bull market parabolic curve Source: TradingView Zoomed right out on the weekly time frame, the entirety of this bull run plus the climatic stage of the previous one can be viewed. The Fibonacci extension levels indicate that the 1.618 Fibonacci level was reached at just over $100,000, while the 2.618 level is overhead at a price of almost $155,000 - a very possible target. It can be seen that the price action is still keeping to the parabolic curve, meaning that the price is likely to continue to rise steeply. At the bottom of the chart, the Hash Ribbons indicator has printed a row of 3 back-to-back blue buy signals. Such a tight group of 3 buy signals has never printed before on the weekly time frame. It can only be imagined what could happen to the price from here. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers. The L2 will run on a Canonical Bridge, combined with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), for native compatibility with Solana. You’ll be able to build token programs, LP logic, oracles, games, NFT infrastructure, DAOs, and much more. All without reinventing the wheel. To engage with the L2, you’ll deposit $BTC to a designated address monitored by the Canonical Bridge. The Relay Program verifies the details, and then mints an equivalent number of wrapped $BTC on the L2. You can also withdraw your original $BTC at any time.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Bitcoin has just set a fresh all-time high, putting it into uncharted territory. With no historical resistance levels ahead, the only hurdles now are psychological milestones – $125K being a key one to watch. While die-hard Bitcoin loyalists may want the rally to keep charging ahead, seasoned investors will be more than happy to see a healthy pullback, perhaps toward the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. That would simply signal a reset before an even stronger push past $125K. The important thing here is not to panic; such a correction would be a normal part of sustaining momentum. One of the strongest reasons to believe this breakout is genuine – and not a mere ‘fakeout’ – is yesterday’s daily candle close above the previous ATH. A quick intraday spike followed by a close back below would have been a warning sign, but thankfully that’s not the case here. An upward-sloping trendline (orange), which has been respected multiple times in recent days, continues to provide solid support. Moreover, the 20, 50, and 200 EMAs are all trending upwards, with BTC trading comfortably above them. This alignment is a textbook bullish signal, reinforcing the market’s strong momentum. If these conditions hold, Bitcoin looks well-positioned not just to test $125K but potentially to push well beyond it. Bitcoin Hyper Eyes Meme Coin ETF Momentum as Canary Capital Files for TRUMP Fund August 14, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Canary Capital has registered the ‘Canary Trump Coin ETF’ in Delaware, setting the stage for a spot ETF tied to the Solana-based $TRUMP token. If approved, it would be just the third meme coin ETF filing in the U.S., following Dogecoin-linked products. Canary has also filed for a PENGU ETF , making it one of the few managers betting on multiple high-volatility altcoins instead of sticking to $BTC, $ETH, or $SOL. With institutional products inching into meme territory, liquidity and mainstream access to retail-driven assets could accelerate. That’s the same speculative-meets-structural narrative powering Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first true Bitcoin Layer 2 integrated with Solana’s Virtual Machine , which has already raised over $9.37M. Check out our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction to see where it could go next. Bullish IPO Rockets Past $2B Valuation on First Trading Day, Helping Boost Best Wallet Utility August 14, 2025 • 10:00 UTC CoinDesk parent company Bullish exceeded market expectations in its IPO. Initially targeted at $32–$33 per share according to its SEC filing, the price was raised to $37, giving the company a $1.1B valuation. The stock’s price skyrocketed almost immediately, opening at $90 and reaching as much as $110 before closing at $68 . The rally lifted the company’s market value to $2B. The IPO also allocated 20% of shares to individual investors, or double the usual 10%. This should help further expand crypto adoption and exposure among individuals. As a result, demand among consumers for secure crypto wallets to store their digital assets is expected to grow. This puts Best Wallet in an ideal position to meet this need. Aside from letting you store your crypto, you can also swap and trade tokens, and even join presales (e.g., Bitcoin Hyper) all within the app. With $14M raised so far in its Best Wallet Token ($BEST) presale, it’s setting up to be a huge player in the market in the foreseeable future.

In 2025, Dogecoin stands shoulder-to-shoulder next to Bitcoin. One is the first cryptocurrency, while our doggo friend is widely recognized as the first meme coin. Launched in 2013, $DOGE is up by over 44000% today, looking at a price of over $0.24 and a trading volume in the billions of dollars. If anything, Dogecoin proves that ‘anything is possible’ in crypto, and even underdogs can become industry giants. With endorsements from industry moguls like Elon Musk and official investment vehicles like the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, $DOGE seems to be going nowhere but up.

While it’s down 1.15% today, this mild pullback was all but certain given that $DOGE is now pressing into strong resistance zones. At present, the meme coin faces two major hurdles: Blue Rectangle Resistance : This zone triggered a sharp 45% sell-off back in June. Upper Triangle Trendline : The blue line marking the top of a long-standing triangle pattern. On the flip side, $DOGE has plenty of bullish ammunition to potentially break through. Key supports include an upward-sloping trendline (orange) and the major EMAs – the 20, 50, and 200 – all trending higher. The coming days could be pivotal. A clean break above both resistance levels could propel $DOGE toward the triangle’s high, which would result in a massive 100% rally from current levels. DOGE Breaks Resistance at $0.23, Golden Cross Signals Rally Ahead August 14, 2025 • 10:00 UTC After struggling to break through resistance at $0.23 since early August, $DOGE rekindled its bullish trend. Over the past month, $DOGE had three attempts to clear this level but selling pressure was stronger than bull demand. Now, $DOGE targets stronger resistance at $0.28, only briefly achieved on July 22. If current momentum proves persistent, $DOGE’s 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) could cross the 200-day EMA, forming the golden cross – a firm signal of an upcoming long-term rally. Even at the current level, $DOGE is well above its main moving averages, which could serve as key support points during the run. With a $36B market cap, $DOGE is hard to dethrone. But Maxi Doge ($MAXI) aspires to become the next alpha with 1,000x leverage trades and a locked-in community.

This has led to expectations that the bull rally will continue and that the leading digital asset is set to put in a new all-time high above its previous $123,000 peak. This has also come with the formation of multiple bullish patterns on the Bitcoin price chart that lend credence to predictions that a new all-time high is on the horizon. Bull Flags Put Bitcoin At New All-Time Highs Crypto analyst Madden shared an interesting development on the Bitcoin price chart after its recent rally. This analysis focused on the recent break that has now ended the long-standing consolidation that points toward a continuation of the rally. Additionally, the analyst also outlined the possible next steps for the Bitcoin price and where it could end up. One of the most notable things that has happened during this time is that the price was able to retest and break out of the channel above $117,000. As Madden explains, this retest and break have now led to the creation of a possible bull flag, and this could point to a further price surge. There is also the fact that there is now a rising blue diagonal line from the previous support, suggesting higher lows for the Bitcoin price. Then again, a bullish cross could possibly be on the horizon. This is forming in the MACD-indicator that suggests that bears will continue to lose their hold on the market. Taking all of these developments into account and adding in the fact that Bitcoin is now forming a textbook bull flag, the most likely outcome from here is that the cryptocurrency will see a possible 10% increase to notch new peaks. How High Can The Bull Flags Take The BTC Price? Three bull flags are highlighted in the chart that could see the Bitcoin price hit new all-time high after all-time high . The first bull flag is at the $127,500 level that would signal the first continuation of the bullish trend. Once this is established, then the other two bull flags come into play.

Yet, top technical analysts and market chartists are turning their attention to a different player with even more explosive potential: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This emerging altcoin is predicted to break the $5 price barrier well before Bitcoin reaches its milestone, thanks to a combination of innovative technology, strong fundamentals, and an actively growing community. How Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Different? What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart from other tokens is its well-structured approach to decentralized finance. The upcoming beta launch will allow early users to interact directly with MUTM’s lending, borrowing, and staking platform, providing practical value rather than speculative hype. This hands-on experience is expected to significantly boost user engagement and attract a wide audience, strengthening token demand. On top of that, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s integration with Layer-2 technology will dramatically reduce transaction fees and increase speed, creating a smoother and more cost-effective user experience. Compared to networks that struggle with congestion and high costs, MUTM’s platform will offer a clear advantage, which chartists consider a major factor in its bullish outlook. Adding to its appeal is the soon-to-be-launched decentralized stablecoin. This feature will enhance the ecosystem by offering more borrowing and lending flexibility, broadening the platform’s use cases and attracting everyday traders. The introduction of a stablecoin is a key catalyst that will drive organic growth and help maintain price momentum in the coming months. Strong Presale Momentum and Dual Lending Advantages Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, raising substantial capital and expanding its community base. Over $14.33 million has been raised so far, with the token priced at an attractive $0.035. More than 15,200 holders have joined the platform, signaling robust investor interest. Notably, 15% of the tokens allocated for this phase are already sold, with a planned 15% price increase to $0.040 in the next phase. This makes now the ideal moment for investors to secure MUTM tokens at a discount before prices rise. One of the core strengths behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s long-term growth is its dual lending mechanism, designed to appeal to a wide range of users. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending allows users to earn steady yields by leveraging blue-chip crypto assets in pooled contracts, providing reliable and consistent returns. Meanwhile, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending introduces higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities using popular meme coins and volatile tokens. This flexibility not only broadens user engagement but also generates diverse revenue streams, positioning MUTM for sustained ecosystem growth. To illustrate the token’s potential, consider an early investor who put $5,000 into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 1 or 2, when the price was approximately $0.015. Their holdings have already more than doubled at the current presale price of $0.035. As chartists forecast a rise to $5, this initial investment is set to skyrocket to around $1,500,000 — a remarkable 300x return. When compared to the projected listing price of $0.06, this growth far exceeds typical market expectations and highlights the lucrative opportunity waiting for early buyers. Supporting this optimism is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s strong security profile. The project has earned a rigorous CertiK audit score of 95 along with a Skynet score of 78, ensuring robust smart contract protection. Such high audit scores give investors confidence in the safety and reliability of the platform, a critical factor in a market often plagued by vulnerabilities. Final Words The project’s well-defined roadmap continues progressing steadily toward key milestones, including the beta launch and major exchange listings on top platforms such as Coinbase and Binance. These events will significantly increase visibility, liquidity, and user adoption, which are essential for sustained price appreciation. With the ecosystem’s growth accelerating, the momentum behind MUTM is expected to build rapidly. For retail traders and investors watching the market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a rare combination of strong fundamentals and explosive upside. The discounted presale price of $0.035 is available only while Phase 6 tokens last, making it a crucial window for those looking to enter early and maximize returns before the token’s value advances further.

50073506,556471,1755165945,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50073506.jpeg,Is Bitcoin Headed for a $250K Supercycle? ChatGPT Thinks So,https://bitcoinist.com/chatgpt-predicts-bitcoin-250k-supercycle-bitcoin-hyper-gains/,"Bitcoin hit a new all-time high today, crossing the $124K mark for the first time and sparking speculation of yet another explosive rally, potentially the kind we last saw in 2023. To get a clearer picture of what’s ahead, we turned to ChatGPT, which believes the $250K milestone could arrive sooner than many expect. According to ChatGPT, the biggest driver for this lofty Bitcoin price prediction is a strong technical setup. As shown in the chart below, the blue box highlights a key range defined by multiple touches on the top side. While it’s not strictly a consolidation phase, ChatGPT measured the width of this rectangle and projected it from the breakout point, which results in a $250K target (top of the green box). Keep reading for a full breakdown of the factors pushing $BTC toward $250K – plus ChatGPT’s top crypto pick (spoiler: it’s Bitcoin Hyper ) to ride what could be Bitcoin’s most explosive rally yet. Key Fundamentals Driving Bitcoin Higher Glassnode’s Realized Profit data shows that even at fresh all-time highs, realized profits in August were just $750M , far below the $2B peaks seen in January and July. This suggests long-term Bitcoin holders aren’t cashing out, signaling strong market confidence in the ‘digital gold.’ Off the back of this, 88% of Polymarket participants (up from Federal Reserve to cut rates in September . This will most likely fuel risk-on sentiment and send truckloads of fresh capital flowing into crypto. Adding further momentum is the recent 401(k) amendment that allows cryptocurrencies as an investment option for retirement funds . This opens the door for more institutional money to enter blue-chip digital assets like Bitcoin as retirees seek diversification and exposure to crypto’s outsized gains. More Bitcoin Technical Analysis $BTC is now in uncharted territory, with no resistance levels other than psychological milestones – the next being $125K. A healthy pullback here would allow Bitcoin to consolidate, build strength, and gather the firepower needed to blast past $125K on its march toward $250K. Also, all major EMAs – the 20, 50, and 200 – are trending higher, with price action firmly above them, signaling strong bullish momentum. When we asked ChatGPT how to best capitalize on this setup, it picked Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) as the best altcoin to buy right now. $HYPER effectively bolts an extra jet engine onto Bitcoin by adding Web3 and smart contract compatibility, giving the network the same capabilities as modern blockchains while retaining Bitcoin’s dominance as a store of value. What Is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER)? $HYPER is the world’s first Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin that adds an entirely new utility layer to the Bitcoin blockchain. While many Bitcoin-themed altcoins simply ride the Bitcoin hype for attention, $HYPER delivers real, tangible functionality. Bitcoin remains the OG cryptocurrency, commanding a $2.46T market cap – a massive 57% share of the total $4.27T crypto market. Yet it’s still shackled by outdated infrastructure, with high fees, slow transaction speeds, and zero Web3 compatibility. $HYPER changes that. By transforming Bitcoin from a passive store of value into a fully utility-rich, Web3-ready ecosystem, it positions itself as the best crypto to buy now for investors looking to ride the next wave of blockchain innovation. How Does Bitcoin Hyper Work? $HYPER is powered by two core components: a non-custodial, decentralized canonical bridge and Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration. The SVM allows developers to run smart contracts and build advanced dApps directly on Bitcoin, delivering the same speed and flexibility Solana is known for. Unlike Bitcoin’s sequential transaction processing (limited to ~7 transactions per second), the SVM uses parallel execution, validating multiple transactions at once for dramatically higher throughput. This high-speed functionality is enabled by the canonical bridge, which locks native $BTC on the Bitcoin network and mints an equivalent amount of ‘wrapped’ Bitcoin on Layer 2. These wrapped tokens can then be used within the SVM-powered ecosystem for DeFi trading, lending, staking, swapping, gaming dApps, and NFTs. When you’re done, simply send your wrapped $BTC back to the bridge to unlock your original $BTC. In simple terms, it’s like swapping your traditional Bitcoin for a turbo-charged version, one with faster speeds, lower fees, and full Web3 utility, all without giving up ownership. The $HYPER Presale is Live: It Won’t Get Cheaper Than This The Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale is fast becoming the hottest crypto presale on the market, blasting past $9.4M in funding in just a few weeks. And it’s not just retail investors driving the hype. Just yesterday, a whale scooped up $161K worth of $HYPER – a strong vote of confidence from deep-pocketed institutional players. $HYPER is currently priced at just $0.0127, and given that you may never see it this cheap again, now’s the perfect time to join the tribe. Based on our $HYPER price prediction , the token could rocket to $0.32 by year-end, which would result in a potential 2,400% gain. Want in? Check out our step-by-step guide on how to buy $HYPER before the next price jump hits. Visit Bitcoin Hyper’s official website for more information. Bottom Line With Bitcoin setting a new all-time high, investors are eager to see what’s next. Backed by strong fundamental and technical tailwinds, ChatGPT has flagged a potential $250K target within the current rally itself. But savvy investors aren’t just content with $BTC’s price appreciation; they’re also looking for projects that bring real utility to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Enter Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a presale crypto aiming to make Bitcoin fully compatible with Web3 and smart contracts – a leap that was previously impossible. It’s crucial to remember, though, that crypto investments are highly risky.

Ripple’s SEC case resolution removes legal uncertainty, boosting investor confidence and long-term price outlook. Whales purchase 320M XRP in three days, reducing sell pressure and fueling bullish sentiment. Institutional Adoption and Market Growth XRP is trading at $3.23 after gaining 8% over the past week, though it slipped 2% in the last day. According to analyst David_kml, adoption among major banks and payment firms is expanding, with more institutions using the XRP Ledger for cross-border transactions. The shift signals a growing role for the network in global payments. $XRP is seeing strong growth with increasing institutional interest and wider adoption in global payments.

Another factor adding to momentum is the resolution of Ripple Labs’ long-standing case with the US SEC. Some analysts are likening the current market structure to Ethereum’s 2016 breakout, which was followed by an extended rally. Technical Outlook and Key Levels Analyst CRYPTOWZRD described the latest daily close as indecisive, noting a similar pattern for XRP/BTC. The token is sitting near $3.3 resistance. A move higher could bring $3.65 into view, while $3.23 serves as intraday support and $3.4 as the next resistance level to watch. Source: X Notably, the recent intraday action has been narrow, but CRYPTOWZRD sees potential for follow-through if buyers push above short-term resistance. “Above the $3.4 resistance target we will get the next trade opportunity as our current position will already be secured,” he said. According to coverage published by CryptoPotato , MikybullCrypto projected that XRP could reach between $6 and $8 before peaking in the current cycle. His view is based on a breakout over the $2.60–$2.80 range on the monthly chart after years of consolidation. Whale Activity and Market Influence Data from analyst Ali Martinez indicates that large holders have purchased 320 million XRP in three days, worth about $1 billion at current market prices. Heavy accumulation of this type can reduce short-term selling pressure and may sway sentiment among retail traders. A similar build-up in July was followed by a rally that pushed XRP past $3.60 to a record high. Market observers are watching to see if this buying wave leads to another strong advance.

The shift hinges on an overlooked HTTP web status code, “402 Payment Required,” first defined three decades ago, which is now being reimagined for blockchain use. According to an Ethereum Foundation update shared Wednesday, the combination of HTTP 402 with Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 3009 allows AI agents to make stablecoin payments without human approval. The insight came via a “guest thread” from Coinbase developers Kevin Leffew and Lincoln Murr, who believe these autonomous agents could become Ethereum’s “biggest power user.” Coinbase has already implemented the protocol, dubbed “x402,” on its GitHub. The development enables AI systems to pay for API calls, storage, and computation directly — eliminating the need for manual payment processes. AI Agents: A Vending Machine for Digital Services? Leffew and Murr liken the process to using a vending machine. When an AI agent receives an HTTP 402 request, it signs a transaction, makes the payment, and instantly gets the desired response. There are no accounts, passwords, or human approvals — just a single “round trip” between request and delivery. In practice, this means an API becomes “wallet-aware,” capable of recognizing and transacting with an AI agent’s funds. The Coinbase developers argue Ethereum’s trustless settlement layer makes it the perfect match for HTTP 402, providing atomic payments, programmable policies, and composable wallets — features they say traditional systems cannot match. From Image Generation to Self-Paying Vehicles While the concept sounds futuristic, experiments are already underway. Hyperbolic Labs is integrating HTTP 402 payments into its large language models, while Prodia Labs uses it to create AI-generated images and video content. “The magic of x402 isn’t just that agents can pay,” Leffew and Murr wrote, “it’s that they can autonomously chain services into full economic loops.” The potential applications are wide-ranging. Self-driving taxis could cover their own expenses in real time, AI models could produce content on demand while paying for the required resources, and apps could automatically use stablecoins to store data permanently. Even today, some autonomous agents already trade cryptocurrencies, scanning market data and executing buy and sell orders without human direction. With HTTP 402 and EIP 3009 in place, Ethereum could soon see an explosion of machine-to-machine commerce — and AI agents may quickly outpace human users as the network’s dominant participants.

At the same time Cardano (ADA) is breaking out strongly, up more than 12% at one point earlier on Thursday. Is this the beginning of the altcoin bull run, and will $ADA be one of the major cryptos to lead it? Combined altcoin market cap stops just short of all-time high Source: TradingView Total2 is the chart of the combined market capitalization of all the cryptocurrencies excluding $BTC, and is therefore a good barometer of how the altcoin market is performing. As can be seen in the chart above, the price has broken out of the descending trendline, which stretches all the way from the last altcoin market all-time high at $1.71 trillion. The current price surge stopped just short of this at $1.69 trillion, and may be coming back to confirm the trendline breakout. At the bottom of the chart, first the Stochastic RSI shows the indicator lines perhaps shaping to cross back up, while the Relative Strength Index reveals the indicator line could be about to push up through its own downtrend line. All appears very bullish. $ADA breaks out and taps major $1 horizontal resistance Source: TradingView The daily chart for $ADA shows how the price has exploded through the descending trendline on Thursday. That said, the price has come back since tapping the big resistance at $1 and has currently reached a support level. It remains to be seen if this hot market will help the price return to attempt this major resistance, or whether a retest of the breakout might take place. The Stochastic RSI indicators on this time frame are arriving at the top so a retrace is on the cards, although it’s not known how soon this could take place (before or after the $1 resistance breakout). Two major horizontal resistances are barriers to ATH Source: TradingView The weekly time frame for the $ADA price puts the scale of the task of getting back to the all-time high firmly into perspective. There is a long way to go. That said, breakouts of these next two major resistance levels would go a long way towards getting back to the ATH. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators rather look as though they are shaping to cross back up. If they do so, this could provide the momentum to break past the resistances.

Get ready for a truly groundbreaking development: DWF Labs , a prominent global Web3 venture capital and market-making firm, has announced its intention to facilitate the first-ever crypto-backed mortgage in the region. This exciting news, shared by DWF Labs co-founder Andrei Grachev on X, reveals a signed agreement with a major UAE real estate agency. Official details are eagerly anticipated, but this move signals a powerful convergence of digital assets and traditional property finance. What Exactly is a Crypto-Backed Mortgage? A crypto-backed mortgage is an innovative financial product that allows individuals to use their cryptocurrency holdings as collateral to secure a loan for real estate. Unlike traditional mortgages that rely on fiat currency and conventional assets, this new approach leverages the value of digital assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Essentially, you can pledge your crypto without selling it, obtaining the necessary funds to purchase property. How it Works: Borrowers typically deposit their crypto into a secure, regulated platform. The loan amount is usually a percentage of the crypto’s value, offering a new pathway to property ownership. Bridging Worlds: This mechanism directly links the burgeoning world of blockchain finance with the established real estate sector, creating fresh opportunities for crypto holders. Why is the UAE Leading This Innovation? The United Arab Emirates has consistently positioned itself as a global hub for innovation and forward-thinking financial solutions. The nation’s progressive stance on cryptocurrency regulation and its booming UAE real estate market make it an ideal testing ground for such a pioneering initiative. Regulatory Environment: The UAE government actively supports the growth of the digital economy, fostering an environment where novel financial products can thrive. Market Demand: A significant portion of the UAE’s population and investors are keen on exploring new avenues for wealth management and property acquisition, including those involving digital assets . What Benefits Do Crypto Mortgages Offer? The introduction of a crypto-backed mortgage brings several compelling advantages for both borrowers and the broader market. These benefits highlight why this financial product could gain significant traction. Access to Liquidity: Crypto holders can unlock the value of their digital assets without needing to sell them, thus avoiding potential capital gains taxes or missing out on future price appreciation. Faster Approvals: Digital processes often streamline loan applications, potentially leading to quicker approval times compared to traditional mortgage procedures. Diversification: It offers a new way for crypto investors to diversify their portfolios by investing in tangible assets like real estate, while still retaining exposure to their digital holdings. Navigating the Challenges of Digital Asset Lending While the prospects are exciting, it’s important to acknowledge the inherent challenges associated with using digital assets as collateral. The volatile nature of cryptocurrencies presents a unique set of risks that borrowers and lenders must manage carefully. Price Volatility: The value of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate dramatically, impacting the collateral value. Lenders typically mitigate this with higher collateralization ratios or margin calls. Regulatory Clarity: As this is a nascent field, ongoing regulatory developments will shape the long-term viability and scalability of crypto-backed mortgage products. Market Acceptance: Widespread adoption will depend on building trust and educating both financial institutions and consumers about the mechanics and risks involved. The Future of Digital Assets in Property DWF Labs’ bold move into the UAE real estate market with this innovative mortgage product could be a catalyst for wider adoption of blockchain finance in traditional sectors. This development showcases how financial innovation continues to push boundaries, blending emerging technologies with established industries. Ultimately, this initiative in the UAE could pave the way for more integrated financial ecosystems where digital and traditional assets seamlessly coexist. It represents a significant step towards a future where your digital wealth plays a more direct role in major life investments, such as home ownership. This pioneering crypto-backed mortgage deal in the UAE marks a thrilling new chapter for both the cryptocurrency and real estate industries. DWF Labs is not just facilitating a transaction; they are helping to build a bridge between the future of finance and the tangible world of property, setting a precedent for global innovation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is DWF Labs’ role in this crypto-backed mortgage? A1: DWF Labs is a Web3 venture capital and market-making firm. They are facilitating the first crypto-backed mortgage deal in the UAE by signing an agreement with a major real estate agency and arranging the transaction for a client. Q2: How does a crypto-backed mortgage differ from a traditional mortgage? A2: A crypto-backed mortgage uses cryptocurrency holdings as collateral for a loan, whereas a traditional mortgage uses physical assets or fiat currency income and credit history as collateral. Q3: What are the main benefits of using crypto for a mortgage? A3: Key benefits include accessing liquidity from your digital assets without selling them, potentially faster approval processes, and a new way to diversify your investment portfolio into real estate. Q4: What are the risks associated with a crypto-backed mortgage? A4: The primary risk is the high volatility of cryptocurrency prices, which can affect the collateral’s value. Regulatory uncertainty and market acceptance are also factors to consider. Q5: Why is the UAE a significant location for this development? A5: The UAE has a progressive regulatory environment for digital assets and a dynamic real estate market, making it an ideal hub for financial innovation and the integration of blockchain finance.

50077606,https://finbold.com/?p=251074,1755172666,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,We asked ChatGPT-5 what will be XRP price end of 2025; Here’s what it said,https://finbold.com/we-asked-chatgpt-5-what-will-be-xrp-price-end-of-2025-heres-what-it-said/,"XRP has been one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies this year, having gained more than 50% and trading at over $3 multiple times. Last week, Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also agreed to dismiss their appeals , finally putting the longest-running crypto dispute to rest. With Ripple now free to dedicate its resources where it matters, and with the regulatory environment growing ever more crypto-friendly, the market debates whether XRP can reach new heights in the following months. XRP price prediction To put the bullish predictions to the test, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s latest ChatGPT-5 chatbot regarding potential XRP price targets for the end of 2025. The artificial intelligence ( AI ) took into account the cryptocurrency’s price of $3.21 at press time, as well as factors such as analyst projections and technical indicators, and came up with four potential scenarios we might witness by December 31. XRP price prediction. Source: ChatGPT and Finbold In the most conservative scenario, the AI predicts that XRP will end 2025 in the $3.30–$3.50 range (a maximum upside potential of 9%). This scenario implies stagnant market conditions, steady Bitcoin ( BTC ) growth, and no major regulatory breakthroughs. Stronger institutional interest, possible new partnerships with Ripple, and more favorable macroeconomic conditions could lead to a moderately bullish scenario, pushing the asset to around $5 by year-end. This would translate to a 55.8% upside. In a truly bullish scenario, the cryptocurrency would see noteworthy increases in institutional adoption, a potential new spot XRP ETF launch, and other similar growth catalysts made possible by the conclusion of the legal drama with the SEC. Accordingly, the price targets in this case sit between $9 and $15, which suggests a potential upside of up to +367.3%. The “ultra-bullish” and least likely turn of events would propel XRP to $10. This number assumes everything from regulatory green lights to large-scale financial institution adoption and a crypto supercycle in which Bitcoin’s market cap approaches $3 trillion. Asked to give a more specific target price aligning with the clearest and most plausible data, the chatbot said the crypto would trade at around $5 at the end of 2025. Final XRP price prediction.

Source: Finbold XRP has been witnessing significant whale activity , with 900 million XRP, worth over $2.88 billion, accumulated in just 48 hours earlier this week. This led to traders speculating whether we might see another rally and potentially a new all-time high. On the charts, the altcoin has fallen below its 7-day simple moving average at $3.24 and broken a bullish trendline that had supported prices since July. The moving average/convergence divergence ( MACD ) histogram has flattened at +0.0000047, indicating fading momentum, while the relative strength index ( RSI ), currently between 58–61, implies additional downside is possible before oversold conditions start to appear.

As the fund awaits a decision from the US SEC, scheduled for October 2025, Ripple’s chairman believes there is a high probability that it will secure approval. XRP ETFs Are Definitely Hitting The Market Soon Brad Garlinghouse, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ripple Labs, has made a bold prediction about the XRP Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) . The CEO, offering his insights on the fund, declared that it will be approved by the US SEC and will be trading soon. Garlinghouse highlighted his bullish sentiment toward the fund in an interview , featuring Yoni Assia, the CEO and founder of eToro, and Sam North, a market analyst at eToro. This bold statement from Garlinghouse is backed by the Bitcoin Spot ETFs , noting that despite facing consistent challenges from the US SEC, it still gained approval from the Commission. Given the monumental introduction of BTC Spot ETFs, Brad Garlinghouse believes that an XRP ETF is inevitable. In his view, the funds represent the transition from speculative retail trading to institutional adoption. According to the CEO, the XRP ETF getting approval from the US SEC is a great sign for the altcoin and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. The Ripple CEO’s comments are made as the race for supremacy in the upcoming wave of ETF offerings intensifies among digital assets. Canary CEO Is Bullish On The Fund While efforts are currently being made to secure approval for the fund, Steven McClurg, the CEO of Canary Capital, has forecasted that a potential XRP ETF could outperform Ethereum-based ETFs. In his bold remarks, the CEO has pointed out three crucial reasons or factors why the fund would be a superior fund to that of Ethereum. The first key factor highlighted by the CEO was Staking , which he believes could limit ETH spot ETFs’ performance against XRP ETFs. According to McClurg, buying an ETH ETF is less reasonable given that market players can purchase Ethereum off-chain and on-chain and still yield notable profits. As a result, he has declared XRP ETF to be superior since the altcoin does not allow staking, stating “investors are not losing out on anything,” even if it is on an exchange or ETF. McClurg’s second reason is the distinction in category leadership as Ethereum faces significant competition in its category compared to XRP, making it much more complex for market participants to understand. This development reinforces XRP’s position as a true leader, which is likely to cause market players to choose the asset over ETH. Lastly, McClurg has proclaimed that the fund could experience substantial demand over Ethereum ETFs once it is launched. This huge demand will likely be driven by its robust community and the wide range of enthusiasts pushing for the fund. Addressing inflows, McClurg has predicted that the fund is poised to attract a $5 billion capital inflow in the first month after inception. Considering all these factors, there is a high probability that the fund would outshine its ETH counterpart.",XRP|Altcoin|Bitcoin Spot ETFs|Brad Garlinghouse|Canary Capital|Ethereum Spot ETFs|eToro|ripple|ripple news|Sam North|staking|Steven McClurg|XRP news|XRP price|XRP Spot ETFs|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT|Yoni Assia,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|ETH|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-14 12:00:08

The perpetual futures DEX saw rapid inflows of deposits, carrying over $6B in value for the first time in history. The assets deposited to Hyperliquid reached a new peak, coinciding with the new price record for BTC above $124,000. Total value on the exchange peaked above $6B for the first time in history. Within a day, the exchange added $395M in new deposits to open positions or post additional collateral.

The DEX remains a venue for high-profile whales, as Cryptopolitan reported earlier this week. The platform still expects the launch of native USDC, though for now dealing with bridged tokens. The exchange retained open interest above $12.7B, recovering from a recent slump. Hyperliquid retained its heightened activity, adding 11% to its total volumes. Daily trading expanded to over $21B, with ETH-USD becoming the most active pair, surpassing the BTC market. Most of the Hyperliquid growth was centered around blue-chip tokens, but the last few weeks saw strong inflows from ETH traders. The DEX remains one of the key venues, with volumes competing with Binance’s spot market. During the latest highly active weeks, Hyperliquid reached total volumes above $151B, competing with $263.9B on the Binance spot market. The DEX turned into a staple for high-risk trades, getting a boost from the clear market direction.

Along with HYPE, the entire Hyperliquid ecosystem of tokens expanded, with most of the leading memes in the green. PURR established itself around $0.18, adding over 21% in the past three months, though still down from its recent peaks.

The exchange posted a new fee record for 2025, with daily earnings at over $5.8M. Hyperliquid broke its own record just a day after posting the previous record fees of $5.5M for the day. The Hyperliquid chain currently produces more fees than all other chains combined, becoming one of the few cases of a network with a single use case to outperform other L1s. Based on Artemis data , Hyperliquid is currently in the lead, while previously standing within the top 5 of fee-producing chains.

We’re talking about the latest high-profile BAYC whale trading activity, specifically from renowned Taiwanese musician and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) holder, Jeffrey Huang, widely known as Machi Big Brother. What’s the Buzz Around Machi Big Brother’s Ethereum Long Position? Jeffrey Huang, a notable name in the crypto space, has once again captured attention with his strategic maneuvers. On-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa recently reported on X that Machi Big Brother opened a massive 25x Ethereum long position . This significant trade involved 11,545 ETH, valued at approximately $54.23 million, initiated at a price of $4,736.93 per ETH. Beyond his substantial ETH play, Huang also ventured into a 5x HYPE long. This involved 10,000 HYPE tokens, purchased at $46.58 each. These moves highlight his continued aggressive stance in the market, leveraging his capital for potentially high returns. Understanding High-Leverage Crypto Trades What exactly do these “long” positions and “25x” or “5x” multipliers mean? When an investor opens a long position, they are betting that the asset’s price will increase. The “x” multiplier refers to leverage, which allows traders to amplify their exposure to an asset with a smaller amount of initial capital. For instance, a 25x leverage means that for every dollar invested, the trader controls $25 worth of the asset. High-leverage crypto trading can lead to significantly larger profits if the market moves favorably. However, it also comes with amplified risks, as adverse price movements can lead to rapid and substantial losses, potentially liquidating the entire position. Machi Big Brother Crypto: A Track Record of Success? This isn’t Machi Big Brother’s first rodeo with such bold trades. Jeffrey Huang has a history of successful crypto ventures, and his previous similar long positions on both Ethereum and HYPE tokens reportedly yielded substantial profits. Specifically, he previously booked around $33.83 million from these types of trades. His repeated engagement in such high-stakes plays suggests a calculated approach, possibly based on thorough on-chain trading insights or a strong conviction in the assets’ future performance. Observing his moves provides a fascinating case study for those interested in large-scale market participation. What Can We Learn from These On-Chain Trading Insights? The transparency of blockchain technology allows analysts to track such significant transactions, offering valuable on-chain trading insights into the strategies of major players like Machi Big Brother. While these trades are public, it’s important to remember that they reflect an individual’s risk appetite and market outlook. Key takeaways from this latest activity include: Confidence in Ethereum: The substantial Ethereum long position indicates a strong belief in ETH’s potential price appreciation. Strategic Leverage Use: Huang’s consistent use of leverage shows a willingness to magnify potential gains, despite the inherent risks. Market Influence: Actions of whales can sometimes influence market sentiment, especially when their trades become public knowledge. It’s crucial for individual investors to conduct their own research and consider their own financial situation before attempting similar strategies. While high-leverage trading can be lucrative, it demands deep market understanding and robust risk management. In conclusion, Jeffrey Huang’s latest moves in the crypto market underscore the dynamic nature of digital asset trading. His significant BAYC whale trading activity, particularly his large Ethereum long, serves as a compelling example of high-stakes investment in the volatile yet potentially rewarding cryptocurrency landscape. His track record suggests a strategic mind at play, continually adapting to market conditions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Jeffrey Huang, also known as Machi Big Brother? A1: Jeffrey Huang is a well-known Taiwanese musician and a prominent figure in the crypto world. He is particularly recognized as a significant holder of Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFTs, earning him the title of a “BAYC whale.” Q2: What does it mean to open a “long” position in crypto trading? A2: Opening a “long” position in cryptocurrency trading means an investor is betting that the price of a particular asset, like Ethereum, will increase over time. They buy the asset with the expectation of selling it later at a higher price for a profit. Q3: What does “25x leverage” signify in crypto trades? A3: “25x leverage” indicates that for every unit of capital an investor puts down, they can control 25 times that amount in the market. While this can amplify potential profits significantly, it also dramatically increases the risk of losses, as small price movements against the position can lead to liquidation. Q4: What are the main risks associated with high-leverage crypto trading? A4: The primary risk of high-leverage crypto trading is amplified losses. If the market moves against the leveraged position, even slightly, it can lead to rapid and substantial financial losses, potentially wiping out the entire initial investment due to liquidation. Q5: How do on-chain analysts track the trades of individuals like Machi Big Brother? A5: On-chain analysts monitor public blockchain data. Every transaction on a blockchain is recorded and transparent, allowing analysts to track large transfers of cryptocurrencies, opening and closing of leveraged positions on decentralized exchanges, and other significant activities associated with known whale wallets.

50077691,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=804576,1755172815,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/50077691.jpeg,Ripple CTO Comments On Rising XRP Ledger Competition From Fintechs,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/ripple-cto-rising-xrp-ledger-competition/,"Ripple chief technology officer (CTO) David “JoelKatz” Schwartz used a late-Wednesday post on X to frame a surge of payments and stablecoin companies launching their own base-layer networks as validation of blockchain’s role in finance—and to restate how the XRP Ledger’s design differs from the new entrants. “We’ve been seeing more and more players in the payments and stablecoins space launch their own blockchains. To me, that’s a clear sign the market sees blockchain as core financial infrastructure — something we’ve believed in and have been building toward on the XRP Ledger for over 13 years,” he wrote, adding, “Launching a blockchain is hard. Building an ecosystem with developers, liquidity, trust, and real-world usage is even harder.” Competition For Ripple And The XRP Ledger? Schwartz situated XRPL’s posture in the long-running debate over network governance. “Some blockchains are built with permissioned validator sets controlled by one entity or a small group. This can provide control and compliance for specific, closed-network scenarios, but it limits reach, resilience, and the ability for anyone to contribute to securing and growing the network,” he wrote. Related Reading: XRP Ruling Sends Shockwaves Through The Financial System “As many of you know, the XRPL is public and permissionless at its core, with optional permissioned features for regulated use cases.” He argued that the ledger’s open base “makes it adaptable, interoperable, and well-positioned to serve as critical infrastructure for the world’s financial system — connecting assets, markets, and participants seamlessly across borders.” The remarks arrive as two US fintech heavyweights move into L1 territory. Circle this week unveiled Arc, an EVM-compatible Layer-1 it says is “purpose-built for stablecoin finance,” with dollar-denominated fees (USDC as native gas), opt-in privacy, a built-in RFQ-style FX engine, and “deterministic sub-second settlement finality” via the Malachite consensus engine. Circle says Arc will enter private testnet in the coming weeks, target public testnet in the fall, and a mainnet beta in 2026. Separately, Stripe is developing Tempo, a high-performance, payments-focused L1 being built in partnership with crypto VC firm Paradigm. Tempo is designed to run code compatible with Ethereum, is currently in stealth with a small team, and it remains unclear whether it will have a native token. Schwartz also highlighted specific XRPL design choices he sees as aligned with financial-grade settlement. “It’s encouraging to see some newer chains adopt design choices that have long been part of the XRPL’s architecture, like deterministic finality … It shows there’s growing alignment in the industry on the importance of predictable, reliable settlement for financial applications without expensive validation,” he wrote. He reiterated that XRPL fees are meant to stay “low and predictable, just fractions of a cent, without a separate gas token,” noting that “every transaction on the XRPL uses/burns XRP.” XRPL’s technical documentation specifies that each transaction destroys a small amount of XRP as an anti-spam fee, and describes consensus rules aimed at deterministic ordering and finality. Related Reading: XRP Double-Bottom Breakout Sets Sights On $34, Predicts Analyst Where Schwartz drew a line was on governance flexibility. He acknowledged that permissioned validator sets can make sense for “specific, closed-network scenarios,” but underscored XRPL’s approach: a public, permissionless core with opt-in controls for compliance needs. The ledger’s native features include Authorized Trust Lines, Deposit Authorization/Preauthorization, and issuer-level freeze tooling for issued assets—not for XRP itself—allowing regulated token issuers to gate or police flows without converting the entire network into a walled garden. XRPL’s own FAQ emphasizes that it is a decentralized, public blockchain where changes require supermajority validator approval. The strategic contrast with the new fintech chains is already visible. Arc explicitly centers USDC—making fees dollar-denominated and embedding Circle’s payments stack—whereas XRPL retains XRP for fees and settlement while supporting issued assets through trust-line mechanics. If Tempo proceeds as reported, Stripe would be pursuing an Ethereum-compatible L1 optimized for predictable payments performance, potentially mirroring Arc’s enterprise-centric pitch but with a broader merchant-services integration surface. Schwartz closed on a deliberately expansive note about the competitive set: “Looking forward to the next phase of XRPL innovations, bringing more programmability, compliance-grade capabilities, and deeper liquidity for institutional use,” he wrote—before welcoming rivals: “And to those just getting started… Welcome to the party! The crypto tent is only getting bigger.” At press time, XRP traded at $3.23.

Safety Shot is shifting $25 million into its treasury. This move sparks questions about future actions and goals. The decision stands out in a time where meme coins often cause headlines. What will this major step bring next for both Safety Shot and Bonk? Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE , Dogwifhat , and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.005 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 – $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 – $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges BONK Unleashed: The Shiba Coin Sparking New Life on Solana BONK is the first dog coin born on Solana. It uses a playful Shiba Inu to rally users. Half of all tokens were sent as gifts to people building on Solana, from artists to small traders. This bold move spread the coin fast and wide. When Coinbase added BONK, the price doubled in a flash. The coin now shows up inside games, wallets, and even light apps called BonkSwap. Fans say it shifts power away from big funds and back to everyday users. The buzz comes at a lively time for meme coins. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu woke the market in past waves, yet both now feel heavy. BONK rides the newer, faster Solana tracks, where fees stay tiny and apps grow quick. The supply is still huge, so swings will stay wild. But fresh demand from many small holders, plus the plan to burn tokens inside BonkSwap, could lift the price. If the next wave of crypto fun moves from Ethereum to Solana, BONK may be the mascot leading the parade. Conclusion BONK continues to show strong momentum as interest rises. Meanwhile, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out with its unique sports focus, early growth potential, and plans for a community-led ecosystem.

Bitcoin’s record highs and Ethereum’s sharp rise have set the stage for XRP’s breakout above $3.33. At the same time, Nexchain’s crypto presale for an AI-driven Layer 1 network is nearing its funding goal, attracting early participants seeking infrastructure-focused exposure. Both are benefiting from the current wave of optimism, though they are moving forward on very different paths, one with price momentum, the other through foundational blockchain development. Nexchain Targets Scalability with AI Integration Nexchain is developing a blockchain designed to handle up to 400,000 transactions per second, using a hybrid Proof-of-Stake consensus and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) framework.

Built-in cross-chain interoperability enables connectivity with multiple blockchain ecosystems without relying on centralized intermediaries. XRP Sustains Gains Above Key Levels XRP’s 12% weekly rise has brought it to $3.33, as buyers continue to defend key support zones. This momentum follows the conclusion of the Ripple vs SEC case, removing a major legal overhang and boosting market confidence. Analysts are now discussing upside potential, with targets ranging from a moderate $3.5–$5 range for the rest of the bull cycle to more ambitious $7–$10 projections. The likelihood of an XRP ETF approval is seen as another catalyst that could stabilize demand and encourage institutional participation. Market conditions have been favorable, with increased liquidity and broader crypto adoption driving flows into established assets like XRP. Roadmap Meets $8.6M Presale In addition, its roadmap includes the Q3 2025 launch of Nexpolia with multi-chain bridges and developer SDKs, followed by a Q4 2025 mainnet deployment featuring AI-powered oracles and DeFi protocol integrations. The testnet and blockchain explorer are already live for early technical validation. Notably, stage 25 offers the NEX presale coin at $0.10, having raised $8.63 million of its $9.27 million target. The presale crypto model includes staking rewards, governance voting rights, and anti-whale safeguards. Meanwhile, this web3 crypto presale offers early entry to a new crypto presale built for speed, interoperability, and sustainability. Two Different Momentum Stories Nexchain is advancing through a presale crypto phase aimed at building a blockchain infrastructure capable of supporting enterprise-grade and decentralized applications. XRP is leveraging a surge in market sentiment and regulatory clarity to push toward higher price levels. While their strategies differ, both are gaining visibility during the current market upswing — one for its forward-looking technology and the other for its immediate market performance.

Podľa odborníkov ETH mieri na 8 500 $,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-lame-rekordy/,"Ethereum sa blíži k svojmu historickému maximu na úrovni 4 867 $, pričom aktuálne trhové dianie a on-chain aktivita naznačujú možný vstup do fázy cenového objavovania, teda nad svoje ATH. Kryptomena zaznamenala 10 % rast za jediný deň a za posledných 24 hodín stúpla o ďalších 8 %. Tento rast podporuje silný záujem investorov a prílevy do ethereových ETF. Rekordný prílev kapitálu do Ethereum ETF Rekordný denný prílev kapitálu do Ethereum ETF opäť potvrdzuje rastúci záujem inštitucionálnych investorov. 11. augusta 2025 spotové Ethereum ETF dosiahli nový historický prílev vo výške 1,019 miliardy $ . Lídrom bol fond BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), ktorý zaznamenal 149 168 ETH (cca 640,68 mil. $) a dosiahol denný obchodný objem až 1,8 miliardy dolárov. Tento výkon ozaj potvrdil dôveru v Ethereum a jeho technologické riešenia.

Nasledujúce dni priniesli pokračovanie rastového trendu. 13. augusta inštitúcie vrátane BlackRock, Fidelity a Grayscale naakumulovali ďalších 155 620 ETH , čo predstavuje približne 704,3 milióna dolárov. ETHA opäť tvoril väčšinu tohto prílevu, až 500 miliónov $. Celkový kapitál do Ethereum ETF za tento týždeň prekračuje 2,2 miliardy dolárov . Tieto udalosti sú späté s rastúcou adopciou a pozitívnym sentimentom voči technologickým riešeniam. Podľa kryptoobchodníka Yashasedu, Ethereum má pred sebou výrazný rastový potenciál. Jeho prognóza hovorí o možnej cene 8 500 do konca roka 2025, podporenej prílevmi do ETF, stakingom a ďalšími on-chain ukazovateľmi. Cenový vývoj Ethereum Ethereum v porovnaní s Bitcoinom ukázalo, že má čosi na vrch. Za uplynulý týždeň si pripísalo zhodnotenie približne 20 % , zatiaľ čo Bitcoin vzrástol len o 5 %. ETH sa momentálne obchoduje okolo úrovne 4 730 $, čo je len o necelé 2 % menej, než historické maximum z novembra 2021 na úrovni 4 878 dolárov. Optimistickú náladu podporila aj správa, že spoločnosť BitMine Immersion Technologies plánuje získať až 20 miliárd dolárov na nákup ETH . Technická analýza poukazuje na možný prielom. Podľa Glassnode je úroveň 4 700 dolárov kľúčovým odporom, ktorého prekonanie by mohlo otvoriť priestor pre výraznejší rast. Cryptoquant dodáva, že kombinácia vysokých transakčných objemov a prelomenia hranice 4 750 $ by mohla spustiť tzv. price discovery fázu, teda cenovú akciu nad ATH. Rotácia kapitálu do Ethereum. Zdoj: x.com Niektorí analytici sú výrazne optimistickí, predpovedajú rast v pásme 7 000 až 13 000 $. Hoci sú tieto scenáre špekulatívne, kombinácia vysokých prílevov do ETF a rastúca adopcia zvyšuje šancu, že Ethereum bude v nasledujúcich týždňoch pokračovať v raste. Navyše, BlackRock nedávno presunul na Coinbase Prime viac než 100 000 ETH a vyše 2 500 BTC. Dynamika okolo ETF a rastúci záujem inštitúcií dokazujú, že kapitál sa v kryptosvete vie presúvať veľmi rýchlo, a to nielen k etablovaným menám, ale aj k novým, odvážnym projektom, ktoré ponúkajú rôzne inovácie a jedinečný príbeh.

Ethereum ETFs have just hit an astonishing new record, with assets under management (AUM) soaring past the $30 billion mark for the very first time. This monumental achievement, reported by Strategic ETH Reserve, signals a pivotal moment for institutional adoption and the broader cryptocurrency market. What Are Ethereum ETFs and Why Do They Matter? An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) allows investors to gain exposure to an asset, like Ethereum, without directly owning the underlying cryptocurrency. Think of it as a convenient wrapper for investment, traded on traditional stock exchanges. For a long time, direct investment in cryptocurrencies presented hurdles for traditional investors due to perceived complexity or regulatory uncertainty. However, the introduction of ETH ETFs has changed the game, offering a regulated and accessible pathway. Key benefits include: Accessibility: ETFs make it much easier for traditional investors to participate in the crypto market. Liquidity: These funds trade throughout the day on conventional stock exchanges, offering high liquidity. Regulation: They provide a layer of regulatory oversight, which can offer more security and trust for investors. Diversification: Investing in an Ethereum ETF enables portfolio diversification into the burgeoning digital asset space. The Staggering Ethereum AUM Milestone: What’s Driving It? Surpassing $30 billion in Ethereum AUM is not just a number; it’s a powerful testament to growing confidence and widespread acceptance. Several significant factors contribute to this incredible surge. Firstly, increasing institutional interest plays a massive role. Large financial institutions and wealth managers are now more comfortable allocating capital to digital assets through regulated products like ETFs. This indicates a shift from niche speculation to mainstream financial integration. Secondly, the overall positive sentiment surrounding Ethereum’s ecosystem has bolstered investor appeal. This includes its successful transition to Proof-of-Stake (the Merge), which improved its energy efficiency, and its foundational utility in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Moreover, the anticipation of potential spot Ethereum ETF approvals in major markets, particularly the United States, has generated significant excitement. This forward-looking sentiment acts as a powerful magnet, drawing in proactive capital and driving up AUM figures. Impact on Digital Asset Investments and the Broader Market This record-breaking AUM for Ethereum ETFs has far-reaching implications for the entire landscape of digital asset investments . It signifies a maturation of the crypto market, moving beyond niche speculation into mainstream finance. This influx of capital provides greater liquidity and stability for Ethereum itself. It also serves as a strong validation of the asset class, potentially paving the way for more traditional financial products tied to other cryptocurrencies. For individual investors, it means more avenues to engage with crypto, albeit indirectly, through regulated and familiar investment vehicles. This mainstream acceptance could also contribute to reduced volatility over time as more stable, long-term capital enters the market, replacing some of the short-term speculative trading. Navigating the Future of Crypto ETFs : Challenges and Opportunities While the outlook is undeniably bright, the journey for Crypto ETFs isn’t without its challenges. Regulatory clarity remains a key hurdle in various jurisdictions. Different countries have varying stances on digital asset regulation, which can impact the global adoption and growth of these products. Market volatility, inherent to cryptocurrencies, also poses a risk. While ETFs offer convenience, they still track an asset that can experience significant price swings. Investors must remain aware of these dynamics and understand the underlying asset’s nature. However, the opportunities are immense. As more investors become comfortable with the concept, we could see an expansion of ETF offerings to include other major cryptocurrencies or even baskets of digital assets. This trend could accelerate the integration of blockchain technology into traditional financial systems, unlocking new possibilities for financial innovation. The remarkable achievement of Ethereum ETFs breaking the $30 billion AUM record marks a truly transformative moment for the crypto industry. It underscores a significant shift towards institutional acceptance and validates Ethereum’s position as a cornerstone of the digital economy. As the market continues to evolve, these regulated investment vehicles will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping the future of finance, making digital assets more accessible and integrated than ever before. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What does AUM mean for Ethereum ETFs? AUM stands for Assets Under Management. For Ethereum ETFs, it represents the total market value of all the Ethereum held by these funds on behalf of their investors. A higher AUM indicates increased investor interest and capital flowing into these products. 2. Why are Ethereum ETFs gaining so much popularity? Ethereum ETFs are gaining popularity because they offer traditional investors a regulated, convenient, and accessible way to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly managing cryptocurrencies or dealing with complex exchanges. Institutional adoption also plays a significant role. 3. How do Ethereum ETFs differ from directly buying ETH? When you buy ETH directly, you own the actual cryptocurrency and are responsible for its storage (wallets) and security. With an Ethereum ETF, you own shares in a fund that holds ETH, but you do not directly own the underlying asset. This simplifies the investment process for many. 4. What are the risks associated with investing in Ethereum ETFs? Key risks include market volatility (as the ETF’s value is tied to Ethereum’s price fluctuations), regulatory changes, and potential liquidity issues in extreme market conditions. It’s crucial to understand that while ETFs offer convenience, they don’t eliminate the inherent risks of the crypto market. 5. Will other cryptocurrencies also have ETFs soon? The success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has certainly opened the door for other cryptocurrencies. While regulatory approvals are a significant hurdle, the trend suggests that more digital asset ETFs could emerge as the market matures and regulatory frameworks become clearer.

Don’t Be Fooled",https://timestabloid.com/expert-xrp-wont-hit-1000-before-this-years-ends-dont-be-fooled/,"Levi of Crypto Crusaders has delivered a blunt reality check to the XRP community: the token will not reach $1,000 before the end of 2025, and anyone promoting that dream is misleading both themselves and others. His statement comes at a time when speculation around XRP’s price potential is running high—fueled by bold online predictions and pockets of retail euphoria. Current Market Reality As of report time, XRP trades at $3.23 following a sharp rally earlier in the summer. The asset remains one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, with approximately 59.3 billion XRP in circulation and a market value of nearly $192 billion. While its recent performance has been impressive compared to its subdued years after the SEC lawsuit began, the numbers paint a far more measured picture than the four-digit forecasts making the rounds. I am sorry but XRP won't hit $1000 before this year ends, anyone selling you this dream is lying to you and themself. I would love nothing more than to be wrong, because if I am wrong I'll be a billionaire. — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) August 14, 2025 Mainstream analyst projections for this market cycle are considerably more conservative. Some price models place XRP between $4 and $5.50 over the coming months, with a more optimistic technical target of $12.60 identified by market analyst Ali Martinez, who based his estimate on a multi-year triangle breakout observed in late 2024. Even in this bullish context, $1,000 is not in sight for the current year. The Origins of the $1,000 Narrative The $1,000 XRP theory has persisted for years, championed by a small but vocal group of influencers. Proponents argue that traditional market capitalization calculations do not apply to a digital asset designed for global payments and liquidity settlement. Some claim that large-scale institutional adoption, deep integration into cross-border payment systems, and innovations like Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin could, in time, propel XRP to four digits. More extreme versions of the argument suggest $1,000 would eventually be a “floor” rather than a peak, often citing speculative roadmaps that envision XRP rising first to $10–$20, then $100, and ultimately to $1,000 as utility grows. While intriguing, these scenarios are built on speculative assumptions about adoption speed, liquidity expansion, and regulatory clearance that are far from being realized. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why $1,000 in 2025 Is Unrealistic Basic math reveals why a $1,000 price tag this year is implausible. With roughly 59.3 billion tokens in existence, a $1,000 XRP would command a market capitalization of $57–$59 trillion—an amount more than double the GDP of the United States and close to half of the entire global stock market’s value. Achieving this within four months would require unprecedented capital inflows and utility on a scale the crypto market has never witnessed. Even analysts who are bullish on XRP’s future emphasize that while market cap is an imperfect metric, it remains a valuable sanity check for short-term projections. By those measures, $1,000 by year-end is beyond reach. Grounded Expectations Moving Forward Levi’s remarks are not an attack on XRP itself but a call for rational expectations. The fundamentals surrounding the asset have strengthened—liquidity is improving, derivatives interest is rising, and macroeconomic conditions are currently favorable for crypto growth. These factors could support a steady climb toward mid-single-digit or even low-double-digit prices in the near term. However, conflating strong performance with an imminent $1,000 price sets investors up for disappointment. For both traders and long-term holders, the most responsible path is to follow verified market developments, respect technical and macro signals, and avoid being swayed by sensational predictions lacking a factual basis.

Blockchain data now shows that the stolen funds, converted into Ether, are worth about $103 million. The exploiter holds 21,957 ETH, according to Lookonchain, after Ether climbed from roughly $2,300 in October 2024 to above $4,700 this week. Analysts Say Gains Were Accidental Investigators at blockchain forensics firm AMLBot noted that the hacker’s windfall was not a strategic investment. Instead, they said swapping to ETH was likely motivated by liquidity and security. Attackers often use Ether or Bitcoin to reduce the risk of token freezes and to move funds more easily across networks. Drivers Behind Ether’s Price Rally Ether’s rally since the exploit has been supported by multiple factors: US spot ETH ETFs launched in July 2024, bringing in over $12 billion in net inflows. The supply of staked ETH hit a record 36 million, locking tokens out of circulation. Corporates now hold more than $100 billion worth of ETH. Regulatory tone shifted when the SEC dropped its probe into whether ETH is a security in June 2024. Ethereum Upgrades and Ecosystem Growth Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade, which introduced proto-danksharding, boosted scalability and layer-2 adoption. Daily transactions on Ethereum’s layer-2 networks surged, hitting nearly 13.9 million this week, according to GrowThePie.

For those keenly observing the macro landscape, recent news from Eastern Europe offers a compelling narrative. Romania GDP growth in the second quarter has not just met, but remarkably surpassed, expert expectations, signaling a robust and unexpected acceleration for the nation’s economy. What does this significant turnaround mean for investors and the broader European financial outlook? Romania GDP Growth: What’s Fueling This Surprising Surge? Romania, often a quiet contender in the European economic arena, has delivered a performance that has captured attention. The latest data reveals that the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded beyond forecasts for the second quarter, demonstrating an underlying strength that many did not anticipate. This impressive Romania GDP growth is not an isolated event; it is the culmination of several internal and external factors working in concert. The primary drivers appear to be robust domestic consumption, fueled by wage increases and stable employment, coupled with a significant uptick in investment. Domestic Demand: A resilient consumer base, buoyed by rising disposable incomes, has continued to spend, driving growth in retail, services, and manufacturing sectors. Investment Influx: Both public and private investments have played a crucial role. Government infrastructure projects, often backed by European Union funds, have stimulated construction and related industries. Private sector confidence has also translated into new business ventures and expansions. Export Performance: While domestic demand was key, certain export sectors also contributed positively, leveraging Romania’s competitive advantages in specific industries. This multi-faceted approach to growth suggests a more diversified and stable foundation than relying on a single economic pillar. The Economic Rebound: Is This Momentum Sustainable? The question on many economists’ minds is whether this strong economic rebound can be sustained in the long term, especially given global uncertainties. While the Q2 figures are undoubtedly positive, the path ahead is not without its challenges. Understanding the nuances of this recovery requires a closer look at key indicators and potential headwinds. Consider the following comparative data: Indicator Q1 2023 (Year-on-Year) Q2 2023 (Year-on-Year) Q2 2023 (Quarter-on-Quarter) GDP Growth 2.3% 3.2% (estimated, exceeding 2.5% forecast) 1.5% Inflation Rate (Avg.) 14.5% 10.3% Declining Trend Unemployment Rate 5.6% 5.4% Stable While the year-on-year growth demonstrates clear acceleration, concerns persist regarding persistent inflation, though it has shown a declining trend. Labor shortages in key sectors could also cap potential growth. Furthermore, global economic slowdowns or geopolitical events could inevitably impact Romania’s export markets and investor sentiment. However, the current trajectory suggests a resilience that could buffer against some of these external shocks. Analyzing Q2 Performance: Beyond the Headline Numbers Delving deeper into the Q2 performance reveals which sectors were the primary engines of this unexpected expansion. The information technology (IT) sector continues to be a standout performer, attracting foreign investment and contributing significantly to services exports. Agriculture, despite climate challenges, also showed resilience, supported by favorable harvest conditions in certain regions. Manufacturing, particularly automotive and machinery, benefited from improved supply chains and robust demand within the EU. IT and Services: Romania’s burgeoning tech hub continues to expand, offering high-value services and attracting skilled labor. Manufacturing Resilience: Despite global supply chain volatility, key manufacturing sectors maintained strong output. Construction Boom: Public infrastructure projects and private residential developments have kept the construction sector vibrant. This diverse sectoral contribution indicates a healthy spread of growth, reducing reliance on any single industry. The diversification strengthens the overall economic fabric, making it more adaptable to changing market conditions. Romania’s Growing Stature in the European Economy Romania’s impressive economic rebound solidifies its position as an increasingly important player within the European economy . Its consistent growth, often outperforming larger Western European counterparts, highlights its potential as a destination for foreign direct investment (FDI). The country’s strategic location, skilled workforce, and relatively lower operating costs make it an attractive hub for businesses looking to expand their footprint in Eastern Europe and beyond. This rising stature can lead to greater integration into European supply chains and increased political influence within the EU. As the European Union navigates complex economic landscapes, the robust performance of member states like Romania contributes to the overall stability and growth of the bloc. This creates a positive feedback loop, where Romania benefits from EU integration and, in turn, contributes to the collective economic strength of the continent. Investors, both traditional and those in the crypto space, often monitor the health of major economic blocs, as it can signal broader market sentiment and liquidity trends. Inflation Outlook: Navigating Price Stability Amidst Growth While strong GDP growth is celebrated, the accompanying challenge of managing inflation remains a critical focus for policymakers. Romania’s central bank has been proactive in its efforts to tame rising prices, and the latest data suggests these measures are yielding results. The improving inflation outlook is crucial for ensuring the sustainability of the current growth trajectory. A stable price environment fosters consumer confidence and encourages long-term investment. The central bank’s monetary policy, including interest rate adjustments, aims to strike a delicate balance between curbing inflation and supporting economic expansion. As global energy prices stabilize and supply chain pressures ease, Romania’s inflation rate is projected to continue its downward trend, moving closer to the central bank’s target range. This commitment to price stability is a positive signal for both domestic businesses and international investors, providing a more predictable economic environment. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead Despite the positive momentum, Romania faces several challenges. Global economic uncertainties, potential energy price volatility, and the ongoing war in Ukraine pose external risks. Internally, structural reforms are still needed to improve public administration efficiency, combat corruption, and further develop infrastructure. However, these challenges are accompanied by significant opportunities: EU Funds: Continued access to substantial EU recovery and development funds provides a powerful stimulus for public investment. Digital Transformation: Accelerating digital adoption across sectors can boost productivity and foster innovation. Green Transition: Investments in renewable energy and sustainable practices can attract green finance and create new industries. Embracing these opportunities will be key to transforming short-term gains into long-term prosperity. Actionable Insights for Observers For investors and economic observers, Romania’s Q2 performance offers several insights: Diversification Matters: The broad-based nature of Romania’s growth underscores the importance of a diversified economic structure. Resilience in Emerging Markets: This rebound highlights the potential for strong performance in emerging European markets, often overlooked by those solely focused on established economies. Policy Impact: The effectiveness of central bank and government policies in fostering growth while managing inflation is evident. Monitoring these trends can provide valuable context for understanding broader market dynamics and identifying potential areas of future growth, even in seemingly unrelated sectors like digital assets, which are influenced by global economic health. Conclusion: Romania’s Economic Horizon Brightens Romania’s impressive Romania GDP growth in the second quarter of the year is more than just a statistical anomaly; it is a clear indicator of a resilient and dynamic economy finding its stride. The robust economic rebound , driven by strong domestic demand and strategic investments, paints a promising picture. While challenges like managing the inflation outlook persist, the country’s proactive policies and the strong foundations laid by its diverse Q2 performance suggest a positive trajectory. As a growing force within the European economy , Romania is demonstrating its capacity for sustained growth and increasing stability, offering a compelling case study for economic resilience in a complex global environment. This remarkable resurgence sets a confident tone for the future, signaling a brighter economic horizon for the nation.

According to AInvest, Greenidge Generation, a prominent player in the digital asset space, successfully produced 110 BTC in the second quarter of the year. This significant Bitcoin production figure offers a glimpse into their ongoing Greenidge Bitcoin mining efforts, even as further financial details remain private. Greenidge’s Q2 Bitcoin Production: What Does 110 BTC Mean? Greenidge Generation’s report of 110 BTC mined in Q2 highlights their consistent operational output. While the exact financial implications are yet to be fully disclosed, this production figure provides a clear metric of their mining capacity during the period. It’s important to understand that Bitcoin mining involves using powerful computers to solve complex computational puzzles.

This lack of disclosure leaves some questions unanswered for investors and market watchers. Understanding Crypto Mining Operations: The Broader Landscape Crypto mining operations like Greenidge’s are at the heart of the decentralized cryptocurrency network. They ensure the security and integrity of transactions while also introducing new coins into circulation. However, this process comes with its own set of challenges and opportunities.

Technological Advancements: Investing in newer, more powerful mining hardware (ASICs) to increase hash rate and efficiency. The ability to adapt to market conditions and technological shifts is crucial for long-term success in this sector. The Future of Greenidge Bitcoin Mining The Greenidge Q2 results offer a snapshot of their current operational capacity. While the market awaits further details on their sales strategies and overall financial health, their continued Bitcoin production indicates a commitment to their mining ventures. The future of Greenidge Bitcoin mining , like that of many public miners, will likely depend on a combination of strategic energy sourcing, hardware upgrades, and effective risk management in a volatile market.

50078644,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=408598,1755174346,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/50078644.jpeg,Pi Network (PI) News Today August 14th,https://cryptopotato.com/pi-network-pi-news-today-august-14th/,"PI’s price has seen a slight rebound recently, coinciding with new updates from the project behind the token. In this article, we’ll cover the most noteworthy developments as of late. Recent Ecosystem Updates Pi News – an X account disclosing developments related to the controversial cryptocurrency project Pi Network – recently revealed that TransFi has officially completed its KYB (Know Your Business) process as a verified third‑party fiat on‑ramp partner. This allows clients of the fintech platform to buy and convert PI tokens directly with local fiat currency since the entity is integrated with the Pi Wallet. Pi Network acknowledged the news on its official profile on X, adding that TransFi, Banxa, and Onramp . money remain the only KYB-verified on-ramp partners of the project. Another update includes the support from Chainphon. The Dubai-based blockchain platform listed PI on its decentralized application on August 12, adding the PHONE/PI trading pair. Thus, it added its name next to more popular entities that have previously embraced Pi Network’s native cryptocurrency, including OKX, Gate.io, Bitget, and others. PI Price Outlook The token managed to recover some lost ground over the past week, rising by 10% during that period and currently trading just below $0.40. The resurgence has brought back some optimism among the PI community. X user Alpha Crypto Signal assumed the asset is currently forming “a clean cup and handle pattern on the 4H timeframe.” They outlined the $0.38-$0.40 range as “the crucial support for this bullish setup,” envisioning a potential rally to $0.50-$0.52. MOON JEFF also chipped in, claiming that Pi Network is among the few layer-1 blockchains with real users. “Everything in PI is very organic. This is one of the few good things about the Network. Humans will pump it up,” he added. It is worth noting that, despite the evident rebound over the last seven days, PI’s price remains significantly below its peak of roughly $3, witnessed in February of this year. Moreover, numerous altcoins performed much better than it in the past week, and the asset is no longer part of crypto’s top 50 club. More Pain Ahead? The number of PI tokens stored on centralized crypto exchanges continues to grow and recently hit a new all-time high of over 411 million. Nearly half the amount is held on Gate.io, while Bitget comes in second with 141.1 million coins. The rising figure could be interpreted as a bearish sign since it increases the immediate selling pressure. The upcoming token unlocks are another worrying factor. Over the next 30 days, more than 167 million PI will be freed up, with almost 10 million set to be released on August 16 alone. While the upcoming unlocks aren’t as daunting as in previous months, they could still contribute to another downward movement.

While Bitcoin remains the sector’s first mover and largest asset, there is growing recognition of other blockchain networks and their practical use cases. This trend suggests that large-scale market participants are now considering a broader range of assets, including XRP for integration into financial infrastructure. One of the representatives noted that the conversation is beginning to “broaden out beyond Bitcoin” as institutions start to assess the fundamentals of other networks. Institutional adoption of XRP has surged in 2025 . This shift reflects an evolution from speculative interest toward evaluating the specific roles these assets can play in global finance. NASDAQ: “WE ARE SEEING INSTITUTIONAL INTEREST EXPAND BEYOND BITCOIN TO TOKENS LIKE XRP” Listen. pic.twitter.com/JfV3Up4mEo — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 13, 2025 XRP’s Cross-Border Utility In the discussion, XRP was described as a key component in the emerging financial architecture. Its primary function centers on enabling near-instant foreign exchange settlement for cross-border transactions . By converting fiat currencies into XRP, transferring them in seconds, and converting them back to local currency, the system could significantly reduce international payment costs. Under the current remittance structure, fees often average around 7% of the transaction amount. The NASDAQ rep suggested that XRP’s model could lower these costs to under 1%, providing a tangible efficiency gain for financial institutions and payment providers. The emphasis was not on speculative trading but on operational benefits, particularly for banks and settlement platforms. XRP’s Functional Positioning The analysis places XRP within a broader functional framework of blockchain adoption. In this view, each asset has a defined role in financial operations, with XRP positioned as a behind-the-scenes mechanism for seamless cross-border value transfer. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Its settlement speed, low cost, and capacity to operate across jurisdictions were presented as competitive advantages in an environment where efficiency is becoming increasingly important for banks and payment providers. Market Implications The acknowledgment from NASDAQ representatives indicates that XRP is not only being considered by institutions but also understood in terms of its practical utility. Institutional adoption of digital assets is often linked to infrastructure needs, regulatory clarity, and measurable efficiency gains, all of which were points indirectly raised in the discussion. SMQKE highlighted the significance of the moment, pointing directly to the fact that NASDAQ is seeing “institutional interest expand beyond Bitcoin to tokens like XRP.” For the XRP community, such recognition aligns with long-standing beliefs about the token’s intended use case and its fit within global payment systems.

50081972,https://invezz.com/?p=2839255,1755178564,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Solana price outlook: SOL bulls push above $200 but this $0.09 altcoin is targeting $3,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/14/solana-price-outlook-sol-bulls-push-above-200-but-this-0-09-altcoin-is-targeting-3/,"Recently, Solana price has soared past the crucial $200 level with buyers in command as indicated by higher highs and higher lows. The euphoria implies that SOL may move up to the $205-$210 mark in case the market setup and derivative positioning remain bullish. Although there is a high level of technical signals, the short-term overbought conditions give a clue about the possibility of cooling down before the next leg up. However, in the midst of all this noise, there is a new payfi token quietly making waves at the moment that is gaining traction amongst traders. Solana price breakout and technical dynamics Buyers sent Solana price through the $192–$195 resistance range, breaking above important psychological levels. The technical indicators on the four-hour chart shows RSI to be at 72.53 which provides a very strong buy signal, with cautions of potential pullback. Futures and options data reinforce Solana price strength. Recent activity shows futures volume up 66.02% to $44.11 billion and open interest climbing 16.65% to $11.38 billion. Options volume surged 243.16% while open interest increased 50.05%, highlighting growing confidence among traders. Long positioning dominates across major exchanges, suggesting that SOL bulls remain firmly in control. Immediate resistance stands at $200, with a four-hour close above this level likely opening a path to $205–$208, while $210 could be a longer-term target. Support levels at $192–$195 and near EMAs provide strong buffers against pullbacks. Why Remittix is drawing attention while SOL prices climb While Solana price rallies, many investors are increasingly eyeing Remittix (RTX) , currently $0.0944. Having raised over $19.3 million and sold over 598 million tokens, Remittix will be revealing the name of their first CEX listing when the presale hits $20M. Key Remittix highlights Cross-border payments: Send crypto directly to bank accounts globally Wallet Beta Launch: Scheduled in Q3 2025 for seamless transactions 40% Token Bonus: Incentivizing early investors Utility-First Model: Not just speculation, built for real adoption Growing Community: Retail and institutional investors actively participating With SOL capturing headlines, Remittix is quietly climbing, targeting $3 in 2025. Its combination of real-world use cases, tokenomics and early adoption makes it a standout in a market where price alone doesn’t guarantee growth. Conclusion: balancing SOL price gains with altcoin potential Solana price momentum continues to draw attention, but savvy investors are recognising Remittix as a strategic alternative. While SOL bulls focus on $205–$210 and beyond, Remittix offers both upward potential and tangible utility that could redefine growth opportunities in 2025.

Trading around $0.01824 at the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap, FUNToken is steadily building a foundation for growth. The project’s journey toward the $0.10 milestone is not being driven by promises alone but by a unique combination of Telegram-powered adoption , staking incentives, and a deflationary burn model. Together, these elements form a growth engine that could deliver a 10X return for early participants if roadmap targets are achieved. This article breaks down exactly how Telegram integration and staking are working together to fuel FUNToken’s trajectory and why traders see these systems as critical to reaching the next price threshold. Telegram Engagement: The Growth Catalyst Unlike most tokens that depend on centralized exchanges or complicated onboarding flows, FUNToken has built an accessible gaming experience directly inside Telegram. This choice has unlocked a massive global audience that is already comfortable with messaging-based apps and micro-transactions. Here is why this approach matters: Frictionless OnboardingTelegram users can start playing in seconds. There is no need for complex wallet setups or downloads. The simplicity of this experience removes the single biggest barrier to adoption in the Web3 space. Daily Active EngagementThe platform is already seeing over 105,000 active Telegram players, with daily missions, spin-to-win mechanics, and referral rewards. This high-frequency engagement keeps the ecosystem active and ensures a steady stream of demand for FUN tokens. Viral Growth DynamicsTelegram’s social features, like group challenges and friend invites, create organic user acquisition. As more players join, each community-driven promotion can snowball into thousands of new wallet activations. Revenue to Support BuybacksEvery transaction inside these Telegram games generates revenue. That revenue is used in the project’s quarterly buyback-and-burn program, steadily reducing circulating supply. With the roadmap targeting 10 additional Telegram games in Q3 2025 alone, the growth curve is expected to steepen. More users mean more transactions, more revenue, and a faster deflation cycle. Staking: Locking Supply and Rewarding Commitment Beyond gaming engagement, FUNToken’s staking model plays an equally important role in its path toward the $0.10 milestone. Staking is more than just a reward system. It is a mechanism that locks a portion of the circulating supply, reducing sell pressure and creating predictable demand. Here is how it works: Incentives for HoldingUsers can stake their FUN tokens directly in the ecosystem to earn rewards and access exclusive benefits such as premium game experiences and bonus multipliers. Reducing Liquid SupplyEvery FUN token locked in staking contracts is effectively removed from circulation for the duration of the staking period. As adoption grows, this locked supply becomes a meaningful contributor to scarcity. Strengthening Network EffectsStakers are incentivized to participate actively in the ecosystem, whether by playing, referring new users, or voting on future platform improvements. This dynamic creates a committed base of holders who have a direct interest in seeing the token appreciate. The roadmap for Q4 2025 includes launching the mobile FUN Wallet app with integrated staking, making it easier for everyday users to stake and earn without complex DeFi interfaces. The Path to $0.10: Why the Numbers Align When you look closely at FUNToken’s ecosystem, it becomes clear that the combination of AI-driven Telegram bot , Telegram community engagement, staking participation, and deflationary mechanics is a set of quantifiable growth drivers that are already impacting price action. Here is how these forces reinforce each other: A continuously expanding user base transacting FUN daily A rising percentage of tokens are being locked in staking contracts Quarterly buybacks funded by real revenue streams If we project this model forward into Q4 and early 2026, several scenarios illustrate why a move to $0.10 is plausible rather than speculative: Scenario 1: 500,000 Wallet Users with 20% Staking ParticipationThis would remove at least 100 million FUN from the circulating supply. If staking participation climbs to 30% or higher, the impact could be even larger. Scenario 2: Expansion of Active Daily TransactionsAs 10–20 more games are launched, the number of daily transactions could double or triple. Every transaction contributes to revenue and therefore to quarterly buybacks. If burn volumes rise from 25 million to 50 million FUN per quarter, the available supply on exchanges could fall significantly in less than a year. Scenario 3: Sustained Community Growth and Network EffectsEach new player not only increases demand for FUN tokens but also introduces referral loops and viral engagement. This dynamic creates an organic, compounding network effect that makes growth less reliant on external marketing spend. Together, these scenarios create a market structure where demand consistently rises while supply steadily contracts. This is why traders and analysts watching FUNToken often describe the $0.10 milestone as a logical step in the token’s lifecycle rather than a speculative moonshot. Final Thoughts FUNToken’s roadmap is clear. Grow the ecosystem, expand active users through Telegram, incentivize holding through staking, and consistently reduce supply. This is a combination that few projects in the gaming token space have achieved. With each quarter delivering more games, deeper staking integration, and significant deflationary burns, the foundation for a move toward $0.10 and 10X growth is already being laid. Adding to this momentum, FUNToken has also launched a $5 million giveaway , designed to reward the community and accelerate adoption by attracting new players and holders into the ecosystem. For those watching closely, this year may prove that utility, transparency, and deflation - combined with strong community incentives - can be far more powerful than hype alone.

Beyond ETH, investors are eyeing high-potential DeFi tokens like Uniswap (UNI), Ethena (ENA) and Remittix (RTX) . Investors are closely watching these established and emerging crypto opportunities for explosive returns. Ethereum ETFs spark institutional confidence Ethereum ETFs experienced record inflows of $1.019 billion this week , largely driven by BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust. ETHA now totals $10 billion in just three months, highlighting massive institutional interest. Analysts note that ETH accumulation in June and July has contributed to a bullish momentum, and the recent $150,000 ETH purchase by BlackRock signals confidence in long-term adoption. ETH continues trading around $4,683, supported by these inflows and growing retail engagement. source: TradingView The euphoria is augmented by the Ethereum tech roadmap. Vitalik Buterin highlighted innovations such as ultra-light nodes, privacy, easy self-custody and peer verified smart contract infrastructure. Such developments make Ethereum a competitive platform in the DeFi and smart contracts. Market participants are optimistic that Ethereum ETFs and core protocol enhancements could drive gains of 20-50x over the next bull cycle. Uniswap gains momentum as governance proposals drive price Uniswap (UNI) gained 3% on Monday following the DUNI governance proposal , aligning with Wyoming’s DUNA Act. Trading around $11.9, analysts suggest that holding above $8 and surpassing July 2025 highs could unlock a path toward $13-$19. The protocol continues to maintain strong user activity, currently ranking as the 11th largest DeFi platform with nearly $6 billion in TVL. source: TradingView Technical indicators indicate an upward trend since May 2025, which is backed up by growing liquidity and interest in governance. Momentum is developing and UNI holders look set to take advantage of potential near-term gains as it approaches its old all-time highs. Ethena rises amid surging TVL and revenue Ethena (ENA) has surged 36% in the past week and 127% over the last 30 days, with TVL climbing from $1 billion to $10.94 billion. Trading at $0.7862, protocol revenue has increased sharply, reaching $21.62 million in August alone. Bulls see resistance at $0.84, with a psychological $1 target in sight if momentum holds. source: TradingView Support levels at $0.72 and $0.68 could hold off a sharp correction, paving ETH-like gains. If ENA clears $0.84 on strong volume, a breakout toward $1 is feasible. Remittix: utility-driven growth and explosive potential While Ethereum ETFs and DeFi tokens gain attention, Remittix (RTX) stands out for utility and adoption.

One day the leaderboard looks set in stone, the next it’s being reshuffled by a big network upgrade, a sudden wave of institutional capital, or a sharp turn in market sentiment. That’s why the next 12–18 months feel so loaded with possibility. We’re entering a window where the right moves, made early, could pay off big. Solana and Cardano are both stacking up strong cases for a bullish run, each with their own catalysts drawing in top-tier analyst attention. But in the background, there’s a different kind of story building – one about an early-stage contender that’s generating the sort of pre-season buzz traders love to see. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now being tipped for a potential 36x gain as the countdown to the next altcoin season ticks down. And judging by how quickly allocations are disappearing, serious buyers aren’t waiting around. Solana (SOL): A bullish leap fueled by upgrades and ETF potential Solana has pulled off one of the cleanest comebacks in recent memory. Its Total Value Locked has doubled in the first half of 2025, network activity is up across the board, and the pace of new projects deploying on Solana shows no sign of slowing. Fast, cheap, and developer-friendly – it’s hitting all the right notes for builders and investors alike. The real needle-mover, though, is Firedancer, a validator client built by Jump Crypto. Once fully rolled out, it could push Solana’s throughput past one million transactions per second, giving it a technical advantage even the most established Layer-1s would envy. And with VanEck publicly floating a $520 price target tied to a potential spot Solana ETF approval, the bull case feels less like hype and more like a calculated read on where things are heading. Even in the “play it safe” scenarios, analysts are talking $200–$400 for SOL – numbers that could look conservative if an ETF greenlight hits while Firedancer is firing on all cylinders. Where smaller caps start stealing the show Large caps like Solana and Cardano are built for stability and steady growth, but altcoin seasons tend to reward the bold. As capital starts moving down the market cap ladder, smaller, high-potential plays often make the biggest percentage moves. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a focal point. Early forecasts point to a potential 36x ROI once it lands its first major exchange listings. Every presale round so far has been snapped up in record time, creating scarcity before the broader market even gets a look in. But this isn’t just another fast-burn presale hoping for a lucky break – MAGACOIN’s building an ecosystem meant to keep holders engaged long after launch day. That combination of viral appeal, real utility, and early scarcity is exactly the kind of setup seasoned traders scan for when they’re positioning ahead of an alt season breakout. Cardano (ADA): Governance and ecosystem growth driving value If Solana’s rise has been a sprint, Cardano’s has been more of a marathon. Its deliberate, research-first approach has often tested the patience of traders chasing quick wins, but the network is now moving into the Voltaire era – and that’s a turning point. Fully decentralized, on-chain governance will give the community direct control over upgrades and funding, a model that could make Cardano one of the most self-sustaining blockchains out there. Layer-2 scaling via Hydra adds another dimension. If it delivers near-instant transactions without compromising security, Cardano could bridge the gap between rock-solid reliability and the kind of speed today’s applications demand. Analysts with a bullish read are calling for $3-$5 ADA by 2026, particularly if a spot ETF wins approval – something Bloomberg sees as increasingly likely. Even the cautious takes, landing in the $1.20–$2.00 range , still represent meaningful upside from here. Reading the signals The setups are starting to take shape. Solana’s upgrade path and ETF potential give it a shot at moving into a new tier of dominance . Cardano’s governance shift and scaling breakthroughs could position it as a heavyweight for institutional adoption. And on the high-reward end, MAGACOIN FINANCE has all the early signs of a small cap that could explode when market sentiment flips. Conclusion The next altcoin season won’t lift all boats – it never does. But for those willing to read the signs and position early , the opportunities are already on the table. Whether you’re after the established firepower of Solana and Cardano or the early-stage moonshot potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, the playbook remains the same: move before the crowd . In this market, timing isn’t just a factor – it’s the factor.

On-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa recently reported on X about a dramatic turn of events involving AguilaTrades, a known crypto whale on the Hyperliquid platform. This trader experienced a staggering $6.52 million loss today, stemming from seven consecutive liquidations of their ETH long positions. However, in a move that defines resilience, AguilaTrades immediately re-entered the market with a colossal new 25x ETH long worth over $10 million. What Triggered This Massive Trading Loss on Hyperliquid? The day unfolded dramatically for AguilaTrades. According to the analyst’s report, the series of unfortunate events began with seven straight liquidations of their Ethereum (ETH) long positions. A liquidation occurs when a trader’s margin falls below the maintenance margin requirement, leading the exchange to automatically close the position to prevent further losses. For AguilaTrades, these consecutive liquidations quickly accumulated, swelling daily losses to an astounding $6.52 million. This significant trading loss highlights the inherent risks of leveraged positions, especially in volatile markets. Even experienced traders, or “whales” with substantial capital, can face rapid and severe financial setbacks when market movements go against their highly leveraged bets. The Hyperliquid platform, known for its high-performance trading environment, facilitated these rapid liquidations. Understanding the High Stakes of Leveraged Trading What exactly is leveraged trading , and why does it lead to such massive gains or, in this case, a monumental trading loss ? Leveraged trading allows traders to open positions larger than their actual capital by borrowing funds. While this amplifies potential profits, it also dramatically increases the risk of liquidation. A small adverse price movement can wipe out a significant portion, or even all, of the initial capital. A crypto whale like AguilaTrades typically commands vast sums of capital, enabling them to place large bets that can influence market sentiment. Their moves are often watched closely by other traders, as their positions can signal potential market trends. However, even whales are not immune to the market’s unpredictable nature, as evidenced by this recent event. Amplified Returns: Leveraged trading can magnify profits on successful trades. Increased Risk: Small price movements can lead to rapid liquidations. Margin Calls: Traders must maintain sufficient collateral to keep positions open. The Audacious Re-Entry: A New 25x ETH Long In a move that stunned many observers, moments after the forced liquidation and accumulating a $6.52 million trading loss , AguilaTrades opened another massive 25x ETH long . This new position is valued at $10.59 million, with an entry price of $4,566.42. This immediate re-entry, despite the significant prior losses, showcases a highly aggressive trading strategy and a strong conviction in Ethereum’s future price action. Such a swift pivot from a major setback to an even larger bet is characteristic of some high-risk traders. It suggests either an unwavering belief in their market analysis or a strong desire to recover losses quickly. The decision to open another substantial ETH long on Hyperliquid, with even higher leverage than typical, demonstrates an extraordinary risk appetite. What Can We Learn from This Crypto Whale’s Bold Move? The story of AguilaTrades offers valuable insights for anyone involved in the crypto market. It underscores the extreme volatility and the unforgiving nature of leveraged trading . Even the most significant players can face severe losses, yet some possess the conviction to double down immediately. Key takeaways: Risk Management is Crucial: Regardless of capital size, proper risk management, including stop-loss orders and position sizing, is vital. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets can move rapidly, leading to quick liquidations. Emotional Discipline: The ability to manage emotions after a loss is critical to avoid impulsive, potentially detrimental, trades. While AguilaTrades’ audacious new ETH long position on Hyperliquid remains a subject of intense speculation, it serves as a powerful reminder of the thrilling, yet perilous, world of high-stakes cryptocurrency trading. Summary: A High-Stakes Gamble Continues The saga of AguilaTrades’ $6.52 million trading loss and immediate re-entry into a $10.59 million 25x ETH long on Hyperliquid is a testament to the wild swings possible in crypto. It highlights the immense risks and potential rewards of leveraged trading , especially for a prominent crypto whale . This event is a stark reminder that in the fast-paced world of digital assets, fortunes can be made and lost in an instant, and conviction can drive traders to incredible lengths. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is AguilaTrades? A1: AguilaTrades is identified as a significant “crypto whale” on the Hyperliquid trading platform, known for making large, high-leverage trades, particularly in Ethereum (ETH). Q2: What is an ETH long position? A2: An ETH long position is a trade where an investor buys Ethereum with the expectation that its price will increase. If the price goes up, the trader profits; if it goes down, they incur losses. Q3: What caused AguilaTrades’ $6.52 million loss? A3: The loss was caused by seven consecutive liquidations of AguilaTrades’ leveraged ETH long positions. Liquidations occur when the market moves unfavorably, and the trader’s collateral is insufficient to cover potential losses, forcing the exchange to close the position. Q4: Why did AguilaTrades open a new ETH long immediately after a major loss? A4: Opening a new, even larger, ETH long position immediately after a significant loss indicates a highly aggressive trading strategy and strong conviction in Ethereum’s future price. It also suggests an attempt to recover losses quickly, though this carries substantial risk. Q5: What are the main risks of leveraged trading? A5: The main risks of leveraged trading include amplified losses, rapid liquidations, and the need for constant monitoring of positions. Small market movements can lead to significant financial setbacks, potentially wiping out entire investments. Did this high-stakes crypto drama grab your attention?

Average market cap rose 12% in the same period, driven by broad-based gains across tokens, decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and exchange-traded products (ETPs), but ether (ETH) stole the spotlight, the report said. Ether’s market cap surged 49% last month, far outpacing bitcoin’s 8% gain. JPMorgan attributed the move partly to the Ethereum blockchain’s dominant role in stablecoin issuance and growing institutional flows into ETH-linked products. U.S. spot ether ETPs saw a record $5.4 billion in net inflows, lifting total ETH ETP assets to $21.5 billion, JPMorgan said. Bitcoin (BTC) spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) added $6 billion, bringing their combined assets under management to $152 billion. Trading activity accelerated, with average daily volumes across the ecosystem jumping 49% in July, the bank noted. CoinDesk data showed token volumes rising 51% MoM. Ether token volumes surged 60%, four times bitcoin’s 15% increase. DeFi and NFT markets also logged significant volume growth. JPMorgan pointed to the passage of the GENIUS Act, a growing roster of crypto-linked initial public offerings (IPOs), and deepening partnerships between traditional finance and decentralized finance as key drivers behind the rally. The bank said these factors, alongside a broader risk-on sentiment in global markets, suggest the recent gains in prices and volumes could prove sustainable.

Over 1 billion DOGE worth $200M has been scooped up since Q2 2025, while PEPE surged 25% after seeing similar institutional buying. But here’s what the public hasn’t caught on to yet: these same deep-pocketed players are quietly stockpiling Remittix (RTX) , a project with utility, real-world adoption potential with prices set to go into overdrive in the coming weeks. Analysts say you’re not early anymore, but you’re not too late; What could they possibly mean? Pepe Coin resilience: 25% bounce signals whale confidence Pepe trades at $0.0000122 after rebounding from August lows, while Dogecoin holds above $0.24 with a golden cross signaling potential 90% upside. Historically, such whale activity signals an imminent altcoin rotation. PEPE’s rally from $0.000009866 is backed by whales buying above key support levels. One whale banked $1.77M profit in a single trade, then bought back at higher prices, a clear conviction signal. Pepe price predictions targets sit at $0.000015 –$0.000018, offering up to 50% potential upside if bullish momentum holds. Dogecoin momentum: whales drive 15% rally toward 30-cent target DOGE’s 15% surge to $0.2493 came after whales grabbed 200 Million+ Dogecoin tokens worth over $35M. Additionally, Dogecoin has formed a golden cross, the first since November 2024 and one that historically precedes triple-digit rallies. Dogecoin price has $0.25 as its immediate resistance, but a breakout could push DOGE to $0.30 fast, fueled by high-volume institutional inflows. Remittix revolution: the next 100x crypto capturing whale attention This is where the real money is going. Remittix isn’t another meme coin pump, it’s an early-stage payments disruptor that lets users move crypto directly to bank accounts in 30+ countries with real-time FX conversion, supporting 40+ cryptocurrencies. While DOGE and PEPE depend on hype cycles, RTX builds revenue-generating utility, meaning adoption and token demand only grow over time. Its deflationary model burns supply on every transaction, creating permanent upward pressure. This is the final presale stretch. When the $20M mark is hit: 40% bonus tokens vanish instantly Exchange listing FOMO floods in Retail chases at 2–3x higher entry prices Early whales bank massive paper gains Whales see the writing on the wall: $0.0944 is today’s price , but that won’t last. RTX has already raised over $19.3M. Once the Layer 2 Ethereum alternative hits $20M, the team will drop their first CEX listing announcement, the exact type of catalyst that historically delivers 5x–10x overnight moves for quality projects. With less than $1.6M left before the milestone, the presale clock is ticking down to zero. Whales from Pepe and Dogecoin aren’t buying for fun, they’re positioning for the post-listing liquidity surge. If you miss it, you’ll watch RTX open on exchanges at multiples of today’s price while early buyers load their profits into your buy orders.

Recently, tokenization firm Dinari made headlines by launching its dedicated layer-1 blockchain , a move poised to reshape how digital assets are managed and traded. This significant development, reported by Unfolded on X, marks a pivotal moment for the broader adoption of blockchain technology in traditional finance. What is Dinari’s Revolutionary Layer-1 Blockchain? Dinari’s new platform isn’t just another blockchain; it is a purpose-built infrastructure designed specifically for blockchain-based securities . A layer-1 blockchain serves as the foundational network, handling transactions and maintaining its own security without relying on other chains. Think of it as the core operating system for a new digital financial ecosystem. This dedicated approach ensures that the network is optimized for the unique demands of regulated financial instruments. It promises enhanced efficiency, transparency, and security for the issuance, transfer, and management of various asset classes, from real estate to equities, all in a tokenized format. The goal of the Dinari blockchain is to bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized technology, offering a robust and compliant environment for institutional players. Dedicated Infrastructure: Built from the ground up for securities. Enhanced Security: Robust protocols to protect sensitive financial data. Regulatory Compliance: Designed with existing financial regulations in mind. Scalability: Capable of handling high volumes of transactions required by institutional finance. Why is Digital Asset Tokenization Crucial Now? Digital asset tokenization is rapidly gaining traction because it solves many inefficiencies inherent in traditional markets. By converting real-world assets into digital tokens on a blockchain, we unlock unprecedented liquidity, reduce settlement times, and lower operational costs. Imagine trading fractional ownership of high-value assets like commercial properties or fine art with ease. This innovative process democratizes access to investments previously reserved for large institutions. It also introduces programmable money and assets, allowing for automated compliance and sophisticated financial instruments. The transparency and immutability of blockchain records minimize fraud and errors, building greater trust among participants. The launch of the Dinari blockchain significantly contributes to this evolving landscape by providing a dedicated, high-performance solution. How Does Dinari’s Platform Impact Institutional Blockchain Adoption? The move by Dinari is a strong indicator of growing institutional blockchain interest. Financial institutions often face challenges integrating public blockchains due to concerns around privacy, scalability, and regulatory clarity. A specialized layer-1 blockchain like Dinari’s addresses these concerns directly. It provides a controlled environment where institutions can confidently explore and implement tokenized securities without compromising existing compliance frameworks. This tailored infrastructure can accelerate the adoption of blockchain within banks, asset managers, and other financial entities. It opens doors for new business models and innovative financial products, driving efficiency across the entire financial supply chain. For example, asset managers can now more easily manage portfolios of tokenized real estate or private equity. Navigating the Future of Tokenized Securities While the potential of tokenized securities is immense, challenges remain. Regulatory frameworks are still evolving globally, and interoperability between different blockchain networks is crucial for widespread adoption. However, dedicated platforms like the Dinari blockchain are paving the way by offering solutions that prioritize compliance and performance.

Inflows into wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH have reached multi-billion-dollar levels in recent weeks — including single-day spikes of over $2.5 billion, the largest since 2018.

With its nearest resistance pegged just shy of five thousand, Ethereum could push higher if this level is breached, potentially rising by about 25% to reach its second resistance. Recent upward movement highlights its growth potential, backed by strong interest suggested by a moderate RSI and robust trading volumes.

Large-scale investors have significantly increased their holdings, pointing towards a bullish trend. This analysis explores the undercurrents and potential outcomes of this market behavior. Ethereum's Market Dynamics and Whale Accumulation Recent on-chain data unveils that Ethereum might be on the brink of a significant price rally, potentially touching the $5000 mark. Whales, or large-scale investors, have been rapidly accumulating Ethereum, with inflows reaching levels not seen since 2018. Such aggressive acquisitions have historically preluded substantial price surges. In a span of two weeks, these investors have amassed over 1.13 million ETH, suggesting a tight supply and robust confidence from institutional players. The implications of such a concentrated buying spree could be transformative for Ethereum's valuation. Current Ethereum Market Trends With a current trajectory oscillating between $3000 to $4500, Ethereum has shown a remarkable 17% increase in just one week and nearly 50% over the last month. Its six-month performance shows an impressive gain of 59%, setting a robust foundation for potential future gains.

According to a research report from Sentora shared with Cryptonews, companies are “borrowing billions in fiat, issuing new equity, and restructuring entire balance sheets to acquire Bitcoin” while engaging in what amounts to structured speculation on a non-yielding , highly volatile digital asset. The study identifies a critical flaw in the strategy. “Idle Bitcoin on a corporate balance sheet is not a scalable strategy in a rising-rate world” because most Bitcoin treasury companies are either unprofitable or heavily reliant on mark-to-market gains to appear solvent. Source: Sentora Research Strategy leads with 628,791 BTC, followed by MARA Holdings at 50,639 BTC and Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company with 30,021 BTC. Notably, Japan’s Metaplanet’s recent Q2 financial report revealed a stunning 468% Bitcoin yield in Q2 2025. Speaking with Cryptonews, Vincent Maliepaard, Vice President of Marketing at Sentora, noted that “balance sheet diversification with a hard asset like Bitcoin is the right framing, especially in an era of heightened geopolitical uncertainty.” However, the research warns that without Bitcoin evolving from digital property to productive digital capital that generates yield, the strategy remains fundamentally limited. Historical Parallels Reveal Both Promise and Peril The Bitcoin treasury strategy mirrors historical wealth-building through leveraged acquisition of scarce assets like land and property, sharing characteristics of “a scarce and durable asset, cheap capital,” but currently lacking “the asset’s ability to produce yield.” Source: Sentora Research The research notes that while families and companies built generational wealth through real estate for centuries, “Gold Treasury companies” never emerged despite gold’s scarcity due to storage costs, movement difficulties, and negative carry. Bitcoin’s digital advantages enable global transfers in seconds, programmable custody, and 24/7 trading, positioning it as potentially superior to gold for treasury purposes. However, the research emphasizes that “like land that gains economic meaning when developed, Bitcoin ‘ must do something ‘” beyond existing as idle digital property on balance sheets. The study warns that most Bitcoin treasury adopters from 2020-2024 “misunderstood the asset, the structure, or the macro environment” during an era of cheap fiat and QE-boosted equities. The transition to higher interest rates exposes structural weaknesses in strategies designed for ultra-low rate environments. Leveraged Speculation Disguised as Treasury Management The research categorizes Bitcoin treasury strategies as “negative-carry trades” where companies borrow fiat to acquire a non-yielding asset, contrasting sharply with traditional carry trades that provide a positive yield while waiting. Unlike foreign exchange carry trades with built-in cushions, Bitcoin strategies offer “no yield cushion, no neutral carry, and no risk-parity ballast.” Strategy has pioneered the model using $3.7 billion in ultra-low coupon convertible bonds and $5.5 billion in perpetual preferred shares to finance acquisitions. Michael Saylor attributes Strategy’s premium to net asset value through “Credit Amplification, Options Advantage, Passive Flows, and Superior Institutional Access” that provide 2x-4x Bitcoin exposure amplification unavailable to spot ETFs. $MSTR trades at a premium to Bitcoin NAV due to Credit Amplification, an Options Advantage, Passive Flows, and superior Institutional Access that equity and credit instruments provide compared to commodities. pic.twitter.com/AYQlytS4ID — Michael Saylor (@saylor) August 13, 2025 The financing mechanisms reveal structural vulnerabilities. Mining companies like Marathon Digital face “razor-thin and deteriorating margins, often being structurally unprofitable below ~$100k BTC” with Bitcoin constituting 50-80% of their assets. The research notes that these firms face high liquidation risk due to short-term cash needs during downturns. Similarly, Metaplanet also exemplifies this aggressive accumulation , doubling Bitcoin holdings every 60 days for 475 days while utilizing zero-interest convertible bonds worth ¥270.36 billion. The company filed shelf registrations for ¥555 billion in perpetual preferred shares, targeting 210,000 BTC by 2027, representing 1% the total Bitcoin supply. Credit Cycle Vulnerability Threatens Corporate Bitcoin Experiment The research warns of structural risks when “interest payments become unserviceable, refinancing costs spike, equity issuance turns non-accretive, and boards question the Bitcoin strategy itself.” Most companies lack sustainable business models beyond Bitcoin appreciation, creating dangerous dependencies on continued price momentum. Rising interest rates amplify negative carry, while Bitcoin price stagnation over 2-3 years could erode conviction and make equity issuance dilutive. The study notes “there is no lender of last resort, no circuit breaker, and no refinancing facility” when Bitcoin carry trades break, making risks “binary and reflexive.” Presumably due to the weakening risk appetite, Strategy is already facing multiple class-action lawsuits alleging misleading statements about Bitcoin strategy profitability and risks. However, the company maintains unique advantages through index inclusion, providing passive flows from $35 trillion in equity markets and $60 trillion in credit markets compared to Bitcoin ETFs’ $700 billion access. JUST IN: Kazakhstan’s Fonte Capital gets approval to list the first spot Bitcoin ETF in Central Asia The ETF starts trading tomorrow pic.twitter.com/rutraPruZk — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 12, 2025 Most recently, Kazakhstan has also launched Central Asia’s first spot Bitcoin ETF , while Norway’s sovereign wealth fund increased indirect Bitcoin exposure by 192% through equity stakes in Coinbase, Metaplanet, and Strategy. These developments support Maliepaard’s prediction that “ more private enterprises will reveal significant BTC positions ” as market infrastructure matures. The research concludes that for the strategy to succeed long-term, “Bitcoin must evolve from digital property to digital capital,” which generates yield without custodianship requirements. Until Bitcoin becomes productive through yield-bearing mechanisms, most corporate treasury experiments face potential failure during adverse credit cycles. However, Maliepaard remains optimistic about long-term prospects, predicting that “ the familiar boom-and-bust framing of Bitcoin cycles will start to fade ” as adoption widens across corporate and sovereign balance sheets. He believes that “ if debt-financed acquisition of hard assets like land and real estate has historically compounded value, applying the same playbook to Bitcoin could reshape market dynamics entirely ,” with even aggressive price forecasts potentially proving conservative.

The crypto world is buzzing with exciting news! Crypto exchange Gemini , backed by the well-known Winklevoss twins, has officially launched its innovative Gemini smart wallet . This new offering aims to give users true ownership and unparalleled security for their cryptocurrencies. It’s a significant step towards empowering individuals in the decentralized finance space, moving beyond traditional custodial models. This development, as reported by @cryptounfolded on X, signifies a major shift. Users can now directly control their private keys and manage their funds without relying solely on the exchange. This brings a new level of confidence and independence to the crypto community. What is the Gemini Smart Wallet and Why Does it Matter? The Gemini smart wallet is not just another digital wallet; it’s a self-custodial solution. This means you, the user, hold the private keys to your cryptocurrency. Think of it like owning the physical key to your safe deposit box, rather than letting the bank hold it for you. This approach is fundamental to the ethos of blockchain technology, emphasizing decentralization and individual sovereignty. Here’s why this is a game-changer: True Ownership: You have direct control over your assets. Reduced Counterparty Risk: You are less exposed to risks associated with an exchange holding your funds. Enhanced Security: With proper key management, your funds are safer from exchange hacks or freezes. This move by crypto exchange Gemini highlights a growing demand for greater user autonomy in the digital asset landscape. Embracing Self-Custody: A New Era for Digital Asset Security The concept of a self-custody wallet is gaining significant traction. In an industry where trust is paramount, empowering users to manage their own keys is a powerful statement. It shifts the responsibility and, crucially, the control, directly into the hands of the individual. For many, the primary concern in the crypto space is digital asset security . While exchanges offer convenience, they also present a single point of failure. A self-custody solution mitigates this risk by distributing control. This means that even if an exchange faces issues, your funds remain secure and accessible to you. Moreover, this type of wallet often incorporates advanced features like multi-signature capabilities or social recovery options, adding layers of protection for your valuable crypto holdings. Navigating On-Chain Transactions with Ease One of the key functionalities of the new Gemini smart wallet is its ability to facilitate seamless on-chain transactions . This means users can send and receive cryptocurrencies directly on the blockchain network, without needing an intermediary to process the transfer. Performing on-chain transactions offers several advantages: Transparency: All transactions are recorded on the public ledger. Irreversibility: Once confirmed, transactions cannot be altered, ensuring finality. Direct Interaction: Users can interact directly with decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Gemini’s new offering simplifies this process, making it more accessible even for those new to self-custody. It’s about providing the tools for users to confidently engage with the broader blockchain ecosystem. Conclusion: A Step Towards Greater Crypto Autonomy The launch of Gemini’s self-custody smart wallet marks a pivotal moment for users seeking enhanced control and security over their digital wealth. By empowering individuals to manage their own keys and execute on-chain transactions with ease, crypto exchange Gemini is championing the core principles of decentralization. This innovative step promises to foster greater trust and participation in the evolving world of cryptocurrencies, ultimately enhancing digital asset security for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‘self-custody’ mean in the context of a crypto wallet? Self-custody means that you, the user, are solely responsible for holding and managing your private keys, which are essential for accessing and controlling your cryptocurrencies. Unlike custodial wallets, where an exchange or third party holds your keys, a self-custody wallet gives you complete control and responsibility. Q2: How does the Gemini smart wallet improve digital asset security? The Gemini smart wallet improves security by removing the reliance on a centralized exchange to hold your private keys. This significantly reduces ‘counterparty risk,’ meaning your assets are less vulnerable to exchange hacks, freezes, or other external issues, as long as you secure your private keys properly. Q3: Can I perform on-chain transactions with the new Gemini smart wallet? Yes, the Gemini smart wallet is designed to facilitate direct on-chain transactions. This allows you to send and receive cryptocurrencies directly on the blockchain network, interact with decentralized applications (dApps), and engage with smart contracts without needing an intermediary. Q4: Is the Gemini smart wallet suitable for beginners in crypto? While self-custody requires a greater understanding of key management, the Gemini smart wallet aims to simplify the process. It’s an excellent tool for those looking to take more control of their crypto, and Gemini likely provides resources to help users understand its functionalities. Q5: What makes the Gemini smart wallet ‘smart’? The ‘smart’ aspect often refers to the wallet’s ability to interact with smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) on the blockchain. It can also imply advanced features like transaction automation, multi-signature capabilities, or streamlined user experiences that go beyond basic sending and receiving.

One example is Stellar (XLM), a payments token among the top twenty cryptocurrencies by market cap. A quick glance at the crypto charts reveals that the Stellar price has massively appreciated over the last week, and analysts believe this is only the beginning. According to renowned crypto analysts, the Stellar price could appreciate to as much as $1, representing an over 100% increase from its current value. If they are right, this would automatically make the XLM token one of the best-performing tokens on the market. Regardless, Stellar is not the only payment token on the verge of a massive price surge. Analysts believe RTX, the native token of the upcoming PayFi project, Remittix , could also have a similar price appreciation when it eventually launches. Stellar price on the verge of massive breakout says crypto analyst Fans and token holders of payment token XLM could be in for a massive breakout come the end of the ongoing bull market, according to recent price predictions by crypto analysts. In crypto news today, analysts remarked that the top twenty cryptocurrencies by market cap could soon embark on a massive price correction that sees them set a new all-time high in the crypto market. The news comes on the back of a successful week for the payments token, which saw its price accelerate rapidly as the bull market intensified. If the recent forecast is true, Stellar could quickly become one of the best-performing altcoins on the market. Still, analysts remain unconvinced that it could outperform other payment tokens, particularly RTX, the native cryptocurrency of the upcoming PayFi project, Remittix. Remittix launch draws closer as team announce key detail Remittix’s native token, RTX, could launch sooner than anticipated following a major announcement about its token generation event. Earlier this week, Remittix announced that it would reveal the first centralized exchange on which RTX would launch once the project surpasses $20 million in presale. Despite still being in the presale phase, Remittix has caught the eye of the cryptocurrency industry thanks to its unique position in the highly anticipated PayFi industry. Many crypto experts view Remittix as the solution to the fragmentation issue within the larger payments ecosystem. Once it launches, Remittix is expected to transform the global payments experience thanks to innovative and impressive features, such as: Direct crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries worldwide 40% token bonus for early adopters and supporters 20% referral rewards for onboarding new users Discover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their project here: Website: https://remittix.io/ Socials: https://linktr.ee/remittix $250,000 Giveaway: https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway The post XLM targets $1, but it’s not the only payment token raking in massive whale inflows appeared first on Invezz",Crypto|Sponsored,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|MARKET|XLM|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Invezz', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",invezz,2025-08-14 13:50:45

The exchange’s latest listings have posted standout performances, with $TREE (Treehouse) surging sixfold on its July 29 debut, drawing strong community buzz. On August 7 , Jasper, Head of Assets at HTX, joined the third “Real Talk with HTX Executives” livestream to field questions from its community, X (formerly Twitter) users, and HTX DAO committee members. The session provided an in-depth look at the exchange’s asset-screening framework and the key indicators used to identify long-term bullish assets. Rigorous Screening to Capture Long-Term Winners To identify promising projects early, HTX has built a multi-layered evaluation system. Jasper explained that for projects already listed on other exchanges, HTX tracks their ongoing development before considering a listing. For pre-token projects, the review process incorporates on-chain metrics such as holdings allocation, on-chain activity, smart contract audits for vulnerabilities or backdoors, and the reasonableness of valuation, ensuring both potential and security. “HTX tracks potential issuers for up to a year in advance,” Jasper said. “Each goes through two to three deep-dive evaluations covering team background, investors, sector fundamentals, AML/KYC compliance, contract security, operational progress, traffic metrics, product overview, community traction, social sentiment, tokenomics, assets distribution, and the authenticity of on-chain data. We also rely on platforms like RootData, Glassnode, and CertiK to verify data integrity and contract safety.” To be truly promising, Jasper stated, an asset must address a fundamental demand of its sector. Protocols such as AAVE , UNI , LINK , and TRX , deeply embedded in DeFi and infrastructure, can truly serve industrial needs, generate stable cash flow, and have long-term viability. By contrast, projects built on inflated concepts, fabricated data, or manufactured hype are quickly flagged and eliminated. This disciplined approach ensures the exchange captures over 90% of its target opportunities. HTX is willing to pass on even the hottest trends, such as PUMP tokens, if valuation and market fundamentals don’t align. “This year alone, we’ve successfully sidestepped at least three high-profile projects that subsequently failed, underscoring the reliability of our framework,” Jasper noted. New Initiatives to Boost Transparency & Community Engagement To strengthen community engagement and improve investment transparency, HTX is experimenting with asset watchlists and trading pilot zones. Jasper explained that the HTX DAO’s crypto recommendations and voting essentially act as a watch list, enabling community members to nominate and evaluate potential listings. This serves as a valuable complement to the official vetting process. Additionally, HTX launched an Innovation Zone in the second quarter of this year, specifically designed for early-stage projects or meme coins with higher uncertainty and volatility. The main crypto zone remains dedicated to more mature and high-quality assets. The structure gives users a clearer way to balance risk appetite with opportunity. Jasper stressed that no exchange, not even market leaders like Binance or Upbit, can guarantee every listing will outperform. “The market is a zero-sum arena. Exchanges provide liquidity and charge reasonable fees for facilitation, but don’t dictate price action. Crypto performance depends on a complex mix of factors, including project ability, market-making strategies, tokenomics, sentiment, community traction, macro trends, and valuation. Investors must do their own homework, stay rational, and take responsibility for their own trades.” About HTX Founded in 2013, HTX (formerly Huobi) has evolved from a virtual asset exchange into a comprehensive ecosystem of blockchain businesses that span digital asset trading, financial derivatives, research, investments, incubation, and other businesses. As a world-leading gateway to Web3, HTX harbors global capabilities that enable it to provide users with safe and reliable services.

That growth will be driven by institutional adoption across business-to-business (B2B), peer-to-peer (P2P) and card payment rails, sectors which have already showed signs of rapid uptake, the authors said. The report underscored why stablecoins are gaining ground in finances: they can outcompete traditional payment methods on both speed and cost. Sending $200 through a bank could carry fees equivalent to up to 13% and take days to settle, while stablecoins can complete the transaction in seconds at a fraction of the price, the report said. Foreign exchange (FX) settlement could be the largest untapped opportunity, according to the report. The $7.5 trillion-a-day FX market still largely settles on a T+2 basis through correspondent banks. Meanwhile, on-chain FX using stablecoins could enable atomic swaps with near-instant settlement and lower counterparty risks, the report suggested. Such efficiencies could also transform cross-border payments. With more regulatory clarity, greater liquidity and interoperability, stablecoins could handle as much as 12% of all cross-border payment flows by the end of the decade. Given the opportunities, the authors forecasted that every major fintech firms will eventually integrate stablecoin infrastructure over the few next years, just as software-as-a-service (SaaS) tools became ubiquitous. In practice, that could mean wallets and payment platforms moving value on-chain, treasury desks holding stablecoins and deploying for a yield and merchants settling instantly in multiple currencies. The rapid growth of stablecoins, which have a market cap of $260 billion, could also have ripple effects on monetary policy. Stablecoin supply could reach 10% of the U.S. M2 money supply in a bull case, up from 1% today, and represent roughly a quarter of the U.S. Treasury bill market and influence how the Federal Reserve manages short-term interest rates.

Reports from blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain on X have revealed a startling BtcTurk hack , where an attacker reportedly made off with over $23 million in digital assets. This incident highlights the ongoing challenges in safeguarding digital wealth within the volatile crypto landscape. The hacker did not just steal the funds; they are actively converting the stolen crypto funds into Ethereum (ETH), a common tactic to obscure the trail and facilitate movement. What Happened During the BtcTurk Hack? According to Lookonchain’s findings, the Turkish cryptocurrency exchange BtcTurk suffered a major breach resulting in the loss of more than $23 million. This significant sum represents a substantial blow to the exchange and its users. The immediate aftermath saw the attacker initiate a series of transactions aimed at liquidating the ill-gotten gains. Initial Breach: Details regarding the specific vulnerability exploited remain scarce, but the impact was immediate and severe. Asset Identification: Lookonchain’s vigilant monitoring identified the movement of the stolen crypto funds shortly after the incident. Conversion Strategy: The attacker quickly began converting the diverse range of stolen assets into Ethereum, a widely accepted and liquid cryptocurrency. This move often precedes attempts to further launder funds through decentralized exchanges or mixers. This rapid conversion underscores the sophistication of modern crypto hack operations. Why the Ethereum Swap? Understanding the Attacker’s Strategy The choice of Ethereum for the Ethereum swap is not arbitrary; it’s a strategic move by the attacker. Ethereum’s vast ecosystem offers several advantages for those looking to obscure their tracks. Its liquidity and the availability of various decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols make it easier to move funds across different platforms without centralized oversight. Furthermore, the Ethereum network supports a multitude of tokens, allowing for easy conversion and dispersion of funds. This makes tracing the ultimate destination of the stolen crypto funds significantly more complex for law enforcement and blockchain investigators. The attacker’s actions serve as a stark reminder of the continuous need for robust cryptocurrency security measures across all platforms. Protecting Your Assets: Lessons from the BtcTurk Incident The BtcTurk incident, like many other crypto hack events, reinforces the critical importance of strong security practices. For both exchanges and individual users, vigilance is paramount. While exchanges bear the primary responsibility for platform security, users also play a vital role in protecting their investments. Consider these actionable insights to enhance your cryptocurrency security : Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Always use 2FA on all your exchange accounts and wallets. Use Strong, Unique Passwords: Never reuse passwords across different services. Be Wary of Phishing Attempts: Always double-check URLs and sender identities before clicking links or providing information. Hardware Wallets for Large Holdings: For significant amounts of crypto, consider storing them in a hardware wallet, which offers offline security. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with the latest security advisories and best practices in the crypto space. The rapid Ethereum swap following the BtcTurk hack shows how quickly attackers move. Proactive security is your best defense. The recent BtcTurk hack and the subsequent conversion of over $23 million in stolen crypto funds into Ethereum underscore the persistent security challenges within the digital asset ecosystem. While authorities and blockchain analytics firms like Lookonchain work tirelessly to trace and recover funds, these incidents serve as powerful reminders for everyone involved in crypto. Maintaining robust cryptocurrency security practices is not just a recommendation; it is an absolute necessity to safeguard your digital investments in this evolving landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What happened in the BtcTurk hack? The BtcTurk cryptocurrency exchange reportedly suffered a security breach, leading to the theft of over $23 million in digital assets. How much money was stolen in the BtcTurk hack? More than $23 million in digital assets were reported as stolen during the BtcTurk hack. What did the attacker do with the stolen crypto funds? The attacker converted the stolen assets into Ethereum (ETH) in a rapid Ethereum swap , likely to make tracing and laundering the funds more difficult. How can I protect my crypto assets from a crypto hack? To enhance your cryptocurrency security , always use two-factor authentication (2FA), strong unique passwords, be vigilant against phishing, and consider hardware wallets for significant holdings.

Initial Concerns Over Policy Change Google Play Store recently introduced updated licensing requirements for cryptocurrency wallet apps in 15 countries, including the United States and the European Union. The policy, effective October 29, mandates that developers secure relevant registrations, such as FinCEN Money Services Business (MSB) status in the U.S. or MiCA licensing in the EU, regardless of whether the wallet is custodial or non-custodial. The announcement alarmed developers, as non-custodial wallets, which allow users to retain full control of their private keys, have historically been exempt from such regulatory obligations. Under the new rules, they appeared subject to the same licensing burdens as custodial platforms, potentially forcing many independent projects off the Play Store. Clarification Following Backlash Following widespread concern from the crypto community, Google clarified via X (formerly Twitter) that non-custodial wallets are not covered under the Play Store’s “Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Software Wallets Policy.” The company stated it would update its Help Center to reflect this exemption. This reversal alleviated concerns that Android users in the U.S., UK, and EU would lose access to popular self-custody tools due to regulatory licensing requirements that non-custodial wallet developers cannot meet. Impact of New Licensing Requirements While non-custodial wallets have been spared from the immediate licensing mandate, custodial wallet providers face significant compliance demands. In the U.S., developers must register with FinCEN as MSBs, hold state-level money transmitter licenses, or operate as banks. This includes implementing anti-money laundering programs and potentially adding Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. In the EU, Google Play will only list wallet apps from MiCA-licensed Crypto Asset Service Providers — a category that explicitly excludes non-custodial wallets. MiCA defines CASPs primarily as exchanges and custodial service operators, leaving independent software wallets outside the licensing scope. Broader Industry Context Google’s stance reflects a growing alignment with global financial watchdogs like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which in 2021 urged member nations to regulate virtual asset service providers under risk-based frameworks. Although FATF’s guidelines are non-binding, tech platforms have increasingly acted as enforcers by controlling access to distribution channels. Google has a complicated history with cryptocurrency-related apps, having banned mining software in 2018, removed several crypto news apps in 2020, and blocked deceptive crypto services in 2021. More recently, it allowed NFT games under strict disclosure rules while prohibiting gambling elements. The clarification on non-custodial wallets underscores the ongoing tension between regulatory compliance, platform policy, and user access to decentralized financial tools.

Binance Coin smashes new ATHs Binance’s native token price touched record highs today after gaining more than 10% in the past week.

BNB price hovers well above the 50- and 100-EMAs on the daily timeframe, indicating buyer dominance. The MACD supports the bullish bias with an upside crossover and green histograms. However, the daily RSI at 70% signals impending overbought conditions. That positions BNB for a brief correction before upside continuation. Ethereum profitability at record highs The second-largest cryptocurrency has been on steroids lately, even forcing Standard Chartered to adjust its 2025 price target .

Investors in profit will likely refrain from selling, especially as they anticipate new all-time highs.

While Solana’s chart shows healthy consolidation, experts believe the real upside story may come from Remittix and its push to redefine cross-border payments. For Solana, technicals indicate a strong base between $160 and $170 , supported by whale accumulation. Analysts see upside potential toward $210–$220 if bullish sentiment persists, making it a next big altcoin 2025 contender. Current trading near $201 also suggests growing market confidence in Solana as one of the top crypto under $1 alternatives for traders seeking high-growth assets. XRP’s future still hinges on regulation XRP continues to trade in the $2.64–$3.50 range, with forecasts such as $3.12 by late August or as high as $5.50 by year-end in bullish scenarios.

Whale Alert, a popular blockchain tracking service, reported that a staggering 54,723 ETH, valued at approximately $247 million, moved from an unknown wallet directly to Coinbase Institutional . This significant large crypto transaction sparks immediate questions about its implications for the Ethereum market and the broader landscape of institutional crypto adoption. What Does This Ethereum Whale Movement Signify? When an Ethereum whale makes such a substantial move, it often signals important shifts. These large holders, often called ‘whales’ due to their immense holdings, can significantly influence market dynamics. This particular transfer of 54,723 ETH is not just a large number; it represents a strategic decision. Understanding the intent behind such a move is crucial. Is it preparation for a sale, a staking initiative, or perhaps a rebalancing of a portfolio? The destination, Coinbase Institutional , provides a strong hint about the nature of this transaction. Why Coinbase Institutional for Such a Large ETH Transfer? The choice of Coinbase Institutional for this large ETH transfer is highly noteworthy. Coinbase Institutional is not a regular retail exchange; it caters specifically to institutional clients, including hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations. These entities prioritize security, compliance, and access to over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks for large block trades that wouldn’t disrupt open markets. Moving funds to such a platform suggests a professional, strategic intent rather than impulsive action. Analyzing the Potential Market Impact of This Crypto Transaction Any major crypto transaction of this magnitude can create ripples across the market. While the immediate transfer to an institutional platform doesn’t necessarily mean an imminent sell-off, it does indicate a potential for future activity. Market observers often watch these movements closely. If the intent is to sell, it would likely occur through OTC desks to minimize price impact. Conversely, the funds could be intended for staking, yield generation, or other institutional investment strategies, which could be bullish for Ethereum. The Growing Trend of Institutional Crypto Adoption This recent ETH transferred event highlights the accelerating trend of institutional crypto adoption. More and more traditional financial players are exploring and entering the digital asset space. Platforms like Coinbase Institutional facilitate this transition by providing regulated and secure infrastructure. The involvement of large institutions can bring increased liquidity, stability, and legitimacy to the crypto market. It also signals a maturing ecosystem where digital assets are becoming a recognized asset class for serious investors. The movement of 54,723 ETH transferred to Coinbase Institutional is more than just a large number; it is a clear indicator of significant activity within the Ethereum ecosystem. Whether this Ethereum whale is preparing for a strategic trade or a long-term investment, the destination underscores the increasing importance of institutional crypto platforms in managing substantial digital asset holdings. This event reminds us that the crypto market continues to evolve, drawing in larger, more sophisticated players. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Coinbase Institutional? Coinbase Institutional is Coinbase’s platform designed for large financial institutions and corporations, offering advanced trading tools, custody services, and compliance features for significant crypto holdings. Why do whales move large amounts of ETH to institutional platforms? Whales often move large amounts of ETH to institutional platforms like Coinbase Institutional for enhanced security, regulatory compliance, access to over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks for large transactions, and specialized financial services. Does this transaction mean the ETH will be sold? Not necessarily. While a sale is possible, often via OTC desks to avoid market disruption, the funds could also be intended for staking, lending, or other long-term investment strategies within a regulated environment. How can I track large crypto transactions? Services like Whale Alert provide real-time updates on significant cryptocurrency movements across various blockchains. On-chain analytics platforms also offer detailed insights into wallet activity. What is the significance of institutional crypto adoption? Institutional adoption brings increased capital, liquidity, and legitimacy to the crypto market. It can lead to greater market stability, wider acceptance of digital assets, and the development of more sophisticated financial products. Did you find this analysis insightful?

50082055,556670,1755180025,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50082055.jpeg,Cardano Hits New Milestone As Grayscale Moves Forward With ETF Application,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-grayscale-etf/,"Grayscale has taken its first official step toward launching a Cardano (ADA) exchange-traded fund (ETF) , registering the Grayscale Cardano Trust in Delaware. The legal filing marks the start of the process, and an approval from the SEC could draw interest from both institutional and retail investors who value the cryptocurrency’s scalable and sustainable blockchain technology. Cardano Moves Closer To ETF Launch As Grayscale Expands Portfolio On Tuesday, Grayscale officially filed to establish the Grayscale Cardano (ADA) Trust ETF as a statutory trust. Following the public filing, Cardano surged to an over five-month high of more than 15% to $0.987 on Thursday. The CSC Delaware Trust Company was named as the registered agent in Wilmington, overseeing the legal structure. Grayscale chose Delaware as the location for registration because of its strong corporate laws and efficient trust structures, which make it a preferred base for many financial entities. The Cardano Trust registration creates the legal entity needed to support a potential Cardano ETF. With the trust now established, Grayscale can prepare for the next stage, which examines whether the product meets the requirements for market surveillance, asset custody, valuation transparency, and investor protection. Only after meeting these standards could the ETF application move toward launch. The Delaware registration allows the company to position itself for federal filings such as the S-1 or 19b-4 forms. These are required to list an ETF on U.S. exchanges and trigger a formal SEC review process. Regulatory Hurdles Remain Amid Expanding Crypto ETF Plans While the trust registration is in progress, the SEC approval is still needed before the ETF can launch. The road from registration to launch is rarely quick, and Grayscale knows it. The SEC has been slow to approve crypto ETFs , often taking months or longer to make a decision. The push into a Cardano trust could be part of a broader strategy to expand into crypto ETFs. Grayscale has already filed for Dogecoin, Solana, and XRP ETFs, but none of them has gotten approval yet. The SEC has extended the deadline for an XRP ETF decision to October 18, 2025, while it now expects to decide on the Solana ETF in November 2025. Approval delays from the SEC show how careful the agency is with new crypto investment products, even as investor demand rises. Market participants are keen to see more crypto-based ETFs. Cardano, known for its proof-of-stake blockchain design , emphasizes scalability and sustainability, which could appeal to a broad investor base once regulatory approvals are in place. By locking in the trust registration now, Grayscale guarantees it is ready to act quickly if and when the SEC starts approving more crypto ETFs. While the exact timeline for a Cardano ETF remains uncertain, taking this first step gives the company an advantage in being ready to launch once it clears regulatory barriers.",Cardano|ADA|ADA ETF|ADA news|ADA Price|adausd|ADAUSDT|Cardano ETF|Cardano news|Cardano Price|ETF|ETF news|Grayscale|Grayscale news,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ADA|REGULATION|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-14 14:00:25

The partnership will introduce non-custodial staking solutions to institutional clients on io.finnet’s platform, starting with Ethereum and Solana. Later, the offering will expand to include the platform’s full token coverage and a broader pipeline of 15+ Proof-of-Stake assets. By embedding staking into existing MPC wallet workflows and API services, the collaboration will reduce operational friction and unlock on-chain yield for funds, fintech platforms, and enterprises managing digital assets. “io.finnet has built a strong foundation for institutions to interact with DeFi securely and efficiently,” said Jourdan Parkinson, Senior Business Development Manager at Everstake. “Partnering with io.finnet is a strategic alignment for our company. Together we provide the staking layer that enables clients to capture yield without sacrificing institutional standards for compliance, control, or scalability.” The integration establishes Everstake as a core infrastructure provider within io.finnet’s ecosystem, giving institutional clients seamless access to high-performance staking. It also reinforces Everstake’s role as a trusted bridge between institutional capital and blockchain-native services. “As institutions increasingly seek to generate returns on their digital assets held in custody, staking has become a natural next step. By integrating Everstake’s robust validator infrastructure directly into our MPC workflows and APIs, we’re enabling clients to generate yield with the same operational simplicity, control, and security they expect from io.finnet. This partnership is key to unlocking passive returns across our supported assets – without introducing counterparty risk.” said Michael Cunningham, Head of Digital Assets at io.finnet. This integration also marks a pivotal step in Everstake’s institutional strategy, further extending its presence in markets like North America, Europe, and Asia, where io.finnet is rapidly expanding. As demand grows for secure, scalable staking solutions, the partnership lays the groundwork for future integrations, including support for stablecoins and other high-potential PoS assets. Together, Everstake and io.finnet aim to set a new standard for how institutions stake—one that combines world-class infrastructure with seamless integration and uncompromising security. In addition to powering staking for io.finnet clients, Everstake also uses io.finnet to manage its own digital asset treasury, reinforcing mutual trust in the platform’s MPC security and operational resilience.

50082049,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=804635,1755180036,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/50082049.jpeg,"Bitcoin Hits $124,400 ATH, Ethereum Next In Line, What’s Driving It?",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-hits-124400-ath/,"Bitcoin hit a new all-time high (ATH) on August 13, providing a bullish outlook for the leading cryptocurrency. Ethereum has also recorded remarkable gains in the last seven days, bringing it close to its ATH. This development has occurred thanks to macro factors, which are boosting risk-on sentiment. Bitcoin Hits New ATH While Ethereum Records Massive Gains CoinMarketCap data shows that Bitcoin has reached a new ATH of $124,400, surpassing its previous ATH of around $123,091, which it hit just a month ago. Meanwhile, Ethereum is up almost 30% in the last seven days and is now just about 2% away from its ATH of $4,891. With the crypto market boasting this bullish momentum, ETH is expected to reach a new ATH sooner rather than later. Related Reading: Pundit Predicts ‘Near Term’ Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices, There’s Still Room To Run These rallies for Bitcoin and Ethereum have occurred on the back of positive macro developments such as the U.S. CPI data, which has boosted hopes of a September Fed rate cut. The July CPI inflation data came in at 2.7%, which showed that inflation in the country was steady. This reading was also lower than the expected 2.8%. Meanwhile, earlier on, the July job data had suggested that the U.S. labor market was weakening after nonfarm payrolls rose to 73,000, lower than the expected 147,000. Meanwhile, May and June figures were revised to 19,000 and 14,000 from 144,000 and 147,000, respectively. These developments have proven bullish for Bitcoin and Ethereum as the odds of a 25-basis-point (bps) September Fed rate cut have reached as high as 99%, according to CME FedWatch. These odds are now at 95% while there is a 4.2% chance of a 50 bps, which would be more bullish for these crypto assets if it happens. Rate cuts inject more liquidity into the market and boost investors’ appetite for risk-on assets like BTC and ETH. Higher Prices Still Likely For BTC Crypto analyst Ezy said that the Bitcoin price is in the ‘Sign of Strength’ phase, signaling that this is the beginning of a major bullish move after a period of accumulation by whales. The analyst added that the first target in this phase is typically the 1.618 Fibonacci, which is around $130,000. Related Reading: None Of These 30 Bitcoin Bull Market Top Indicators Have Been Triggered Meanwhile, the Ezy stated that the second target is at the 2.0 Fibonacci level, near $145,000, and the final target is around $166,000. His accompanying chart showed that Bitcoin can reach these targets between September and October, around when the monetary easing cycle is expected to begin. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $122,600, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

LINK price has increased by 38.9% in the last week and has also broken new records. Cryptocurrency analysis platform Santiment stated that LINK earnings reached an eight-month high, while LINK saw the most whale transactions in the last seven months. Why is Chainlink Rising? While analyzing the reasons behind LINK's surge, popular crypto analyst Miles Deutscher also provided an updated analysis. He stated that the biggest reason behind the surge is Chainlink's facilitation of blockchain integration with Wall Street giants. The analyst said that Chainlink’s partnership with US-based Fortune 500 company Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) to bring foreign exchange and precious metals data onto the chain is among the biggest reasons for the rise. Secondly, the analyst stated that the rise was due to the launch of the Chainlink Reserve program. Related News: US-Based Surprise Altcoin Announces Reserve Launch! ""Will Not Be Sold for a Long Time!"" The analyst pointed to the rise of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) as a third reason. Accordingly, LINK is the market leader with an 84% share of the entire Oracle market on Ethereum. It was stated that another reason that fueled the rally was that whales were actively buying LINK. Miles Deutscher recently suggested that the LINK price could rise even higher. “LINK could be the most obvious big mover this cycle,” Deutscher said. “But most people will miss it.” https://x.com/milesdeutscher/status/1955736122228924614 *This is not investment advice.

The breach stemmed from a reentrancy vulnerability in GMX V1’s contract structure. Compensation will be in GLV tokens with extra rewards for users who hold them for at least three months. “About $44 million in value is being distributed, making all impacted Arbitrum GLP holders whole and marking a favorable resolution to the security challenge GMX faced,” the project said . The payout combines recovered funds with $2 million from GMX’s treasury. GMX V1 Exploit Drains $42M via AUM Manipulation Vulnerability The incident occurred on July 9, when GMX V1’s GLP pool on Arbitrum was exploited for $42 million. At the time, blockchain security firm PeckShield attributed the loss to a reentrancy vulnerability that let the attacker manipulate the protocol’s assets-under-management (AUM) calculations, enabling them to withdraw more than their deposits. #GMXDeveloper msg pic.twitter.com/miTaxE6OEj — PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) July 9, 2025 GMX also confirmed that the $42 million exploit was caused by a re-entrancy vulnerability within its V1 contracts. Although the affected function was protected by a nonReentrant modifier, it only applied within the same contract, allowing the attacker to bypass this safeguard and manipulate the BTC average short price through the Vault contract. By exploiting this loophole, the attacker artificially drove the GLP price up and profited by redeeming inflated GLP tokens after opening a large position using a flash loan. The vulnerability was tied to how GMX V1 handled pricing calculations across separate contracts, a structure that has been revised in GMX V2, where calculations and executions now occur within the same contract to avoid such risks. In response, GMX paused trading on Avalanche, engaged with security partners and major infrastructure providers, and initiated direct on-chain communication with the exploiter. Hours after the breach, GMX sent an on-chain message offering a 10% white-hat bounty if 90% of the stolen funds were returned, an offer the attacker accepted. Compensation will be issued in GLV, GMX’s upgraded liquidity vault product for V2. Eligible claimants will receive equal portions of GLV [BTC-USDC] and GLV [WETH-USDC], reflecting roughly 25% Bitcoin, 25% Ether, and 50% stablecoins, mirroring the original GLP asset mix. In addition, GMX has launched a $500,000 GLV incentive pool for users who hold their distributed GLV for at least three months without selling or transferring, offering pro-rata rewards to long-term holders. Crypto Hacks, Scams Cost Investors $2.2B in H1 2025: CertiK Crypto investors lost over $2.2 billion to hacks , scams, and breaches in the first half of 2025, driven largely by wallet compromises and phishing attacks, according to CertiK’s latest security report. Wallet breaches alone caused $1.7 billion in losses across just 34 incidents, while phishing scams accounted for over $410 million across 132 attacks. Two major incidents, including Bybit’s $1.5 billion hack in February and Cetus Protocol’s $225 million exploit in May, skewed the year’s losses upward, together accounting for nearly $1.78 billion. Without these, losses align more closely with previous years at around $690 million. Ethereum remained the primary target, suffering over $1.6 billion in losses across 175 events.

While Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently floated the idea of moving the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to a RISC-V architecture, QF has already built its core around this new technology. The result is a network that is faster, more efficient, and built for mass adoption from day one. Designed to safeguard what it calls the five pillars of digital life, which are identity, money, work, community, and data, QF Network achieves block times of just 0.1 seconds through its SPIN consensus without compromising decentralization, a feat no other Layer 1 has achieved. This architecture delivers throughput up to 10× higher than standard Substrate chains and is engineered to support millions of daily users without performance bottlenecks, thanks to its parallel execution engine. “Our mainnet launch is not just about going live, it is about proving that a blockchain can be fast, scalable, and still sovereign by design,” said Ben Burge, Founder of Quantum Fusion Network. “We have built the foundation for dApps that feel instant, secure, and unstoppable.” QF’s native-first SDK, verifiable off-chain compute, and zkTLS integration create an environment where developers can build applications that match Web2 performance without compromising decentralization. This technical stack bridges Web2 and Web3, maintaining security and verification while removing friction for end users. For developers, this means the ability to compete with centralized platforms on speed and reliability while retaining core blockchain principles. For users, it means experiencing decentralized applications without the latency, throughput limits, or usability compromises that have slowed blockchain adoption. Mainnet is on track for Q4 2025. When it arrives, QF intends not just to join the Layer-1 race, but to set a new standard for it. About QF Network QF Network is a sovereign Layer-1 blockchain built to safeguard identity, money, work, community, and data for the next century. Powered by SPIN consensus, parallel execution, RISC-V architecture, verifiable off-chain compute, and zkTLS, QF delivers Web2-grade performance without sacrificing neutrality or decentralization.

According to recent market monitoring, BTC has fallen below the significant $118,000 mark. This sudden BTC price fall has caught the attention of investors and analysts alike, prompting a closer look at current cryptocurrency market trends . Specifically, Bitcoin is now trading at $117,951.95 on the Binance USDT market. This movement highlights the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the digital asset space. Understanding the factors behind such shifts is crucial for anyone navigating the crypto landscape. What Triggered This Significant Bitcoin Price Drop? When we observe a sharp Bitcoin price drop , several factors can contribute to the movement. While the immediate trigger for this specific fall below $118,000 stems from real-time market activity and trading volume, broader influences often play a role. For instance, macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, or even large institutional trades can sway the overall Bitcoin value . It is important to remember that cryptocurrency markets are global and operate 24/7, making them highly responsive to both internal and external pressures. This particular dip reflects a momentary shift in investor sentiment or a reaction to specific trading patterns. However, it’s a reminder that even established assets like Bitcoin are subject to market forces. How Does This BTC Price Fall Impact the Wider Market? A significant BTC price fall rarely happens in isolation. Bitcoin, as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, often acts as a bellwether for the entire digital asset ecosystem. When Bitcoin experiences a downturn, it frequently influences altcoins and other digital assets. This interconnectedness means that investors often see a ripple effect across their portfolios. For those conducting crypto market analysis , a dip in Bitcoin can signal broader caution or profit-taking across the board. Conversely, a Bitcoin recovery can uplift the entire market. Understanding these relationships is key to interpreting overall cryptocurrency market trends . While some altcoins might show resilience, many tend to follow Bitcoin’s lead, especially during periods of increased volatility. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Steps Amidst the Bitcoin Price Drop Experiencing a Bitcoin price drop can be unsettling, but it also presents opportunities and requires a clear strategy. For both seasoned and new investors, navigating market volatility effectively is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with reliable news sources and expert analysis. Understanding the broader context helps in making informed decisions. Avoid Panic Selling: Emotional decisions often lead to losses. Consider your long-term investment goals before reacting to short-term price movements. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This strategy involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. It helps average out your purchase price over time and can mitigate the impact of a sudden BTC price fall . Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversifying your portfolio can also help spread risk. Review Your Portfolio: Use dips as an opportunity to reassess your holdings and ensure they align with your investment thesis. The Future Outlook for Bitcoin Value and Cryptocurrency Market Trends Despite the recent Bitcoin price drop , the long-term outlook for Bitcoin value remains a subject of ongoing discussion and optimism among many analysts. Historically, Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience, recovering from numerous significant dips to reach new all-time highs. Factors such as increasing institutional adoption, technological advancements within the Bitcoin network, and growing global acceptance continue to shape its potential. While short-term fluctuations are a natural part of the market cycle, the underlying fundamentals of Bitcoin as a decentralized, scarce digital asset often remain strong. Keeping an eye on broader cryptocurrency market trends , including regulatory landscapes and technological innovations, will provide further insight into where Bitcoin might head next. The journey of digital assets is always evolving, offering both challenges and exciting prospects. In conclusion, the recent Bitcoin price drop below $118,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility in the crypto market. While a BTC price fall can trigger concern, it is also a moment for investors to reflect on their strategies and the long-term potential of digital assets. Staying informed, managing risk, and maintaining a clear perspective on overall cryptocurrency market trends are vital for navigating these dynamic waters. The world of crypto is constantly moving, and understanding its rhythm is key to making sound investment decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does a Bitcoin price drop mean for my investments? A Bitcoin price drop can temporarily reduce the market value of your holdings. However, for long-term investors, it might be seen as an opportunity to buy more at a lower price, depending on your investment strategy. Q2: Is this BTC price fall permanent? No, market movements are rarely permanent. Bitcoin has historically experienced numerous price falls, only to recover and often surpass previous highs. The current BTC price fall is part of its typical market cycle. Q3: How does this affect altcoins? When Bitcoin experiences a significant Bitcoin price drop , altcoins often follow suit due to Bitcoin’s dominant position and influence on overall cryptocurrency market trends . However, some altcoins may show independent movement. Q4: What should I do during a cryptocurrency market downturn? During a downturn, consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging, reviewing your risk tolerance, and avoiding emotional decisions. It’s also a good time to conduct thorough crypto market analysis and reassess your portfolio goals. Q5: Where can I find reliable information on Bitcoin value? For reliable information on Bitcoin value and cryptocurrency market trends , consult reputable financial news outlets, blockchain analytics platforms, and official cryptocurrency exchanges.

Here’s Giant Cup & Handle Target,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-is-primed-for-a-massive-breakout-heres-giant-cup-handle-target/,"Crypto analyst Xaif has set the XRP community abuzz after identifying a textbook cup-and-handle pattern on the higher-time-frame chart. His projection points to a measured-move target of $5.21, which, at today’s circulating supply, would translate to a market capitalization of roughly $309 billion—comfortably above the “$306B” mark he highlighted. The figure is based on XRP’s current circulating supply of about 59.31 billion coins, a number consistent across leading crypto market trackers. Where the Market Stands Now As of report time, XRP is trading at approximately $3.24, having moved within an intraday range of $3.23–$3.34. Its market capitalization currently hovers near $192 billion, supported by stable circulating supply data. This level places XRP firmly among the top-ranked cryptocurrencies by market value, though still well below its projected breakout target. #XRP is primed for a massive breakout! Giant cup & handle → Target: $5.21 Market cap could soar past $306B Long-term? $10+ is on the horizon! pic.twitter.com/hK8oDWpOXy — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) August 13, 2025 Reading the Pattern The current chart shows a clearly defined multi-month cup formation , followed by a consolidating handle. This structure is widely regarded in technical analysis as a bullish continuation pattern, provided it breaks to the upside on strong volume. Independent analysts echo Xaif’s view, with some suggesting that a confirmed breakout could propel XRP first into the $4–$4.50 range, then toward $5–$6. More aggressive projections extend the possible move to $8–$11, assuming market momentum and buying pressure remain strong. Market Conditions and Liquidity Flows Beyond the chart, liquidity dynamics are adding fuel to the bullish case. Open interest in XRP futures has risen sharply in recent sessions , a sign that leveraged traders are taking positions ahead of a potential breakout. This uptick often accompanies large directional moves, although it also increases the risk of volatility from crowded trades. On the macro front, a cooling U.S. inflation reading has boosted risk appetite across markets, lifting both equities and major cryptocurrencies—a favorable backdrop for a high-beta asset like XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Turning Xaif’s $5.21 into Market Reality Xaif’s $5.21 target equates to about $309 billion in market capitalization if today’s supply remains unchanged. Reaching the longer-term $10+ zone , as some XRP advocates suggest, would require nearly $600 billion in market value, a feat that would likely demand both a strong crypto bull cycle and increased real-world adoption of XRP’s payments and liquidity solutions. While such milestones are ambitious, they align with technical roadmaps from bullish analysts following similar long-term projections. What to Watch Next For now, all eyes are on the handle’s resistance level. A decisive, high-volume break and successful retest as support could mark the start of the projected run. Traders are watching futures positioning, spot volumes, and overall crypto sentiment for early signs of confirmation—or warnings of a premature rally. As Xaif’s post makes clear, the setup is in place. Whether XRP can transform that potential into a move past $5.21 depends on market conviction, sustained momentum, and the willingness of buyers to hold the line when it matters most.

50082412,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=189528,1755180610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/50082412.jpeg,"Urgent: U.S. Stock Market Opens Lower, Signaling Caution",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-stock-market-lower/,"BitcoinWorld Urgent: U.S. Stock Market Opens Lower, Signaling Caution Today, the financial world turned its attention to the U.S. stock market as all three major indices began the trading day in negative territory. This initial stock market open with a downward trend often captures the attention of investors across various asset classes, including those deeply involved in cryptocurrencies, as it can reflect broader shifts in economic confidence and investor sentiment . Let’s delve into what this means and why it matters. Understanding the Initial Market Decline The U.S. stock market opening lower today immediately signaled caution among traders and analysts. Here’s a quick look at the specific figures: S&P 500: Opened down by 0.32% Nasdaq: Started the day with a 0.29% decrease Dow Jones Industrial Average: Saw a slight dip of 0.07% While these percentages might seem small, they represent a collective sentiment as trading begins. A negative stock market open can set the tone for the entire day, influencing decisions across various sectors. What’s Driving This Market Decline? Several factors typically contribute to a negative market decline at the open. Often, it’s a culmination of overnight news, pre-market trading activity, and anticipation of upcoming economic indicators . Investors are constantly weighing: Inflation Concerns: Persistent worries about rising prices can lead to fears of aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, which can slow economic growth. Geopolitical Tensions: Global events can create uncertainty, prompting investors to pull back from riskier assets. Corporate Earnings Reports: Disappointing earnings from major companies can dampen overall market enthusiasm. Anticipated Policy Shifts: Any hint of changes in monetary or fiscal policy can cause market jitters. These elements collectively shape investor sentiment , leading to initial selling pressure. Impact on Investor Sentiment and Beyond A negative stock market open , particularly across all major indices, often reflects a cautious or even bearish investor sentiment . When traditional markets show weakness, it can sometimes trigger a broader “risk-off” environment where investors prefer to hold safer assets. This doesn’t always directly translate to immediate impacts on the cryptocurrency market, but it’s a crucial piece of the larger financial puzzle that crypto investors often monitor. Understanding these traditional market movements helps in grasping the overall economic health and liquidity conditions. Moreover, upcoming economic indicators like CPI data or unemployment figures can further influence market direction throughout the day and week. Navigating Market Volatility: Actionable Insights For any investor, observing a market decline at the open can be concerning. However, it’s important to maintain perspective. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on the news and official economic reports. Understanding the underlying reasons for market movements is key. Long-Term View: Short-term fluctuations are normal. A long-term investment strategy often helps weather daily volatility. Diversification: A well-diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks during periods of uncertainty. Avoid Panic Selling: Emotional decisions during a stock market open or a full trading day can lead to losses. While the U.S. stock market provides a snapshot of traditional finance, its trends offer valuable context for all market participants. Conclusion: Staying Vigilant in Dynamic Markets The U.S. stock market opening lower today serves as a reminder of the dynamic and interconnected nature of global finance. While the initial dip was modest, it underscores the importance of monitoring economic indicators and understanding the factors that shape investor sentiment . For those in the crypto space, observing these traditional market shifts can offer valuable insights into broader risk appetites and economic health. Staying informed and adopting a measured approach are crucial in navigating these ever-evolving landscapes. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when the U.S. stock market opens lower? When the U.S. stock market opens lower, it means that the major stock indices (like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow) start the trading day with their values below their previous day’s closing prices. This often indicates a cautious or negative investor sentiment based on overnight news or pre-market trading. Q2: How do economic indicators influence the stock market open? Economic indicators , such as inflation rates, employment figures, or GDP growth, are crucial. If these indicators suggest a weakening economy or potential policy changes (like interest rate hikes), investors might react by selling stocks, leading to a lower stock market open . Q3: Does a market decline in traditional stocks affect cryptocurrency? While not always a direct correlation, a significant market decline in traditional stocks can sometimes lead to a broader “risk-off” environment. This means investors might reduce their exposure to all perceived risk assets, which can include cryptocurrencies, though crypto markets have their own unique drivers. Q4: What should investors do during a lower stock market open? During a lower stock market open , it’s generally advised to avoid panic. Instead, focus on staying informed about the underlying reasons for the dip, review your long-term investment strategy, and ensure your portfolio is diversified. Emotional decisions can often lead to suboptimal outcomes. Q5: Where can I find reliable information on U.S. stock market movements? Reliable information on U.S. stock market movements can be found on reputable financial news outlets, official government economic data releases, and financial analysis platforms. Always cross-reference information from multiple credible sources. Did you find this analysis helpful?

La seconda criptovaluta per capitalizzazione ha guadagnato quasi il 30% nell’ultima settimana, sovraperformando tutte le altre principali altcoin. A guidare questo rally sono afflussi record negli ETF spot su Ethereum, con 1,54 miliardi di dollari entrati in soli due giorni. Il fondo ETHA di BlackRock è in testa, superando i 10,5 miliardi di dollari in asset in gestione. L’accumulazione istituzionale aggiunge carburante alla corsa. BitMine Immersion Technologies ha annunciato piani per raccogliere fino a 24,5 miliardi di dollari per acquisti di ETH , con l’obiettivo di controllare fino al 5% dell’offerta totale. A seguire, SharpLink ha completato una raccolta fondi da 389 milioni di dollari, destinando quasi tutti i proventi all’acquisto di Ethereum. Analisti puntano a 5.241 $, o più Gli indicatori tecnici suggeriscono che il rally di Ethereum abbia ancora margine. L’analista crypto Ali Martinez cita le MVRV pricing bands , indicando un possibile movimento verso 5.241 $. Nel frattempo, il trader Yashasedu ritiene che, se Bitcoin raggiungesse i 150.000 $, Ethereum potrebbe superare gli 8.500 $, in base ai rapporti storici di capitalizzazione di mercato. I dati on-chain di Santiment mostrano che i trader retail stanno vendendo durante il rally, uno schema che storicamente ha preceduto ulteriori rialzi di prezzo. Le tesorerie aziendali, invece, stanno accumulando in modo aggressivo, creando una resistenza minima per una rottura verso nuovi massimi. Ethereum (ETH) domina sulle altcoin Mentre altre importanti altcoin come Solana, Cardano e Chainlink hanno registrato forti rialzi, gli analisti notano che questo ciclo è più una “stagione di Ethereum” che una vera e propria stagione altcoin. Benjamin Cowen sottolinea che le altcoin escluse ETH e BTC (indice TOTAL3) sono scese del 50% rispetto a Ethereum da aprile, segnalando la sua crescente dominanza. I fondamentali di Ethereum restano solidi, con il valore totale bloccato (TVL) che ha superato i 90 miliardi di dollari, il livello più alto dal 2022. Anche l’attività nel mercato dei derivati si sta surriscaldando, con un open interest a 12,1 miliardi di dollari, il più alto da marzo 2024. Se il momentum dovesse continuare, una rottura sopra i 4.750 $ potrebbe spingere ETH verso i 5.000 $ e oltre, consolidando la sua posizione come preferito dagli istituzionali insieme a Bitcoin .",Uncategorized|Ethereum,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|ALTCOIN|BTC|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-14 15:13:16

He says Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) play a comparable, transitional role now: legally familiar wrappers that hold the off-ledger asset (treasuries, real estate, credit) while issuing a tokenized representation on a network. The model is “clunky” and centralized, he acknowledges, but useful as infrastructure, standards and policy mature. It is, in his words, “ scaffolding ,” not the end state. The “endgame,” Infanger contends, is native issuance — assets “born digital,” where the token is the legal instrument, compliance is enforced by code, settlement is atomic, and liquidity is composable across venues rather than trapped in wrappers and intermediaries. Why Infanger says XRPL stands out Infanger’s case for XRPL centers on protocol-level capabilities intended for financial use from the outset, which he argues reduce integration work and operational risk for institutions moving from SPVs toward native issuance: On-ledger exchange (built-in DEX): XRPL includes a native order-book exchange, allowing issued tokens to trade directly on the ledger without external smart-contract routers. For tokenized RWAs, that can mean immediate listing and peer-to-peer execution with fewer moving parts. Near-instant, low-cost settlement: The ledger’s consensus design targets fast finality and minimal transaction fees, a combination Infanger says is critical for high-volume instruments (for example, tokenized T-bills or invoices) where carry, fees and operational latency matter. XLS-30 automated market maker (AMM): This standard introduces on-ledger liquidity pools that algorithmically set prices based on inventory, so tokens can trade even when a matching order isn’t present. For RWA markets that need continuous two-way prices—rather than episodic RFQs—on-ledger AMMs can help stabilize liquidity. XLS-65 lending vaults: A proposed standard for protocol-level borrowing and lending. Instead of building bespoke smart contracts, issuers could enable secured credit (for example, borrowing against a tokenized note or real-estate claim) with rules defined at the standard level, aiding auditability and risk controls. Programmable compliance and custody hooks: Because issuance, exchange, and settlement live in the base protocol, Infanger argues that rule sets (whitelists, transfer restrictions, disclosures) and custody workflows can be embedded directly into asset lifecycles—supporting regulatory alignment as volumes scale. Composability: With exchange, liquidity, lending and issuance primitives designed to interoperate, tokens can move through primary issuance, secondary trading, collateralization and settlement without stitching together multiple external systems. Infanger says that’s the path to “embedded” liquidity rather than fragmented silos. Early signs of native issuance To illustrate the direction of travel, Infanger cites a pilot by Ctrl Alt with Dubai’s land regulator to mint property ownership records on XRPL. By recording titles natively, the scheme aims to streamline transfers, improve auditability and embed supervisory visibility. Ctrl Alt also plans to integrate Ripple Custody for secure storage of tokenized deeds—an example of how ledger-level functionality and institutional-grade custody can be paired in production. Why SPVs aren’t going away — yet Infanger cautions against writing off SPVs. They remain the pragmatic path for institutions that must operate under current law, satisfy auditors and test operational readiness. But, he argues, immobilization in the 1970s paved the way for full dematerialization; likewise, SPVs can onboard capital and inform policy while the industry builds toward assets that are “born digital,” with compliance and settlement embedded at the protocol layer. The pitch to institutions The message to banks, asset managers and treasurers is incremental rather than revolutionary: use SPVs where needed today, but design with native issuance in mind. Infanger’s bet is that a public, finance-oriented ledger with built-in exchange, liquidity and credit standards will shorten that path — reducing bespoke code, simplifying controls and making on-ledger assets behave more like mainstream financial instruments at scale.",Tech|Tokenization|Ripple|XRP Ledger|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|WALLET|EXCHANGE|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-14 15:14:42

This development comes at a pivotal time, as the tech giant faces heightened Antitrust Scrutiny regarding its market dominance in travel discovery. For those deeply invested in the rapid advancements of technology and its impact on various industries, understanding Google’s strategic play in integrating Google AI into its core services is crucial. Google AI : Revolutionizing Travel Search with Natural Language Google’s latest innovation, dubbed ‘Flight Deals,’ is now available within Google Flights, leveraging advanced Google AI models to transform how users search for travel. This tool is specifically tailored for ‘flexible travelers’ who prioritize cost-effectiveness over rigid schedules. Instead of traditional keyword-based searches, users can now input natural language queries, articulating their travel desires in a conversational manner. Imagine typing a query like, ‘week-long trip this winter to a city with great food, nonstop only’ or ’10-day ski trip to a world-class resort with fresh powder.’ The AI then processes these nuanced requests, sifting through live Google Flights data to present highly relevant and often cheaper options. The core benefit here is the enhanced user experience. By understanding context and intent, the AI significantly reduces the effort required to pinpoint suitable travel arrangements. This marks a notable shift from conventional search methodologies, promising a more intuitive and personalized travel planning journey. While Google has not yet disclosed which specific Gemini models power this tool, or the exact data sources utilized, the underlying principle is clear: to make travel planning as seamless and efficient as possible through intelligent automation. Navigating Antitrust Scrutiny : Regulatory Hurdles and Strategic Responses Google’s timing for this launch is particularly interesting, given the ongoing regulatory investigations into its market practices. Authorities, including the European Commission, are scrutinizing whether Google’s dominance in search, particularly its promotion of proprietary products like Google Flights, stifles competition. The European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) aims to curb the power of major tech platforms, and Google is reportedly planning to propose changes to appease these regulators. One such proposed change includes the addition of a price-comparison box directly within search results, which could potentially offer more visibility to third-party travel providers. This move highlights the delicate balance Google must maintain: innovating to improve user experience while also addressing concerns about fair competition. The introduction of the new Flight Deals tool, while beneficial for consumers, inevitably adds another layer to this complex regulatory narrative, as it further embeds Google’s own offerings into the travel discovery process. The Competitive Landscape for Travel Tech : Google’s Late Entry? In the broader context of the Travel Tech industry, Google’s entry into AI-powered travel planning is not entirely groundbreaking. Several competitors have already integrated similar AI capabilities into their platforms. Giants like Booking.com and Expedia, along with regional players such as Indian travel aggregator MakeMyTrip, have been leveraging AI to streamline trip planning for some time. This suggests that while Google possesses immense scale and reach, it might be arriving somewhat late to this particular AI party. However, Google’s late arrival does not necessarily diminish its potential impact. With its vast user base and deep integration across various services, if the ‘Flight Deals’ tool proves effective and gains traction, it could still pose a formidable challenge to existing players. The beta release of the tool in the U.S., Canada, and India is a strategic move to gather feedback and refine the AI’s capabilities, indicating a methodical approach to capturing market share in this evolving sector. The Power of Generative AI in Travel: Broader Implications The introduction of AI-powered Flight Deals is part of Google’s larger strategy to integrate Generative AI across its product ecosystem. This initiative positions Google directly in competition with other major AI players like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity. The race to embed generative AI into everyday applications, from search to content creation, is intensifying, and travel planning is a natural fit for this technology’s ability to process complex queries and generate relevant solutions. While the immediate focus is on flight deals, the implications of this AI integration extend far beyond. It signals a future where travel planning could become entirely conversational, with AI assistants handling everything from itinerary creation to booking accommodations and activities. However, as with any advanced AI deployment, questions regarding data sources, privacy safeguards, and the ethical implications of AI-driven recommendations remain pertinent. Google’s current silence on these specific details for ‘Flight Deals’ leaves room for further discussion and scrutiny from privacy advocates and users alike. Challenges and Future Outlook for Google Flights Despite the new AI capabilities, Google has assured users that the classic Google Flights interface, launched in 2011, will continue to operate. In fact, it’s receiving an update that allows users to exclude basic economy fares for trips within the U.S. and Canada, catering to those who prefer a more traditional search experience or specific fare options. This dual approach indicates Google’s understanding that while AI offers new avenues, a significant portion of its user base still values the established interface. The success of the new Flight Deals tool will hinge on its ability to consistently deliver accurate, cost-effective, and truly personalized results. As competition heats up and regulatory pressures persist, Google’s ability to innovate responsibly while maintaining user trust will be paramount. This new AI feature represents a significant step in Google’s ongoing evolution, aiming to redefine convenience in travel planning while navigating a complex landscape of competition and oversight.

She questioned Secretary Bessent if the Treasury was looking at revaluing these holdings.Bessent: US Government Will Not be Revaluing Its Gold Nor Buying BitcoinBessent responded by noting that the government maintains a large gold reserve, which they might not be revaluing. He emphasized that the gold would remain in place as a store of value for the American people. Treasury Secretary Bessent on FOX Business Treasury Secretary Bessent on FOX Business The Treasury Secretary then switched to digital assets, noting that the administration has moved to modernize its holdings by establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve . He explained that the government has funded the reserve through seized assets.According to Bessent, the reserve is worth between $15 billion and $20 billion at current prices. However, he revealed that the administration has no plans to buy more Bitcoin, reiterating that it will continue to grow the reserve only through confiscated assets. Data from Arkham shows the US government holds 198,022 BTC worth $24.34 billion.Bessent also confirmed that the government has no plans to sell any of the assets already in the reserve. Recall that in March, White House Crypto Czar David Sacks noted that the previous administration lost around $17 billion by selling some of its Bitcoin holdings.Meanwhile, Bessent further explained that each of these initiatives, whether related to gold or Bitcoin, would require legislative action to formalize. He said the administration would pursue statutory measures to create a dedicated fund to manage these assets responsibly for future generations. Bessent added that President Trump wants people to remember him as the leader who built national wealth through asset accumulation rather than increasing debt.Treasury Secretary Bessent's Comments Contrast Previous RemarksNotably, this stance on halting Bitcoin purchases contrasts with previous remarks made by Bo Hines, former Executive Director of the US President's Council of Advisers on Digital Assets. Hines had repeatedly indicated that discussions were underway with the Treasury and other agencies to explore budget-neutral ways to acquire additional Bitcoin.Hines' comments came after President Trump signed an executive order on March 6, 2025, creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a United States Digital Asset Stockpile, which received initial funding from existing BTC holdings.The order classified Bitcoin as a reserve asset similar to gold, prohibited the sale of reserve holdings, and directed Treasury and Commerce to seek cost-free acquisition methods for more Bitcoin.Following the order, Hines had floated the idea of re-evaluating gold certificates and using the resulting gains to purchase additional Bitcoin. He also suggested in March that the US wants to accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible, much like gold.Bessent's latest remarks have now placed doubt on those ambitions. Shortly after his remarks, Bitcoin, which had recently been reaching record highs, fell sharply. Within minutes, the price dropped below $120,000, and it is currently trading at $119,090, marking a 3.51% decline for the day.",Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|FIAT|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-08-14 15:24:58

Imagine AI models so compact they can power your smart devices without an internet connection, offering unparalleled privacy and efficiency. This isn’t science fiction; it’s the reality unveiled by Multiverse, promising a future where powerful AI resides directly in your pocket or home appliance. What is Multiverse Computing and Their Breakthrough? Multiverse Computing , a buzzy European AI startup headquartered in Donostia, Spain, has garnered significant attention for its innovative approach to AI. Co-founded by quantum computing and physics experts Román Orús and Samuel Mugel, alongside former banking executive Enrique Lizaso Olmos, the company has quickly established itself as a leader in AI model compression. Their secret sauce? A proprietary technology called “CompactifAI.” This isn’t just any compression. As Orús explains, “We have a compression technology that is not the typical compression technology that the people from computer science or machine learning will do, because we come from quantum physics. It’s a more subtle and more refined compression algorithm.” This quantum-inspired compression is what allows Multiverse to drastically reduce the size of existing AI models without sacrificing their performance. Having recently raised €189 million (about $215 million), bringing their total funding to around $250 million since 2019, Multiverse is well-positioned to bring this technology to the masses. Meet the “Model Zoo”: SuperFly and ChickBrain Multiverse Computing is not just talking the talk; they’re walking the walk with their new family of incredibly small, yet powerful, AI models. Playfully named the “Model Zoo” due to their animal brain-inspired sizing, these models are designed to bring advanced AI capabilities to the smallest of devices. Let’s meet the stars of the show: SuperFly: This model is a compressed version of Hugging Face’s open-source model SmolLM2 135. While the original has 135 million parameters, SuperFly shrinks it down to a mere 94 million parameters. Orús likens its size to a fly’s brain, albeit a “little bit more clever.” SuperFly is specifically designed for highly restricted data environments, making it ideal for embedding into home appliances. Imagine telling your washing machine, “start quick wash,” and having it respond instantly, all powered by SuperFly. ChickBrain: Larger and more capable than SuperFly, ChickBrain boasts 3.2 billion parameters. It’s a compressed version of Meta’s Llama 3.1 8B model. What’s truly remarkable is that despite its power, ChickBrain is small enough to run locally on a MacBook, completely offline. Even more impressively, Multiverse claims ChickBrain slightly outperforms the original Llama 3.1 8B in several standard benchmarks, including language skills (MMLU-Pro), math skills (Math 500, GSM8K), and general knowledge (GPQA Diamond). ChickBrain Performance Benchmarks (Internal Tests): While Multiverse isn’t claiming its models will top leaderboards against the largest state-of-the-art models, the achievement lies in maintaining or even slightly improving performance while significantly reducing size. Here’s a snapshot of ChickBrain’s internal benchmark results: Benchmark Original Llama 3.1 8B Score ChickBrain Score MMLU-Pro (Language) X.XX Y.YY (slightly higher) Math 500 (Math) A.AA B.BB (slightly higher) GSM8K (Math) C.CC D.DD (slightly higher) GPQA Diamond (General Knowledge) E.EE F.FF (slightly higher) (Note: Specific numerical scores for the original Llama 3.1 8B were not provided in the source text, hence placeholders. The key takeaway is ChickBrain’s comparative performance.) The Power of Tiny AI: Enabling On-Device AI Everywhere The implications of such compact yet powerful tiny AI models are vast. The primary goal is to embed AI capabilities directly into Internet of Things (IoT) devices, smartphones, tablets, and PCs. This paradigm shift from cloud-dependent AI to on-device AI offers several compelling advantages: Offline Functionality: Devices can operate and respond to AI commands without an internet connection, crucial for reliability and accessibility in various environments. Enhanced Privacy: Data processing occurs locally on the device, significantly reducing the need to send sensitive information to cloud servers, thereby bolstering user privacy. Reduced Latency: Instantaneous responses are possible as there’s no network delay involved in sending queries to the cloud and receiving replies. Lower Costs: Reduced reliance on cloud infrastructure can lead to lower operational costs for manufacturers and potentially lower data usage for consumers. Multiverse envisions a future where everyday appliances, from washing machines to smartwatches, are infused with conversational AI, making them more intuitive and user-friendly. This local processing power is a game-changer for smart homes and personal electronics. Strategic Partnerships and the Promise of Quantum-Inspired AI Multiverse Computing’s innovative approach has not gone unnoticed by industry giants. Orús confirms that the company is actively in discussions with leading device and appliance manufacturers, including Apple, Samsung, Sony, and HP. Notably, HP Tech Ventures and Toshiba were among the investors in their latest funding round, which was led by the well-known European VC firm Bullhound Capital. The core of Multiverse’s success lies in its unique quantum-inspired AI compression algorithm, CompactifAI. This technology is not limited to large language models; it also applies to other forms of machine learning, such as image recognition. Over its six-year history, Multiverse has secured an impressive client roster including BASF, Ally, Moody’s, and Bosch, showcasing the broad applicability and trust in their technology. Beyond direct sales to manufacturers, Multiverse is democratizing access to its compressed models through an API hosted on AWS, allowing any developer to integrate these efficient AI capabilities into their applications, often at lower token fees than competitors. This strategy fosters wider adoption and innovation across the developer community. The Future is Small: A Compelling Conclusion Multiverse Computing’s introduction of SuperFly and ChickBrain marks a significant milestone in the evolution of artificial intelligence. By successfully creating the world’s smallest high-performing AI models , they are paving the way for a new era of ubiquitous, private, and efficient AI. The ability to run sophisticated chat, speech, and even reasoning capabilities directly on devices without an internet connection is a transformative step for IoT, consumer electronics, and data privacy. This quantum-inspired breakthrough by Multiverse Computing demonstrates that bigger isn’t always better in the world of AI. Their focus on making powerful AI accessible and embeddable is poised to revolutionize how we interact with technology, bringing intelligent capabilities to every corner of our lives, one tiny model at a time.

Markets were jittery, and parts of the crypto futures market saw forced liquidations during the sell-off. Treasury Rules Out New Buys According to reports, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business the government will not be buying additional Bitcoin for the reserve and that future additions will come from confiscated assets. “We’re not going to be buying that,” he said, and he added the Treasury would “stop selling” holdings it already controls. Bessent estimated the reserve’s current value at somewhere between $15 billion and $20 billion. The comments stand in relief to an earlier move by US President Donald Trump, who issued an executive order asking for budget-neutral plans to grow strategic Bitcoin holdings.

Trading platforms recorded a wave of liquidations estimated at roughly $450 million around the same time. Traders said the sudden shift was driven by the clarity in policy — investors had been pricing a possible government buyback program into earlier optimism, and that expectation faded after Bessent’s remarks. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview with Fox, “We are not going to be buying,” referring to crypto reserves, and will instead use seized assets.

Bessent suggested annual tariff receipts could top a previous projection of $300 billion, a figure he said could help fund other asset strategies. The timing of his comments also came as US data showed the Producer Price Index rising 3.3% year-on-year and 0.9% month-on-month for July, numbers that add to the broader economic backdrop investors are watching. Related Reading: Dogecoin Draws New Attention As Open Interest Tops $3 Billion Confiscated Assets Versus Direct Purchases The Treasury secretary’s note that confiscated assets will be used to grow the reserve shifts the funding model away from direct Treasury buys. For now, that means any further increase in the reserve would be gradual and dependent on law enforcement recoveries rather than market purchases. Market participants said that stance removes a clear, predictable buyer from the market, which can make price swings larger over short windows — exactly what traders saw on Thursday.

Here’s What Bitcoin NUPL Metric Says,https://cryptopotato.com/is-the-bull-cycle-nearing-its-top-heres-what-bitcoin-nupl-metric-says/,"The current bull cycle is different from past seasons in many ways. For starters, bitcoin (BTC) has recorded new all-time highs (ATH) every now and then. This has raised speculation about when the market will reach its peak and begin a bear run. An analyst at the market research firm CryptoQuant has predicted that the bull run may last longer, but with a catch. This prediction stems from data derived from the Bitcoin Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric, which measures the overall profit or loss status of BTC investors. Is The Market Near a Top? According to Yonsei Dent, an NUPL value above 0 indicates that more bitcoins are in profit than in loss. The more the value climbs, the stronger the incentive for investors to take profit, leading to increased selling pressure. Past bull cycle tops have coincided with peaks in the NUPL. CryptoQuant found that the metric hit one peak throughout the 2017 bull run; that figure doubled in the 2021 cycle. However, the current cycle has not come to an end, but the NUPL has already hit two peaks. Yonsei said the indicator is attempting a third peak, with BTC at its current price of $120,000. The analyst noted that, unlike past cycles, this bull market is moving in “stepwise waves.” This shift in momentum can be linked to the increasing inflow of institutional capital from corporate BTC acquisitions and United States spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Although the rising institutional participation has increased the market size and liquidity and improved stability, the percentage of profit during each rally is gradually declining. Therefore, the bull market may last longer than previous cycles, but with lesser gains for investors. Yonsei insists that the chances of the market seeing sharp, short-term overheated rallies during the rest of the cycle could be lower. NUPL Stays Above 0 Currently, the NUPL remains above 0, indicating that bitcoin’s market price is higher than the average price at which investors, especially short-term holders, purchased their assets. This increases the chances of increased selling pressure when prices climb higher. Meanwhile, profit-taking among long-term Bitcoin holders has slowed down from a high trend witnessed weeks ago. On-chain analytics firm Glassnode recently disclosed that the seven-day moving average of long-term holder realized profits has fallen from the $1 billion per day seen in July.

Crypto World Draws Towards Latest 100x Altcoin Coldware,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/missed-ethereum-rally-crypto-world-draws-towards-latest-100x-altcoin-coldware/,"Ethereum (ETH) has surged in recent weeks, boosted by Pantera Capital’s $300 million bet on Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) such as BitMine, which now holds 1.2M ETH worth $5.3B. While institutional moves like this are fueling Ethereum’s climb, retail investors who missed the rally are searching for the next 100x altcoin — and many believe they’ve found it in Coldware (COLD) . Coldware (COLD): Where Hardware Meets Web3 Utility Coldware (COLD) isn’t another Layer-1 blockchain chasing the same DeFi playbook. It’s the only presale project combining token ownership with real-world hardware infrastructure, including the Larna 2400 Web3 smartphone and ColdBook laptop. These encrypted devices act as blockchain nodes, enabling always-on staking, secure DeFi access, and decentralized messaging without third-party apps. As of August 2025, Coldware (COLD) has raised $7.7M+ in its presale , selling over 1.3Bn tokens at the current price of $0.008. With a launch price set at $0.4, early backers are eyeing a potential 3,924% upside. Less than 27% of Stage 3 tokens remain, and buyers using the code 50FLASH get 50% bonus tokens. Ethereum’s Rally vs. Coldware’s Growth Curve Ethereum’s gains this year are undeniable — but for smaller investors, the math is different. Doubling ETH from $3,500 to $7,000 is significant, but not the life-changing ROI that early-stage presales can deliver. Coldware’s growth potential is amplified by: A hardware-native blockchain model Direct consumer adoption via devices Built-in token demand from node operations Ethereum’s institutional tailwinds show that Web3 infrastructure plays attract big money. Coldware (COLD) ’s difference? It’s offering retail investors an early seat at the table before the launch surge. Why COLD Could Ride the Next Institutional Wave If Pantera’s DAT strategy proves right, the next phase of capital inflow will look for projects that generate yield, secure networks, and provide tangible user benefits. Coldware ticks all three boxes: staking rewards, node operation through hardware, and built-in privacy tools. Conclusion Ethereum’s rally proves the market is alive, but Coldware (COLD) offers the asymmetric upside ETH no longer can. For investors seeking triple-digit gains in the next bull run, Coldware’s presale is positioning itself as the 100x altcoin to watch.

Speaking to Fox Business, Michael Saylor said that Wall Street is underestimating Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Referring to the long-term profitability of Bitcoin, Saylor pointed out that BTC provides an average annual return of over 50 percent, far exceeding traditional investment instruments. “Bitcoin is an asset to hold for the long term and has averaged over 50% annualized returns over the long term to date.” Saylor also argues that a Bitcoin strategy will always be profitable. To this point, Saylor claimed that companies that invest a portion of their cash reserves in Bitcoin and adopt the “Bitcoin standard” could outperform the S&P 500 by up to 40% annually. In contrast, Saylor said that the returns of companies relying on traditional assets like Treasury bonds are declining daily and could decline by about 10% each year. Big bull Saylor added that he believes this approach will increasingly become the new norm in institutional capital management as more companies adopt the “Bitcoin standard.” Stating that Wall Street will be late in understanding Bitcoin, Saylor concluded his words as follows. “It will take a long time for Wall Street to fully grasp the potential of digital capital and the Bitcoin ecosystem.

We just witnessed an unprecedented event: a staggering $429 million in crypto futures liquidation occurred in just one hour. This rapid unwind highlights significant market movements and the inherent risks of leveraged positions. Over the past 24 hours, the total sum of futures liquidations reached an astounding $905 million, painting a clear picture of intense crypto market volatility . Understanding Crypto Futures Liquidation: What Just Happened? When we talk about crypto futures liquidation , we are referring to the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position due to insufficient margin to cover potential losses. Essentially, if the market moves sharply against a highly leveraged trade, exchanges automatically close the position to prevent further losses for both the trader and the exchange. In the last hour, major exchanges processed $429 million in liquidations. The 24-hour total climbed to $905 million. These figures represent a significant number of traders losing their capital on highly leveraged bets. Why Such Massive Futures Liquidations? Massive liquidations typically occur during periods of extreme price swings, often triggered by unexpected news, large institutional moves, or a cascade effect. When the price of an asset moves quickly and significantly in one direction, it triggers margin calls for traders on the wrong side of the move. Those who cannot add more collateral face automatic liquidation. This recent event underscores the heightened crypto market volatility we’ve been experiencing. Traders using high leverage amplify both potential gains and losses. A small price movement can lead to substantial losses, especially when employing aggressive leveraged trading strategies. The Impact of Leveraged Trading on Market Stability Leveraged trading allows traders to control large positions with a relatively small amount of capital. While this can lead to amplified profits, it also dramatically increases risk. When a large number of leveraged positions are open, a sudden price drop can create a domino effect, leading to a cascade of liquidations that further push prices down, sometimes contributing to a broader crypto market crash . For individual traders, liquidations mean losing their initial margin and potentially more, depending on the specifics of their position and the exchange’s policies. For the market, it can signal a period of uncertainty and deleveraging. Navigating Crypto Market Volatility: Actionable Insights How can traders protect themselves in such volatile conditions? Risk management is paramount. Understanding the mechanics of futures liquidations is the first step. Manage Leverage Wisely: Avoid excessively high leverage, especially during periods of high market uncertainty. Set Stop-Loss Orders: These can help limit potential losses by automatically closing a position at a predetermined price. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your capital into highly speculative or leveraged trades. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news and sentiment. Unexpected events often trigger sharp price movements. Understand Margin Requirements: Always know your liquidation price and ensure you have sufficient margin. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto? While a crypto market crash of this magnitude in terms of liquidations is concerning, it is also a stark reminder of the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets. These events often clear out excessive leverage from the system, potentially paving the way for more stable growth in the long run. However, they also serve as a crucial lesson for traders about the importance of prudent risk management in the fast-paced world of digital assets. In conclusion, the recent $429 million in crypto futures liquidation within an hour, part of a larger $905 million over 24 hours, underscores the extreme crypto market volatility . It serves as a powerful reminder of the risks associated with leveraged trading and the potential for rapid unwinds. While challenging for those affected, such events are integral to the market’s natural cycles, prompting a renewed focus on careful strategy and risk mitigation for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is crypto futures liquidation? Crypto futures liquidation is the automatic closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange. This occurs when the market moves against their trade to a point where their initial margin can no longer cover potential losses, preventing negative balances. Why do large futures liquidations occur? Large liquidations are typically triggered by significant and rapid price movements in the market. When prices swing unexpectedly, especially due to high crypto market volatility , many leveraged positions on the wrong side of the trade can be forced closed simultaneously. How does leverage impact liquidations? Leverage amplifies both potential profits and losses. Higher leverage means a smaller price movement can lead to a liquidation. For example, with 100x leverage, a 1% price move against your position could lead to liquidation. What are the risks of crypto futures trading? The primary risks include rapid capital loss due to high leverage, the potential for a cascading crypto market crash during extreme volatility, and the complexity of managing margin requirements. It’s not suitable for all investors. How can traders protect themselves from liquidations? Traders can protect themselves by using lower leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders, understanding their liquidation price, maintaining sufficient margin, and diversifying their portfolio to avoid overexposure to a single asset or leveraged position.

Accompanying SMQKE’s tweet is a clip from eToro’s Conversation With Leaders interview series. The interview provided insight into Garlinghouse’s perspective on the role of ETFs in driving institutional adoption of XRP and the broader cryptocurrency market. Garlinghouse on the Transition to Institutional Adoption During the interview, a market analyst noted the recent influx of XRP ETF filings both in and outside of the United States, asking Garlinghouse for his view on the matter. Garlinghouse responded by linking ETF developments to a broader transition from speculative retail participation to increased institutional involvement. He pointed to the approval of Bitcoin ETFs as a pivotal moment for the digital asset market, noting that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was “dragged kicking and screaming” toward that decision. He described the approval as a monumental event in expanding opportunities for institutional investors to enter the crypto market. Garlinghouse emphasized that the introduction of an XRP ETF is not a matter of speculation but inevitability. According to him, such a development would allow greater participation from those who may be unwilling to directly custody digital assets. This includes investors deterred by the complexities of private key management and other operational considerations. Brad Garlinghouse: “XRP ETFs represent the transition from speculative retail trading to institutional adoption.” This is precisely why XRP ETFs are essential. ETFs will be “approved and trading SOON.” Listen. https://t.co/KbInec6y5W pic.twitter.com/KNLufoPeld — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 13, 2025 Multiple Filings in the U.S. and Europe The Ripple CEO stated that there are currently four or five XRP ETF filings in the United States and at least one in Europe. He described these filings as unsurprising, given the growing recognition of XRP’s role in global payments and its established market presence. Garlinghouse expressed optimism that approvals would happen soon and that trading could commence shortly thereafter, allowing broader access to XRP exposure for both institutional and retail investors through regulated investment vehicles. His comments indicated that the move toward ETF approval is already well underway, suggesting that it is not merely theoretical but a process with active applications being considered by regulatory bodies in multiple jurisdictions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Broader Implications for the Crypto Market While Garlinghouse acknowledged the significance of an XRP ETF for the asset itself, he also framed the development as a positive signal for the cryptocurrency sector as a whole. He argued that such products increase market legitimacy, provide easier entry points for traditional investors, and help bridge the gap between conventional finance and digital assets. The CEO reiterated that the benefits of ETF availability extend beyond XRP, contributing to a more mature and accessible market environment. SMQKE’s decision to highlight these remarks underscores the importance that many in the digital asset community place on institutional-grade investment products for mainstream adoption. If Garlinghouse’s projections hold, XRP could soon join Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in having ETF options, marking another milestone in the evolution of digital asset investment infrastructure.

(Ethereum Price Analysis),https://cryptopotato.com/was-this-eths-final-shakeout-before-surge-to-new-ath-ethereum-price-analysis/,"It appears the moment has finally arrived. Ethereum is closing in on a new all-time high after nearly four years. With this momentum, many investors are eyeing the $5,000 mark as a realistic target in the weeks ahead. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart On the daily chart, it’s clear that since ETH’s rebound from the 100-day moving average near the $2,100 mark in June, the price has been on a steady upward trajectory. Now, Ethereum is rallying almost vertically, closing in on a new all-time high. With the current momentum, even the $5,000 psychological level appears within reach. Furthermore, the $4,000 level can now be seen as a strong support zone, adding to the confidence of bullish traders. That said, momentum indicators such as the RSI are signaling a potential overbought condition, suggesting the possibility of a consolidation or pullback before ETH can push higher. However, the recent bullish crossover between the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, with the 100-day MA rising sharply in line with price action, indicates strong market optimism. This setup suggests that any pullback could be temporary, keeping the broader uptrend intact. The 4-Hour Chart Looking at the 4-hour chart, ETH has been consistently moving within a broad ascending channel for the past few months. This formation has carried the asset through several resistance zones, all of which have now flipped into support. With the channel’s upper boundary already sitting above the previous $4,800 all-time high, the path toward testing the $5,000 level in the near term appears clear. On the flip side, the RSI indicator on this timeframe is clearly in overbought territory, similar to the daily chart, and the recent 4-hour candles have been shrinking in size. As a result, some analysts anticipate a pullback soon. Still, given the strong market structure and momentum, a sharp breakout beyond the $4,800 all-time high seems more likely to play out before any notable correction sets in. Sentiment Analysis Exchange Reserve The chart shows Ethereum’s price movement alongside its exchange reserve across all exchanges. Over the last two years, exchange reserves have been in a consistent downtrend, dropping from above 28 million ETH in early 2022 to around 18.6 million today. This significant decline suggests that a large portion of ETH has been moving off exchanges, likely into cold storage or staking. Historically, such supply reduction on exchanges tends to tighten available liquidity, creating favorable conditions for upward price pressure, especially during strong bullish phases. The recent surge to around $4,700, just shy of the $4,800 all-time high, aligns with this supply squeeze narrative. If the decline in exchange reserves continues, ETH will likely rally even higher in the coming months. The post Was This ETH’s Final Shakeout Before Surge to New ATH?

While the crypto market celebrates this historic milestone, analysts and institutional players are already hunting for the next asymmetric opportunity. And increasingly, that conversation is starting to include MAGACOIN FINANCE —a small-cap token with outsized upside potential heading into 2026. Bitcoin Surges Past $124K as Macro Conditions Align Bitcoin’s latest rally leg was the result of macroeconomic tailwinds and on-chain strength. Lower-than-expected U.S. CPI data (July inflation reading at just 2.7%) has reignited expectations for future Federal Reserve rate cuts. This dovish outlook, characterised by the lack of aggressiveness in monetary policy tightening, has increased demand for rare digital assets, and the Bitcoin price has reached its peak. Whale wallets are also playing their part. The number of addresses holding over 100 BTC reached an all-time high this week, signaling deep-pocketed confidence in long-term price growth. Another catalyst has been ETFs. BlackRock, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton’s Bitcoin ETFs saw a record inflow of over $1.2 billion in the last 72 hours. Ethereum Holding Firm as Bulls Target $5K The price of Ethereum (ETH) is holding strong at USD 4,600 as bullish pressure increases due to the ETF. BlackRock’s ETHA fund raked in over $300M in inflows while several staking innovations have gained traction, with ETH bulls eyeing the $5000 target. Upcoming upgrades are likely to cut gas fees and improve the scalability in the Ethereum ecosystem. Once institutional capital rotates into Layer-1s other than Bitcoin, Ethereum will be one of the main ones for capital allocation. XRP Recovery Gathers Pace After SEC Clarity Ripple’s XRP token is recovering after the conclusion of its case with the SEC, currently priced above $3.15. As USA exchanges make XRP available again after legal clarity was restored, investors are betting on a price run that ends in Q4. Thanks to whale movements and the adoption of global payments, many analysts now think that a move to $4.20 is on the cards. XRP has been identified as a utility altcoin for a second time, and one that can make a run for the top five by market cap. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Analysts’ Favorite for Pre-2026 ROI Analysts forecast MAGACOIN FINANCE could hit a 25x ROI before the next altseason peak , as rising whale accumulation and cross-chain investor interest fuel momentum ahead of key market catalysts. With a scarcity-driven supply model, expanding community presence, and growing attention from institutional players, the project is building a strong foundation for accelerated growth. As liquidity rotates into high-upside altcoins ahead of the next market leg, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a prime target for early movers seeking substantial returns. Final Thoughts While bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, the most significant returns in crypto are still found in an uplifted market, which is not in bitcoin itself. With intelligent positioning of funds and the buildup of optimistic catalysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE is, without a doubt, one of the most excellent altcoin prospects for 2026.

50085299,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=189489,1755185710,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/50085299.jpeg,Alarming PPI Rise: US Inflationary Pressures Mount Unexpectedly,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ppi-rise-us-inflation/,"BitcoinWorld Alarming PPI Rise: US Inflationary Pressures Mount Unexpectedly The financial world recently experienced a significant jolt. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed an alarming PPI rise for July, far exceeding initial forecasts. This unexpected surge immediately raised eyebrows and amplified concerns about escalating US inflation . What Does the Surprising PPI Rise Mean for You? The Producer Price Index (PPI) tracks changes in selling prices received by domestic producers. Think of it as a key indicator of wholesale inflation. This July, the PPI climbed a surprising 0.9% month-over-month. This figure dramatically surpassed the modest 0.2% forecast, catching many off guard and defying prior market expectations . Even more concerning, the Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, also mirrored this 0.9% increase. This was well above its 0.2% prediction, indicating broad-based price pressures across various sectors. Historically, a significant Producer Price Index increase often foreshadows future consumer price hikes, impacting the Consumer Price Index (CPI) with a delay. Why Did the Producer Price Index Jump So High? Several factors likely contributed to this unexpected jump. Global supply chain disruptions continue to play a role, making it more expensive for producers to source raw materials and components. This persistent challenge directly contributes to the PPI rise . Robust consumer demand in certain sectors might also empower businesses to pass on higher costs. Furthermore, the persistent tightness in the labor market could lead to increased wage costs. Producers then incorporate these costs into their pricing, further fueling the inflationary trend. How Does This Economic Data Impact Markets? Such robust economic data can significantly influence market sentiment. Investors often view higher PPI figures as a precursor to more aggressive monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. This diverges sharply from previous market expectations for a potential pause in rate hikes. Concerns about persistent US inflation could lead to expectations of higher interest rates. These rates can impact asset valuations across the board, including traditional equities and cryptocurrencies. A strong PPI suggests the Fed’s battle against inflation is far from over, potentially leading to continued volatility. Traders and analysts closely watch these numbers. They use this critical economic data to gauge broader economic health and anticipate central bank actions. The Producer Price Index directly feeds into their models for future market movements. Navigating Inflationary Pressures: What’s Next for the Economy? The July PPI rise adds another layer of complexity to the economic outlook. Policymakers will scrutinize this data carefully as they consider future interest rate decisions. This unexpected development challenges earlier market expectations of a smoother path towards disinflation. For consumers, this could translate to higher prices for goods and services in the coming months. Producers will eventually pass on their increased costs, impacting household budgets. For investors, understanding the implications of this economic data is crucial. Diversifying portfolios and considering inflation-hedging assets might become more appealing strategies. The market’s swift reaction to this surprising news highlights its sensitivity to any signs of persistent inflationary trends. Be prepared for continued vigilance from economic observers. Conclusion: The unexpected 0.9% PPI rise in July serves as a stark reminder that inflationary pressures remain a significant challenge for the U.S. economy. This key piece of economic data signals potential future price increases for consumers and will undoubtedly factor into the Federal Reserve’s next steps. Staying informed about these economic indicators is vital for anyone navigating the complex financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Producer Price Index (PPI)? The Producer Price Index (PPI) measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. It reflects wholesale inflation. How does PPI differ from CPI? PPI tracks prices from the perspective of the seller (producers), while the Consumer Price Index (CPI) tracks prices from the perspective of the buyer (consumers). PPI often acts as a leading indicator for CPI. Why is the July PPI rise significant? The July PPI rise was significantly higher than market expectations , indicating stronger-than-anticipated inflationary pressures at the wholesale level, which could soon impact consumer prices. How might the Federal Reserve react to this PPI data? The Federal Reserve closely monitors economic data like PPI. A higher-than-expected PPI could reinforce the need for continued hawkish monetary policy, including potential interest rate hikes, to combat persistent US inflation . What impact could this have on cryptocurrency markets? Higher inflation and potential interest rate hikes can make riskier assets like cryptocurrencies less attractive. Investors might move towards less volatile assets, leading to increased volatility or downward pressure on crypto prices. If you found this analysis insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

Nasdaq-listed VCI Global is making headlines with its bold move into the cryptocurrency space. The company plans a substantial Bitcoin purchase , allocating a considerable portion of funds from a recent convertible bond offering to build a robust Bitcoin treasury. This strategic decision highlights a growing trend among corporations to diversify assets and strengthen long-term capital resilience. What’s Driving VCI Global’s Strategic Bitcoin Purchase? VCI Global, a well-known entity on Nasdaq, announced its intention to raise $51 million through a convertible bond offering . This financial maneuver is designed to provide the company with significant capital. From this impressive sum, a substantial $20 million is earmarked specifically for a Bitcoin purchase . This allocation signals a clear strategic shift, as reported by JinSe Finance. The primary goal behind this move for VCI Global Bitcoin investment is twofold: Fund Diversification: Spreading investments across different asset classes helps mitigate risks associated with traditional financial markets and reduce dependence on a single asset type. Capital Resilience: Holding a portion of assets in Bitcoin aims to enhance the company’s ability to withstand economic fluctuations, preserve value over time, and potentially offer a hedge against inflation. This substantial convertible bond offering provides the necessary capital injection for VCI Global to execute its innovative treasury plan effectively, positioning it for future growth. Understanding the Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption VCI Global is not alone in its embrace of digital assets. We are witnessing a notable surge in corporate Bitcoin adoption across various industries. Leading companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have previously made headlines by adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, demonstrating a growing institutional acceptance. This trend reflects a changing perception of Bitcoin from a purely speculative asset to a legitimate treasury reserve asset. Why are more corporations considering this move? Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s programmatic scarcity and limited supply make it an attractive hedge against inflation, especially in an era of expanding monetary policies. Store of Value: Many financial experts and corporations now view Bitcoin as “digital gold,” a reliable store of value that can appreciate over the long term, offering a non-correlated asset. Technological Advancement: Investing in Bitcoin aligns companies with the cutting edge of financial technology and the evolving digital economy, showcasing innovation. However, it is also important to acknowledge potential challenges, such as price volatility, which can impact short-term valuations, and evolving regulatory uncertainties across different jurisdictions. Companies must weigh these factors carefully before committing to a Bitcoin treasury strategy . How VCI Global’s Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Works Implementing a robust Bitcoin treasury strategy involves more than just buying Bitcoin; it requires a comprehensive approach to managing digital assets within a corporate framework. For companies like VCI Global, this means carefully planning the acquisition, secure custody, and ongoing management of their Bitcoin holdings. They will likely engage with reputable institutional-grade custodians to secure their digital assets, ensuring maximum protection against theft or loss. Beyond security, a successful VCI Global Bitcoin treasury involves understanding the accounting implications and ensuring compliance with financial regulations. This proactive approach helps ensure the long-term safety and accessibility of their Bitcoin holdings, integrating them seamlessly into the company’s overall financial management system. A well-executed Bitcoin treasury strategy can offer significant advantages, potentially enhancing shareholder value and providing a competitive edge in an evolving financial landscape. It represents a forward-thinking approach to capital allocation. What Does This Strategic Investment Mean for VCI Global? VCI Global’s decision to make a significant Bitcoin purchase positions it as a pioneering and forward-thinking company in the traditional finance sector. By diversifying its treasury with Bitcoin, VCI Global aims to strengthen its financial foundation and potentially unlock new growth avenues. This move could inspire other companies, particularly those listed on Nasdaq, to explore similar strategies, further normalizing corporate engagement with cryptocurrencies as legitimate assets. The success of this initiative will naturally depend on various market factors and VCI Global’s meticulous execution of its strategy. Nevertheless, it represents a clear statement of intent regarding their long-term vision and adaptability in a dynamic global economy. The market will be watching closely to see how this strategic investment unfolds and its impact on VCI Global’s financial performance. In conclusion, VCI Global’s plan to allocate $20 million from its $51 million convertible bond offering towards a substantial Bitcoin purchase is a testament to the growing confidence in digital assets. This strategic Bitcoin treasury strategy , driven by the desire for diversification and capital resilience, marks another significant step in the broader trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption . It underscores a progressive approach to financial management, setting a potential precedent for others in the corporate world looking to embrace innovative asset classes.

After Bitcoin’s recent stability above key support levels, traders are now eyeing altcoins for potentially outsized gains in the next cycle. With several macro and regulatory tailwinds converging, many believe this could be the moment that sends digital assets into overdrive. One project already catching the eye of investors is MAGACOIN FINANCE, an emerging altcoin opportunity positioned for explosive growth. Altcoin ETF Approvals Could Unlock Billions in Fresh Capital While Bitcoin and Ethereum have already enjoyed the ETF spotlight, the next phase could see major altcoins getting their turn. Top contenders like XRP, Solana, and Litecoin are reportedly in the running, with analysts noting that approval of just one more altcoin ETF could unleash a wave of institutional money from Wall Street. For many investors, this would mark the formal entrance of blue-chip altcoins into mainstream portfolios, boosting both liquidity and price momentum. New Altcoin Gains Early-Stage Traction In the midst of these developments, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been drawing serious interest from those looking to position themselves before the next major market rally. Growth models suggest a potential 47x return from current levels if adoption trends and investor interest continue at the current pace. With demand outstripping available allocations and community numbers climbing, it’s becoming one of the most closely watched early-stage plays in the altcoin space. A Fed Rate Cut Could Ignite Risk Assets Another huge boost may be Federal Reserve policy. The U.S. Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent has forecasted that we may see a drop in interest rates by 0.5% oin September, so this may add new vigor to both crypto and stock markets. With lower interest rates, investors tend to migrate to assets with higher risk and returns and the crypto industry has traditionally flourished in such times. The inflation numbers (CPI) also were better than expectations and the risk-on rally is increasingly becoming set up. The CLARITY Act Could Reshape the Entire Market The next big thing that may significantly have the implications of the future is the introduction of the CLARITY Act, a broad legislation that is aimed at bringing long-desired regulatory clarity in the digital assets sector. Legislators are aiming to get it approved in late September and should it pass, along with a Fed rate reduction, it will probably unleash one of the most ferocious rallies the market has witnessed in years. Final Take Whether it is an ETF, monetary policy changes, or groundbreaking laws, the scene is ready to make a possibly historic altcoin season. Other big players are being given the spotlight but new opportunities such as MAGACOIN FINANCE could potentially create major returns to those who are well placed early in the game. The months to come may become the most exciting in the history of the crypto market with all the right catalysts in their place.

After holding in the $4.82–$4.85 range and briefly hitting $4.91, the asset faced an aggressive selloff from 06:00 on 14 August, bottoming at $4.53 at 12:00 on heavy volume, signaling potential capitulation. Buyers quickly stepped in, establishing fresh support near $4.60 and restoring confidence in the Cosmos ecosystem. This price level became a key threshold as selling pressure eased and trading stabilized. During the 60-minute recovery window from 13:20 to 14:19 on 14 August, ATOM rose from $4.60 to $4.61, peaking at $4.64 before consolidating in a tight $4.59–$4.62 range. This confirmed $4.60 as a support base, suggesting a potential launch point for future gains. While resilience is evident, resistance at $4.91 remains untested. Holding $4.60 will be crucial for maintaining bullish momentum, with any breakdown risking renewed downside pressure. Technical Indicators Point to Consolidation Price range of $0.42 representing 9% volatility between $4.91 maximum and $4.49 minimum. Volume spike to 5.62 million units, exceeding 24-hour average of 1.33 million by 322%. Resistance level established at $4.91 during early morning hours of 14 August. Support base formation around $4.60 following recovery from $4.53 low. Consolidation pattern between $4.59-$4.62 range indicating potential stabilization.

Stellar now has 9.69 million active wallets, gaining 5,000–6,000 new addresses every day. The price targets after breakout sit at $0.60, $0.72, and $0.77, based on Fibonacci extensions. XLM Builds Strong Base with Classic Chart Pattern Stellar (XLM) was trading at $0.43 at press time, with a 5% drop in the last 24 hours. Over the past 7 days, it’s up by 2.5%. Trading volume has reached $668 million, showing steady interest despite short-term dips. A recent chart posted by crypto analyst Ali Martinez shows an inverse head and shoulders forming on the daily timeframe. This structure has a left shoulder in January, a head around late April, and a right shoulder forming now in August. Inverse head and shoulders on Stellar $XLM . Break $0.50 and $0.77 is next! pic.twitter.com/TcgY4bChWS — Ali (@ali_charts) August 13, 2025 Notably, the neckline sits near $0.50, a level that has drawn attention from traders waiting for a breakout. XLM’s price is trading near $0.45, close to the 0.786 Fibonacci level. The $0.50 mark is acting as a key resistance. A strong move above this point could open the door for further upside. Fibonacci extensions imply that the price may reach $0.60 (1.272), $0.72 (1.618), and $0.77 (1.786). These levels tend to be followed to determine price action following a breakout. Several traders are waiting to see whether the price can close above the neckline, targeting high volume. On-Chain Activity Supports Growing Interest Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto reports that Stellar now has 9.69 million accounts, with 5,000–6,000 new addresses being added daily. This growth reflects steady adoption and increased usage of the network. Source: X While price and chart setups are in focus, network activity often shows how much attention a project is getting. Rising wallet creation can reflect fresh demand, which may play a role in price movement over time. Past Support Still Relevant Last month, analyst Peter Brandt called Stellar one of the more promising charts. He notes that the price needs to stay above the April low, near $0.22, and eventually close above $1 to break out of the broader range. Meanwhile, another voice in the market, @Xfinancebull, pointed out that XLM has already gained over 150% from its earlier lows. He claims this move was predictable based on chart signals and market sentiment at the time. Now, with the price sitting just below $0.50, all eyes are on whether Stellar can clear this level and continue upward.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at approximately $117,907.45 on the Binance USDT market. This sudden shift has caught many investors off guard, prompting questions about the immediate future of the cryptocurrency market . Understanding these movements is key to navigating the often unpredictable world of digital assets. What Triggered This BTC Market Downturn? When Bitcoin experiences a rapid decline, several factors often contribute to the BTC market downturn . While a single definitive cause is rare, a combination of macroeconomic trends, profit-taking by large holders, and shifts in investor sentiment typically play a role. For instance, global economic uncertainties or news related to interest rates can influence investor appetite for riskier assets like Bitcoin. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Broader economic concerns, such as inflation data or central bank policies, can lead investors to de-risk their portfolios, pulling funds from volatile assets. Whale Movements: Large holders, often referred to as “whales,” can significantly impact the market. When these entities decide to sell substantial amounts of Bitcoin, it can create selling pressure and trigger a cascade effect. Technical Resistance: Sometimes, a price level acts as strong resistance. If Bitcoin struggles to break above it, a subsequent pullback can occur as traders take profits. These elements, combined with the inherent nature of the cryptocurrency market , create a dynamic environment where rapid price changes are not uncommon. Navigating Crypto Volatility: What Investors Need to Know The recent dip serves as a stark reminder of the inherent crypto volatility that defines the digital asset space. Unlike traditional markets, cryptocurrencies can experience dramatic swings in value within short periods. This volatility, while presenting risks, also offers opportunities for those who understand how to navigate it. It is crucial for investors to have a clear strategy rather than reacting impulsively to every market fluctuation. Understanding the concept of market cycles is vital. Bear markets, characterized by sustained price declines, are a natural part of any financial market. For Bitcoin, these cycles have historically led to new all-time highs after periods of consolidation or decline. This perspective helps in managing expectations and avoiding panic during a Bitcoin price drop . For many, such a decline might seem alarming. However, experienced traders and long-term investors often view these dips as potential buying opportunities. It is about understanding your risk tolerance and investment goals. What Does This Bitcoin Value Shift Mean for Your Portfolio? A sudden change in Bitcoin value can certainly impact an investor’s portfolio. For those holding Bitcoin directly, the immediate effect is a decrease in the fiat value of their holdings. However, it is important to differentiate between short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. If your investment horizon is long, daily or weekly price movements may be less significant than the overall trajectory of Bitcoin adoption and development. Consider these points: Long-Term Vision: Many Bitcoin proponents believe in its long-term potential as a store of value and a decentralized global currency. Short-term dips are often seen as temporary setbacks in this larger narrative. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This strategy involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price. When the Bitcoin price drop occurs, DCA allows you to buy more Bitcoin for the same amount of money, lowering your average purchase price over time. Portfolio Diversification: While Bitcoin is a significant asset, a well-diversified portfolio helps mitigate risk. Spreading investments across different cryptocurrencies or traditional assets can provide a buffer against the impact of a single asset’s decline. The key is to avoid emotional decisions and stick to a well-researched investment plan, especially during periods of high crypto volatility . Actionable Insights for Cryptocurrency Trading Amidst a Dip When the cryptocurrency market experiences a downturn, it presents unique challenges and opportunities for traders. Successful cryptocurrency trading during such times requires discipline and a clear understanding of market dynamics. It is not about predicting the bottom, but rather about managing risk and making informed decisions. Here are some actionable insights: Reassess Your Risk Tolerance: Before making any moves, evaluate your comfort level with risk. Are you prepared for further declines, or do you need to adjust your positions? Avoid Panic Selling: Selling assets purely out of fear can lead to significant losses, especially if the market recovers shortly after. Always have a strategy for when to sell, and stick to it. Research and Due Diligence: Use this time to research projects you believe in. A market dip can reveal the true strength of a project’s fundamentals. Set Price Alerts: Use exchange features to set alerts for specific price levels. This can help you stay informed without constantly monitoring the charts, allowing you to react strategically to changes in Bitcoin value . Ultimately, a Bitcoin price drop is a test of an investor’s conviction and strategy. By staying informed and disciplined, you can navigate these periods more effectively. In conclusion, the recent Bitcoin price drop below $118,000 highlights the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market . While such movements can be unsettling, they are a normal part of its evolution. Understanding the factors contributing to a BTC market downturn , embracing the reality of crypto volatility , and adopting sound investment strategies like dollar-cost averaging can empower you to make informed decisions. Remember, knowledge and a long-term perspective are your best tools in this exciting, yet unpredictable, financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Why did Bitcoin fall below $118,000? The exact reason for a specific Bitcoin price drop is often multifaceted, involving macroeconomic factors, large-scale profit-taking by institutional investors or whales, and technical market dynamics. It’s usually a combination of these elements influencing the overall BTC market downturn . 2. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Whether it’s a good time to buy depends on your individual investment strategy and risk tolerance. Many long-term investors view significant dips as potential buying opportunities, especially when employing strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA). However, the market remains subject to crypto volatility . 3. What is crypto volatility? Crypto volatility refers to the rapid and often unpredictable price swings that cryptocurrencies experience. This high degree of fluctuation means that the Bitcoin value can change dramatically in short periods, offering both higher potential returns and higher risks compared to traditional assets. 4. How can I protect my investments during a market dip? To protect your investments during a cryptocurrency market dip, consider strategies like portfolio diversification, setting stop-loss orders (if actively trading), and practicing Dollar-Cost Averaging. Avoiding panic selling and focusing on long-term fundamentals rather than short-term fluctuations are also crucial for sound cryptocurrency trading . Did you find this analysis helpful?

This favors a bullish PEPE price prediction that sees the token delivering huge gains in the short term. After hitting a recent low of $479 million on August 6, trading volumes in the spot market for PEPE have been steadily surging and closed yesterday at $1.4 billion, accounting for as much as 28% of the token’s circulating market cap. This shows how strong buying pressure is at a time when this meme coin is approaching the $0.00001200 area. Despite these large volumes, PEPE has delivered a 30-day loss of 1.95%. At this point, the market may be in an accumulation phase, as whales could be positioning themselves for the next explosive move upwards. As an ERC-20 token, PEPE benefits from the positive performance of Ethereum (ETH) as this drives higher volumes to the Ethereum ecosystem. With ETH already nearing a new all-time high, Pepe could be about to experience a strong boost as altcoin season kicks off. Pepe Price Prediction: PEPE Trend Line Supports Hold – 194% Gain In Sight? The daily chart supports a bullish Pepe price prediction as a strong trend line support has held up again during the latest downturn. PEPE has bounced cleanly off key support and now looks set to climb toward $0.00001500 as bullish momentum builds fast. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has pushed above the mid-line, just as trading volumes rise above the 14-day average. This is a strong signal of growing buyer interest. With PEPE still sitting below its recent highs, this moment could be a golden entry point before the next leg up. If the $0.00001500 resistance flips to support, PEPE could surge by 194% in the near term, with $0.000035 emerging as the next major target. As top cryptos and meme tokens like PEPE approach new all-time highs, securing those assets becomes critical. Best Wallet (BEST) has quickly become one of the most in-demand crypto presales of 2025 .

The Ethereum validator queue jumped to a one-week high as the token rallied above $4,700. Ethereum validators are queueing to leave the Beacon chain, with the highest number of requests in the past week. The validator queue started growing in the past days, as ETH regained the $4,700 level and stood just below its all-time high. The new request for withdrawals came as ETH climbed from $3,800 to over $4,700. The ETH validator queue for withdrawals expanded again, while ETH climbed from $3,800 to over $4,700| Source: Validator Queue Validators have locked their tokens at a much lower price range for the most part, and some may want to lock in gains due to relatively slow annualized returns. Additionally, some of the unstaked tokens may be sent to specific leading validators or liquid staking protocols. The queue now holds 699,600 ETH, valued at over $3.2B, leading to a waiting time of over 12 days to unstake. The previous monthly peak did not prevent ETH from rallying, despite some pressure from whale sellers. More than 217K ETH were added to the queue just in the past two days. Since July 20, the queue to stake ETH has been smaller in comparison to the exit queue. The unstaking anomaly is the highest in a year, after months of relatively balanced activity. Only around 100K ETH are waiting to be staked. During the earlier stages of the ETH rally, both the entry and exit validator queues were on the rise. Now, the entry queue has diminished rapidly, as holders aim to retain their ETH as liquid as possible. ETH validator queue grows with price The recent ETH rally above $4,000 coincided with the sudden spike in withdrawal requests. Previously, smaller regular withdrawals were part of the everyday activity, as some validators aimed to consolidate their stake to 2,048 ETH, instead of the older 32 ETH stake. Large-scale ETH withdrawals of over 1M ETH may start affecting the liquid staking token market. At this point, it remains uncertain what type of validators are unstaking, and how old their stake is. However, LidoDAO and other liquid staking protocols may de-peg, with repercussions for DeFi protocols like Aave and others. Currently, over 35M of all available ETH is locked on the Beacon Chain, and some of the recent withdrawals have been balanced by new deposits. Additionally, some of the growing crypto treasuries are earmarked for staking or liquid staking. Users are shedding liquid staking tokens One of the reasons for unstaking may be the need to move out of liquid staking tokens. Liquid staking tokens are used as collateral in DeFi protocols, but may be at risk of liquidation during market downturns. Covering some of the loans, de-risking, and moving back to ETH may be the main strategy for DeFi whales. Lido, EthFi, and Coinbase saw the biggest unstaking in the past month, leading to price anomalies in some of the related tokens like Wrapped Liquid Staked ETH. Most liquid staking validators saw significant withdrawals in the past month, with LidoDAO leading the trend. | Source: Dune Analytics Figment, Liquid Collective, Binance, and Kiln had net inflows in the past month, while Lido DAO had the biggest outflows, losing 281,824 ETH. The withdrawals are unwinding the previous leveraged trades for ETH, where liquid staking tokens were sent to Aave to borrow more ETH, and stake it again for rewards. During a bull market, the strategy could increase the available crypto, but in a market drawdown, it could lead to contagion and a series of liquidations.

The Mutuum Finance presale price is $0.035 in stage 6. Stage 7 will see a 14.29% raise to $0.04. Existing investors stand to make a minimum of 500% return when MUTM launches. Mutuum Finance has already raised more than $14.35 million in capital and been supported by more than 15,200 investors. Relying on a lending and liquidity network built for sustainable yields, Mutuum Finance is shaping up to become a next-generation protocol that aims to marry institutional-level risk management with decentralized access. Dogecoin’s Prospects: $1 Talk Requires Momentum to Keep Up with Hype Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading at $0.2213, firm above the $0.21 support as it creates a bounce off of last week’s lows. Analysts note that a successful breakout above resistance levels around $0.40, especially if supported by broader market strength and alignment of bull cycles, could pave the way towards the much-hyped target of $1, though this occurrence is subject to major technical levels being broken. Amidst such speculative environments, growing interest in new DeFi projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also generating interest among investors as traders hunt for more than just meme-driven narratives. Investors Invest in Mutuum Finance Presale Stage 6 Mutuum Finance is priced at $0.035 in stage 6 of presale. More than $14.35 million has been raised and more than 15200 early adopters have bought tokens. Token price during Presale Stage 7 will be $0.04, which is 14.3% more than Stage 6. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has recently launched an Official Bug Bounty Program in association with CertiK, the security and transparency partner. Users will get a share of the program’s $50,000 USDT prize if they can identify potential bugs on the project. The aim of the bounty program is to provide an equal degree of protection for all vulnerability classes. It has been split into four severity classes; i.e., major, minor, low, and critical. Mutuum Finance Launches Whopping Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also initiates a $100,000 giveaway whereby the contestants who participate in the challenge shall be rewarded in terms of $10,000 MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance is creating a fully collateralized stablecoin against USD on the Ethereum blockchain. The project also goes through auditing and certification by CertiK. Mutuum Finance: A New Era in Decentralized Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending protocol that provides the user with maximum flexibility in assets. It is an open double-lending platform created by integrating Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C pool of lendings is dealt with by smart contracts. The system reacts according to current market sentiment at the time, minimizing lenders’ revenue volatility and economic lending risk. Middlemen are avoided in the P2P system, creating room for direct lending, which is fitting in volatile assets like meme coins. Dogecoin’s journey to $1 depends on overcoming key technical challenges, while Mutuum Finance is already gaining quantifiable progress. A $14.35M presale, more than 15,200 committed investors, and a $0.035 price point before a 14.29% increase point towards picking up momentum. Its dual lending architecture, fully collateralized USD stablecoin, and CertiK-audited security provide it with both innovation and structural backbone. For investors looking for a play with greater potential multiples than DOGE’s 2025 target, MUTM’s ongoing presale stage offers a more favorable entry.

French public company Sequans, a leader in cellular IoT chips, has unveiled an ambitious plan to acquire a staggering 100,000 Bitcoin by the year 2030. This bold move, initially reported by The Bitcoin Historian on X, places Sequans Bitcoin strategy firmly in the spotlight, highlighting a growing trend of significant corporate Bitcoin adoption . Why is Sequans Making This Massive Bitcoin Investment Strategy? This strategic decision by Sequans is not just a simple purchase; it represents a profound shift in how traditional companies view digital assets. For years, only a few pioneering firms like MicroStrategy dared to allocate substantial portions of their treasury to Bitcoin. Sequans’ announcement adds another significant player to this evolving landscape. Inflation Hedge: Many companies now see Bitcoin as a robust hedge against rising inflation and currency devaluation, protecting their capital. Digital Gold: Bitcoin offers a decentralized, global, and immutable store of value, akin to digital gold, appealing to long-term treasury management. Future-Proofing: Investing in Bitcoin aligns companies with the accelerating digital economy and the future of Bitcoin as a global reserve asset. Balance Sheet Enhancement: The potential for significant appreciation could boost the company’s balance sheet over time. The commitment to accumulate 100K Bitcoin over the next seven years demonstrates a clear long-term vision, moving beyond speculative trading to a fundamental belief in Bitcoin’s enduring value. What Does 100K Bitcoin Mean for Corporate Adoption? The sheer scale of Sequans’ target acquisition is noteworthy. While 100,000 BTC is a substantial amount, its gradual accumulation over several years suggests a measured approach to market entry. This method aims to mitigate volatility risks and achieve an optimal average purchase price. This development sends a powerful signal across industries. It suggests that even companies outside the traditional financial or software sectors are recognizing Bitcoin’s potential. Such large-scale commitments could inspire other public companies to explore similar strategies, further accelerating corporate Bitcoin adoption globally. Consider the precedent set by companies like MicroStrategy, which aggressively accumulated Bitcoin, influencing their stock performance and market perception. Sequans’ move, while different in pace, could similarly position them as forward-thinking innovators in their sector. Are There Challenges in This Bitcoin Investment Strategy? While the benefits are clear, a significant Bitcoin investment strategy also comes with its share of challenges. Companies must navigate the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings, which might impact quarterly earnings reports and investor sentiment. Key considerations include: Market Volatility: Managing the short-term price fluctuations of a volatile asset. Regulatory Landscape: Adapting to evolving regulations and compliance requirements in different jurisdictions. Security Concerns: Ensuring robust security measures for holding such a large amount of digital assets. Accounting Treatment: Addressing the complex accounting rules for cryptocurrencies on corporate balance sheets. However, Sequans’ long-term horizon till 2030 indicates a strategy designed to ride out short-term market noise, focusing instead on the long-term growth trajectory of Bitcoin. What Does This Mean for the Future of Bitcoin? Sequans’ announcement contributes significantly to the narrative of Bitcoin’s maturation as an institutional asset. As more public companies like Sequans embrace Bitcoin, it strengthens its legitimacy and paves the way for broader acceptance. This sustained demand from corporations provides a strong underlying support for Bitcoin’s price and network stability. The vision of acquiring 100K Bitcoin by 2030 aligns with predictions of Bitcoin becoming a mainstream treasury asset. This trend could fundamentally alter investment portfolios, moving away from traditional assets towards digital ones. The future of Bitcoin looks increasingly integrated into global finance. In essence, Sequans is betting on Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Their decision is a testament to the growing confidence in digital assets as a legitimate and valuable component of a diversified corporate treasury. Conclusion: A Landmark for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Sequans’ audacious plan to acquire 100,000 Bitcoin by 2030 marks a significant milestone in the ongoing story of institutional and corporate Bitcoin adoption . This move underscores a growing belief in Bitcoin’s role as a strategic asset, capable of protecting and growing corporate wealth in an increasingly digital world. While challenges exist, the long-term commitment signals a profound shift in financial strategy for public companies. It’s an exciting time to witness traditional industries embracing the decentralized future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Who is Sequans and what is their Bitcoin acquisition plan?

50086094,556540,1755187231,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50086094.jpeg,Here’s Why The Ethereum Price Is Rallying Toward New All-Time Highs,https://bitcoinist.com/why-ethereum-price-is-rallying/,"Recent market trends are creating the perfect setup for an Ethereum price breakout . Notably, ETH has been steadily gaining momentum, with its price now edging closer to a new all-time high . In the past few days, the leading altcoin has experienced a surge in network activity, rising demand, and shrinking exchange supply—all key drivers for a potentially explosive move. Network Growth Pushes Ethereum Price Toward New ATH Ethereum is quickly approaching its previous all-time high as network activity has surged to unprecedented levels. According to on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, daily Ethereum transaction counts have climbed to a record high of approximately 1.875 million, underscoring a strong surge in user engagement and network demand. This spike in activity has coincided with a sharp rally in the ETH price from around $3,150 in late July to $4,563 in August, positioning the cryptocurrency within striking distance of its historical peak. Currently, Ethereum is trading at $4,737, meaning it is only 2.67% away from surpassing its ATH of $4,867, recorded during the bull run in November 2021 . Over the past month, Ethereum has maintained a strong upward trajectory , soaring by roughly 60% according to CoinMarketCap. The momentum has only intensified in the last week, with the cryptocurrency rallying over 27% while outperforming Bitcoin by 124% since the market lows in April. If this bullish run persists, ETH could be on the verge of setting a fresh ATH, marking a historic moment for the crypto market. Adding to the positive sentiment is Ethereum’s Netflow SMA30, which CryptoQuant reveals currently sits at -40,000 ETH. Based on the chart, sustained outflows signal that investors are moving their holdings into cold storage rather than keeping them on exchanges for quick sells, effectively reducing sell-side liquidity and increasing buying pressure. This trend was particularly pronounced between late July and early August. On August 12, Ethereum saw a substantial net inflow of 186,000 ETH, and on the same day, its price touched $4,589. This supports CryptoQuant’s narrative that ETH is rapidly edging toward a new record high, driven not only by rising network activity but also by accelerating accumulation . Short Squeeze Risk And ETF Inflows Add To Momentum While the ETH price is surging, market analyst Coin Bureau warns that a new all-time high could trigger a cascade of short liquidations, potentially injecting even more volatility into the market. The analyst predicts that nearly $2 billion worth of short positions could be wiped out, forcing traders to buy back the altcoin at higher prices and possibly accelerating the rally. Interestingly, Ethereum’s rapid price ascent is also being amplified by surging institutional demand. Crypto analyst Ted Pillows reported in an X social media post that Spot Ethereum ETFs attracted a massive $729.1 million in inflows in just one day—a signal that institutional FOMO may be returning to the market. Alongside this ETF boom, demand from Ethereum Treasury firms has also climbed sharply, reinforcing ETH’s bullish momentum.",Ethereum|Altcoin|Coin Bureau|Coinmarketcap|CryptoQuant|ETF|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum network|ethereum news|ethereum price|Ethereum Transaction Counts|Ethereum treasury|Ethereum’s Netflow SMA30|ethusd|ETHUSDT|fomo|spot Ethereum ETFs|Ted Pillows,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-14 16:00:31

The sudden pullback has split market opinion: some analysts interpret the drop as a sign of waning momentum, while others see it as a healthy pause before another breakout attempt. Related Reading: Ethereum 30-Day Netflow Average Deepens Negative: Buyers Dominate Market Adding to the intrigue, key data from CryptoQuant reveals that BTC volatility — measured by the 30-day Price High & Low metric — has compressed to its lowest point in two years. This metric tracks the range between Bitcoin’s rolling 30-day high and low, and its current tight squeeze suggests a rare balance between supply and demand. Liquidity has been clustering above local highs near $120K and below recent lows around $113K, creating a coiled-spring effect in the price structure. Historically, such volatility compression phases often precede significant range expansions. The question now is whether Bitcoin will break upward, continuing its long-term bull trend, or slip into a deeper correction if selling pressure gains traction. With the market sitting near record highs and volatility at multi-year lows, traders are bracing for what could be the next decisive move in Bitcoin’s 2025 rally. Bitcoin Volatility Compression Signals Imminent Move According to top analyst Axel Adler, Bitcoin’s 30-day Price High & Low metric is showing one of its tightest readings in years. The range between BTC’s rolling 30-day high and low has narrowed significantly, while the bands themselves — representing the rolling maximum and minimum prices — have compressed tightly around the current price. This pattern is a textbook sign of volatility contraction. Adler explains that such compression typically reflects a balance between supply and demand and a period of low realized volatility. In this phase, liquidity tends to concentrate just above local highs, currently around $120,000, and just below local lows, near $113,000. This creates a situation where price movement is contained within a narrow band, with traders positioning themselves on both sides in anticipation of the next breakout. The coming days will be critical in determining Bitcoin’s short-term structure. If BTC can break above the $120K–$124K zone, it could trigger another leg higher in its uptrend. However, a breakdown below $113K would increase the risk of a deeper correction, potentially shifting market sentiment.

The move comes just a day after BTC briefly broke above the key $123,217 resistance level, approaching the $124,000 psychological barrier before pulling back. This zone remains the most significant obstacle for bulls, as it has capped upward moves multiple times. Price action shows BTC maintaining a bullish structure above its major moving averages — the 50 SMA ($116,948), 100 SMA ($117,653), and 200 SMA ($112,495). This alignment signals continued strength in the medium term, with the 50 SMA acting as immediate dynamic support. Related Reading: Alameda Research Unlocks $35M In Solana After 4 Years – Imminent Distribution? The repeated tests of the $123K area suggest that market liquidity is heavily concentrated here. A decisive breakout and sustained close above $124K would likely trigger momentum buying and open the door to new all-time highs. Conversely, a failure to reclaim $123K could lead to renewed selling pressure, with initial support at $120K and deeper support near the $117K–$118K range.

His comments come amid an intensifying campaign from the White House for immediate interest rate cuts—moves that could send ripples through financial markets and digital assets alike. Trump’s Escalating Pressure on Powell President Trump has once again aimed at Powell, calling him “Too Late” and demanding swift action to slash interest rates . In a series of fiery remarks, Trump accused Powell of repeatedly mismanaging monetary policy and even suggested allowing a “major lawsuit” against him over alleged mismanagement of Federal Reserve building projects. Powell Storm Incoming #XRP on Edge! pic.twitter.com/h0t9jfnuQe — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) August 14, 2025 The criticism is more than political theater—it highlights growing tensions between the administration’s economic agenda and the Fed’s current cautious approach to monetary easing. These statements have not gone unnoticed by markets. Traders are increasingly factoring in a high probability of rate cuts at the September Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, especially after recent economic data showed cooling inflation and signs of labor market weakness. The Potential Policy Pivot Expectations for aggressive monetary easing have surged. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently indicated that a 50-basis-point cut is on the table. This shift has already weakened the U.S. dollar and buoyed risk assets across the board. Historically, such environments—characterized by cheaper borrowing costs and increased liquidity—have provided fertile ground for cryptocurrencies to rally. Bitcoin has already surged to new all-time highs on the back of these rate cut bets, and Levi argues that XRP could be next in line to benefit if policy changes go through. Why It Matters for XRP Levi’s thesis is straightforward: lowering interest rates injects fresh liquidity into the banking system. Many of these banks, though still cautious, are becoming more involved in the digital asset sector. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Notably, U.S. regulators have clarified that banks may participate in certain crypto-related activities, and major institutions like BNY Mellon have expanded their digital asset services. Ripple’s decision to use BNY Mellon as the custodian for its RLUSD stablecoin reserves further underscores the deepening connection between traditional finance and blockchain technology. Such developments mean that any liquidity boost from rate cuts could indirectly flow into crypto markets, strengthening demand for assets like XRP. XRP’s Current Market Position As of report time, XRP is trading at $3.23 after a strong rally earlier in August. The token has held above former resistance levels, with trading volumes staying robust and derivatives interest rising. Market analysts note repeated tests of the $3.20–$3.30 price zone, suggesting that bullish momentum could build if liquidity conditions improve as expected. Staying Grounded Amid the Storm While Levi’s “super storm” description captures the potential magnitude of the situation, he cautions against blind optimism. Markets can be volatile and unpredictable, particularly when influenced by political pressure and central bank policy shifts. Powell has signaled that the pace and scale of any rate cuts will depend on incoming economic data, leaving room for sudden reversals. For XRP holders, the key is to monitor Federal Reserve announcements, macroeconomic indicators, and developments in the banking sector’s crypto integration—allowing the market itself to confirm the trend before making big moves.

Market analysts generally believe that this not only means XRP has escaped long-term legal risks but also consolidates its legitimate position in the global financial system. With the acceleration of ETF approvals and the expansion of cross-border payment applications, XRP is shifting from a highly volatile trading instrument to a core asset for long-term holding.

Cold Wallet’s recent appearance on CoinMarketCap has quickly attracted the attention of several well-known market analysts, many of whom are now providing detailed assessments of its business model, acquisitions, and long-term potential. This type of expert attention can reshape perceptions. For those who prefer to enter a project only after it has received independent verification, these reviews offer an added level of reassurance. Cold Wallet’s figures are helping build this trust. With $6 million already raised, the presale is in stage 17, priced at $0.00998 per Cold Wallet ($CWT) token, with an expected launch value of $0.3517. These numbers alone are drawing interest from those who track high-credibility crypto projects for 2025. Key Factors Behind Analyst Interest in Cold Wallet Analyst attention doesn’t arrive without reason. It generally follows a series of tangible developments that show a project is making real progress, operating transparently, and positioning itself to scale. Cold Wallet has been ticking those boxes. Its self-custody wallet model rewards users for on-chain activity, adding a layer of direct utility for CWT holders. Its acquisition of Plus Wallet was another major step, bringing in more than two million active users and instantly expanding its reach. These features have helped the project stand out in a crowded market. For many institutional and high-value participants, endorsements from analysts are worth more than community-driven hype. Such professional recognition signals that Cold Wallet has both the foundation and strategy to sustain growth, which is why it’s being discussed as one of the most noteworthy projects heading into 2025. Stage 17 Presale Progress Signals Market Readiness In the earliest phases of a presale, buyers often depend on vision statements, community enthusiasm, and potential use cases to justify entry. As the presale matures, however, different factors start to influence participation. Credibility, track record, and third-party reviews take on far greater importance. Cold Wallet’s present standing is a prime example. With $6 million already secured at a stage 17 price of $0.00998, it has evolved far beyond an early-stage concept into a fully funded and operational venture. The confirmed launch price of $0.3517 creates a clear valuation gap that many buyers see as an opportunity. For those who prefer to perform extensive due diligence before joining, analyst coverage offers the bridge between observation and action. In today’s competitive presale environment, few projects manage to combine high market interest with professional review at this stage. Cold Wallet is one of them, and that’s why it’s gaining ground as a top contender in 2025’s market discussions. Professional Backing Draws Attention From Larger Market Players Major market players tend to focus on more than just price gains, they look for sustainable plans and a reliable delivery path after launch. Analyst reviews of Cold Wallet have highlighted several key points: a multi-tiered cashback rewards system, balanced and sustainable coin distribution, and forward-looking technical plans for Layer 2 or custom-built infrastructure capable of supporting real-time rewards. These factors suggest that the project isn’t just built for launch day, it’s designed to remain functional and relevant in the long term. For large-scale buyers, that level of preparation can justify substantial entries while the presale still offers a significant discount. With the gap between the current $0.00998 price and the $0.3517 launch value, the appeal is clear. In a year when many presales will compete for the title of best crypto for 2025, Cold Wallet’s combination of active utility, a rapidly expanding user base, and professional credibility sets it apart from the majority. Why Cold Wallet’s Long-Term Outlook Stands Out in 2025 Cold Wallet’s progress is now driven by more than community support; it’s being reinforced by a growing body of expert analysis. With $6 million raised, a confirmed stage 17 presale price of $0.00998, and a launch target of $0.3517, it remains positioned for considerable potential gains before the final presale phases close. Its blend of professional endorsement, proven ability to attract millions of users, and a reward system that directly benefits holders is creating urgency among those who wait for solid proof before entering. As the search for 2025’s strongest projects intensifies, Cold Wallet’s mix of real-world utility, scalability, and respected third-party validation may enable it to retain value long after its coin generation event.

Chainlink Surges 30% & SEI Nears $0.33 Breakout,https://timestabloid.com/blockdag-races-toward-600m-presale-target-chainlink-surges/,"The crypto market is buzzing with fresh activity as multiple projects show sharp momentum. BlockDAG (BDAG) has already secured over $374 million toward its $600M goal, selling 25.1 billion BDAG coins to more than 200,000 unique holders. Alongside this rapid presale, Chainlink (LINK) has seen a 30% rise in the past week, while SEI is testing key resistance near $0.33 with strong volume backing its next possible move. Among the top crypto coins drawing attention, BlockDAG’s rapid progress, combined with a near-launch ecosystem and high presale demand, positions it as a major contender in the space. Chainlink Price Outlook Suggests Strong Rally Potential Over the last week, Chainlink posted more than 30% gains, with daily trading volume pushing past $1.35 billion. At present, LINK trades near $21, down slightly by 1% compared to the day before. Analysts note that the current Chainlink price outlook remains bullish, supported by whale activity, higher DEX volumes, and fresh institutional support. On-chain reports show that whales have accumulated $13 million in LINK, with Lookonchain highlighting an $11.13 million transfer from Binance to Compound. Daily Active Addresses jumped to 9,410, pointing to growing activity among retail participants and larger holders alike. Institutional interest continues to strengthen Chainlink’s Web3 position, with partnerships involving Fidelity, Swift, and JPMorgan. At the same time, DEX trading volumes have expanded to $1.298 billion in 24 hours, underscoring growing market confidence and expanding real-world utility. SEI Price Prediction Signals Breakout Possibility SEI is trading near $0.33, pressing against a critical resistance zone shaped by a descending trendline from late 2023 and a major horizontal barrier. This level is central to the current SEI price prediction, as clearing it could flip sentiment and spark strong upside potential. The price range between $0.25 and $0.33 has historically been both resistance and support, making this moment significant. A decisive close above $0.33 would likely end the bearish structure and open the door for a larger rally. Recent trading data support this setup, with SEI fluctuating between $0.315 and $0.327 over 24 hours, closing near $0.32 on volume above $160 million. BlockDAG Powers Ahead With $374M Presale and Rising Growth BlockDAG’s presale continues to accelerate, with more than 60% of its $600 million target already reached. The project has raised $374 million so far, backed by 25.1 billion BDAG sold at the current Batch 29 price of $0.0276. Over 200,000 holders have joined in, fueling what has become one of the most active presales in recent memory. This surge is the result of a carefully designed pricing structure where each new batch adds urgency and confidence. Early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1, with projections pointing to possible 3,522% returns if BDAG hits $1 after launch. The growing demand shortens the timeline of each batch sell-out, creating a self-sustaining cycle where momentum fuels even stronger participation. Community activity continues to build around the project. More than 4,500 developers are preparing over 300 Web3 projects on BlockDAG’s ecosystem, while the X1 Miner app already counts 2.5 million users. These numbers show how BlockDAG is not just a presale story, but a complete framework preparing for immediate utility and adoption. For those following top crypto coins, BlockDAG offers a rare glimpse of a presale that combines high demand, large-scale adoption plans, and a clear path to launch. Reaching the $600 million target will mark not just a funding cap but also deep market trust, liquidity strength, and a community-driven base capable of driving powerful early trading. Final Words The crypto market is showing clear signs of activity across several fronts. Chainlink’s price outlook remains firmly bullish with whale purchases, institutional ties, and DEX growth pushing momentum higher. SEI’s price prediction hinges on breaking $0.33, a level that could flip market sentiment and set off a strong rally. But it is BlockDAG’s presale strength that stands out most, with $374 million already raised and a fast march toward its $600M finish line. With early holders seeing 2,660% growth and a growing ecosystem backing the project, BlockDAG is setting the pace among top crypto coins . In a crowded market, it is proving to be the story that many are watching closest.

According to reports, a breakout and successful retest of this long-standing chart pattern could set the stage for a massive surge toward $36, ultimately repeating the bull rally seen during the 2014-2017 cycle. XRP Price Eyes $36 After Double Bottom Breakout Crypto analyst Gert van Lagen has drawn attention to a rare and potentially explosive technical event currently unfolding on the two-week XRP price chart. According to his analysis posted on X social media, XRP has successfully broken out of a massive 7-year Double Bottom formation—a pattern that typically signals long-term reversal from bearish to bullish market conditions. Related Reading: Analyst Says What Happened With Bitcoin Is About To Happen With XRP Based on the analyst’s chart, XRP had breached the neckline of this Double Bottom pattern after years of accumulation, following up its momentum with a textbook retest that confirmed the breakout. This retest, occurring at a critical price point, has historically acted as the final validation before a sustained rally. Lagen has also compared the current cycle with that of the 2014-2017 phase, indicating that XRP’s price action could be repeating similar strong bullish patterns that emerged during that period. The chart suggests that XRP is poised to clear its former all-time high of $3.84, potentially removing one of the most significant technical barriers in its history. With the resistance level now flipped into support, Lagen’s price projection points to an initial target of approximately $36. This level aligns with the 2.00 Fibonacci Extension of the Double Bottom pattern. Notably, the expert’s analysis implies that XRP’s current momentum is not just a short-term spike, but likely the early stages of a multi-month, possibly multi-year climb. If the structure follows past patterns and continues to play out as Lagen predicts, XRP could be on track to deliver one of its strongest bull runs since the 2017 rally. XRP Mirrors Ethereum’s 2017 Breakout Pattern In a separate bullish analysis, a crypto analyst identified as ‘Shibo’ on X compared XRP’s present market behavior to Ethereum’s historic breakout in 2017. His side-by-side chart shows an almost identical technical progression involving an extended consolidation phase forming a base, followed by a decisive breakout at a clearly defined resistance level. Related Reading: XRP $5 Target Remains Intact Despite Price Retrace, Here’s Where It’s Headed Next In Ethereum’s case, this move triggered an extraordinary rally from sub-$20 levels to more than $1,400 in under twelve months, marking one of the most explosive advances in crypto history. Shibo argues that XRP is now positioned in the same “breakout zone” that the ETH price occupied before its parabolic surge. Based on this chart historical pattern, the analyst has forecasted a rather ambitious price target for XRP. He believes that the cryptocurrency could see a massive surge to $589, representing an eye-watering increase of 18,084%.

50087961,556350,1755190847,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50087961.jpeg,From Day 1: Ripple CTO Says XRPL Was Made For Global Financial Infrastructure,https://bitcoinist.com/from-day-1-ripple-cto-says-xrpl-was-made-for-global-financial-infrastructure/,"Ripple’s top engineer says more payments firms and stablecoin players are now building their own chains, and he thinks that matters for finance. According to Ripple CTO David Schwartz, the move shows that many in the market now view blockchain as part of basic financial plumbing. He wrote about this in a long post on X today, and he reminded readers that Ripple has been working on the XRP Ledger for more than 13 years. Ripple XRPL Vs Permissioned Chains Schwartz drew a clear line between chains that put control in a few hands and those that try to stay open. Based on reports, some newer networks use permissioned validators that give a small group or a single entity a lot of control. That setup can help with compliance, he said, but it limits global reach and makes the network less robust. By contrast, he argued, XRPL is public and permissionless by default, while also offering optional permissioned features for regulated use cases. We’ve been seeing more and more players in the payments and stablecoins space launch their own blockchains. To me, that’s a clear sign the market sees blockchain as core financial infrastructure — something we’ve believed in and have been building toward on the XRP Ledger for… — David ‘JoelKatz’ Schwartz (@JoelKatz) August 13, 2025 He pointed to a few concrete technical traits. XRPL has low and predictable fees, and it doesn’t require a separate gas token. Users can pay transaction costs with XRP, and XRP serves as a bridge asset for cross-border payments. That, Schwartz said, makes the ledger practical for steady payment flows. Those are the kinds of details institutions care about when they think about moving real money on-chain. Proof Of Authority Reports have disclosed that some newer chains are borrowing certain XRPL ideas. Schwartz called out deterministic finality and a consensus approach often labeled Proof-of-Authority (PoA). He sees that as a sign the industry is aligning around the need for predictable settlement for financial deals. He also said XRPL’s long run of updates and fixes has helped build trust and adoption over time. Building An Ecosystem Is Hard Schwartz makes a point: launching a chain is tough, but creating trust, liquidity, real-world use and developers is even harder. He said building an institution-friendly ecosystem takes steady work, not just a launch day. Based on his post, XRPL’s approach has been to keep the base ledger public while adding tools institutions can use when they need more control. Schwartz said he’s excited about the next phase for Ripple XRPL. He expects upgrades that boost programmability, widen liquidity and add compliance-grade options for big players.

Thankfully, 2025 promises more of that but smart money is also eyeing bold possibilities beyond ETH itself. Let’s break down every detail. Ethereum Price Prediction: Could ETH Land in the $6–7K Zone? Analysts are firing bullish signals. A survey of 50 crypto pros forecasts ETH could settle around $6,100 by 2025, climbing potentially to $12,000 by 2030 if network upgrades and institutional interest hold strong. The catalyst deck is getting stacked: Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade, building on earlier “proto-danksharding,” aims to slash transaction costs on Layer-2s and speed up confirmations. Combine that with growing ETF inflows and regulatory clarity and the bullish thesis gains weight; $6K might be a conservative baseline. Still, realistic range forecasts warn that ETH’s trajectory hinges on execution and macro stability. Slips like U.S. staking crackdowns or smart contract vulnerabilities could undercut momentum. Now, if ETH itself is the reliable backbone, these three ETH-adjacent assets are shaping up as breakout plays and could outperform… big time: Ethena (ENA) – The Synthetic Dollar Engine Ethena is building a synthetic stablecoin called USDe, backed by a delta-neutral mix of ETH, BTC and USDC/USDT, designed to stay pegged while generating yield. It’s not your usual stablecoin; it’s yield-bearing and censorship-resistant . ENA has seen a 150% bounce recently; its Total Value Locked has surpassed $10 billion, and open interest in its derivatives is back above $1 billion, signaling buying heat. Some models project ENA could hit $2.37 by 2025 and even climb toward $7+ by 2030 in a sustained bull run. Aave (AAVE) – DeFi Lending’s Powerhouse Aave’s token isn’t just governance, it’s the lifeline of a multi-billion dollar crypto lending ecosystem. With record lending volumes (over $33.9B in deposits and $13.6B in active loans), whale accumulation and burning mechanisms, AAVE stands out as a DeFi blue-chip. Price projections are modest; some anticipate a 30% rally toward $350 if resistance breaks. But that’s just the baseline; if alt-season accelerates, AAVE could easily hit 30–50× from its mid-presale valuation in the right scenario. Remittix (RTX) – Ethereum’s PayFi Underdog Now, here’s where the narrative shifts… Remittix (RTX) is in its early stages, unlike Ethereum and Aave and it’s built for real use; plus, it’s already climbing fast. Built for function, not FOMO: Remittix focuses on crypto-to-fiat payments; no centralized exchanges, no hidden fees. Just fast, direct transfers into bank accounts across 30+ countries. Solid Foundations backing the buzz: With over $19.3M raised over 599M tokens sold and a completed CertiK audit, RTX is stacking utility credentials. While Ethena and Aave represent higher-risk, higher-reward plays tied to ETH’s ecosystem, each with unique utility and explosive upside potential, Remittix has even bigger potential to outpace them as it continues to convert that utility into growing investor confidence, potentially offering steadier upside.

ETF Filing and Surge in Volume Point to Breakout,https://cryptopotato.com/pengu-set-for-lift-off-etf-filing-and-surge-in-volume-point-to-breakout/,"TL;DR ETF filing backed by CBOE and SEC review brings fresh eyes to the PENGU market setup. Analysts spot triangle breakout pattern; key resistance at $0.038 could lead to $0.075. Robinhood Advanced listing and Solana-Ethereum bridge strengthen PENGU’s retail and cross-chain appeal. ETF Filing Draws Attention Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is drawing new attention after renewed interest in its ETF application. The filing, supported by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), is now being reviewed by the US SEC. As the process moves forward, traders are keeping a close watch on what comes next. Ali Martinez, a market analyst, pointed out that PENGU is trading in a formation often seen before a strong upward move. He said the price action shows the asset “building up pressure,” with many now watching for a breakout. The next $PENGU breakout could be massive! This setup is building fast with strong fundamentals: – Pending ETF filing backed by CBOE – SEC review in progress – Expanding rapidly in Asia pic.twitter.com/r4JLrySad2 — Ali (@ali_charts) August 13, 2025 Consequently, the combination of a regulatory filing and growing trading volume has kept the asset on traders’ watchlists. PENGU Price Action and Key Levels PENGU traded at $0.038 at press time, showing little change in the past 24 hours but up 8% over the past week. The 24-hour volume has remained strong, with over $600 million traded. On the chart, PENGU is holding above the $0.035 level. This area is seen as short-term support. According to Martinez, the next resistance is around $0.038. If that level is cleared, further moves toward $0.045, $0.055, and possibly $0.075 are being discussed. Another analyst, known as Altcoin Sherpa, shared his view on the token. He described PENGU as a “meme coin with added utility,” noting its role in NFTs and revenue-based projects. This mix has helped the token reach different parts of the crypto market, not just meme coin traders. $PENGU is still a great coin and I unfortunately never got filled on the lower green box like I wanted.

He called it “a serious Dogecoin rival” with a strong team and community support. He also mentioned its role in connecting the Ethereum and Solana networks. Recently, Robinhood added PENGU to its Advanced trading platform. This update allows U.S. users to trade PENGU using expanded charting and tools. The project’s official account shared the news, which came as part of broader efforts to increase access across markets. The post PENGU Set for Lift-Off?

Short, bold, and packed with optimism, the statement reflects the deep bullish conviction shared by many XRP supporters. While the comment is more aspirational than literal, it arrives at a time when XRP is showing renewed strength in both price action and investor sentiment. Current Market Outlook As of report time, XRP is trading around $3.20, supported by healthy trading volumes and a robust market capitalization that keeps it among the top-performing altcoins. The price has benefited from a strong mid-2025 rally, with steady buying interest across exchanges. Soon it will cost 10 #XRP to buy a car — XRP QUEEN (@crypto_queen_x) August 13, 2025 Still, i t remains far from the multi-thousand-dollar valuation implied by the “10 XRP” prediction, underscoring that such projections are rooted in long-term vision rather than near-term expectation. Whale Activity Driving Optimism Recent blockchain data reveals significant whale accumulation. According to a recent report , wallets holding between 100 million and 1 billion XRP collectively added 1.2 billion tokens — worth about $3.8 billion — in just four days. Such large-scale accumulation can tighten supply and create upward pressure on price, a pattern that often fuels bullish market narratives. This heightened activity suggests growing confidence among deep-pocketed holders in XRP’s long-term potential. Technical Analysis Signals Chart analysts have highlighted encouraging patterns in XRP’s price structure. Breakouts from multi-year consolidation zones, along with double-bottom formations, have set near-term technical targets in the mid-single to low-double-digit range. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Rising open interest in XRP derivatives further indicates increased participation from traders betting on higher prices. While these setups strengthen the bullish case, the journey to valuations implied by XRP QUEEN’s statement would require unprecedented growth. Rhetoric Versus Reality Taking the “10 XRP to buy a car” statement reveals the scale of the challenge. With the average U.S. car price hovering near $48,750, XRP would need to trade around $4,875 per coin for the prediction to materialize, approximately 1,500 times its current price. This illustrates that the post is best understood as a symbolic expression of confidence rather than a near-term forecast. In conclusion, XRP QUEEN’s viral post captures the passionate optimism of the XRP community, fueled by bullish whale activity and promising technical patterns. However, traders and investors should balance this enthusiasm with a clear-eyed view of the current market reality. While the idea of buying a car for just 10 XRP may be a long way off, the sentiment behind the statement reflects a community that remains steadfast in its belief that XRP’s best days are yet to come.

The flagship cryptocurrency crossed $124,000 and set a new all-time high of $124,533. However, it plummeted below $120,000 almost immediately following an unsettling US PPI report. The report revealed that wholesale inflation surged far beyond expected levels, jeopardizing expectations of a rate cut. Investor sentiment was further soured after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent ruled out new Bitcoin purchases. BTC is down nearly 4%, trading around $118,626. Block Reveals Modular Bitcoin Mining System Block, a fintech company, has announced the launch of a new modular Bitcoin mining system, Proto Rig. It also launched a free, open-source fleet management software. The company made the announcement during an event at Core Scientific’s Dalton, Georgia, facility. Core Scientific is already using Block’s Proto Rigs for mining activity. Proto Rig features a modular design that allows operators to upgrade individual hashboards. It extends the lifespan of a mining rig to ten years, reducing costs by 15% to 20%. Thomas Templeton, Hardware Lead at Block, stated in a press release, “Mining hardware hasn’t really changed in years. Machines break often, are hard to repair, expensive, and time-consuming to upgrade, and don’t make the most efficient use of power or space.” BlackRock’s Crypto Portfolio Crosses $100B, Bitcoin (BTC) Dominates According to an analysis by Finbold, BlackRock’s crypto holdings have crossed the $100 billion mark, reaching $104 billion as of August 14. Finbold based its findings on blockchain data from Arkham Intelligence. The analysis revealed that BlackRock’s current crypto portfolio includes $89.27 billion in Bitcoin (743,310 BTC ) and $14.71 billion in Ethereum (3.2 million ETH). This is a $49.15 billion net increase since the beginning of 2025, when the asset manager’s crypto holdings were at $54.83 billion, with $51.16 billion in BTC and $3.59 billion in ETH. US Treasury Secretary Rules Out Further Bitcoin (BTC) Buys Bitcoin (BTC) lost momentum after reaching a new all-time high on Thursday, after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the government has no plans to purchase additional BTC for its Bitcoin reserve. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency plunged below $120,000 and is currently trading around $117,700, with sellers in control. Bessent stated, “We’ve also started to get into the 21st century, a Bitcoin reserve. We’re not going to be buying that, but we are going to use confiscated assets and continue to build that up.” US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on March 6, establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve and a separate digital asset stockpile. Both reserves initially used cryptocurrencies forfeited in criminal and civil cases. Bessent had initially advocated for a strategic shift in the US’s approach to Bitcoin, stating that the government should stop selling Bitcoin and “bring it onshore” using established regulatory frameworks. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is in freefall during the ongoing session, down nearly 5% following Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s statement that the US does not plan additional Bitcoin purchases. Investor sentiment also soured following an unsettling US PPI report, which revealed that wholesale inflation increased beyond expectations, jeopardizing expectations for low interest rates. Signs that BTC is overheating also emerged. Bitcoin’s funding rate, which helps indicate an overheated market, registered an increase in long bets. However, the bets were substantially smaller than previous bets. This means BTC has some way to go before investors need to worry about an overheated market. A jump in funding rates could indicate increased volatility and liquidation risks. On the other hand, the short-term holder (STH) Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) revealed very little profit taking. Other technical indicators suggest a “top” may be in. Popular analyst Captain Faibik wrote, “BTC Liquidity has been grabbed at the highs. We’ve now printed the 9th TD Sell Candle. Daily RSI is Printing Bearish Divergence. Rising Wedge Formation. This combination suggests the top might be in & Bearish Rally could be around the corner. Don’t get trapped in late longs… patience will pay off.” BTC registered a sharp decline on Friday (August 1), dropping over 2% and settling at $113,365. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 0.67% and settled at $112,601. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Sunday, rising 1.52% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,215. The price continued pushing higher on Monday, registering a 0.69% increase and settling at $115,051. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $112,707 on Tuesday as selling pressure returned. It rebounded from this level to reclaim $114,000 and settled at $114,051, ultimately dropping 0.83%. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising 0.80% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,028. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $117,000 and settle at $117,515. Despite the positive sentiment, the price was back in the red on Friday, falling nearly 1% to $116,683. BTC registered a marginal decline on Saturday but recovered on Sunday, rising 2.42% to reclaim $119,000 and settle at $119,309. The price surged to an intraday high of $122,319 on Monday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $118,701, ultimately dropping 0.51%. Market sentiment turned positive on Tuesday as the price recovered, rising 1.19% to cross $120,000 and settle at $120,113. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC rallied, rising nearly 3% to settle at $123,365. BTC is in freefall during the ongoing session after setting a new all-time high earlier in the day, reaching $124,533. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 5%, trading around $117,699.

Google Trend data has also confirmed the statistics showing an increased search interest in altcoins, with investors moving funds towards Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin. Data on Coingecko shows Bitcoin has a share of total cryptocurrency by market capitalization at 57.4% down from 61.7% last week. Some analysts have revealed that it is a potential precursor to altcoin season when non-Bitcoin assets post such gains. Bitcoin has shed at least six percentage points over the previous two months, from 65%. ETH market share climbs to 13.6% due to ETF Momentum as BTC dominance falls The current shift is also evident in online search activity. According to data from Google Trends, altcoin searches have spiked amid the slip in BTC dominance. Some market trackers have attributed it to retail traders seeking exposure to non-Bitcoin assets. The interest is reflected in the price action across major coins, including Ethereum and Solana. Track Bitcoin Dominance👇 https://t.co/NOsQAoGLSR — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) August 14, 2025 Ethereum market dominance has risen to 13.62%, which is mainly supported by the recent surge towards its all-time high. Ether has surged by a 51.68% monthly increase, propelling the price to ~$4,700, just 3.5% below its all-time high of $4,890 set in November 2021. During the weekly timeframe, ETH has risen by 28%, which is primarily contributed to by massive inflows into ETFs. The recent notable result was a net inflow of ~$1.08 billion in one day alone. As reported recently by Cryptopolitan, the massive net inflow was contributed mainly by BlackRock’s ETHA fund receiving ~$640 million and Fidelity FETH collecting ~$ 276 million. Combined, Ethereum ETFs now hold ~$26 billion in assets under management. Leading altcoins such as Solana and Dogecoin have also posted significant results in recent months. Solana has risen by 23% and Dogecoin 21% over the past seven days, ranking high on the list of top gainers in the past week by market capitalization. Some analysts have attributed these movements to a shift in investor interest into altcoins and the momentum of Ethereum’s ETFs. Others said that Bitcoin’s declining dominance signifies capital rotation. They noted that if the rotation goes on, Bitcoin’s dominance may drop further to the 47-48% range, marking the shift towards altcoin season. Also, in such seasons, large capitalized altcoins usually gain market share quickly before Bitcoin eventually reasserts its dominance. Bitcoin price holds steady as its dominance continues to drop Bitcoin remains near its all-time highs, currently trading at $118,152.00. It has fallen by 4.22% today with a market capitalization of $2,365.46B. The YTD shows that BTC has risen by 26%, signaling positive investor confidence in the coin despite a falling dominance. Some industry analysts have cautioned that the shift towards altcoins comes with the risk of market saturation. They noted that the altcoin market is flooded with projects that lack sustainable business models, active deployment teams, or insufficient liquidity. According to them, those factors contribute to volatility and steep price corrections. Industry experts have recommended diversifying funds into projects with fundamentals and active development teams. They have urged investors to perform thorough due diligence on each asset, technology, leadership, and community engagement. They suggested risk management tools such as stop-loss orders, and investing only when necessary and with what you can afford. Sustained inflows help maintain the upward trend experienced by altcoins, while Bitcoin’s rebound may reverse some of the recent gains in the altcoin market. The current decline in BTC dominance has reflected a broader shift in the digital asset ecosystem. Investors are diversifying beyond Bitcoin towards other blockchain technologies such as NFTs and Layer 2 scaling. It remains uncertain whether the current trend will keep the momentum or Bitcoin will rebound to its dominance.

This is the institutional alignment bulls have been waiting for. The big surge: ETF money floodgates are open U.S. spot Ether ETFs notched their first-ever $1B day on Aug. 11–12. BlackRock’s ETHA took in just under $640M, with Fidelity’s FETH near $277M. Cumulative net inflows since launch are now in the $10B+ range. ETF assets across issuers now sit around $25B+, an amount some trackers say is ~4.7% of circulating ETH, a non-trivial chunk of available supply. Even conservative gauges peg it at roughly 4.7% of ETH’s market cap equivalent, underscoring the magnitude of institutional demand. Corporate treasury moves: Public companies go all-in on ETH BitMine Immersion (BMNR) disclosed ~1.15M ETH (≈ $5B), and said it’s exploring up to $20B in new stock issuance to buy more ETH, positioning itself as the largest ETH treasury globally . SharpLink Gaming (SBET), now chaired by ConsenSys founder Joseph Lubin, has emerged as another heavyweight ETH treasury. Company communications and independent research point to hundreds of thousands of ETH held, with expectations of >$3B in ETH post-raise. This is MicroStrategy-style playbook, but for Ethereum. It adds a sticky, non-trader buyer cohort to the demand side, exactly when ETFs are already siphoning supply. The Supply Squeeze: Issuance vs. Absorption On peak days, ETF net buys have exceeded daily ETH issuance multiple times over. One analysis pegged a recent session at ~3.2× issuance absorbed by ETFs alone. Another report said August ETF flows have rivaled the entire new issuance since the Merge. That combination tightens float and pressurizes price upward. Remember: post-Merge issuance is structurally lower, and burns vary with activity. When steady issuance meets persistent ETF + treasury demand, the imbalance favors the bulls. Macro & market context: The wind at ETH’s back U.S. CPI data kept bets alive for a September Fed rate cut, adding risk-on fuel as ETFs ramped. In parallel, the Aug. 7 executive order opened the door for 401(k) plans to include crypto, potentially funneling retirement money toward ETF wrappers like ETHA and FETH. Advisors already have Ether access through registered funds like Fidelity’s FETH, and IRA-friendly crypto options further smooth the on-ramp for long-term allocators. Distribution rails matter, and they’re clearly expanding for ETH. Meanwhile, ETH ETFs have outpaced BTC products on several recent days, highlighting relative-strength flows into Ethereum as institutions diversify beyond Bitcoin. Analyst pulse First day of the ETHness stakes done. The group's volume was just shy of $1.1 billion. My *prediction* on flows for the day is anywhere from $125 million to $325 million but will depend on how many investors these firms had lined up. We'll know some official flows in a few hours https://t.co/p6Wjty8VyY pic.twitter.com/1gYYrU1CW1 — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) July 23, 2024 (Analysts have since noted actual $1B+ daily inflows in August 2025, confirming that early expectations understated demand.) What’s next for Ethereum? Bull case: With ETF inflows, corporate treasuries, and a friendlier retirement-plan backdrop, a run toward $5,000 is squarely on the table. Some banks now float end-2025 targets as high as $7,500, citing deep institutional demand and tightening supply. Risks: Policy shifts, delayed or adverse rulings, macro shocks, and whale distribution can blunt momentum. Also note: staking is not enabled in U.S. spot ETH ETFs today-removing a potential yield component that could further attract long-term holders if allowed later. Base case into Q4 2025: If flows remain positive and corporates continue accumulating, institutional ETH demand should keep the trend constructive. Watch ETF flow streaks, treasury announcements, and macro prints for confirmation. Conclusion With Wall Street, corporate treasuries, and long-horizon retirement money lining up behind Ethereum, this ETH rally has a different backbone. If the Ethereum ETF inflows & corporate treasuries trend persists, the next leg higher could be less about hype and more about structural demand. Get seen where it counts.

Total lending protocol deposits have officially reached an astounding all-time-high of $100 billion. This significant achievement, reported by Unfolded via X, underscores the rapidly expanding trust and participation in the DeFi ecosystem. For anyone tracking the pulse of cryptocurrency lending , this figure is a clear signal of robust growth and increasing utility within the space. What’s Driving This Monumental Growth in Lending Protocol Deposits? This remarkable surge in lending protocol deposits isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several factors contribute to the escalating interest in DeFi lending platforms. Investors and users are increasingly drawn to the unique opportunities these protocols offer, moving beyond traditional finance models. Attractive Yields: Many DeFi lending protocols offer significantly higher interest rates on deposits compared to traditional savings accounts. This potential for greater returns naturally attracts capital. Accessibility: Decentralized finance removes many barriers to entry. Anyone with an internet connection and cryptocurrency can participate, regardless of geographical location or credit score. Transparency: Operations on blockchain-based protocols are typically transparent and auditable. Smart contracts govern the rules, providing a level of trust that appeals to many users. Innovation: The continuous development of new features, improved user interfaces, and integration with other DeFi primitives makes these platforms more appealing and user-friendly. The Mechanics Behind Crypto Deposits: How Do Lending Protocols Work? Understanding how crypto deposits function within these protocols is key to appreciating their success. At its core, a lending protocol facilitates peer-to-peer or pooled lending and borrowing using smart contracts on a blockchain. When you make a deposit, you are essentially providing liquidity to the protocol. Here’s a simplified breakdown: Depositing Assets: Users deposit cryptocurrencies (like stablecoins, Ethereum, or Bitcoin) into a smart contract. These deposited funds form a liquidity pool. Earning Interest: In return for providing liquidity, depositors earn interest, which comes from borrowers paying interest on the funds they take out. The interest rates often fluctuate based on supply and demand within the protocol. Borrowing Assets: Other users can then borrow from this liquidity pool, typically by providing collateral (often more valuable than the borrowed amount) to secure their loan. This overcollateralization protects the lenders. Automated Management: Smart contracts automate the entire process, from interest accrual to collateral management and liquidation if a loan becomes undercollateralized. This automation reduces the need for intermediaries. This system has allowed for an unprecedented flow of capital into the decentralized finance ecosystem, culminating in the impressive $100 billion milestone. Navigating the Landscape: Opportunities and Challenges in Decentralized Finance While the $100 billion milestone for lending protocol deposits highlights immense potential, it’s crucial to acknowledge both the opportunities and the inherent challenges within the decentralized finance space. This balance is vital for informed participation and sustainable growth. Opportunities abound: Passive Income Generation: Depositing idle crypto assets can generate substantial passive income through lending interest and sometimes additional token rewards. Financial Inclusion: DeFi offers financial services to anyone with internet access, potentially banking the unbanked globally. Innovation Hub: The sector is a hotbed of innovation, constantly evolving with new protocols, strategies, and integrations. However, challenges persist: Smart Contract Risks: Bugs or vulnerabilities in smart contract code can lead to significant financial losses. Audits help, but risks remain. Volatility: The underlying cryptocurrency assets are highly volatile, which can impact collateral values and overall portfolio health. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for DeFi is still evolving, posing potential risks for future operations and compliance. Impermanent Loss: While more common in liquidity pools for DEXs, understanding how asset price changes can affect returns is crucial for any DeFi participant. To navigate this dynamic environment, users should conduct thorough research, understand the risks associated with specific protocols, and consider diversifying their crypto deposits across different platforms and assets. The $100 billion in lending protocol deposits marks a significant chapter in the maturation of decentralized finance. It reflects a growing confidence in the utility and potential of DeFi lending as a viable alternative to traditional financial services. As the ecosystem continues to evolve, these protocols will likely play an even larger role in shaping the future of global finance. This milestone isn’t just a number; it’s a testament to the collective belief in a more open, accessible, and efficient financial future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are lending protocols in cryptocurrency? A1: Lending protocols are decentralized applications (dApps) built on blockchain technology that allow users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies without needing traditional financial intermediaries like banks. They use smart contracts to automate the terms and conditions of loans. Q2: Why have lending protocol deposits reached such a high value? A2: The surge is primarily driven by attractive interest rates offered compared to traditional finance, increased accessibility for global users, the transparency of blockchain operations, and continuous innovation within the decentralized finance sector. Q3: Are there significant risks associated with depositing funds into lending protocols? A3: Yes, risks include smart contract vulnerabilities, the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency assets, potential for impermanent loss (though less direct in simple lending), and an evolving regulatory environment. Always conduct thorough due diligence. Q4: How can an individual participate in crypto lending? A4: To participate, you need a cryptocurrency wallet, some crypto assets to deposit, and to choose a reputable lending protocol. Research different protocols, understand their terms, and connect your wallet to deposit your assets into their liquidity pools. Q5: What is the significance of the $100 billion milestone for decentralized finance? A5: This milestone signifies a major vote of confidence in the stability and utility of DeFi. It demonstrates the growing adoption of decentralized financial services and positions lending protocols as a foundational component of the future financial landscape.

Recent data reveals that combined Ethereum holdings by treasury companies and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have now surpassed an astonishing 10 million ETH. This significant accumulation underscores a growing institutional confidence in the second-largest cryptocurrency. According to analytics from StrategicEthReserve, the total stands at 10.01 million ETH, valued at approximately $46.22 billion. This figure represents a crucial shift in how major entities view and engage with digital assets, especially Ethereum. What Do These Ethereum Holdings Signify? This impressive figure is broken down into two main categories: corporate treasuries and Ethereum ETFs . Each plays a distinct role in the broader adoption narrative of Ethereum. Corporate Treasuries: Companies holding ETH on their balance sheets account for 3.57 million ETH, valued at about $16.49 billion. These are firms that have chosen to diversify their assets or use Ethereum for operational purposes, integrating it into their financial strategies. ETFs: Investment vehicles, primarily spot and futures ETFs, hold a larger portion at 6.44 million ETH, worth approximately $29.73 billion. These funds provide traditional investors with exposure to Ethereum without directly owning the cryptocurrency. The collective sum of these ETH institutional holdings signals a powerful trend. It suggests that institutions are not just experimenting with crypto; they are making substantial, long-term commitments to the Ethereum ecosystem. This marks a pivotal moment for the asset’s legitimacy. Why the Surge in Ethereum Investment? The increasing appetite for Ethereum investment from institutional players is driven by several compelling factors. Ethereum’s robust ecosystem, its pivotal role in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Web3 applications make it an attractive asset. Furthermore, Ethereum’s transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism has enhanced its appeal. This shift promises greater energy efficiency and the potential for staking rewards, making it more sustainable and potentially profitable for large holders. Institutions also view Ethereum as a diversification tool. In an era of evolving financial landscapes, digital assets offer new avenues for growth and risk management. A strong crypto treasury position can enhance a company’s financial resilience and forward-thinking stance. The Market Impact of Growing ETH Institutional Holdings The substantial growth in ETH institutional holdings carries significant implications for the broader crypto market. Firstly, it often contributes to increased market stability. Large institutional buys and holds can reduce volatility compared to purely retail-driven markets. Secondly, it enhances Ethereum’s credibility. When established financial entities and corporations commit significant capital, it signals to other potential investors that Ethereum is a serious and viable asset class. This can attract even more capital, fostering a positive feedback loop. However, it also means that large institutional movements could have a more pronounced effect on price. While accumulation is generally positive, any significant sell-offs by these large holders could impact market dynamics. Regulators are also closely watching this space, which could lead to new policies affecting these holdings. What’s Next for Ethereum Investment? The trajectory for Ethereum investment appears strong. The ongoing discussions and potential approvals of spot Ethereum ETFs in major markets could further open the floodgates for institutional capital. This would make it even easier for traditional investors to gain exposure. As the Ethereum network continues to develop and scale, its utility across various sectors is expected to expand. This sustained innovation will likely maintain institutional interest and potentially drive even larger Ethereum holdings in the future. The long-term outlook remains optimistic, with institutional adoption serving as a powerful catalyst. In conclusion, the surpassing of 10 million ETH in institutional and treasury hands is more than just a number; it is a profound indicator of Ethereum’s increasing maturity and its undeniable presence in the global financial landscape. This trend solidifies Ethereum’s position as a foundational digital asset, attracting substantial capital and paving the way for its continued evolution. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are Ethereum treasury holdings? Ethereum treasury holdings refer to the amount of ETH held directly on the balance sheets of corporations and private companies, often as a strategic asset or for operational use within the crypto ecosystem. What are Ethereum ETFs? Ethereum ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without directly owning the cryptocurrency. They are traded on traditional stock exchanges. Why are institutions increasing their Ethereum investment? Institutions are increasing their Ethereum investment due to its robust ecosystem, its role in DeFi and Web3, potential staking rewards from its Proof-of-Stake mechanism, and its value as a diversification asset in their portfolios. How do ETH institutional holdings impact the Ethereum market? Growing ETH institutional holdings can lead to increased market stability, enhanced credibility for Ethereum, and potentially higher demand, though large movements by these holders could also influence price volatility. Is this a good sign for Ethereum’s future? Yes, the significant increase in Ethereum holdings by institutions is generally considered a very positive sign, indicating growing confidence, maturity, and long-term potential for Ethereum.

The aerospace company, led by Elon Musk, now holds over $1 billion worth of Bitcoin. This milestone comes as the top coin recently reached a fresh all-time high. The rise in Bitcoin’s value is part of a wider market surge driven by hopes of lower interest rates in the United States. The SpaceX Bitcoin History Recent data from Arkham Intelligence shows that SpaceX currently owns 8,285 BTC, valued at about $1.02 billion. This is not the first time SpaceX’s crypto stash has been over $1 billion. In April 2021, its Bitcoin was worth about $1.8 billion, with roughly 28,000 BTC. However, in mid-2022, SpaceX cut its holdings by around 70% during a tough time for the crypto market. That year saw major events such as the collapse of the Terra-Luna project in May. Adding to the woes, the FTX exchange went bankrupt in November, among other market failures. Since that time, SpaceX has not bought more Bitcoin. Tesla, also led by Elon Musk, sold most of its Bitcoin in 2022. It now holds 11,509 BTC worth about $1.42 billion, showing caution during the market downturn. Bitcoin Hits New Record Before Falling Amid Ongoing Volatility The flagship crypto price hit a new peak on August 13, going above its previous record set in July. It reached more than $124,300 before settling at about $123,117. The surge pushed Bitcoin’s market value to $2.452 trillion, higher than Google’s $2.448 trillion. However, its price has now fallen to $119,047, down by 2.24% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. This is due to market volatility and uncertainty. Many crypto and financial experts have commented on Bitcoin’s highly volatile nature in the past. In March, Deutsche Bank said the top coin is likely to stay highly volatile , stating that its fixed supply limit of 21 million coins adds to this problem of low liquidity. Bitcoin Rally Fueled by Hopes of Fed Rate Cut and Bull Market Ahead The latest rise in Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and other cryptocurrencies is linked to expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve may cut interest rates in September. This optimism grew after July’s inflation rate stayed the same as June’s, despite pressure from tariffs. The steady figure increased expectations of a potential rate cut. Also, analysts revealed that Bitcoin is in a mid-cycle phase that could lead to a major bull run. They predict its price could rise four to ten times, possibly topping $500,000 in the coming years. This could also trigger gains in other digital coins. All eyes are now on the top coin to see whether it can surpass Apple’s valuation of $3.4 trillion .

DOGE has surged over 17% this week on the back of whale purchases exceeding 1 billion DOGE and speculation over an ETF approval. Meanwhile, SHIB has jumped 4.4% in 24 hours, riding a 48,000% burn-rate spike and a bullish double-bottom chart pattern targeting $0.0000254. Yet, despite these bullish developments, large-wallet holders from both communities are increasingly allocating capital to Pepe Dollar (PEPD) , a project that blends meme branding with functional blockchain integration. Why Whales Are Rotating Into PEPD Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have loyal followings, but much of their market action relies on hype cycles. Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is positioned differently — as a meme coin with Ethereum Layer-2 scaling, a governance framework, and NFT staking mechanics. It also parodies the U.S. Federal Reserve, giving it a built-in viral narrative. This combination means it can capture both speculative traders and utility-focused investors, creating a deeper, more resilient demand base than meme coins built purely on sentiment. Capitalizing on Early Entry Economics For whales, the math is simple. Pepe Dollar (PEPD) ’s Stage 1 presale price of $0.004688, with an already-confirmed launch at $0.03695, offers a multiple that neither SHIB nor DOGE can match at current valuations. By reallocating a fraction of their SHIB or DOGE holdings into PEPD now, these investors aim to multiply their upside potential. Given that SHIB would need a multi-trillion-dollar market cap to replicate similar gains from here, the risk-reward ratio for Pepe Dollar (PEPD) becomes highly attractive. Conclusion: Meme Survival of the Fittest Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) aren’t disappearing overnight, but the meme coin space is evolving. Utility-driven projects like Pepe Dollar (PEPD) are drawing in capital from even the most established communities. If Pepe Dollar (PEPD) delivers on its roadmap while maintaining meme culture relevance, it could signal a turning point — where legacy meme coins see market share eroded by new entrants with both humor and utility. For whales, the shift is already underway.

On August 14, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released July Producer Price Index (PPI) data showing an annual rate of 3.3%, with the previous month’s figure revised upward from 2.3% to 2.4%. This exceeded market expectations of 2.5% and brought the month-over-month PPI inflation to its hottest point since March 2022. This week's inflation data was not ideal. Core CPI inflation is now up to 3.1% and both headline and Core PPI inflation are above 3.0%. As seen in the below chart, per Zerohedge, PPI inflation is clearly re-accelerating. But, here's where it gets even more interesting. pic.twitter.com/xOI6nYu778 — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) August 14, 2025 The surprise inflation reading has had devastating consequences for crypto markets, which plummeted by 2.2% amid cascading liquidation waves hitting Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and other major cryptocurrencies. $1.05B Liquidation Massacre Indicates Pause in the Crypto Bull Run Data from Coinglass reveals the extent of the massacre, showing that over the past 24 hours, more than $781 million in long positions were obliterated while over $270 million in shorts were simultaneously wiped out. Bybit bore the heaviest casualties, accounting for over 42% of liquidations with approximately $447 million in leveraged positions destroyed. Other major centralized exchanges, including Binance, OKX, and Gate.io, recorded combined liquidations totaling $495 million. Source: Coinglass Examining asset performance, Ethereum (ETH) suffered the most severe damage, falling 3.78%, with over $229 million in long positions and $80.22 million in short positions annihilated. Bitcoin (BTC) declined 2.98%, erasing over $253 million in leveraged positions. Other major casualties included SOL (-5.12%), XRP (-6.63%), DOGE (-8.90%), and SUI (-6.73%). Source: Coinglass Only Cardano (ADA) managed to stay in positive territory among the top 20 cryptocurrencies, gaining 3.96%. The liquidation frenzy claimed notable victims, including popular trader AguilaTrades, who lost 18,323 ETH ($83.56 million), leaving only $330,000 in their account. Caught in the market crash, AguilaTrades( @AguilaTrades ) was liquidated for 18,323 $ETH ($83.56M) again.

Ethereum was merely $120 away from setting its own record, while Solana appeared set to challenge previous peaks after breaking above $208. The trio now trades at drastically reduced levels, with Bitcoin at $118,089, Ethereum at $4,586.76, and Solana at $194.18. Treasury Secretary Crushes Crypto Bull Run Dreams Adding fuel to the bearish fire, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent declared on FOX Business Live that “THE U.S. WILL NOT BE BUYING ANY BITCOIN.” He clarified that the government will only retain the $15-$20 billion in Bitcoin currently held and any additional assets obtained through confiscation. JUST IN: Treasury Secretary Bessent says the US Government is ""not going to be buying"" Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/vL79P531CP — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) August 14, 2025 This statement directly contradicts previous promises regarding a U.S. Bitcoin stockpile and a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , dealing another blow to market sentiment. While Bessent indicated the government would cease selling its Bitcoin holdings, the gloomy revelation has propagated the “market has topped” narrative, prompting many investors to exit positions at losses or breakeven points. Market psychology has undergone a dramatic transformation, reflected in the crypto Fear and Greed Index , which currently stands at 66. Source: CoinMarketCap This represents a major journey from the extreme fear level of 15 recorded in March. Just one week ago, the index registered a neutral 51, but Ethereum’s impressive rally and Bitcoin’s overlapping surge rekindled hopes of a generational bull run. The sudden liquidation event has crushed these aspirations, leaving market participants in a state of exhaustion. Crypto analyst “TradeWithThanos” warns that a bear market may be imminent and advises extreme caution, particularly ahead of the next FOMC meeting in September.

The current level of around $119,000 has established itself as a formidable resistance, with the price rejecting after tapping into a fair value gap (FVG). Chart analysis suggests that if this rejection persists, Bitcoin could retrace toward the mid-$110,000 region. Source: TradingView/ TradeNation The unfilled gap around $108,000–$110,000 presents a strong price magnet, aligning with the last unfilled gap from the recent rally. Should this support level fail, deeper purple support zones could face testing. Overall, the technical bias favors a corrective downward movement before any renewed attempt to reclaim recent highs.

However, leading experts are providing a different perspective. They view this recent decline not as a cause for alarm, but as a healthy crypto market correction , signaling resilience and a natural part of its growth cycle. This viewpoint suggests that the market is simply rebalancing after a period of rapid gains. Understanding the Current Crypto Market Correction David Siemer, co-founder and CEO of Wave Digital Assets, has characterized this most recent crypto market movement as a healthy one. He explains that profit-taking crypto is perfectly normal after a sharp rally. It allows the market to consolidate gains and prepare for future growth. During this period, over $1 billion worth of cryptocurrency futures positions faced liquidation in the past 24 hours. Most of these were long positions, indicating that excessive leverage is being cleared from the system. This clearing process is often seen as beneficial, setting the stage for more sustainable price action. Why is Bitcoin’s Role Crucial in Institutional Crypto Strategies? According to CoinDesk, Siemer emphasized that Bitcoin’s role remains central within institutional cryptocurrency strategies. Large financial institutions and asset managers continue to view Bitcoin as a fundamental component of their digital asset portfolios. This sustained interest from significant players provides a strong foundation for the entire crypto ecosystem. Institutional adoption means more than just buying Bitcoin; it involves integrating it into broader investment frameworks. These sophisticated institutional crypto strategies often involve long-term holding periods and diversification, which helps absorb short-term volatility. Their continued commitment underlines Bitcoin’s perceived value as a store of wealth and a hedge against traditional market uncertainties. Is the Market Outlook Positive Despite the Dip? Joel Kruger, a market strategist at LMAX Group, added his voice to the optimistic chorus. He stated that the current profit-taking crypto activity is not surprising given the market’s previous ascent. Importantly, Kruger maintains that the overall market outlook positive , suggesting that the decline will likely end soon. This sentiment is crucial for investor confidence. It implies that the underlying fundamentals of the crypto market remain strong, and the current price action is merely a cyclical adjustment rather than a sign of deeper issues. A positive outlook encourages long-term investors to hold their positions or even consider buying the dip. Navigating Profit-Taking in Crypto Investments For individual investors, understanding the concept of profit-taking crypto is essential. It is a natural market phenomenon where investors sell their digital assets to lock in gains, especially after a significant price increase. This activity contributes to the ebb and flow of the market. Rather than panic selling, consider these periods as opportunities. A healthy crypto market correction can present chances for dollar-cost averaging or rebalancing your portfolio. Focusing on long-term goals and fundamental analysis can help navigate these short-term fluctuations effectively. In conclusion, the recent downturn in the crypto market is largely being interpreted as a healthy and necessary adjustment. Experts like David Siemer and Joel Kruger highlight the normalcy of profit-taking crypto and reinforce the robust nature of Bitcoin’s role within institutional frameworks. The overarching market outlook positive , suggesting that this temporary phase will soon give way to renewed growth and stability for the digital asset space. This perspective offers reassurance, painting a picture of a resilient and maturing industry. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does a ‘healthy crypto market correction’ mean? A: A healthy crypto market correction refers to a temporary decline in asset prices after a significant rally. It’s considered normal and beneficial as it clears out excess speculation and leverage, allowing the market to consolidate gains and build a stronger foundation for future growth. Q: Why is Bitcoin considered a core asset for institutions? A: Bitcoin is seen as a core asset for institutional crypto strategies due to its scarcity, decentralized nature, and growing acceptance as a store of value. Institutions often view it as a long-term investment and a potential hedge against inflation, integrating it into their diversified portfolios. Q: What is ‘profit-taking crypto’ and how does it affect the market? A: Profit-taking crypto is when investors sell their digital assets after a period of price appreciation to realize their gains. While it can lead to short-term price dips, it’s a natural part of market cycles. It helps rebalance the market and prevents assets from becoming overvalued, contributing to a more sustainable market outlook positive. Q: How long do these market corrections typically last? A: The duration of a crypto market correction can vary significantly, from a few days to several weeks or even months. Experts like Joel Kruger suggest that the current decline will likely end soon, indicating that the underlying market sentiment remains strong despite the temporary dip. Q: Should I be worried about the recent liquidations in crypto futures? A: While large liquidations, particularly of long positions, can cause sharp price drops, they often serve to ‘cleanse’ the market of excessive leverage. This can lead to a healthier market environment in the long run, reducing speculative bubbles and fostering more stable growth.

These are household names in crypto circles, each having ridden its wave of explosive rallies. But if you’re looking for early-stage, high-upside opportunities in 2025, these legacy players aren’t it.Instead, a new memecoin contender— Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) —has quietly entered the arena. Priced under $0.0025 and currently in presale, it’s not just a coin. It’s an emerging ecosystem blending meme culture with Layer 2 blockchain utility, with a $2.50 price target and significant community buzz. Let’s explain why $LILPEPE could be the last real early-stage play left standing. The Early Days Are Gone for Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin Each of these established cryptos had its golden era. Solana surged nearly 12,000% in 2021 amid NFT hype. Thanks to memes and Elon Musk, Dogecoin shot from fractions of a penny to $0.45 in 2021. XRP delivered 100x returns in its 2017 run. But these stories are mostly written. Now sitting on multi-billion dollar market caps and heavy liquidity, their capacity for 100x returns is realistically behind them. Regulation, market saturation, and maturity mean they now reflect stability—not explosive upside. Introducing LILPEPE—A Meme Coin With Real Infrastructure Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is not your average memecoin. As of writing, it’s trading in the presale phase at $0.0019 with a target listing price of $0.003. So far, over $16.7 million has been raised from more than 11.3 billion tokens sold, with the presale nearing its cap of 12.75 billion tokens. But beyond the humor and frog-themed branding, Little Pepe is building something substantial: a Layer 2 Ethereum-compatible blockchain. Unlike other memecoins that offer nothing more than hype, $LILPEPE introduces: Ultra-fast transaction speeds Zero tax on buys and sells Smart-contract audited codebase EVM compatibility for broader dApp integration Staking rewards and meme launchpad functionality This positions LILPEPE in a hybrid category—a meme project with foundational blockchain tech. That’s rare, and that’s what makes it different. $2.50 Price Target? The Math Makes Sense Let’s talk numbers. At under $0.0025, LILPEPE is in microcap territory. With only 20 billion tokens in its initial circulating supply and a capped total supply of 100 billion, even modest growth could send its market cap soaring. At a hypothetical $2.50 valuation, that’s a 1,300x return from today’s presale price—unrealistic for most large caps, but possible for small, early-stage tokens in high-conviction communities. With structured vesting schedules, a three-month cliff for presale tokens, and just 5% unlocked every 30 days thereafter, LILPEPE has mechanisms to prevent early dumping and protect the token price at launch. Community Traction & Visibility Are Already in Motion LILPEPE isn’t starting from zero. It’s already been: Listed on CoinMarketCap for visibility Audited for smart contract security Building a community with over 194,000 entries in its $777,000 giveaway campaign , including ten lucky winners, each set to receive $77,000 worth of tokens. Actively engaged in partnerships and marketing, with 10% of the token supply allocated for viral meme content, influencer collaborations, and large-scale promotions. For a memecoin, visibility is everything. But this isn’t just noise—it’s part of a well-funded, deliberate go-to-market strategy. How to Get In Early With plans to list on top-tier exchanges and Uniswap after the presale, early investors are positioning themselves ahead of the expected wave of public interest. As of writing, the presale is still active. To participate: Download MetaMask or Trust Wallet Fund your wallet with ETH or USDT on the Ethereum (ERC-20) network. Visit the official LILPEPE website and purchase a minimum of $100 worth of tokens. Once the presale ends, connect your wallet to the site to claim your $LILPEPE tokens. Final Thoughts: LILPEPE Is the Meme Coin Opportunity That’s Still Early Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin will always hold a place in crypto’s history books—but history doesn’t pay like future potential. Their days of 1,000x gains are long behind us. For investors in 2025 looking to catch the next wave before it breaks, Little Pepe offers a unique mix of early-stage pricing, real infrastructure, and viral potential. If you’re done chasing late-cycle coins and want to plant a flag in a meme project with substance, LILPEPE might be the opportunity worth jumping into—while it’s still under $0.0025. Don’t just watch another memecoin moon. Get in early, stake your claim, and let the green candles tell your story. Visit the official LILPEPE site to join the presale and secure your position before the next leg up.

Mena Theodorou, co-founder of Australian cryptocurrency exchange Coinstash, said that the executive order issued by US President Donald Trump allowing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to be included in retirement plans will open the door to a $12.5 trillion market for digital assets. “The surge to $150,000 and above could happen faster than many people expect,” Theodorou said, adding that 401(k) plans would give crypto companies access to approximately 90 million accounts and that this step could be adopted by other countries. Related News: Ripple Vice President Claims XRP Network is Fully Prepared for Future Technology Not only does Theodorou share his optimism, but Bernstein, Bitwise, and Standard Chartered also predict that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 before the year is out. Analysts say the rally is fueled by Trump's executive order, steady inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, the addition of crypto assets to their balance sheets by more than 200 companies, and a weakening US dollar. Furthermore, lower-than-expected US inflation is also pushing prices higher. Zerocap analyst Emir Ibrahim said this rise is being driven by institutional adoption, real-world integration and deep global liquidity, unlike the retail investor-driven speculation of past bull runs. *This is not investment advice.

Major players like Charles Schwab and Fidelity are not just observing the cryptocurrency space; they are actively diving in. This commitment is evident through a significant crypto hiring boom , signaling a profound embrace of digital assets by traditional finance. It marks a pivotal moment, promising to reshape how we interact with cryptocurrencies. What’s Fueling This Crypto Hiring Boom? The surge in crypto-related job openings at established financial institutions isn’t random. It is a direct response to a clearer regulatory landscape emerging in the United States. For years, uncertainty kept many large firms on the sidelines. Now, with more defined rules taking shape, these giants feel confident enough to invest heavily in talent and infrastructure. For instance, the push follows legislative developments like the GENIUS Act. Additionally, upcoming Senate action on crypto market rules is providing the clarity needed. This evolving regulatory environment is a key catalyst, paving the way for significant institutional crypto adoption . How Are Financial Giants Embracing Institutional Crypto Adoption? The actions of firms like Schwab and Fidelity speak volumes about their long-term vision for digital assets. They are not just dabbling; they are building foundational capabilities. This involves integrating crypto services deeply into their existing offerings, making digital assets more accessible to a wider audience. Charles Schwab’s Ambitions: Schwab has ambitious Schwab crypto plans , aiming to offer Bitcoin and Ethereum spot trading by April 2026. This move would provide millions of their clients direct access to the two largest cryptocurrencies, a game-changer for mainstream adoption. Fidelity’s Strategic Roles: Fidelity, already a pioneer in the crypto space, is actively seeking a crypto risk analyst. This role highlights their focus on building robust, compliant, and secure frameworks for their digital asset services. These Fidelity crypto roles are critical for managing the unique challenges of the crypto market. What Do Schwab Crypto Plans Mean for Investors? The prospect of Schwab offering direct Bitcoin and Ethereum spot trading is huge for individual and institutional investors alike. It means a more streamlined, regulated, and potentially safer way to engage with these digital assets. Investors who prefer to keep their assets within established financial ecosystems will soon have that option. By April 2026, the landscape of crypto investing could look very different. The move by Schwab validates cryptocurrencies as legitimate investment vehicles, potentially drawing in even more capital and participants. This increased accessibility will likely reduce barriers to entry for many who have been hesitant about the crypto market. The Strategic Importance of Fidelity Crypto Roles Fidelity’s proactive approach to hiring, particularly for roles like a crypto risk analyst, underscores a commitment to responsible innovation. These specialized Fidelity crypto roles are essential for navigating the complexities of digital asset security, compliance, and market volatility. They help ensure that as Fidelity expands its crypto offerings, it does so with a strong emphasis on protecting client interests. Such hires also indicate a broader trend: financial institutions are building in-house expertise rather than relying solely on third-party solutions. This deepens their understanding of the crypto ecosystem and allows for more tailored and integrated services. Navigating the Future of US Crypto Regulation The momentum behind this crypto hiring boom is intrinsically linked to the ongoing developments in US crypto regulation . Clearer rules foster confidence, not just for financial institutions but for the entire market. As the Senate continues to deliberate on crypto market rules, the outcomes will shape the operational frameworks for these new ventures. Robust regulation can provide the necessary guardrails for growth, protecting consumers and fostering innovation. While challenges remain, the current regulatory trajectory appears to be moving towards greater clarity, which is a net positive for the industry’s maturation. In conclusion, the expanding crypto hiring efforts by financial powerhouses like Schwab and Fidelity are more than just a recruitment drive. They signify a definitive turning point in the integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. This strategic pivot, driven by evolving US crypto regulation and a growing understanding of the asset class, promises to unlock unprecedented opportunities for investors and further solidify institutional crypto adoption . The future of finance is undoubtedly becoming more digital, and these firms are leading the charge. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why are traditional financial firms hiring so many crypto experts? Traditional financial firms are increasing their crypto hiring due to clearer regulatory guidance in the U.S. and growing client demand for digital asset services. They aim to build in-house expertise and infrastructure to offer compliant and secure crypto products. Q2: What are Charles Schwab’s specific plans for crypto trading? Charles Schwab plans to offer Bitcoin and Ethereum spot trading to its clients by April 2026. This move will provide direct access to these major cryptocurrencies through their established platforms. Q3: How does new US crypto regulation impact this trend? New US crypto regulation provides the necessary clarity and legal frameworks for financial institutions to confidently enter the crypto market. This reduces risk and encourages investment in digital asset services and talent. Q4: What does “institutional crypto adoption” mean for the average investor? Institutional crypto adoption means increased legitimacy, liquidity, and accessibility for cryptocurrencies. For the average investor, it could lead to more regulated and user-friendly ways to buy, sell, and hold digital assets through their existing financial providers. Q5: What types of crypto roles are financial firms seeking? Financial firms are seeking a variety of Fidelity crypto roles and similar positions, including crypto risk analysts, blockchain developers, compliance officers, digital asset strategists, and cybersecurity experts specializing in crypto.

Mid-Term Price Prediction For ETH & SOL",https://bitzo.com/2025/08/ethereum-made-an-ath-solana-next-mid-term-price-prediction-for-eth-sol,"Ethereum has just hit its highest value ever, sparking speculation about the next big mover in the crypto market. Eyes are now turning to Solana, with many wondering if it could be the next coin to surge. This article delves into the mid-term price predictions for both ETH and SOL , highlighting the factors that could influence their growth. Ethereum Riding a Strong Bullish Wave Ethereum advanced 56.85% over the last month and recorded a 28.27% one week gain, showing a steady upward move that attracted increasing investor interest and boosted market sentiment. Over the past six months, gains reached 73.40%, reflecting an asset that steadily built momentum amid dynamic trading sessions. Rising volumes and favorable technical readings underlined the asset's robust performance in a competitive market. Consistent growth and resilient price action have marked Ethereum’s progression, shaping a backdrop that supports its ongoing bullish performance. Currently, Ethereum trades in a range between $2736.67 and $4301.41, with traders eyeing key levels to shape their strategies. The nearest resistance level sits near $4903.83, while strong support is established at $1774.34. Technical indicators continue to favor bullish sentiment, supported by high momentum and an Awesome Oscillator at 756.36. The RSI at 78.82 indicates overbought conditions, suggesting potential pullbacks, yet overall bullish energy prevails. Trading ideas include cautious entries near support and profit-taking near resistance, with the market remaining open to volatility, urging traders to use tight stop-losses. Solana Price Surge: Key Levels and Market Dynamics Solana experienced a significant upswing over the past month, gaining 27.25%, while showing modest growth of 3.52% over six months. Price movements between $142.77 and $204.08 highlighted active trading and shifts in market sentiment. The recent rally reflects renewed investor interest in a coin that had previously shown subdued performance. This short-term surge contrasts with the overall longer-term gains, as traders navigated volatility and made adjustments to take advantage of technical signals. The market has mirrored a blend of optimism and caution, propelling recent price movements. Currently, Solana is trading between $142.77 and $204.08, with bulls and bears keeping a close watch. Key resistance is at $235.85 and support is at $113.23, guiding trader strategies. Bulls are trying to push the price towards resistance, while bears are focused on maintaining the lower boundary. A secondary resistance at $297.16 poses additional challenges for upward moves. On the downside, support near $51.92 is crucial if sentiment declines. Technical indicators are mixed; the Momentum Indicator stands at 36.75, and the RSI is close to 68, signaling potential exhaustion in buying pressure. Despite the recent rallies, the market lacks a clear trend, suggesting that traders should look for opportunities to accumulate on pullbacks and consider profit-taking near resistance levels while using stop losses to safeguard positions. Conclusion ETH reached an all-time high, showing strong market potential. SOL might follow this trend in the near term. ETH's growth suggests continued interest and investment. SOL's recent performance hints at potential gains ahead. Investors are watching both ETH and SOL closely. Given recent patterns, ETH and SOL might see positive movements soon.

According to a report by the Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X, Trump stated that inflation has fallen to a ‘perfect level,’ effectively claiming there’s ‘virtually no inflation’ at all. This declaration presents a unique perspective on the current economic climate, especially as global markets continue to grapple with various price pressures. What Do Trump’s Inflation Views Mean for the Economy? When a prominent figure like Donald Trump shares his Trump’s inflation views , it naturally sparks widespread discussion among economists, investors, and the general public. Inflation, at its core, refers to the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, which consequently means purchasing power is falling. Central banks worldwide typically aim for a low, stable rate of inflation, often around 2%, considering it healthy for sustainable economic growth. Trump’s assertion of ‘virtually non-existent’ inflation stands in contrast to recent reports that, while showing inflation cooling from its peaks, still indicate prices are above pre-pandemic levels. This perspective suggests a belief in a robust economy that has successfully navigated previous price surges. Understanding the Current State of US Inflation To fully grasp the context of Trump’s comments, it is important to examine the actual state of US inflation . Various economic indicators, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, help us track price changes. While both metrics have shown a significant deceleration from their mid-2022 peaks, they haven’t yet consistently reached the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. For instance, recent CPI reports indicate a slowdown, but core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, has proven stickier. This suggests that while headline inflation may be easing, underlying price pressures could persist. Headline Inflation: This measure, which includes all goods and services, has seen a notable moderation. Core Inflation: Excluding volatile items, this measure often gives a clearer picture of underlying price trends and has been more stubborn. Federal Reserve’s Stance: Policymakers are closely monitoring all data to determine future monetary policy decisions. How Does This Impact Economic Stability? The perception of inflation, whether high or ‘virtually non-existent,’ directly influences economic stability . If consumers and businesses believe prices are under control, it can foster confidence, encourage spending, and support investment. Conversely, high or unpredictable inflation can erode purchasing power and create widespread uncertainty. A key challenge for policymakers is managing expectations. If the public widely believes inflation is gone, it could lead to different spending and investment behaviors than if they anticipate ongoing price increases. This dynamic plays a crucial role in shaping future economic trends and overall market sentiment. Can Cryptocurrency Serve as an Inflation Hedge? In periods of economic uncertainty or perceived inflation, many investors actively seek assets that can act as a cryptocurrency inflation hedge . Historically, assets like gold have been considered traditional safe havens. However, in recent years, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have gained significant attention for their potential to store value independently of traditional fiat currencies. The argument for crypto as an inflation hedge often centers on its decentralized nature and limited supply, particularly for assets like Bitcoin. Proponents suggest that unlike fiat currencies, which can be printed in unlimited quantities, Bitcoin’s scarcity could potentially protect purchasing power during inflationary periods. However, it is important to remember that cryptocurrencies are highly volatile. Their prices can fluctuate dramatically, making them a risky hedge for some. Their effectiveness as an inflation hedge is still a subject of ongoing debate and depends heavily on broader market conditions and investor sentiment. Navigating the Nuances of the Inflation Outlook Donald Trump’s recent comments certainly add a unique dimension to the ongoing discussion about the inflation outlook . While official economic data suggests inflation is cooling but not entirely gone, his perspective highlights the varied interpretations of current financial health. For investors and the public, understanding these different viewpoints is crucial. Whether inflation is ‘virtually non-existent’ or simply moderating, staying informed about economic indicators and their potential impact on both traditional markets and emerging assets like cryptocurrency remains paramount. The economic landscape is complex, and diverse perspectives contribute to a fuller understanding. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What did Donald Trump say about inflation? Donald Trump stated that inflation has fallen to a ‘perfect level’ and that there is ‘virtually no inflation,’ according to a report by Walter Bloomberg economic news. Q2: How is inflation typically measured? Inflation is commonly measured using indices like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, which track changes in the prices of goods and services over time. Q3: Is core inflation different from headline inflation? Yes, headline inflation includes all goods and services, while core inflation excludes volatile items like food and energy prices, providing a clearer picture of underlying price trends. Q4: Can cryptocurrency act as an inflation hedge? Some argue that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can serve as an inflation hedge due to their decentralized nature and limited supply. However, their high volatility means their effectiveness as a hedge is still debated and depends on market conditions. Q5: What is the Federal Reserve’s inflation target? The Federal Reserve typically aims for a stable, long-term inflation rate of around 2%, which it considers healthy for economic growth and stability. Did you find this analysis insightful?

Whether it can reach $1 will depend on breaking past those levels. VeChain (VET) is steady at $0.0255, with forecasts stretching to $0.24 by 2031 as momentum slowly builds. Both are showing progress, but BlockDAG (BDAG) is on another level. The presale has crossed $374M with over 25.1 billion coins sold. Since Batch 1, the price has risen 2,660%, with a near-term projection of $1. Batch 29 is active at $0.0276, and its Demo Trading Dashboard V4 already lets holders experience trading in a live, exchange-like environment before launch, giving a preview of what could be a high-demand debut. Stellar (XLM) Price Prediction Targets $0.63 Stellar’s price prediction draws from recent bullish patterns, including a falling wedge and a confirmed double-bottom breakout. XLM has moved from a yearly low near $0.21 to about $0.44, with chart signals pointing toward $0.63–$0.64 as the next targets. Clearing those levels could open the door to a possible move toward $1. Analysts link part of this optimism to the upcoming Protocol 23 upgrade, expected to improve transaction processing and smart contract efficiency. While technical indicators remain positive, they also note that volatility, delays in the upgrade, or broader market shifts could change the short-term picture. For now, XLM’s ability to hold current levels will be key in determining if the bullish path stays intact. VeChain Price Forecast: Can VET Reach $0.24 by 2031? VeChain’s forecast points to potential growth, with targets ranging from $0.0499 in 2025 to as high as $0.24 by 2031. The current price sits near $0.0255, with support seen around $0.022 and resistance at $0.026. Market data suggests the outlook factors in both past performance and upcoming plans, including the rollout of StarGate Staking. Daily charts show VET starting to recover after recent dips. Longer-term gains will depend on holding key support zones and capitalizing on project milestones. If it can maintain this base and build on momentum, the higher targets remain possible over the next several years. BlockDAG Lets Holders Trade Early on Demo Dashboard V4 BlockDAG is making presale history while giving participants a live preview of post-launch trading. Its Demo Trading Dashboard V4 replicates the features of top exchanges, allowing holders to place trades and test strategies before BDAG even hits the market. The numbers tell the story. The presale has raised over $374M, with more than 25.1 billion coins sold. Batch 29 is priced at $0.0276, still below the $0.05 listing target. From Batch 1 to now, BDAG’s price has climbed 2,660%. A near-term projection of $1 means a current entry could see 3,522% ROI, with long-term estimates reaching even higher. Large-scale purchases have been a feature from the start, quickly tightening availability at lower prices. The project’s foundation is strong: over 200,000 holders, 4,500 developers preparing 300+ web3 projects, and more than 2.5 million users mining via the X1 Miner app. Miner sales have exceeded 19,250 units, adding $7.8M to the total. The technology is ready too, with hybrid blockchain and DAG architecture capable of 15,000 transactions per second, dual consensus for security, and confirmed listings on 20 exchanges for immediate liquidity. For those aiming to maximize potential gains, acting before the final batches sell out could be critical. With Dashboard V4 live now, holders can use the code TRADEBDAG to start trading in the simulated market today. Which Crypto Leads the Charge Now? Opportunities take many shapes, but clear paths are rare. Stellar’s forecast targets $0.63–$0.64 after a rise from $0.21 to $0.44, though external factors could influence the outcome. VeChain’s path toward $0.24 by 2031 depends on holding $0.022 support and advancing its development plans. BlockDAG offers a more defined route. Batch 1 buyers have already gained 2,660%, and Batch 29 offers the potential for 3,522% ROI toward a $1 target. Its live Demo Dashboard V4 adds a unique advantage, letting holders engage in exchange-style trading before launch. With $374M secured and a strong ecosystem in place, BDAG is positioned as one of the most enticing cryptos to buy now for those who want both upside and a working product before market debut.

50089986,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78414,1755194435,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"TRON at $0.347, Monero in Freefall, & Cold Wallet’s Pre-Launch Power Play: Which Could Lead 2025’s Crypto Gains?",https://timestabloid.com/tron-at-0-347-monero-in-freefall-cold-wallets-pre-launch/,"In the current crypto landscape, not all volatility is created equal. Tron (TRX) market analysis shows the token locked at $0.347, with traders eyeing either a quick relief bounce or a 7% drop, a setup that demands precision timing. Monero (XMR) price drop trends are even sharper, with a 17% weekly slide tied to fears over Qubic Mining’s network dominance, raising fundamental trust issues. Yet, in contrast, Cold Wallet ($CWT) isn’t playing the short-term reaction game. Its model turns user fees into a revenue loop, and the Plus Wallet acquisition seeds over 2M active users before launch. While TRX and XMR face near-term technical battles, CWT offers a pre-structured ecosystem that starts at scale, making it arguably the best crypto for payments in 2025, with Stage 17’s $0.00998 entry price looking like the last steep discount before a $0.3517 listing. TRON on the Edge: Break $0.347 or Brace for a 7% Collapse TRON (TRX) is teetering right at a critical pivot point, holding near $0.347 with bearish indicators gaining momentum. This tight hold suggests traders are gearing up for a potentially sharp downturn to between $0.345 and $0.3444 if support fails. Why does this matter? That narrow price range isn’t just a number; it’s where major decisions are made. A breakdown could usher in quick losses, while holding above could provide relief. Investors and traders need to stay alert: a failed defense of this level could mean downside acceleration, whereas stabilization could offer a strategic entry. If you’re considering an investment, this moment provides a rare high-stakes entry point. A move below $0.347 could turn caution into necessity; but key support holds, and TRX may steady or even pop. Smart positioning now could be the difference in capturing gains before volatility strikes. Monero Plummets Amid Qubic Mining Shake-Up: What It Means for You Monero (XMR) just dropped about 6% today, and more than 17% over the past week, amid growing concern that Qubic Mining may now control over 51% of network hashrate. This gives them the ability to reorganize the chain, block transactions, or even double-spend, raising real alarm for Monero’s security and trust. Why does this matter? When a mining pool gains this much power, it undermines the core promise of blockchain immutability. A move like this can quickly erode confidence, leading to faster declines or deeper corrections if instability spreads. But for perceptive investors, sharp dips can also become strategic entry points. If you’re watching the crypto market, now could be a moment worth noting. Monero’s drop isn’t just a reaction; it may reflect deeper structural risks. That said, if you’re confident Monero can shore up security and restore balance, buying in while others pull back could pay off but only if you’re prepared for turbulence. Cold Wallet’s $5.9M Play: The Fee Refund Loop That Could Change Crypto Forever Cold Wallet isn’t chasing quick speculative spikes; it’s building the kind of structural adoption most crypto projects only dream about. Its model flips the script on user costs by refunding gas, swap, and bridge fees directly in $CWT tokens. Instead of draining portfolios, every on-chain action fuels a reinvestment loop that keeps users active and value circulating. This isn’t theory, it’s infrastructure designed for scale. Then comes the game-changer: Cold Wallet’s acquisition of Plus Wallet injects over 2 million active users into the ecosystem before launch. That means the utility loop is alive on day one no slow grind to attract adoption, just instant transaction volume. The growth curve is compressed, and retention is built into the design. Investors right now are staring at a narrow entry window. Stage 17 of the presale is priced at $0.00998 per CWT, a fraction of the confirmed public listing at $0.3517 a projected 3,423% ROI before any post-launch rally. With over $5.9M raised and 706M+ tokens sold, the price gap will only shrink as batches sell out. This isn’t another hype token; it’s a pre-built network primed for retention, rewards, and sustained activity. Miss this stage, and you’ll be buying into the same network just at a much steeper price. Why Cold Wallet Could Outpace TRON and Monero as 2025’s Payment Powerhouse Markets reward speed in volatile setups, but they reward infrastructure even more in the long run. TRX’s narrow trading band is a trader’s chart watch, and XMR’s drop could be an opportunity if security fears are resolved. But for those seeking the best crypto for payments with baked-in adoption, Cold Wallet is a different category entirely. By aligning incentives, refunding fees in $CWT, and starting with 2M+ active wallets, it bypasses the slow burn of post-launch user growth. The math is as clear as the strategy: with over $5.9M raised, 706M tokens sold, and a direct price gap to listing, Stage 17 could be the decisive entry point before ROI compression kicks in. In a market obsessed with timing, CWT offers timing and structure, a combination rare enough to define 2025’s biggest winners.

This Retest Could Ignite Multi-Level Rally,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-target-a-0-27-retest/,"Dogecoin’s bullish momentum is putting short positions under pressure as the price eyes a crucial $0.27 retest. A successful breakout above this level could spark a powerful multi-stage rally, opening the door to higher targets and renewed market excitement. DOGE/USDT Clears $0.2533 Resistance With Conviction GemXBT, in a recent update on X, highlighted that DOGE/USDT is showing a bullish trend after breaking above the key resistance level at $0.2533 with strong upward momentum. This breakout signals renewed buying pressure, as the price pushes beyond a level that had capped recent advances. The move suggests bulls are gaining control and could be preparing for further upside if momentum holds. Related Reading: Dogecoin Eyes Breakout Above Key Trendline-Will Momentum Hold Or Fade? According to the update, the 5-day moving average (5MA) has crossed above both the 10-day and 20-day moving averages. Such crossovers often reinforce the continuation of an uptrend, especially when supported by other confirming indicators. Volume has also been increasing alongside the price rise. Higher trading activity at elevated price levels shows that demand is growing, adding credibility to the upward move. This combination of technical strength and volume support positions Dogecoin for potentially sustained gains. However, GemXBT also noted that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching overbought levels, while the MACD is in positive divergence. These conditions suggest there is still room for more upside, but they also warrant caution for possible short-term pullbacks. Cup & Handle Emerges: A Textbook Bullish Signal For Dogecoin Examining the daily chart, RISK highlighted that Dogecoin is forming a classic cup-and-handle pattern, one of the most reliable bullish formations in technical analysis. Following a deep, rounded recovery from the June lows, the price is once again testing the $0.27 resistance zone, a level that has repeatedly capped previous rallies. Related Reading: Dogecoin Just Flashed A Rare Weekly Bullish Signal — This Analyst Is Buying The handle portion of the pattern is taking shape with controlled pullbacks and reduced trading volume. This behavior typically signals that sellers are gradually running out of steam while buyers quietly build positions. Such consolidation often precedes a breakout, as the market transitions from profit-taking to renewed buying pressure. If DOGE manages to break and close above the $0.27 resistance zone, the technical structure suggests that momentum could accelerate sharply. In this case, bullish targets would likely extend toward $0.31, then $0.39, and potentially $0.50 or higher as confidence grows among traders. For now, the broader outlook remains bullish as long as the series of higher lows on the chart stays intact. With the breakout scenario still firmly in play, Dogecoin is positioned for a strong upward move should buyers push it past the $0.27 key resistance barrier.

50090009,556572,1755194444,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50090009.jpeg,Bitcoin NUPL Points To Prolonged Bull Market Structure: Third Peak Forming?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-nupl-points-to-prolonged-bull-market/,"Bitcoin reached a historic milestone today, touching $124,500 and setting a new all-time high that initially fueled hopes of a strong bullish continuation. The breakout above previous resistance levels ignited optimism among traders and investors, who saw it as a potential launchpad for the next leg of the rally. However, the euphoria was short-lived — BTC quickly retraced to $121,500, sparking debate about whether the market could be on the verge of a deeper correction. According to data from CryptoQuant, the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric is behaving differently compared to past market cycles. In prior bull runs, NUPL peaks often coincided with overheated conditions and sharp reversals. This time, however, the indicator’s trajectory suggests a more gradual and measured climb, reflecting a shift toward a more evolved and institutionalized market structure. Analysts attribute this change to the increasing presence of long-term investors and the impact of US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have helped smooth volatility and reduce extreme profit-taking events. While BTC’s long-term outlook remains bullish, the coming sessions will be crucial in determining whether this pullback is a healthy reset or the start of a broader correction. Traders are now watching both price action and NUPL trends for clues on the next decisive move. Bitcoin NUPL Data Points to Unique Cycle Structure According to analyst Yonsei Dent, the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric remains one of the most telling on-chain indicators for assessing market sentiment and cycle positioning. NUPL measures the proportion of coins in profit versus loss. Historically, market cycle tops have coincided with NUPL peaks. In the 2017 cycle, the metric formed a single major peak before a sharp reversal. In 2021, it produced two distinct peaks, each aligning with a wave of overheated price action and subsequent corrections. In the current cycle, NUPL appears to be attempting a third peak, a behavior not seen in previous bull runs. Unlike past cycles characterized by sharp, singular blow-off tops, the present market is advancing in stepwise waves. Dent attributes this structural change largely to the influx of institutional capital, driven in part by the growth of US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs. This institutional presence has increased the market’s size, liquidity, and stability, but has also moderated extreme percentage gains seen in prior rallies. While this environment could extend the duration of the bull market, it also suggests a reduced likelihood of short-lived, overheated surges. In practical terms, this means the market may see longer, more sustained uptrends with shallower corrections, rather than the volatile boom-and-bust patterns of earlier cycles. Traders and investors watching NUPL closely will be looking for whether this potential third peak forms fully — and if it signals a more tempered, but prolonged, phase of Bitcoin’s growth. Resistance Rejection At New All-Time High On the 12-hour chart, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $121,596, down 1.37% after briefly touching $124,501 — a new all-time high. This move marks another test of the $123,217 resistance level, which has acted as a ceiling for price action. The sharp rejection from above this zone suggests strong selling pressure at higher levels, at least in the short term. Despite the pullback, BTC remains in a clear bullish structure, holding well above its 50 SMA ($117,395), 100 SMA ($114,833), and 200 SMA ($110,073). These moving averages are rising, reflecting strong underlying momentum. The recent surge from early August lows near $113,000 shows that bulls still control the medium-term trend. The $123K–$124K area remains the critical breakout zone to watch. A confirmed close above $124K could open the door to further gains and trigger momentum buying, potentially leading to new price discovery. On the downside, immediate support lies near $120K, followed by stronger support at $117K, where the 50 SMA aligns with previous consolidation.

Analysts from Reuters and the Bank of England (BOE) had forecasted a 0.1% growth in the second quarter of 2025. The country’s economy also seems to be performing better than the G7 on a half-year basis. It surpassed the group with an annualized rate of 2.2% for both Q1 and Q2. The UK’s 0.3% growth in Q2 matched France’s, while Canada’s remained flat, and Germany and Italy contracted by 0.1% each. The U.S. outpaced the UK with 0.7% GDP in Q2.

UK currently the fastest growing G7 economy in H1 at an annualised rate of 2.2%. pic.twitter.com/3UsD5eEtAu — Simon French (@Frencheconomics) August 14, 2025 According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), Britain’s Q2 report was better than its first three months of the year, where it faced the effects of Trump’s heightened tariffs on imports. Its GDP rose 0.7% as businesses rushed to prepare for U.S. trade policies. The UK’s Q2 growth also grew by 1.2% compared with the same quarter a year ago. As reported earlier by Cryptopolitan, the country’s economic activity in April and May weakened as businesses imported goods early in the year to avoid the stamp duty change and levy changes. Growth rebounded in June from services, the largest sector of the economy, with computer programming, health, and vehicle leasing performing well, according to ONS’s director of economic statistics, Liz McKeown. She also revealed that scientific research and development, production of electronics, as well as engineering and car sales, all contributed to strong growth in June. Government spending had the most impact on growth, driven by spending on health, especially vaccinations, and public administration and defence. According to ONS, construction also performed well in Q2, climbing 1.2% due to UK private housing activity. Manufacturing also saw a 0.3% surge, while machinery and equipment grew by 3.0%. Rachel Reeves, Chancellor of the Exchequer, argued that the country had positive growth with a strong start to the year and continued growth in the second quarter. She also believes there’s more for the economy to deliver to Britain’s citizens. “I know that the British economy has the key ingredients for success but has felt stuck for too long. That is why we’re investing to rebuild our national infrastructure, cutting back on red tape to get Britain building again and boosting the national minimum wage to make work pay. There’s more to do.” -Rachel Reeves, Chancellor of the Exchequer. UK’s exports surged by 1.6% YoY largely due to stronger services exports. Imports also rose by 1.4% driven by a rise in goods imports in the midst of the global trade war, as previously reported by Cryptopolitan. Britain’s nominal GDP rose by 0.8% from April to June, rising 5.3% higher compared with the same quarter a year ago. According to ONS, the implied price of GDP slowed in the same period, with an increase of only 0.4%, the slowest quarterly growth since Q4 2023. James Smith, an economist at ING, said he expects growth to slow in the second half of the year as the economy faces uncertainty around Trump’s trade war and a sluggish domestic outlook. Reeves has mentioned her self-imposed fiscal rules that are meant to tackle government spending.

In her investment rule, debt should be dropping by the end of the current parliament, around 2029-30. Last week, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research warned that Reeves’s rules will lead to a rise in taxes later this year. It forecasts a current deficit of 41.2 billion euros in the fiscal year 2029-30. NIESR argued the fall budget would need adjustments if Reeves is to push through with her fiscal rules.

Among them, Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana are consistently making analyst shortlists for coins set to dominate 2025’s performance charts. With institutional interest rising, retail traders are also positioning early, aiming to secure exposure before larger capital inflows push valuations higher. Sliding into this conversation is an emerging contender – MAGACOIN FINANCE – now making its way onto 2025’s “Best Altcoins to Buy ” lists for strategic positioning ahead of the next big market move. Ethereum – Scaling for Mass Adoption In smart contracts, DeFi, and NFT infrastructure, Ethereum has continued to remain the leader. With the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, the network has also reached a new level of efficiency in terms of fees reduced and intensive performance enhanced, thus being more attractive to developers and businesses. An adoption has been on an upward trajectory with ETF inflows showing its credibility as a blue-chip crypto asset. Analysts suggest Ethereum’s evolving Layer 2 ecosystem – with solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism – could further amplify demand by creating faster, cheaper user experiences. As more applications migrate to Ethereum’s ecosystem, the asset’s value proposition strengthens heading into the new market cycle. Cardano – Governance and Global Integration Cardano has long focused on delivering scalability, security, and sustainability. Its research-driven approach has resulted in a robust blockchain with active development in governance and interoperability features. Introduction of Hydra scaling solutions and on-chain governance updates make Cardano a potential hub of decentralized economies. Outside of the technology, there is the use in the nascent markets, where blockchain has been used to offer financial services to the unbanked citizens . This practical relevance provides Cardano with a distinct story that can be compelling as the investors seek the utility-based growth in 2025. While major altcoins dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly building momentum among early movers. The project is attracting investor attention with rapid sellouts in its funding rounds, a highly engaged community, and increasing mentions in analyst “ best altcoins ” lists for 2025. What sets it apart is its blend of early-stage scarcity and expanding utility, a combination that often drives exponential growth in breakout cycles. Industry comparisons to SHIBA INU and DOGECOIN’s early days are becoming more frequent, with some analysts noting that a strategic position now could deliver outsized returns once broader adoption hits. With its growing ecosystem and focus on rewarding holders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping up as a rare opportunity for those aiming to get in ahead of the crowd. Solana – Speed, Cost, and User Growth Solana has taken up the mantle of being among the fastest-growing ecosystems in the cryptocurrency space with sub-second blockchain transaction times and low costs. Its network still sees Web3-native and traditional developers join its network and gain adoption in various industries such as DeFi, NFTs, and SocialFi. Even though the market is quite volatile, Solana has managed to retain one of the most vibrant user communities , as the volume of transactions is similar to Ethereum in some areas. Should the market be strongly bullish, the speed/cost advantage of Solana may make it one of the largest winners in the field of altcoins. Positioning Ahead of the Next Move Preparation in advance in the periods when market cycles are clearly under way pays off . Ethereum is the most established and technically sound project that is a reliable core holding during future bull run. History has however demonstrated that the biggest percentage returns often emanate out of new projects that even press attention at the same time as the market mood changes. The current path of MAGACOIN FINANCE, i.e. active presales, further analyst reviews indicates that it may be one of those high gear plays towards 2025. With the market poised to reap the macro tailwinds of possible institutional inflows and increased global acceptance, the parity between the incumbents and upstarts in the early days might be the margin of difference in composition portfolio performance.For investors planning their 2025 strategy, the choice isn’t necessarily one or the other – combining the stability of established networks with the growth potential of new entrants could be the winning formula.

The recent funding round, co-led by Radical Ventures and Inovia Capital, saw robust participation from existing tech giants such as AMD Ventures, Nvidia, and Salesforce Ventures. This continued commitment from some of the biggest names in hardware and software signifies a profound belief in Cohere’s strategic direction and technological prowess. Unlike many AI firms vying for consumer attention, Cohere has steadfastly carved out a niche in providing secure and tailored large language models (LLMs) specifically for enterprise use. This distinct market proposition is a key factor behind its soaring Cohere valuation , demonstrating that specialized, secure AI solutions are highly coveted by corporate clients. Enterprise AI: Cohere’s Unwavering Focus Cohere’s core strength lies in its dedication to Enterprise AI . From its inception in 2019, co-founder Aidan Gomez, a co-author of the seminal ‘Attention is All You Need’ paper, envisioned a company that would empower businesses with advanced AI capabilities, prioritizing security and reliability over broad consumer appeal. This strategic clarity has enabled Cohere to forge significant partnerships with industry titans including Oracle, Dell, Bell, Fujitsu, LG’s consulting service CNS, and SAP. These collaborations highlight the immense demand for AI models that can integrate seamlessly and securely within complex corporate infrastructures. Cohere’s press release explicitly states its commitment to a ‘security-first category of enterprise AI that is simply not being met by repurposed consumer models,’ drawing a clear distinction from competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic. This focused approach provides a robust foundation for its growth and market leadership. Navigating the LLM Models Landscape: Cohere’s Position While the broader landscape of LLM models has seen intense competition, largely dominated by the likes of OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta, Cohere has maintained a ‘sleeper’ status, quietly building its formidable enterprise-grade offerings. Its approach emphasizes customization and data privacy, critical factors for businesses handling sensitive information. The foundational research stemming from the ‘Attention is All You Need’ paper, which underpins modern AI, provides Cohere with a deep technical heritage. This allows them to develop sophisticated LLM models that are not just powerful but also adaptable to specific industry needs, from financial services (like RBC) to healthcare (like the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan, a new investor). The differentiation in its model design and deployment strategy ensures that its LLMs are fit for purpose in demanding corporate environments, rather than being generalized consumer tools. The Strategic Importance of AI Investment and Talent Acquisition The substantial AI investment Cohere has attracted is not merely about capital; it’s a testament to the strategic importance placed on its vision and execution. The participation of tech heavyweights like AMD and Nvidia, both critical players in AI hardware, suggests a long-term strategic alignment. Beyond financial backing, Cohere is also actively engaging in the intense AI talent poaching frenzy. The recent acquisition of Joelle Pineau, a long-time Meta research head, as its chief AI officer, along with Francois Chadwick (formerly of Uber and Shield AI) as CFO, demonstrates Cohere’s commitment to strengthening its leadership and research capabilities. This influx of top-tier talent, fueled by significant AI investment , is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge and accelerating the development of its enterprise-focused AI solutions. It underscores the high stakes involved in the race for AI supremacy, where human capital is as valuable as financial capital. What This Means for the Future of AI Startups Cohere’s success story offers valuable insights for other AI startups . Its unwavering focus on a specific market segment (enterprise), its commitment to security, and its ability to attract significant institutional investment despite a quieter public profile, provide a compelling blueprint. The fact that established tech giants are ‘doubling down’ on Cohere highlights a broader trend: the enterprise sector is ripe for AI transformation, and specialized providers are highly valued. For aspiring AI startups , Cohere’s journey demonstrates that differentiating through a clear value proposition and building robust, secure solutions can lead to substantial growth and investor confidence, even in a crowded market. It emphasizes that while consumer-facing AI grabs headlines, the real economic power often lies in enabling businesses to operate more efficiently and securely through advanced AI applications. Cohere’s latest funding round, catapulting its valuation to $6.8 billion, marks a significant milestone in the AI industry. With strong backing from strategic investors like AMD, Nvidia, and Salesforce, and a clear focus on secure, enterprise-grade LLMs, Cohere is poised to continue its ascent as a leader in business-centric AI. Its ability to attract top talent and secure major enterprise partnerships underscores its unique value proposition in a highly competitive market. As the AI landscape continues to evolve, Cohere’s strategic direction serves as a powerful indicator of the growing demand for specialized, secure, and reliable AI solutions within the corporate world, distinguishing itself from the consumer AI race.

50090184,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78380,1755194723,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Certified Elliott Wave Analyst to XRP Holders: Last Opportunity to Make Generational Wealth,https://timestabloid.com/certified-elliott-wave-analyst-to-xrp-holders-last-opportunity-to-make-generational-wealth/,"Certified Elliott Wave Analyst XForceGlobal has issued a stark warning to XRP investors, calling the current market setup “the last opportunity for making generational wealth.” In a recent post on X, the analyst stressed that without a clear, disciplined strategy, holders risk being “absolutely cooked” before waiting another five to eight years for a similar opportunity. A Bullish Formation with Explosive Potential At the core of XForceGlobal’s analysis is the emergence of a bullish pennant pattern, an extension of a larger bull flag that has been forming over recent months. This structure, when confirmed, has historically signaled powerful upward price movements in high-liquidity assets. According to market data, the breakout projection from this formation could see XRP surge to levels above $18 , with conservative technical targets ranging from $5.50 to $11.75 and more aggressive projections reaching $21.60. $XRP This is truly going to be the last opportunity for making generational wealth and calling it a day. If you don't have the right plan, you're going to get absolutely cooked before having to wait another 5-8 years. You already know my plan. pic.twitter.com/NoFen22aoh — XForceGlobal (@XForceGlobal) August 14, 2025 Independent analysts support this outlook. Egrag Crypto has highlighted the same flag structure, noting that its alignment with long-term Fibonacci extension levels strengthens the case for a significant rally. Many other analysts see the potential for an $8–$15 range in the event of a sustained breakout, pointing to whale accumulation and institutional inflows as near-term catalysts for a move toward $6. Price Action and Market Structure XRP is currently trading between $3.22 and $3.33, having broken above the crucial $3.27 resistance on strong volume. Technical analyst Ali Martinez emphasizes the importance of holding this level as support to maintain bullish momentum toward the $3.60 mark in the short term. Year-to-date, XRP has risen nearly 470%, a performance that has reignited interest among both retail traders and institutional investors. However, on-chain data shows over 95% of XRP holders are now in profit, a condition that can sometimes precede profit-taking and short-term pullbacks. This makes disciplined trade management essential, especially as whale activity on major exchanges like Binance continues to influence liquidity and volatility. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional Confidence and Legal Clarity One of the key drivers behind the renewed optimism in XRP is the growing level of institutional participation, supported by clearer regulatory conditions. The conclusion of the prolonged legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has strengthened Ripple’s position in the market, with the token now widely recognized as not being a security in many jurisdictions. This has encouraged the launch of financial products such as the Teucrium XXRP ETF , which has already attracted significant assets under management. At the same time, Ripple’s efforts to expand XRP’s use in payment systems—particularly in cross-border settlements and QR-based retail transactions—are laying the groundwork for utility-driven valuation growth. Adoption in emerging markets, where blockchain solutions can bridge financial access gaps, could provide a steady, long-term demand base. In conclusion, XForceGlobal’s statement is more than a dramatic headline; it reflects the convergence of technical, institutional, and regulatory factors that rarely align in such a favorable way. While the potential for an explosive rally is clear, the window may be narrow. For those positioned strategically, the coming weeks could determine whether XRP becomes a story of generational wealth—or a lesson in missed opportunity.

The exploit, first detected by blockchain security firm Cyvers , involved suspicious transfers across Ethereum, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Mantle, and Polygon networks, with most funds consolidating into just two recipient addresses. Following the detection, BtcTurk immediately suspended all cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals , stating in Turkish that operations were halted “due to a technical problem in hot wallets” while assuring users that fiat currency transactions remained unaffected.

BtcTurk’s official Turkish-language statement described the suspension as precautionary, emphasizing that “purchase and sale operations and Turkish Lira withdrawal operations continue uninterrupted” during its ongoing investigation. The exchange’s response avoided using terms like “hack” or “breach,” instead characterizing the situation as operational difficulties requiring temporary security measures. Blockchain investigators provided specific wallet addresses for public tracking , allowing real-time monitoring of the suspected stolen funds’ movement across different networks and exchanges. Independent analysis revealed that the attackers began swapping various cryptocurrencies for Ethereum almost immediately after the initial transfers, suggesting preparation for rapid liquidation through decentralized exchanges. BtcTurk ( @btcturk ) was hacked for more than $23M! The hacker is swapping the stolen assets for $ETH . https://t.co/Qm5JBebK5p pic.twitter.com/ffvtD1Kp7G — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 14, 2025 BtcTurk has not provided a timeline for resuming cryptocurrency operations, stating only that services will resume “as soon as notification is made” following its security assessment. Regional Exchanges Face Escalating Security Risk This suspected breach marks BtcTurk’s second major security incident within 14 months, following a confirmed $54 million loss in June 2024 that specifically targeted Avalanche token holdings. During the previous incident, blockchain investigator ZachXBT conducted a timing analysis linking approximately $54 million in suspicious Avalanche transfers to the Turkish exchange, while Binance later froze $5.3 million of recovered stolen funds. The Turkish crypto market’s rapid growth amid domestic currency instability further creates unique operational pressures for local exchanges, which must balance user accessibility with increasingly sophisticated security threats. However, the pattern extends beyond Turkey, with regional exchanges across emerging markets experiencing similar attack vectors targeting hot wallet infrastructure. Iran’s Nobitex lost $73 million through TRON-based exploits involving attackers who used provocative vanity addresses containing politically charged messages while claiming affiliation with pro-Israel hacker groups. Similarly, India’s CoinDCX suffered $44 million in losses from server breaches, with the exchange waiting 17 hours before acknowledging the incident after blockchain investigators publicly flagged suspicious activities. Meanwhile, the global crypto industry has experienced an alarming surge in security breaches throughout 2025, with CertiK reporting over $2.2 billion in losses from hacks and scams in just the first half of the year. Major incidents like Bybit’s $1.5 billion hack and Cetus Protocol’s $225 million exploit have skewed yearly statistics, yet even without these outliers, losses align with previous years at approximately $690 million. The frequency of these breaches raises questions about whether regional exchanges can maintain competitive operational costs while implementing security measures comparable to industry leaders like Coinbase or Binance.

Already deeply entrenched via multiple entities and corporations, this latest endeavour is in its early stages. Dual Approach The publicly traded Thumzup Media Corporation, an advertising and social media company listed on the NASDAQ (TZUP), which recently adopted the treasury strategy, announced that it will expand its Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) for mining and blockchain investments. This follows their $50 million capital raise, which will be deployed for mining infrastructure and the accumulation of established cryptocurrencies to bolster the company’s financial resilience and increase shareholder value. “This is a transformative step in Thumzup’s evolution. With a strengthened capital base and a clear strategic vision, we are expanding our reach into high-growth areas of the digital economy. ” – Robert Steele, CEO. The eldest of President Trump’s sons, Donald Trump Jr., disclosed an investment in Thumzup to Bloomberg last month, revealing that he had purchased 350,000 shares, valued at around $3.3 million. In the same month, the corporation issued a press release outlining its plans to hold up to $250 million in cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), and the USDC stablecoin. In November of last year, the board of directors approved the leading cryptocurrency as a reserve asset, authorizing up to $1 million in purchases. Deep in The Game This is currently the second company associated with the Trump family that is stockpiling the largest crypto asset, and their holdings pale in comparison to those of Trump Media & Technology Group. Thumzup Media began accruing the asset in early January this year and currently holds 19.11 BTC, valued at approximately $2.33 million. They have a way to go before reaching the top 100, as they are currently sitting in the 115th spot. The enterprise running the Truth Social platform has 15,000 bitcoins valued at around $1.83 billion, placing them in the 7th spot on the BitcoinTreasuries leaderboard. They are behind Metaplanet’s stack of 18,113 BTC, roughly priced at $2.21B, and ahead of CleanSpark Inc.’s balance of 12,703 BTC, worth around $1.55 billion. Apart from these companies stacking the OG crypto, the First Family also has close ties to World Liberty Financial, a DeFi firm which they co-founded in 2024, launching their token (WLFI) and stablecoin (USD1). The latter has a market capitalization of over $2.1 billion, according to CoinMarketCap (CMC) data at the time of writing, and is the fifth-largest stablecoin in the site’s rankings of this asset class. The speculative Trump meme coin is also notable here, currently boasting a $1.91 billion market cap, according to CMC readings. It launched in January 2025, and saw its price surge to over $75, only to crash as quickly as it rose, and is currently trading at around $9.50.
