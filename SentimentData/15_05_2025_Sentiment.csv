DOGE’s futures open interest rose 70% to $1.65 billion, indicating strong speculative interest. On May 13, Dogecoin (DOGE) witnessed a staggering 528% increase in active addresses, soaring from 74,640 to 469,477, signaling robust network activity and growing investor interest. This surge followed an update to 21Shares’ filing for a spot Dogecoin ETF, receiving acknowledgement from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The financial services firm confirmed the development on X on May 14. Dogecoin active addresses. Source: Glassnode The filing, which aims to track DOGE’s price, aligns with similar efforts by Bitwise and Grayscale, hinting at potential mainstream adoption. This news fueled market optimism, leading to a rise in the memecoin’s network activity. Adding to the momentum, Glassnode reported that DOGE futures open interest rose 70% over the past week, climbing from $989 million to $1.65 billion, despite a price pullback from recent highs. This decoupling of open interest and price suggests persistent speculative positioning, a trend Glassnode noted as “worth monitoring” for potential volatility. Dogecoin futures open interest. Source: Glassnode DOGE has also seen strong spot-buyer demand, and Cointelegraph reported that DOGE’s spot taker 90-day cumulative volume delta (CVD) is currently ""taker buyer dominant,"" reflecting more aggressive buying than selling since early March. This pattern preceded a 385% rally to $0.48 in Q4 2024. Additionally, the long-term holder net unrealized profit/loss (NUPL) for DOGE holders (holding at least 155 days) recently surpassed 0.5, indicating an optimistic “belief” sentiment. With the network’s activity booming, speculative interest rising, and spot buyers dominating, Dogecoin’s market dynamics are setting the stage for a potential price run to its range highs.

With an active community and the upcoming Ouroboros Leios upgrade, Cardano is looking to improve network scalability and transaction speeds. With that in place, ADA is looking like a solid choice for crypto enthusiasts. But what if the next big opportunity isn’t Cardano but Ruvi , a rising star that combines blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI)? If you missed out on Cardano’s previous rallies or want to be part of a ground-floor revolution Ruvi’s presale is the entry point into a potentially game changing project that will disrupt multiple industries. Cardano’s Momentum and Vision Cardano’s rebound is driven by its fundamentals. The upcoming Ouroboros Leios upgrade will make Cardano “the fastest cryptocurrency on the planet” according to founder Charles Hoskinson. This upgrade will significantly increase transaction speeds and scalability. Institutional and retail interest in Cardano is strong, shown by new whale activity and increased developer contributions that now rival Ethereum. But Cardano’s focus is still on DeFi and competing with Ethereum and Solana for smart contract adoption. While that’s impressive, there’s only so much a blockchain can evolve. That’s where Ruvi comes in. Meet Ruvi, the Blockchain-AI Game Changer Unlike Cardano whose appeal is DeFi, Ruvi integrates AI into its blockchain platform , creating real world solutions for industries like supply chain management, healthcare and analytics. Ruvi enables predictive models, automated workflows and unparalleled operational efficiency, taking blockchain utility to a whole new level. At the heart of Ruvi’s ecosystem is the $RUVI token , a limited supply cryptocurrency that will appreciate as demand grows across sectors using its AI powered solutions. Ruvi is for businesses beyond financial services, so it’s usable globally. That’s a big differentiator from ADA’s more narrow use case. How to Invest in Ruvi Early investment in Ruvi comes with rewards for all investment sizes, all at the presale price of $0.01 per token . Here’s a breakdown of Ruvi’s investment potential:### Entry-Level Investment – $500 For a $500 stake you’ll get 50,000 tokens . With Ruvi’s 40% bonus you’ll get an extra 20,000 tokens , for a total of 70,000 tokens . If Ruvi reaches $2 per token this would be $140,000 . Mid-Level Investment – $2,000 For a $2,000 investment you’ll get 200,000 tokens and a 60% bonus of 120,000 tokens . You’ll get 320,000 tokens worth $960,000 if Ruvi reaches $3 per token . High-Level Investment – $5,000 High rollers can get 500,000 tokens for $5,000 . Ruvi’s 100% bonus will double your tokens to 1,000,000 tokens . If Ruvi reaches $4 per token this would be $4 million . These tiers allow early investors to make life changing returns while being part of a revolutionary project. Why Ruvi will outshine Cardano While Cardano deserves credit for its focus on scalability with Ouroboros Leios and its DeFi market share, Ruvi’s industry expanding approach sets it apart . Cardano for all its strengths has yet to meaningfully expand beyond financial use cases. Meanwhile Ruvi’s AI powered platform is extending blockchain utility to solve global business inefficiencies and drive innovation. By combining blockchain with AI Ruvi has created a system that can unlock new efficiencies that will redefine how various industries operate. This universal applicability will push Ruvi higher than Cardano has in years. Don’t miss your window of opportunity Cardano’s rally proves early crypto investments can yield exponential returns. Ruvi’s presale gives you the chance to ride the next wave of blockchain innovation. With its multi industry utility and AI integration Ruvi might just be the narrative that shapes the future of blockchain.Get your $RUVI tokens now and be part of the blockchain revolution.

In 2025, they’re no longer just early investment opportunities; they’re the launchpads for the next wave of utility-driven platforms. As the market matures, investors have sharpened their radar for tokens with substance, sustainability, and real-world use. Gone are the days of hype-only launches. This year, a select few presales have already captured serious attention. But one stealth project is stirring an unusual buzz among insiders. If you’ve been watching Pi Network and XRP communities, you’ve probably noticed it: a growing curiosity, even urgency, surrounding OpenFundNet. And it’s not without reason. The Quiet Token Launch Making Big Noise Quietly but confidently, OpenFundNet has launched its presale, and those who know how to spot value are already moving in. Unlike most platforms, OpenFundNet isn’t chasing hype. It’s focused on revolutionizing crypto crowdfunding by creating a transparent, decentralized, and frictionless system where project creators and investors win together. This isn’t just a new token launch; it’s the beginning of a community-first ecosystem that puts blockchain backers in control. Early access is now open, but for a limited time, and only to those paying attention. A Closer Look at Tokenomics That Actually Work At the heart of OpenFundNet is its native utility token: OFNT. This token powers the entire ecosystem, from project backing to validator rewards to platform governance. Here’s what makes the presale structure attractive: Fair allocation : A sizable portion of tokens is reserved for early backers. Transparency : All presale stages, unlock schedules, and bonus tiers are clearly laid out. Sustainable economics : No inflated supply or sketchy lockups. Just clean, functional tokenomics. This is presale architecture done right. It’s built for long-term health, not a quick flip. The Power Behind Daily Emissions and Dual Rewards OpenFundNet isn’t just rewarding speculation. Its system is designed to fuel ecosystem activity with a balanced emission model. 2.7m tokens are minted daily, and here’s the kicker: they’re evenly split between two crucial roles: Backers ; who fund projects and get rewarded for supporting early innovation. Validators ; who secure and verify transactions, maintaining integrity and trust. This dual reward mechanism does more than just keep things running, it actively incentivizes real engagement on both ends of the platform. It’s a win-win for everyone involved. Breaking Barriers With Zero Platform Fees Most crowdfunding platforms suck value from both creators and investors. OpenFundNet? Not a single platform fee. This is huge. By eliminating fees, OpenFundNet gives projects a better shot at success and investors a cleaner return profile. Whether you’re backing the next killer DApp or staking to validate the network, more value flows back to you. It’s crowdfunding without the middleman. And that means better ROI for early believers. Why Pi Network Supporters Are Turning Toward OpenFundNet The Pi Network community has long focused on accessibility and decentralized tools for everyday users. As Pi continues building its utility ecosystem, some users are seeking more immediate use cases and rewards. OpenFundNet’s mobile-friendly, zero-fee model and daily emissions speak to Pi Network’s grassroots ethos. With Pi currently priced at $1.18 and projected to reach $3.00 in the next four weeks, many holders are exploring platforms like OpenFundNet that offer real-time utility and earning potential. For these users, it feels like the next logical leap. What XRP Whales See in OpenFundNet’s Infrastructure Model XRP has always stood out for its focus on efficient financial infrastructure. Now, some XRP whales are taking early positions in OpenFundNet due to its dual-incentive validator model and scalable emission system. With XRP’s price currently at $2.61 and projected to reach $5.80 in the next four weeks, investors are looking for platforms that offer both near-term rewards and long-term growth potential. OpenFundNet’s daily token output and transparent validator backing check all the right boxes. Bonuses and Perks for the Early Believers Let’s talk about perks. Early adopters of OpenFundNet aren’t just getting in before the crowd; they’re getting bonuses built to reward conviction. Presale participants enjoy: Tiered token bonuses for early contributions Exclusive Discord roles for backers and validators Early access to platform features Governance voting rights from day one These aren’t just fluff incentives. They’re designed to give early buyers a real edge as the platform scales. How to Join Before This Presale Goes Public Joining the presale is simple, but the window won’t stay open long. Payment method : USDT Access point : Join the Discord to verify and participate. Presale stage : Now live! The earlier you move, the better your allocation and rewards. The Final Push—Don’t Wait Until It’s Too Late Right now, OpenFundNet is still in stealth mode. But that won’t last long. With powerful tokenomics, no fees, daily emissions, and early buyer perks, it’s only a matter of time before this presale explodes onto the radar of retail investors, influencers, and major backers. And by then, it’ll be too late to catch the earliest rewards. So here’s your window: move early, or miss out. Because by the time everyone else hears about OpenFundNet, you’ll already be holding the token that helped build the future of crowdfunding.

Traders are piling into futures contracts. A notable performance has been in the Open interest department, which jumped by more than 40%. Related Reading: Avalanche Rumbles 21% Amid Record-Breaking Address Activity Rising Futures Activity According to Glassnode data posted on May 13, futures open interest for XRP surged from $2.42 billion to $3.42 billion in just one week. That $1 billion increase represents a nearly 42% rise in active contracts. When both price and open interest climb, it usually means new money is coming in and that traders expect more upside. $XRP Futures Open Interest has surged by over $1B in the past week, rising from $2.42B to $3.42B (+41.6%). This sharp increase in leverage coincides with a price rally from $2.14 to $2.48, suggesting elevated speculative activity and growing directional conviction, pic.twitter.com/QbsaOM9oxE — glassnode (@glassnode) May 13, 2025 Price Versus Market Gains Based on reports, XRP’s one‑week gain outpaces the broader cryptocurrency market, which has risen about 12% over the same period. A near‑20% jump is no small feat when most major coins are up in the low double digits. Traders see XRP as one of the stronger performers right now, and they are betting accordingly. Momentum Indicators Point Up XRP is trading higher than its 10‑, 50‑ and 200‑day moving averages. That indicates short‑term and long‑term trends are both in favor of buyers. The relative strength index is at 68, which is just short of the overbought zone. There is still space for the rally to continue before reaching a ceiling. The moving average convergence divergence has also crossed higher, suggesting continued upward momentum. Institutional Demand Grows Meanwhile, the XXRP ETF has drawn inflows for five straight weeks. Last week, it added $14 million in new money, up from $10 million the week before. The fund now holds almost $100 million in assets. Even with a 1.80% annual fee—almost twice that of some Bitcoin ETFs—investors still see value in a product tied to XRP. Odds And Projections Based on market‑prediction platforms like Polymarket, there is an 79% chance the US Securities and Exchange Commission will approve spot XRP ETFs soon. According to JPMorgan analysts, these ETFs could attract as much as $8 billion in the first year—more than what Ethereum funds saw after their September 2024 launch. That kind of demand could slingshot XRP even higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling Outlook And Risks Rallying price action, growing open interest, and steady ETF inflows make a bullish case. Fast gains could just as easily fade away if traders lock in profits; a drop through the 50-day average would serve as a warning signal. Regulatory delays or a broader sell-off in crypto could derail the rally as well. For now, XRP sits atop its key averages and sees fresh capital coming in. Many traders and institutions are leaning bullish. Yet anyone getting involved should watch the technical levels and keep an eye on news about spot ETF approvals. If those pieces fall into place, XRP could be set for another leg up. But if markets cool off or regulators hit pause, the run may stall.

Each is actively shaping May 2025 through quantifiable upgrades and measurable market momentum. As the blockchain sector processes a wave of technical developments, consensus is emerging across developer networks and professional trading circles, a shift is underway. In this developing narrative, Qubetics ($TICS), Hyperliquid (HYPE), and Tezos (XTZ) have positioned themselves at the forefront, each addressing distinct challenges while accelerating adoption within their respective domains. Qubetics ($TICS), currently in its 34th presale stage, isn’t merely stepping into the light—it’s redefining how digital assets solve real-world bottlenecks. Unlike prior projects that got tangled in compatibility silos or bloated throughput, Qubetics is sculpted to answer pressing concerns of financial interoperability, cross-chain interactions, and on-chain efficiencies. Let’s find out which Is the best crypto to buy for May 2025: Qubetics, Bitcoin, or Aptos? Qubetics ($TICS): The Real-World Problem Solver with Advanced Interoperability Qubetics ($TICS) operates with a singular principle: digital finance must evolve to reflect the multi-chain world users navigate daily. Incompatible chains once created roadblocks for smooth data and value transfer. Qubetics counters this by offering seamless interoperability among major blockchain ecosystems. It achieves this via a consensus-enabled bridge framework, allowing assets and information to move frictionlessly. A healthcare platform verifying insurance details instantly across blockchains, or decentralized exchanges pooling liquidity from different protocols without compromising execution speed. These use cases no longer belong to fiction. Qubetics’ architecture, built around dynamic validators and real-time oracles, enables execution at scale. The project has surpassed $17 million in raised funds in its 34-stage crypto presale . At a current price of $0.2532, over 512 million tokens have been acquired by more than 26,300 participants. If $TICS reaches $1 post-presale, participants could see a 295% ROI. At $10 post-mainnet, returns could soar up to 3,848%. These aren’t dreams; they’re calculated projections that reflect strategic momentum. For those seeking the best crypto to buy for May 2025, Qubetics offers a blend of utility, traction, and future-facing design that few can rival. The Strategic Value of Blockchain Interoperability As blockchain ecosystems expand, the capacity for networks to operate cohesively has become a fundamental requirement rather than a technical luxury. Interoperability facilitates seamless interaction between distinct chains, enabling decentralized applications to exchange information, automate cross-chain processes, and unlock broader utility across diverse platforms. This capability not only enhances system efficiency and user experience but also supports scalable infrastructure for real-world deployment in sectors such as finance, logistics, and data authentication. Projects like Qubetics ($TICS) exemplify how robust interoperability frameworks can transform isolated networks into an integrated digital economy. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Deep Liquidity and On-Chain Efficiency on the Rise Hyperliquid (HYPE) has carved a niche with precision. It’s not chasing headlines. It’s chasing perfection in liquidity distribution and execution layers. Currently trading at $25.96 with a 5.7% daily rise, HYPE is signaling institutional-grade performance with grassroots-level access. The platform’s smart routing engine tracks optimal liquidity paths and executes trades across multiple pools in milliseconds. While others are still patching up bottlenecks, HYPE is setting new execution standards. As of May 14, 2025, the coin has hit a high of $26.29 and dipped no lower than $24.54 intraday, showing strong confidence from digital asset participants. For anyone narrowing down the best crypto to buy for May 2025, HYPE earns its position through consistency, sharp engineering, and ecosystem scalability. Tezos (XTZ): A Reliable Beacon in Blockchain Governance and Smart Contract Flexibility Tezos (XTZ) continues to prove that steady doesn’t mean stagnant. With an intraday high of $0.6997 and a current value of $0.6922 (up 4.4% in 24 hours), Tezos showcases resilience that stands tall amidst rapid market oscillations. At its core, Tezos thrives on upgradable governance and smart contract adaptability. This means fewer hard forks, reduced friction during network upgrades, and more agile integration of features. With a layered approach to consensus and governance, the protocol adapts without disruption, making it ideal for NFT platforms, DeFi protocols, and DAO structures. Or a DAO system that can autonomously change voting parameters after governance approval. These efficiencies matter. They save time, reduce costs, and protect systems from exploit vectors. For those evaluating the best crypto to buy for May 2025, Tezos delivers an understated but potent promise: reliability meets evolution. Why These Three Should Be on Every Portfolio Watchlist When dissecting what truly qualifies as the best crypto to buy for May 2025 , it’s about more than numbers. It’s about momentum, community strength, technical vision, and real-world alignment. Qubetics ($TICS) leads the charge with interoperable frameworks that could redefine transactional efficiency across industries. Its crypto presale traction and ROI potential have created a growing wave of urgency. Hyperliquid (HYPE) brings institutional-grade execution to decentralized ecosystems. Tezos (XTZ) reminds the market that foundational strength and smart governance still matter. In a sector prone to hype and volatility, Tezos holds steady ground with performance and upgradability baked into its DNA. For early buyers who act before the cycle rotates again, these three coins don’t just offer upside—they offer a layered opportunity to be part of blockchain’s next evolution. Inaction may lead to hindsight.

These meme coins transformed modest investments into life-changing returns during previous market cycles. Now, in mid- 2025 , retail attention is swinging back toward the meme sector—and a new question is emerging: can MAGACOINFINANCE deliver a similar story? While SHIBA and DOGE remain influential, cracks are forming. SHIBA has faced setbacks following the departure of its key developer, Shytoshi Kusama , while DOGE is riding renewed optimism tied to stable prices, community growth, and potential celebrity endorsements. Still, seasoned meme coin holders are now eyeing earlier-stage plays like MAGACOINFINANCE for outsized return potential. SMART MONEY IS LOADING UP – ACT NOW SHIBA and DOGE: Veteran Players Prepare for a Second Wind SHIBA currently trades at $0.00002 with a market cap of around $12.9 billion , maintaining strong exchange volume (~$445 million daily). Despite developer exits and internal headwinds, SHIBA remains anchored in meme coin consciousness, bolstered by persistent community engagement and speculation-driven buyers. DOGE , meanwhile, has surprised many in 2025. With prices ranging between $0.15 and $0.20 , DOGE is eyeing a climb toward upper resistance around $0.29 to $0.41 . Its strength lies in its branding, widespread exchange access, and continued cultural relevance—fueled in part by figures like Elon Musk and Tesla references. It may lack formal roadmaps, but DOGE thrives on momentum. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT MAGACOINFINANCE Emerges as the Early-Stage Challenger In a meme coin cycle where timing is everything, MAGACOINFINANCE stands out—not for what it is today, but what it could become. Like DOGE in 2014 and SHIBA in 2020 , it offers early adopters exposure at the point where the biggest moves historically begin. Its combination of political meme culture and strong branding has caught the eye of crypto influencers, Telegram traders, and speculative buyers familiar with meme-driven trajectories. It hasn’t hit mainstream listings yet—but behind the scenes, its community is growing fast. On-Chain Signals Suggest Institutional Curiosity Blockchain activity is showing early signs of traction. Wallet analysis highlights the emergence of larger holder addresses, with accumulation by speculators and tracking from several whale-watching communities. Meanwhile, MAGACOINFINANCE is seeing increased mentions across meme-themed forums, further supporting its quiet momentum buildup. While it’s too early to predict long-term performance, the alignment of investor sentiment, cultural timing, and low entry pricing makes MAGACOINFINANCE a clear contender in the current meme rotation wave.

But the landscape has evolved. SHIBA and DOGE remain favorites for those seeking nostalgia and relative stability. MAGACOINFINANCE , by contrast, is drawing the risk-tolerant crowd—those hunting for outsized upside at the start of a narrative.

Analysts are already eyeing higher resistance levels at $0.85 and beyond, fueled by aligned EMA trends and growing market optimism. This resurgence not only underscores Cardano’s resilience but also highlights the appetite for cryptocurrencies that offer strong use cases and a vision for the future. Enter Ruvi, a game-changing project that could chart a growth story as compelling as Cardano’s. Ruvi blends blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) to create a dynamic platform tailored for creators, enterprises, and innovators. With its presale attracting early investors, some are already speculating that Ruvi could replicate, or even surpass, the stellar rise of projects like Cardano. What Cardano’s rise reveals about blockchain potential Cardano has consistently won over investors with its focus on scalability, sustainability, and academic rigor. With a supply cap of just 45 billion ADA tokens, it ensures scarcity while enabling utility across decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and NFTs. Its gradual breakout above $0.80 confirms bullish trends reflected in technical indicators like its EMA fan-out and RSI in the neutral zone. Analysts predict price targets ranging from $1.10 to $1.30 if resistance levels are broken. Ruvi stands to learn from this trajectory. Like Cardano, it combines scarcity with utility but focuses on integrating AI technology into its blockchain. By bridging these two high-growth sectors, Ruvi positions itself at the intersection of innovation and profitability. Why Ruvi could be the next bull run darling Ruvi’s unique proposition lies in its ability to use AI for predictive analytics, content generation, and operational optimization. This isn’t just a blockchain for trading or staking; it’s a platform designed to solve real-world inefficiencies in industries like healthcare, logistics, and digital media. The $RUVI token powers this ecosystem, allowing users to earn rewards while contributing to its decentralized growth. Its deflationary tokenomics mirror some of Cardano’s success. Ruvi’s token supply is capped at 5 billion, creating scarcity and paving the way for long-term value appreciation. Its innovative applications in predictive AI and community-focused reward mechanisms make it an enticing prospect for both retail and institutional investors. Investment scenarios with Ruvi Much like Cardano’s early days, Ruvi is giving investors a golden opportunity through its presale program. Here’s how investors can maximize their returns with Ruvi, based on a presale price of $0.01 per token and attractive bonuses: $800 investment At $0.01 per token, $800 secures 80,000 Ruvi tokens. Coupled with a 40% bonus, you gain an extra 32,000 tokens, totaling 112,000 tokens. Should Ruvi hit $2, this initial stake could grow to an impressive $224,000. $1,500 investment A $1,500 investment yields 150,000 tokens during presale. Applying the 60% bonus, you earn an additional 90,000 tokens, bringing your total to 240,000 tokens. If Ruvi reaches $2, this turns into a staggering $480,000. $7,000 investment High-tier investors benefit significantly from the 100% bonus. For $7,000, you receive 700,000 tokens, doubled to 1.4 million tokens after the bonus. At a projected token price of $3, this investment could soar to $4.2 million. These well-structured tiers are attracting savvy investors who understand the value of getting in early on a project poised for exponential growth. How Ruvi lessons from Cardano’s success Like Cardano, Ruvi is a project that aims to break free from speculative trading and instead focus on real-world impact. Cardano’s Vasil upgrade and zkSNARKs adoption show that long-term technological advancements can shift market sentiment. Similarly, Ruvi’s incorporation of cutting-edge AI places it ahead of the curve in sectors such as decentralized predictive modeling and automation. Get in on Ruvi’s presale before the next big breakout Ruvi is offering a chance to join a revolution that could reshape industries. With Cardano paving the way for blockchain adaptability, Ruvi’s AI-driven technology promises unparalleled potential. Early adopters who secure $RUVI tokens now are setting themselves up for exponential returns as blockchain and AI continue to disrupt conventional systems. Don’t miss out on Ruvi’s presale. Be part of the next big thing in cryptocurrency and watch your investment grow as Ruvi unfolds its vision of a smarter, decentralized future. The time to act is now!

The Russian media outlet RG quoted the North Caucasus branch of the national power provider Rosseti as stating that it has used the solutions to detect “dozens of underground crypto mining farms in Dagestan.” Russian Power Engineers: A New Way to Find Crypto Miners? The power firm and its Dagestan subsidiary Dagenergo say they pioneered these solutions in the villages of Balakhani and Maidanskoye. The village of Balakhani in Dagestan, Russia. (Source: Al-Gimrawiy [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Villagers had written to the firms complaining about frequent power outages. Suspecting the presence of crypto miners, the power providers contacted internet providers and mobile operators. The parties agreed to cut off residents’ internet access for a short period. Then, they measured the load on the villages’ power grid. The power firms found that the load dropped by 3.2 MW. They calculated that this meant that “about 900 crypto mining rigs” were operating in the two villages. Rosseti said that 3.2 MW would provide enough electricity to power up to 1,500 houses. The company added that the two villages are home to fewer than 900 families. Using similar methods could help power engineers quickly identify crypto miners on grid maps, power providers suggested. However, they conceded that tracking down illegal miners has become increasingly difficult. Many miners hide their rigs in outbuildings and livestock farms, or use mobile units housed in vans and trucks to avoid detection. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday he was in favour of imposing new sanctions on Russia in coming days if Moscow failed to agree to a ceasefire, mentioning financial services and oil and gas as possible targets. https://t.co/KbeNkCNkgj — Reuters China (@ReutersChina) May 14, 2025 Dagestan’s Crypto Mining Woes In Dagestan’s Sergokalinsky District, engineers say they found a crypto mining farm operating “several meters underground.” A recent crackdown in the republic’s Untsukulsky District has seen officers confiscate “dozens” of rigs. The crackdown saw the power providers launch 35 legal cases pertaining to “unauthorized and unmetered electricity consumption.” The providers have pressed charges against 30 people in four villages in Untsukulsky. Crypto mining is illegal during the winter months in Dagestan until 2031. But observers say that North Caucasus villages continue to buzz with the sound of cooling fans throughout the year. The region’s famously low electricity prices continue to draw crypto miners to the area. And many quasi-legal miners fail to declare their operations, paying heavily subsidized residential rates to power scores of mining rigs, Rosseti added. The Sergokalinsky District in the Russian Republic of Dagestan. (Source: Fred Schaerli [CC BY-SA 3.0]) Crypto Miners ‘Stealing Millions of USD from Grids’ Rosseti North Caucasus said that Dagestan leads in the North Caucasus region in terms of the number of illegal crypto farms it has identified. The power provided said that both the number of illegal mining farms and the volume of electricity stolen by miners in Dagestan doubled in 2024. The firm said that, over the past three years, illegal and quasi-legal crypto miners have stolen an estimated 400 million rubles ($5 million) worth of power from the Dagestan grid. Vyacheslav Afanasyev, a senior executive at the power system operator Southern Unified Energy System, conceded that quasi-legal and illegal mining continues to be a problem. Afanasyev said that many underground crypto mining farms continue to pay for electricity at household rates or “do not pay at all.” He added: “We can see that substations where the loads were once well short of full capacity are currently experiencing overloads.” Such a phenomenon can only be explained by the presence of illicit crypto miners, he suggested. President Donald Trump said Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other US officials will go to Istanbul later this week for potential talks between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders, even if there’s still no certainty that Vladimir Putin will show up. https://t.co/cp4uT1s0qf — Bloomberg (@business) May 13, 2025 More Mining Bans to Follow? Government bodies have said they are considering requests to issue year-round bans on mining in a number of regions . They are also considering extending the existing ban to encompass more parts of the country. Other Russian republics, however, have been encouraged to welcome miners if they have idle electrical capacity . In the southern part of the Bitcoin mining hub of Irkutsk, meanwhile, crypto mining has already been banned completely until 2031. Some Russian regulatory bodies have also argued that Moscow should introduce criminal liability for people who flaunt crypto mining rules . At present, courts only have the power to issue relatively minor fines for the improper use of electricity. Politicians claim that the threat of heavier fines or even jail time would serve as a more efficient deterrent.

While the market continues to swing with sharp volatility, savvy investors are looking beyond quick pumps and turning to tokens with structure, strategy, and sustainability. This week’s action proves the meme coin race is heating up once again. Shiba Inu ($SHIB) increased by 3.69% over the past 24 hours, pushing its price to $0.00001606. The movement reflects cautious optimism among holders after recent dips. In contrast, Moo Deng ($MOODENG) launched a dramatic 33.54% rally, now trading at $0.2816, fueled by short-term excitement and renewed community activity. But the real standout in this cycle isn’t a reactive token—it’s Troller Cat ($TCAT), which is proactively building value through a presale that’s already gained 72.8% across its first four stages. With the next price jump just days away and a projected ROI of 6,044.68%, $TCAT is quickly becoming the best meme coin to buy today. Don’t miss out— Buy TCAT while it’s still early and BuyTCAT to lock in maximum gains before Stage 5 hits. Troller Cat ($TCAT): A Meme Movement Built for Longevity Troller Cat’s presale began on May 2, 2025, at 6 PM UTC with a launch price of $0.00000500. As of Stage 4, it has reached $0.00000864—reflecting a 72.8% increase in value within just ten days. Its final listing price of $0.0005309 puts early investors in a position for a staggering 6,044.68% ROI, setting the tone for one of the most lucrative meme coin entries in the space right now. The presale isn’t a one-off marketing ploy—it’s divided into 26 strategic stages, each tied to a historic trolling moment. The narrative blends community engagement with scarcity mechanics, helping fuel sustained demand. More than 500 participants have already joined, contributing over $100,000 in funding, and that number is rising fast. Troller Cat is built on Ethereum, with full audit and KYC approval in place. It’s also more than a passive hold. Staking is already live in the presale, offering 69% APY to holders willing to lock their $TCAT. Unlike projects that inflate token supplies, this one is layered with deflationary pressure, creating upward price momentum by design. If a buyer enters now with a $40,000 investment at the current price of $0.00000864, they would receive approximately 4.62 billion $TCAT tokens. When the coin lists at $0.0005309, that bag could grow to over $2.45 million, excluding staking rewards and referral bonuses. Inside the Game Center: Where Ads Fuel Burns TrollerCat ’s Play-to-Earn Game Center isn’t just entertainment—it’s a utility powerhouse. Every user must watch in-game video ads at set intervals. Those ads, banner placements, and platform traffic generate consistent revenue, which is then used to buy back and burn $TCAT monthly. It’s a rare closed-loop system in meme coin territory, turning gameplay into real value. That makes every interaction more than fun—it’s profitable. More usage means more ad revenue, which in turn means more tokens burned. Over time, this deflation reduces supply and increases scarcity, helping support upward price action. Pair that with a referral program that unlocks after a $25 investment, and the viral growth factor multiplies. Both the referrer and the new buyer receive a 10% bonus, trackable through a clean referral dashboard. With Stage 5 priced 34.95% higher and less than 72 hours away, the window to maximize these incentives is closing fast. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): Recovering, But Still Uncertain Over the past 24 hours, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has seen a 3.69% increase, pushing the price to $0.00001606. This move follows a brief period of consolidation after several weeks of sideways activity. While the bounce is modest, it reflects growing confidence among short-term traders attempting to re-establish support near the $0.000015 level. Shiba Inu remains one of the most recognizable meme coins in the world, but its massive supply and long-term stagnation have raised questions about future performance. Chart analysis shows a weak breakout with resistance forming near $0.0000172, which it failed to break in its last three attempts. The token’s recent movement appears volume-driven, with small whale buys and social media buzz playing key roles. However, no new utility updates or ecosystem developments have been introduced in the past few weeks. While loyal holders remain active, the absence of fresh incentives or scarcity mechanisms continues to hinder meaningful momentum. For investors seeking long-term upside, Shiba Inu may require more than market sentiment—it needs innovation and deflationary redesigns to regain its former firepower. Moo Deng ($MOODENG): Sudden Rally, High Risk Moo Deng ($MOODENG) delivered a strong 33.54% price increase, rising to $0.2816 over the last 24 hours. This surprise jump came after a burst of online engagement and a sharp uptick in mid-level exchange volume. While the cause of the rally appears largely speculative, the community response has been bullish. The token broke past a resistance level at $0.21, converting it into a new short-term support zone. Technical indicators are flashing overbought signals, suggesting a potential cooldown unless fresh buyers continue to enter the market. That said, Moo Deng’s roadmap remains vague. There’s no staking, referral utility, or deflationary model backing its value—just short-term excitement and branding strength. While this may lead to further pumps, it also opens the door to sharp reversals if momentum fades. Right now, Moo Deng is riding the hype train effectively. But for investors looking for long-term confidence, it lacks the structural mechanics needed to maintain value once market euphoria fades. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Troller Cat offers more than hype—it offers layered utility, a deflationary economic engine, a gamified burn model, and clear ROI potential. Shiba Inu is recovering, but lacking fresh innovation, while Moo Deng is soaring on momentum but light on fundamentals. Troller Cat checks every box for investors searching for the best meme coin to buy today. With staking, a 6,000% ROI window, a referral program, and a thriving Game Center model, the opportunity is now. Head to Trollercat.com , secure your Stage 4 position, and prepare to leap to Stage 5 before the price climbs again.

These cutting-edge AI agents enable real-time content creation and dynamic meme generation, marking a significant transformation in how meme coins can integrate with artificial intelligence (AI). As the FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale approaches a full sell-out, bolstered by an 80% bonus, the timing of this strategic launch is generating serious momentum among early adopters and crypto analysts alike. Meme-o-Matic: A Cultural Engine Built To Outpace ChatGPT And GROK FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Meme-o-Matic, which is currently undergoing beta testing, represents a seismic leap in AI meme generation, positioning itself as a practical, real-time alternative to static tools like ChatGPT and GROK.

Designed for relevance and speed, this AI agent learns from live data feeds, user inputs, and historical patterns, enabling FloppyPepe (FPPE) users to instantly generate culturally resonant, trend-aligned memes. What makes the Meme-o-Matic AI agent particularly useful is its capability to pull sentiment from live market shifts, crypto news, and global events. Unlike GROK and ChatGPT, which rely heavily on prompt tuning for creative content, this AI agent eliminates that friction by auto-generating meme templates tailored to emerging narratives. It’s not just a creative assistant; it’s a cultural strategist that expands the project and solidifies it as a serious player in the $66B AI token market. FloppyX: The Video Bot AI Agent That Puts ChatGPT And GROK On Notice FloppyX AI agent introduces a real-time AI video creation framework that rivals the capabilities of GROK and ChatGPT’s multimodal systems. Powered by GPU-accelerated rendering and dynamic NLP, this AI agent crafts self-aware video narratives that adapt to feedback, market events , and sentiment. Key developments of FloppyX: Real-Time Interaction: Auto-reacts to market or global news with scheduled, branded video responses.

Effortless Content Creation Pipeline: Input Integration: Text, sentiment data, and prompts processed via NLU. Rendering Engine: CNN-based visual continuity. Dynamic Scheduling: Time-aligned delivery for maximum engagement. FloppyX AI agent positions itself not just as a content engine, but as a decentralized brand ambassador. The edge over ChatGPT and GROK is clear: deeper customization, stronger community roots, and meme-native intelligence. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Presale Almost Sold Out: Final Chance For 80% Bonus The FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale is nearing a full sell-out, presenting a final chance for investors to secure an 80% token bonus with the code FLOPPY80 —an offer that applies even to existing buyers. After raising $907,200 in just 24 hours during its private round and pricing the public presale at only $0.0000002 , the project is gaining strong momentum as it approaches its next stage. Investors are rushing into the presale due to FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) meticulously crafted floppynomics model. Each transaction triggers a 1% burn to curb supply and a 1% redistribution to reward holders. The zero-tax token design further maintains deep liquidity across platforms FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Vision For Viral Dominance FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) strategy is rooted in scale and community: Tier 1 CEX Listings Incoming Uniswap Integration Imminent CMC & CoinGecko Listings Secured Discord and X Community Exploding in Growth Influencer Backing: Endorsed by David In Crypto, Crypto Legends, etc. Future phases involve AI-powered market analytics, meme tournaments, global partnerships, and an airdrop campaign for loyal holders. Unlike ChatGPT or GROK, which exist behind paywalls and silos, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) tools are community-accessible and decentralized by design. FloppyPepe (FPPE) 80% Bonus Is Still On: Don’t Miss It While ChatGPT and GROK remain generalist giants, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Meme-o-Matic and FloppyX AI agents offer culture-native, community-driven, and meme-optimized tools that bring AI directly to crypto holders. The project is also protected with a regular audit conducted by SolidProof, multi-signature wallets, and an active bug bounty program to maintain system robustness. With only a few tokens left at the current presale price of $0.0000002 , the 80% bonus is still active with code: FLOPPY80, and exchange listings are already scheduled.

XLM price has closely followed XRP price action in the past, and both have hinted at potential rally toward price discovery soon. Stellar (XLM) price has gradually gained bullish momentum in the past six weeks. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $15.1 billion and an average 24-hour traded volume of about $314 million, rallied over 25 percent in the past four weeks to trade about $0.3033 on Wednesday, May 14, during the late North American trading session. The notable return of FOMO altcoin trading, as evident in the Ethereum price rally against Bitcoin, played a crucial role in the gradual rebound of XLM price. Moreover, XLM’s Futures Open Interest (OI) surged from $112 million on April 14 to about $196 million at the time of this writing Stellar Network and Institutional Adoption The Stellar network has grown over the past years to a vibrant web3 ecosystem. Since the launch of the smart contract capabilities through the Soroban upgrade in early 2024, the Stellar network has attracted more institutional investors seeking to tokenize real-world assets (RWA) to explore more global markets. For instance, several institutional investors led by Franklin Templeton, Circle USDC, IBM, and MoneyGram, among others, have explored RWA tokenization on the Stellar network. At the time of this writing, the Stellar network had over $54 million in total value locked and more than $353 million in stablecoin market cap. What Next for XLM Price In the past years, it is evident XLM price action mirrored that of rival Ripple Labs’ XRP. After six years of symmetrical consolidation, both XRP and XLM broke out and signaled the onset of the macro bull rally. In the daily timeframe, XLM price has already broken out of a falling wedge pattern and now aims at hitting 60 cents in the near term. Moreover, the daily MACD line recently crossed the zero line amid a potential breakout from an inverse head and shoulder (H&S) pattern.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XLM|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-14 23:35:25

Infrastructure-focused assets like KASPA , SUI , and XRP continue building on solid foundations—but capital is shifting. Meme coins, fueled by cultural sentiment and political virality, are driving exponential rallies. The meme cycle is no longer just noise—it’s attracting serious capital. While KASPA’s technical roadmap and DAG architecture keep it in high regard, and SUI continues its remarkable comeback, traders are increasingly rotating into tokens like MAGACOINFINANCE , drawn by its blend of political commentary and meme energy. THE CLOCK IS TICKING FAST – ACT NOW Technical Titans: KASPA, SUI, and XRP Hold Their Ground—for Now KASPA currently trades near $0.10 , with a market cap of roughly $2.7 billion . Backed by a unique blockDAG structure and a loyal developer community, KASPA has improved transaction speeds and scalability post-fork. Still, in this cycle, fundamentals alone aren’t always enough. SUI remains fundamentally strong, now valued over $8 billion , buoyed by consistent user growth and high-speed Layer-1 innovation. Price projections suggest a move toward $8.3–$9.0 by June—but volatility persists. XRP , one of the longest-standing giants, continues to average around $2.4–$2.5 with over $3.7 billion in daily volume. Though it enjoys deep liquidity and institutional interest, price growth remains tied to regulatory developments and macro adoption triggers. MAGACOINFINANCE: Quietly Rewriting the Meme Coin Playbook Amid meme favorites like DOGE , PEPE , and TRUMP , MAGACOINFINANCE is carving out a different path. It blends political branding with meme appeal—resulting in growing traction among retail traders and early-stage allocators seeking rotation trades. While it hasn’t reached billion-dollar daily volume yet, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining ground through a focused pre-sale phase. Its narrative-driven approach resonates with those seeking more than speculative hype—this coin is building a community centered around culture and identity. Early Momentum and Accumulation Indicators Though still in development, MAGACOINFINANCE is generating key early signals: Community Growth : Social engagement is up significantly, with Discord and Beacon activity rising over the past two weeks Retail Inflow : Wallet analysis shows increasing accumulation from TRUMP and DOGE investors Narrative Alignment : Influencers within the meme sector have begun covering MAGACOINFINANCE’s positioning While its market cap lags behind SUI or XRP, early acquisition of MAGACOINFINANCE mimics the early movements seen in PEPE and TRUMP before their explosive growth. Can Fundamentals Compete With the Meme Trade in 2025? The truth is: fundamentals and memes are now clashing more directly than ever. KASPA offers true innovation and developer commitment. SUI has liquidity depth and speed. XRP remains a regulated, institutional bet. But meme coins are winning attention—and fast. MAGACOINFINANCE may not be the most technically robust token, but its cultural resonance and early-stage nature could turn it into the breakout of summer. With a limited token supply and a community-first approach, it plays into 2025’s rotating narrative economy where sentiment drives price as much as code. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X Conclusion: The Rotation Is Real—and MAGACOINFINANCE Is on the Radar As this market cycle matures, capital is flowing toward tokens with momentum, not just technology. KASPA, SUI, and XRP will remain relevant—but MAGACOINFINANCE represents the other side of the market: fast-moving, meme-aligned, and potentially explosive. With growing volume, rising attention, and a politically infused brand, this altcoin may be poised for a short-term surge—before its listing hits full throttle. To learn more about MAGACOINFINANCE , please visit Website: https://magacoinfinance.com Twitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance FAQs What is MAGACOINFINANCE and how does it compare to major coins like SUI or XRP? MAGACOINFINANCE is a meme-driven token rooted in political culture. Unlike Layer-1 chains like SUI or settlement networks like XRP, it gains traction through narrative appeal rather than infrastructure use. Is XRP still affected by regulatory risk? Yes. While Ripple has gained clarity in some regions, global regulatory pressures remain a variable, and institutional demand is tied to long-term compliance.

Retail investor interest typically peaks 1 week after BTC breaks all-time highs. Bitcoin ( BTC ) retail traders are known for entering the market during periods of euphoria, typically after strong monthly gains or a new all-time high. This time is no different, with Bitcoin approaching $104,000 on May 14 while general public interest and retail activity continue to lag. Analysts estimate that in 2025, retail investors were the largest net sellers of BTC, while institutions were the main buyers. But if historical patterns hold, a surge in retail appetite is likely to occur about one week after Bitcoin surpasses the $109,350 mark. Source: X/River According to River’s estimates, individual investors sold a total of 247,000 BTC throughout 2025, equivalent to $23 billion based on the average price during the period. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s Strategy accounted for 77% of the 157,000 BTC acquired by businesses that year. Retail interest for Bitcoin nears 6-month lows Current search trends for the term “Bitcoin” match levels last seen in June 2024, when BTC was trading around $66,000 after three months of failing to break above $73,000.

Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph The retail excitement coincided with Bitcoin breaking its previous all-time high of $73,757 on Nov. 6, 2024, with excitement peaking nine days later. Although retail traders missed most of the gains from the $67,000 level a month earlier, the bullish trend persisted as Bitcoin surged to $107,000 by mid-December 2024. Related: Bitcoin bulls aim for new all-time highs by next week as capital inflows soar Buying Bitcoin near an all-time high is a sub-optimal strategy A comparable spike in retail demand occurred on March 9, 2024, when the Coinbase app rose to the fourth most downloaded in the US finance category, up from 35th place just two weeks earlier. At the same time, Google search interest for “Bitcoin” hit its highest level in 20 months, roughly six days after Bitcoin surpassed its prior record daily close of $68,000 from November 2021. The retail interest jump in March 2024 followed a 56% price increase in just 30 days, with BTC climbing from $43,100 to $68,100. In contrast to the November 2024 breakout, the following seven months saw erratic price movements, with Bitcoin struggling to maintain levels above $70,000. Retail traders tend to react to previous all-time highs, but this often means they miss out on most of the upside. The net outflows from retail investors while Bitcoin trades 5.5% below all-time high reinforce the “Bitcoin” search trends and Coinbase app rankings, supporting the idea that retail demand emerges roughly one week after a previous all-time high is surpassed.

Pseudonymous analyst Kaleo tells his 698,600 followers on the social media platform X Sui’s ( SUI ) price action over the last two years looks very similar to SOL’s 2020-2021 market structure. In 2021, Solana exploded and rallied by about 300% in just three months after shattering its resistance at $55. Says Kaleo, “SUI looks primed for a move similar to the one SOL made in the Fall of 2021. SUI has been the emerging layer-1 market leader this cycle, similar to what SOL was then. If current structural similarities continue to play out, things are about to get fun.” Source: Kaleo/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that SUI is close to skyrocketing and printing new all-time highs. At time of writing, SUI is trading for $4.04. Kaleo is also bullish on the leading memecoin Dogecoin ( DOGE ). The analyst shares a chart suggesting that Dogecoin may be repeating its 2018-2021 market structure. “It’s finally time to pay attention again to the king of memes.” Source: Kaleo/X Based on the chart, Kaleo believes that DOGE will soar to $3 before 2025 expires. At time of writing, DOGE is worth $0.239. As for Bitcoin, the trader sees BTC running close to $200,000 with short and shallow pullbacks. “Up only from here fellas.” Source: Kaleo/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $103,868.

Bonk (BONK) is drawing attention again after a sharp 10% jump, placing its $0.00002 target back in focus, especially if its wedge pattern continues to hold. At the same time, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading above $0.00001718, backed by a bullish cup and handle setup and rising interest from large holders. Those tracking top crypto gainers aren’t just looking at charts. BlockDAG is also in the spotlight, with its podcast-led push for openness helping the project collect over $247 million in presale funds. With strong community momentum and a clear roadmap, BlockDAG (BDAG) is one of the few names offering both data and direction this cycle. BONK’s Price Eyes the $0.00002 Break Bonk (BONK) is climbing again after bouncing 10% from support inside a rising wedge that began forming in March. With the price aiming for $0.00002, many traders believe a breakout is close. Several indicators support this view. The Stochastic RSI remains low, a level often linked to trend reversals. Analysts are focusing on the wedge pattern as a sign that price pressure is building. Above the current range, multiple liquidity points line up with the target. If these get cleared, price could move fast. With bulls in charge, $0.00002 may act as more than just a resistance, it could spark the next rally leg. BONK is shaping up to be one of the top crypto gainers to watch closely this month. SHIB Builds Momentum Above Key Support Shiba Inu (SHIB) is showing strength after moving past $0.00001718. Analysts are tracking a potential climb toward $0.00002215, which would be a 29% rise. The structure also supports a bullish cup and handle formation. Another strong sign is whale activity, large wallets have increased their buying by almost 3,000%, suggesting a growing interest. On the technical side, SHIB is holding above important moving averages and staying well above the $0.00001600 level. If SHIB keeps this pattern, it may reach $0.00002200–$0.00002700 soon. With Shibarium activity rising, this memecoin could remain in play for those tracking the top crypto gainers this season. BlockDAG Podcast Drives $247M Surge in Presale BlockDAG (BDAG) is taking a fresh approach to crypto communication. Instead of traditional PR, the team has launched a podcast series that opens the floor to the community. The show features engineers, analysts, and key figures discussing DAG structure, market insights, and future goals. The format is working. Community members ask questions, hosts reply on air, and the feedback loop grows stronger. As a result, the numbers tell a clear story. BlockDAG has raised over $247 million, sold more than 20.2 billion BDAG, and reached Batch 28 in its presale. Its early stages offered steep gains, returning 2520% from Batch 1 to the current price of $0.0262. But there’s still time to act. A limited offer is live with BDAG available at $0.0020, and this price is frozen until June 13th. More than 17,000 miners have already been sold, totaling over $7 million in miner sales. The project’s podcast has also helped build trust, with each episode increasing wallet sign-ups and community engagement. Core team guests keep the message clear: BlockDAG is here to explain, not just market. For those analyzing top crypto gainers, this podcast-backed momentum shows real traction before the final presale phases kick in. Strong Setups and Clear Signals Across the Board BONK and SHIB continue to show technical strength, with both tokens building on support and chasing higher levels. BONK’s price is nearing a breakout, while SHIB’s pattern points toward higher targets. Traders focused on short-term moves are watching both closely. Meanwhile, BlockDAG’s presale remains a highlight. Its podcast format has boosted community trust, making its growth numbers stand out. With over $247 million raised, more than 20.2 billion coins sold, and a frozen price of $0.0020 until June 13th, BDAG presents a clear opportunity in this market phase.

Here’s what this could mean for BTC. Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score Suggests Cooldown For Mega Whales In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has shared the latest update on the Accumulation Trend Score for the various Bitcoin investor cohorts. The “ Accumulation Trend Score ” here refers to an indicator that tells us whether the BTC investors are accumulating or not. The metric determines its value by not only looking at the balance changes happening in the wallets of the investors, but also referring to the size of the wallets themselves. This means that larger investors have a higher weightage in the indicator. When the Accumulation Trend Score is above 0.5, it means the large investors (or alternatively, a large number of small holders) are in a phase of accumulation. On the other hand, being under this threshold implies the dominance of distribution in the market. These behaviors are at their strongest at the extreme points of 0 and 1. Now, here is the chart posted by the analytics firm, which shows the trend in the Accumulation Trend Score separately for the different Bitcoin holder groups over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the investors on the lower end of the market (the below 1 BTC and 1 to 10 BTC cohorts) have their Accumulation Trend Score under 0.5, which implies they are distributing. The story is different for the larger cohorts, who are in a phase of accumulation. The metric is sitting at 0.8 for the sharks (holders carrying 100 to 1,000 BTC) and at 0.9 for the whales (1,000 to 10,000 BTC), implying a strong trend of buying. One cohort stands out in its Accumulation Trend Score, however, the ‘ mega whales ‘ holding more than 10,000 BTC. From the chart, it’s visible that this cohort shifted from distribution to accumulation earlier in the year, ahead of the rest of the market and obtained a near-perfect score on the indicator. Recently, though, the group has shown another shift, as the metric’s value has come down to around 0.5 for its members. This suggests the cohort’s trend is now neutral. It’s possible that these humongous investors backing off on accumulation could have a negative impact on the ongoing Bitcoin rally . That said, at least for now, the sharks and whales are still supporting the run. During the rally from the last couple of months of 2024, the mega whales took to light distribution, but the rest of the market continued to accumulate, providing fuel for the run. The rally ended when the mega whales took to heavy distribution. Just like how the buying from the cohort this year came ahead of the rest, this selloff also arrived before the rest could move. Considering this smart-money behavior from the mega whales, their Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score could be to keep an eye on. BTC Price The Bitcoin rally has stalled during the last few few days as the cryptocurrency is still trading around the $104,000 mark.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin accumulation|bitcoin buying|Bitcoin Mega Whales|bitcoin whales|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-15 00:00:10

With countless new projects launching every month, spotting one with real potential isn’t easy. But when a token raises over $4 million in its presale and has a launch price 1,747% higher than its current sale price, it’s hard to ignore. That’s where Web3 ai stands out. Analysts aren’t just taking notice, they’re forecasting returns as high as 1000x to 5000x post-launch. For anyone looking for the best crypto to buy early, Web3 ai is shaping up to be a smart bet before it hits the exchange. Web3 ai Presale Hits $4M, And It’s Only Getting Started Web3 ai’s presale is blazing through the stages. Just days after launching stage 4, the project raked in over $4 million in total funds, and it’s not just the whales making moves. Investors from all corners are diving in at $0.000347 per token, setting themselves up for a launch price of $0.005242, a potential 1747% ROI even before exchanges come into play. For many, that’s already enough to put it on the radar as one of the best early crypto buys. But here’s where it gets even more interesting. What’s really grabbing the attention of analysts isn’t just the impressive price difference. It’s the solid foundation Web3 ai has built. This project isn’t riding on hype alone; it’s come out swinging with 12 cutting-edge AI tools aimed directly at crypto traders. From automated bots to fraud detection, arbitrage tools, and even portfolio rebalancing, it’s a one-stop-shop for everything a crypto trader needs. In a space where juggling multiple apps is the norm, Web3 ai is offering an all-in-one solution powered by real-time data and neural networks. With the presale still in stage 4, there’s time to get in early, though not for much longer. Analysts Predict WAI Could Deliver Over 1000x Returns! Crypto analysts are also touting Web3 ai as a breakout contender, and for good reason. The project combines cutting-edge AI functionality with practical real-world applications, launching at a price that could set early investors up for massive gains. Right now, the token is priced at $0.000347, with a confirmed exchange listing of $0.005242, offering nearly 18x returns just from the price difference alone. But the potential doesn’t stop there. While AI is making waves in the crypto space, most projects only tackle one niche use case. Web3 ai stands out by offering a suite of 12 interconnected tools, ranging from predictive models and staking advice to scam detection and DeFi optimization. These tools all work together, feeding data into one another, creating a platform that only gets smarter the more it’s used. Analysts believe this level of integration could place Web3 ai on par with well-known platforms like ChainGPT and Bitsgap, yet with a much smaller market cap and far more room to grow. If Web3 ai gains even a fraction of the adoption experts anticipate, early buyers could be looking at returns well beyond 1000x. No need for the project to crack the top 10 cryptos to see significant growth. With AI dominating tech and finance conversations, now might be the perfect time to get in on one of the best crypto opportunities before it hits the mainstream. Why Getting in Early with Web3 ai Is The Smart Move! What truly sets Web3 ai apart is its perfect timing. Unlike projects that ask investors to wait years for results, this one is already making waves. The project has a clear launch timeline and a confirmed exchange price of $0.005242, which means anyone buying in at stage 4 is getting in at a serious discount. With over $4 million raised and exchange listings on the horizon, this isn’t a “maybe”, the demand is real, and the roadmap is solid. From a tokenomics perspective, $WAI is built for lasting value. Beyond speculation, the token is used to access Web3 ai’s suite of tools and gives holders governance rights. This means real-world utility right from the start, and it aligns holders with the platform’s long-term growth. Add in an annual burn mechanism, and you’ve got a deflationary feature that helps boost token value over time. With a modular, cross-chain structure and support for wallet and API integrations, Web3 ai isn’t just a product, it’s a scalable ecosystem. This makes it one of the top crypto opportunities for long-term growth. The Bottom Line Web3 ai has quickly gone from under the radar to front and center. With over $4 million raised in its presale, a fully functional product suite, and the token priced at just $0.000347 before its $0.005242 launch, the opportunity for early investors is clear. Analysts are predicting huge gains, some even pointing to a 1000x or 5000x return. But the window to get in at this price is closing fast. For those looking for the best crypto to buy early, based on real tech, fundamentals, and timing, not just hype, Web3 ai is emerging as a solid and strategic investment choice.

Long liquidations and exchange outflows signal a bullish reset as smart money accumulates during volatility. Ethena [ENA] surged 17.35% over the past 24 hours, fueled by a trendline breakout and renewed on-chain strength across address activity and transaction size distribution. At the time of writing, ENA traded at $0.4332 and approached the $0.60 resistance, a level that capped gains for weeks. Although sellers have defended it repeatedly, ENA holds well above the mid-range. Therefore, if bulls push past $0.60, the structure could flip fully bullish with room for higher targets. Source: TradingView Address growth and large transactions point to deeper adoption On-chain activity has grown significantly. New addresses increased by 56.43% week-on-week, while active addresses rose 37.12% over the week. Simultaneously, mid-to-large transactions surged. Transactions in the $10K–$100K bracket surged 220%, while those in the $100K–$1M range ballooned 613.64%. Naturally, this pointed to rising interest from both institutional and large-scale retail participants. Therefore, the address and transaction trends align with the current price strength and suggest sustained market engagement. Source: IntoTheBlock Exchange data showed strong accumulation behavior. ENA Outflows totaled $24.11M, while inflows reached only $19.87M. Therefore, more tokens are leaving exchanges than entering them. This behavior often indicates that investors are securing assets in self-custody. As a result, sell pressure on centralized platforms decreases. Historically, Net Outflows during rallies support continued price expansion. In fact, this trend reinforces the bullish narrative and hints at deeper investor confidence in ENA’s long-term trajectory. Source: CoinGlass ENA leverage unwind intensifies as longs get wiped out Derivatives data shows a clear long squeeze. Long liquidations totaled $504.44K, while short liquidations reached only $75.45K. Overleveraged bulls initiated this reset as prices reached resistance. Clearing excessive long exposure, however, reduces market risk. This shift allows for a more stable continuation if buyers return. Therefore, the liquidation event, while sharp, may help ENA resume its climb from a healthier technical base, provided bullish momentum holds in the coming days. Short-term trader activity has spiked. Santiment data showed a rise in the 0d–1d Realized Cap HODL Waves metric, now at 0.0915. This uptick signaled heightened short-term activity, likely from momentum traders. While this adds volatility, it also injects fresh volume and liquidity. Importantly, it confirms that ENA has re-entered the market’s focus. Source: Santiment Can ENA sustain momentum and break above $0.60? Ethena continued to show strength in price structure and on-chain fundamentals. Network growth, large transactions, and reduced exchange supply support bullish sentiment. Although long liquidations caused a shakeout, leverage now looks cleaner. If ENA closes above $0.60, it may confirm a full trend reversal. Until then, the market remains cautiously optimistic.",Altcoin|News|News 1|Social|Trading View,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|ENA,"{'name': 'AMB Crypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/ambcrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",ambcrypto,2025-05-15 00:00:41

While PEPE , TRUMP , and Solana (SOL) have made waves in early 2025 , a quieter shift is unfolding beneath the surface—and MAGACOINFINANCE is emerging as a project quietly positioning for breakout. Unlike hype-driven pumps, MAGACOINFINANCE has opted for a deliberate growth path, combining a compelling political angle with disciplined token economics. Though still under the radar for many, its traction is beginning to accelerate. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Growing Attention as Investors Rotate into Value As of early May, MAGACOINFINANCE remains in its structured pre-sale phase, steadily building both its user base and community engagement across platforms like Discord and Twitter/X. This expansion is taking place at a time when investor sentiment is shifting—from overhyped launches to smaller, undervalued tokens with strong narratives. With broader interest forming around rotation trades, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining visibility among early movers and contrarian investors alike. Uptick in On-Chain Metrics and Wallet Activity Traders seeking overlooked opportunities are taking note of MAGACOINFINANCE for more than just its branding. Wallet analysis now shows increased inflows from mid-sized Ethereum wallets, often associated with early-stage venture plays. While volumes remain modest, these signs mirror pre-rally accumulation patterns seen in previous market cycles. In addition to rising community interest, its new tokenomics design—featuring time-locked releases and open developer wallets—aims to avoid the liquidity pitfalls common to meme-driven tokens. Tokenomics That Encourage Loyalty, Not Dumping Whereas most tokens struggle to sustain price post-launch, MAGACOINFINANCE integrates mechanisms to promote holding. Controlled liquidity access, transparent supply caps, and structured token vesting have helped it avoid early dumping, attracting more serious long-term holders. This stability-first approach sets it apart in a landscape often dominated by short-lived momentum trades. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW Is This the Breakout Rotation Trade of Summer 2025? Analysts are beginning to tag MAGACOINFINANCE in their rotation watchlists. Here’s what’s catching attention: Social Growth : A 60% surge in Twitter/X visibility over the past three weeks Holder Distribution : Balanced wallet distribution minimizes whale influence Engagement-to-Market Cap : Matching early FLOKI and TRUMP coin metrics from prior cycles These data points suggest that the token is being positioned for a strategic move. With altcoin rotation in full swing, MAGACOINFINANCE could become a standout from the smaller-cap sector. Conclusion: Quiet Today, But Not for Long Market interest is steadily shifting toward lower-cap, narrative-rich tokens that offer room to surprise. While projects like KASPA , XRP , and PEPE remain solid names, their large caps may limit near-term upside for new entrants. MAGACOINFINANCE , however, appears earlier in its cycle—right where long-term breakouts often begin. With increased on-chain signals, social traction, and a smart token design, this altcoin may soon move from quiet accumulation to center stage. Summer could tell the story—and MAGACOINFINANCE is writing the first chapters now.

Moderate optimism sees $210 as a likely outcome, backed by $187,000 in volume. RSI at 71 indicates overbought conditions, suggesting possible price correction soon. Solana (SOL) continues to draw investor attention in May 2025, with strong trading volumes shaping expectations for its monthly close. According to Polymarket data , market participants appear largely confident in SOL maintaining momentum, pricing in a 71% probability that the token will close near $190.

On-Chain Data Points To This,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-resistance-on-chain-data-points-this/,"On-chain data suggests this upcoming Dogecoin level could prove to be a resistance wall based on the investor cost basis distribution. A Large Amount Of Dogecoin Was Last Purchased At $0.36 In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about Dogecoin levels that appear significant on the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) of the memecoin. The “URPD” refers to an on-chain indicator that basically tells us about how much of the asset’s supply was last purchased at which price levels. The metric determines this cost basis for each token by checking its transaction history to see its last transfer price. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Up Despite Price Pullback, Data Shows Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the latest URPD data for Dogecoin: As displayed in the above graph, there are no levels immediately nearby to the current Dogecoin price that hold the break-even mark of a significant portion of the supply. The closest level that stands out in the URPD is around $0.21, which hosts the acquisition point of 7.5% of the DOGE supply. For the up direction, there aren’t any notable cost basis centers until all the way to $0.36, where investors last bought about 3.8% of all tokens in existence. Now, what’s the relevance of these levels to Dogecoin? To know the answer to that question, investor psychology needs to be understood first. To any holder, their cost basis is naturally an important level, so they can be prone to showing some kind of reaction when a retest of it happens. Whatever this reaction be, it’s not of significant to the cryptocurrency if only a few investors are showing it. For retests of levels that host the cost basis of a large amount of holders, however, the story can be different. The aforementioned levels could be important ones from this perspective. Generally, investors tend to react by buying if the retest is happening from above, granted the mood in the market is bullish. This is because these holders, who were in profit prior to the retest, might look at the price decline as just a ‘dip.’ Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharks & Whales Continue To Accumulate: Stage Set For New All-Time High? On the other hand, the holders who were in loss before the retest may decide to sell their Dogecoin, as they could fear that this might be their last opportunity to exit at their break-even for a while. As such, major supply walls below the DOGE spot price can act as potential support zones, while those above it may prove to be resistance areas. Given that the closest two such levels are at $0.21 and $0.36 for the asset right now, they may be where the coin could be the most probable to encounter strong support and resistance, respectively. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.237, up more than 37% in the last seven days.

Yaroslav Zhelezniak, Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Finance , Tax and Customs Policy, made the announcement. He said a bill to create the reserve is nearly complete. He hopes to bring it before parliament in the next few weeks. Ukraine has consistently been open to digital coins. The nation has been a trailblazer in embracing crypto-friendly rules, even as war with Russia rages. The war has made these things even more important for digital assets. Cryptocurrency donations helped Ukraine raise millions in humanitarian and defense aid in 2022 and 2023. Now, the government is planning a full set of overhauls, allowing cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology they are built on to go mainstream. The Ministry of Digital Transformation is leading the effort. The new law would categorize digital assets, establish exchange rules, and introduce clear tax guidelines. Officials said the measure could take effect as soon as possible if it becomes law. Binance backs Ukraine’s cryptocurrency plans Kirill Khomyakov, head of operations for Central and Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Africa at Binance, said that Binance will help Ukraine set up the Bitcoin reserve . He praised the concept but added, “It’s a heavy lift.” According to Khomyakov, founding a national cryptocurrency reserve would require several large-scale changes in Ukrainian law. These changes will take time. Additionally, he said that current legislation does not allow the owning and managing of digital assets within the frame of official reserves. But Binance is itself a believer in the long-term potential of the move. The company is also working with several countries to establish cryptocurrency-related legislation. Earlier, Binance co-founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao proposed that Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan should develop a sovereign approach to Bitcoin. Binance has already worked with the Ukrainian government on several projects, including providing education on cryptocurrency and implementing exchange regulations. Nations embrace Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset Ukraine is not alone. Other countries worldwide are beginning to see Bitcoin as a strategic resource. In March 2025, the United States took the lead by establishing its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . The reserve is supported by digital assets forfeited by law enforcement. This proves that the government is racing to embrace Bitcoin even as a tool for national security and economic independence. All over Europe, Switzerland has been weighing such measures. The Brazilian Central Bank has also indicated that it is interested in researching digital reserves. The Central African Republic joined the fray of Bitcoin, which became a legal tender after El Salvador paved the way a few years back. Experts say that as additional countries embrace Bitcoin, it could become an important part of global finance. It might be able to hold national wealth, underwrite international trade, or even stand in for parts of conventional foreign reserves. The Ukrainian plan may be the first in Europe, but it likely will not be the last. A new dynamic is now in play as potential ceasefire talks with Russia gain ground. A peaceful resolution could unleash economic recovery and optimism. That could, in turn, drive up confidence among investors and lift the prices of cryptocurrencies — making Ukraine’s proposed Bitcoin Reserve even more strategically valuable.

This early-stage opportunity has now crossed $8 million raised , sparking renewed interest among strategic XRP and Cardano (ADA) investors. What’s driving the move? Both ADA and XRP are still considered credible assets, yet their current trajectories have plateaued. In contrast, MAGACOINFINANCE is showing real traction through a combination of community growth, structured release phases, and strong attention from analysts looking for the next 35x performer . For seasoned holders, the appeal lies in clear mechanics—not hype. FINAL CALL — ACT NOW & SECURE YOUR SPOT! May Market Rundown: XRP and Cardano Stay Range-Bound Cardano (ADA) trades between $0.70–$0.72 , holding up on ETF speculation and protocol upgrades like LAOS, but struggling to break key resistance at $0.81 . Meanwhile, XRP hovers near $2.22 , facing short-term stagnation as ETF headlines cool and liquidity remains light. Although long-term forecasts remain optimistic, shorter-term catalysts are limited. That has prompted ADA and XRP holders to diversify toward faster-moving, high-potential projects— MAGACOINFINANCE chief among them. 50% Bonus Now Active — and ROI Forecasts Are Rising This isn’t just momentum—it’s a calculated entry. Analysts estimate over 3,000% return potential from the current entry to its $0.007 target listing price. On top of that: A 50% token bonus is live for a limited time Supply is capped at 100 billion tokens , with nearly half reserved for pre-sale Token allocation and pricing shift hourly as demand surges Unlike delayed development plays, MAGACOINFINANCE moves with structure, making it a standout amid market noise.

PRESALE SELLING OUT — TAP TO SECURE YOUR SPOT NOW! Analysts View MAGACOINFINANCE as a 2025 Power Entry While ADA and XRP remain anchored to market cycles, MAGACOINFINANCE is charting an independent growth path. With over 20,000 investors already participating and visibility increasing across media platforms, the project is positioning itself as one of 2025’s most strategic early entries .

So that makes it very hard for us to make a return for our liquidity providers,” Tapeiro said while speaking in a panel discussion at the Consensus conference in Toronto on May 14. “So a lot of those deals we just pass almost automatically, even businesses that we really like, we won't invest in if the price isn't reasonable in the beginning.” 10T Holdings has passed on over 200 companies for similar reasons, including the now-bankrupt FTX, BlockFi and Celsius, Tapeiro said. Tapeiro said 10T Holdings looks for crypto projects that have valuations above the $400 million to $500 million range with a valuation-to-revenue ratio of 10x or less. Host of Crypto In America Eleanor Terrett (left) moderating a discussion with Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead (middle) and Dan Tapeiro (right) at the Consensus conference. Source: Cointelegraph VCs often prefer lower valuations because they offer more upside potential with less risk. Realistic valuations often make follow-on funding rounds more attractive to investors while also simplifying the exit process. “Valuation is very important,” Tapeiro said. Despite Tapeiro’s comments, it appears that crypto startups have had no problem attracting VC funds , as PitchBook reported on May 13 that the total value of crypto venture capital deals rose over 100% quarter-on-quarter to $6 billion in Q1 2025, while the number of deals only increased by 8.8%. VCs should diversify their bags Also speaking alongside Tapeiro was Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead, who said more VCs should opt to receive a mix of private equity and tokens when investing in crypto startups. “Each one has their pros and cons, and then they go in these wild pendulum swings where sometimes tokens are really expensive and ventures cheap. Sometimes it's the opposite.” Related: Crypto VC deals drop in Q1, but funding more than doubles: PitchBook “So as an investor, I always advocate people investing in a wide spectrum of tokens and ventures.” Morehead’s Pantera has taken a more aggressive approach than 10T Holdings over the years and seen considerable success, making a return on 86% of the startups it invested in, with 22 of those reaching unicorn status (companies reaching $1 billion valuations).

Shares in eToro Group Ltd (ETOR) closed May 14 trading at $67, up 28.9% from its initial offering price of $52, according to Yahoo Finance. It brings the company’s market value to over $5.5 billion. Its stock price shot to a high of $74.26 during the trading day before cooling and has also slightly dipped by 0.7% after the bell to $66.53. EToro shares shot up and then traded sideways on the company’s debut US offering. Source: Yahoo Finance The day before, on May 13, eToro boosted its IPO to $620 million after pricing its shares above its previously suggested range of between $46 to $50 each. Initially, the firm aimed to raise $500 million by offering 10 million shares, but the company and its backers sold over 11.92 million shares at its IPO, split evenly between eToro and some existing shareholders. Some BlackRock-managed funds and accounts had signalled interest in buying up to $100 million worth of shares at IPO, eToro said in a May 5 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), a rival to eToro that went public in 2021, saw its share price sink 1.9% to $61.39, with its losses extending by 1.63% after-hours to $60.39, Yahoo Finance shows . In its regulatory filing, eToro reported its total 2024 crypto revenue, from sources such as trading fees and withdrawals, was $12.1 billion, up from $3.4 billion in 2023. It also expected crypto to account for 37% of its commission from trading activity in the first quarter of 2025, down from 43% in Q1 2024. The offering was led by Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, UBS Investment Bank and Citigroup. IPOs rebound after tariff turmoil EToro’s public debut marks a rebound for public offerings in the US after many firms put their plans on hold as US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs tanked global markets. EToro made confidential filings with the SEC in January for a public offering and publicly announced the plans on March 24, but delayed its IPO after Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” tariff plans, which put a stop to many in-the-works public offerings. Related: 8 major crypto firms announce US expansion this year The stock and crypto trading house was founded in 2007 and previously bid to go public in 2021 via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company at a valuation of $10 billion. It canned that plan a year later , in 2022, after stock and crypto markets took a massive hit due to the COVID-19 pandemic and sticky inflation that caused central banks to quickly hike interest rates. Crypto exchange Kraken is considering going public this year, as is stablecoin issuer Circle, which filed with the SEC on April 1 but paused its plan a day later due to Trump’s tariffs. Crypto fund manager Bitwise predicted in December that, alongside Kraken and Circle, crypto exchange Figure, crypto bank Anchorage Digital and blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis would also go public this year.

Backed by the successful rollout of the Pectra upgrade, which improved staking performance and enhanced user experience, Ethereum continues to show its dominance in the Layer 1 space. But while ETH regains strength, investors are already diversifying into early-stage projects with significantly more upside. One project gaining traction is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a DeFi protocol currently in presale that many believe could rise to $5 in the months following its launch, offering far more growth potential than major altcoins at this stage. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum’s surge to $2.5K is undeniably a bullish signal for the broader market. Institutional inflows are returning, and its Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism are also seeing increased activity. These networks reduce congestion and gas fees while helping Ethereum scale, boosting confidence in the ecosystem overall. Although ETH provides long-term stability, many investors recognize that the biggest gains often come from early-stage tokens — those with low entry prices, real utility, and solid fundamentals. Mutuum Finance fits that mold exactly. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized system that facilitates the lending and borrowing of digital assets through open-access smart contracts. It’s designed to give users full control of their holdings while unlocking yield or liquidity, depending on their strategy. Here’s where it gets interesting: instead of rewarding users through inflation or unsustainable emissions, Mutuum redistributes value in a smart, closed-loop system. A share of the platform’s revenue is allocated to buying MUTM tokens from the open market, which are then distributed to mtToken holders — tokens that represent their deposited assets. This structure ensures that actual usage drives demand. As borrowing activity grows, so does pressure to acquire and distribute MUTM — a dynamic many DeFi protocols fail to establish. Let’s say an investor holds $20,000 in ETH and believes it will continue to rise. Rather than selling and missing potential gains, they could deposit it into Mutuum to borrow $12,000 in stablecoins. Those funds could be used for real-world expenses, new investments, or even buying more MUTM — all without liquidating the original ETH. As long as the value of their collateral stays above the liquidation threshold, the position remains open, and they keep full exposure to the underlying asset. This concept is already gaining popularity across the DeFi sector, and Mutuum is building it into a user-friendly, scalable platform. One of Mutuum’s most important features is its Layer 2 compatibility. By building on networks like Arbitrum, the platform ensures that users can interact with smart contracts quickly and cost-effectively. Lower fees mean more participation, and higher volume leads to more platform-generated revenue — which, again, feeds back into the MUTM token. This gives the token utility beyond speculation. It becomes part of a functional ecosystem that benefits from every interaction — borrow, repay, deposit, withdraw — all feeding into token demand. The current presale price of MUTM is just $0.025. Based on its revenue model, projected usage, and early-stage positioning, analysts see a realistic path to $5 in the post-launch period. That represents a 19,900% gain — a level of upside that few established assets can offer. With over $8 million already raised and thousands of participants onboard, the token is gaining attention not just for its price, but for its structure. A beta version of the platform is expected to roll out at launch, giving users immediate access to borrowing and lending features — something most presale tokens delay for months. Ethereum’s return to $2.5K shows that the market is waking up — but investors looking for the next breakout opportunity are setting their sights elsewhere. Mutuum Finance delivers a streamlined, scalable platform supported by actual revenue — designed to incentivize user activity and generate genuine demand for its token. The opportunity to get MUTM at the $0.025 price level is quickly running out. As listings approach and platform activity begins, the price will no longer reflect early-stage access. For those asking what’s the best crypto to invest in before the next full bull run, MUTM is shaping up to be a top contender.

Exchange reserves dropped to 19.1 million ETH, suggesting rising demand and a brewing supply squeeze. Ethereum [ETH] recently regained the $2,700 level, a price it last traded at on the 24th of February. This followed a notable 5.63% rally in the past 24 hours. AMBCrypto found that this move into the $2,700 range runs counter to the bets of traditional investors, who were selling. This divergence has created room for a potentially stronger rally. Traditional investors backing out might be a good sign for ETH According to LookOnChain , spot ETH ETFs saw net outflows of $10.83 million over the past 24 hours. This means traditional investors offloaded more ETH than they bought, likely securing profits after recent gains. Source: LookOnChain However, the altcoin has continued trending higher, likely supported by institutional purchases made during this same period. One notable institutional investor contributing to the bullish momentum is Abraxas Capital. This group purchased 33,482 ETH worth $84.7 million within the past 24 hours. In fact, over the past week, Abraxas accumulated 211,030 ETH, valued at $477.6 million. Moves like this often instill confidence and help sustain rallies. If the Netflow of Spot ETH ETFs turns positive, it would reinforce the current upward movement driven by large institutional investors, potentially pushing ETH above $3,000. More confluences are emerging According to CryptoQuant, spot traders currently maintain a neutral position in the market. This indicates a level of balance, even as prices continue to rise. Spot retail activity remains in the grey zone, albeit trending slightly upward, with a 0.17% gain. Source: CryptoQuant If this trend continues, spot traders may not drive the next ETH upswing. With that in mind, AMBCrypto examined other market signals. However, Exchange Reserve data told a different story. ETH held on exchanges dropped to 19.1 million, confirming reduced sell pressure. This suggests strong demand, with traders accumulating ETH from exchanges and causing a gradual supply squeeze. Source: CryptoQuant At the same time, the Fund Market Premium, which reflects institutional flows like Grayscale’s, remained mildly negative at -0.3. This indicates room for further growth, particularly if these institutional players step back in. Overall, c urrent market dynamics indicate Ethereum could rally further if institutional, traditional, and spot traders re-engage. With renewed participation, ETH has a strong chance of breaking above $3,000 in the near term.",Altcoin|Ethereum|News|News 1|Social|Trading View,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'AMB Crypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/ambcrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",ambcrypto,2025-05-15 01:00:52
