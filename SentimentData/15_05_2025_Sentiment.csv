DOGE’s futures open interest rose 70% to $1.65 billion, indicating strong speculative interest. On May 13, Dogecoin (DOGE) witnessed a staggering 528% increase in active addresses, soaring from 74,640 to 469,477, signaling robust network activity and growing investor interest. This surge followed an update to 21Shares’ filing for a spot Dogecoin ETF, receiving acknowledgement from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The financial services firm confirmed the development on X on May 14. Dogecoin active addresses. Source: Glassnode The filing, which aims to track DOGE’s price, aligns with similar efforts by Bitwise and Grayscale, hinting at potential mainstream adoption. This news fueled market optimism, leading to a rise in the memecoin’s network activity. Adding to the momentum, Glassnode reported that DOGE futures open interest rose 70% over the past week, climbing from $989 million to $1.65 billion, despite a price pullback from recent highs. This decoupling of open interest and price suggests persistent speculative positioning, a trend Glassnode noted as “worth monitoring” for potential volatility. Dogecoin futures open interest. Source: Glassnode DOGE has also seen strong spot-buyer demand, and Cointelegraph reported that DOGE’s spot taker 90-day cumulative volume delta (CVD) is currently ""taker buyer dominant,"" reflecting more aggressive buying than selling since early March. This pattern preceded a 385% rally to $0.48 in Q4 2024. Additionally, the long-term holder net unrealized profit/loss (NUPL) for DOGE holders (holding at least 155 days) recently surpassed 0.5, indicating an optimistic “belief” sentiment. With the network’s activity booming, speculative interest rising, and spot buyers dominating, Dogecoin’s market dynamics are setting the stage for a potential price run to its range highs.

With an active community and the upcoming Ouroboros Leios upgrade, Cardano is looking to improve network scalability and transaction speeds. With that in place, ADA is looking like a solid choice for crypto enthusiasts. But what if the next big opportunity isn’t Cardano but Ruvi , a rising star that combines blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI)? If you missed out on Cardano’s previous rallies or want to be part of a ground-floor revolution Ruvi’s presale is the entry point into a potentially game changing project that will disrupt multiple industries. Cardano’s Momentum and Vision Cardano’s rebound is driven by its fundamentals. The upcoming Ouroboros Leios upgrade will make Cardano “the fastest cryptocurrency on the planet” according to founder Charles Hoskinson. This upgrade will significantly increase transaction speeds and scalability. Institutional and retail interest in Cardano is strong, shown by new whale activity and increased developer contributions that now rival Ethereum. But Cardano’s focus is still on DeFi and competing with Ethereum and Solana for smart contract adoption. While that’s impressive, there’s only so much a blockchain can evolve. That’s where Ruvi comes in. Meet Ruvi, the Blockchain-AI Game Changer Unlike Cardano whose appeal is DeFi, Ruvi integrates AI into its blockchain platform , creating real world solutions for industries like supply chain management, healthcare and analytics. Ruvi enables predictive models, automated workflows and unparalleled operational efficiency, taking blockchain utility to a whole new level. At the heart of Ruvi’s ecosystem is the $RUVI token , a limited supply cryptocurrency that will appreciate as demand grows across sectors using its AI powered solutions. Ruvi is for businesses beyond financial services, so it’s usable globally. That’s a big differentiator from ADA’s more narrow use case. How to Invest in Ruvi Early investment in Ruvi comes with rewards for all investment sizes, all at the presale price of $0.01 per token . Here’s a breakdown of Ruvi’s investment potential:### Entry-Level Investment – $500 For a $500 stake you’ll get 50,000 tokens . With Ruvi’s 40% bonus you’ll get an extra 20,000 tokens , for a total of 70,000 tokens . If Ruvi reaches $2 per token this would be $140,000 . Mid-Level Investment – $2,000 For a $2,000 investment you’ll get 200,000 tokens and a 60% bonus of 120,000 tokens . You’ll get 320,000 tokens worth $960,000 if Ruvi reaches $3 per token . High-Level Investment – $5,000 High rollers can get 500,000 tokens for $5,000 . Ruvi’s 100% bonus will double your tokens to 1,000,000 tokens . If Ruvi reaches $4 per token this would be $4 million . These tiers allow early investors to make life changing returns while being part of a revolutionary project. Why Ruvi will outshine Cardano While Cardano deserves credit for its focus on scalability with Ouroboros Leios and its DeFi market share, Ruvi’s industry expanding approach sets it apart . Cardano for all its strengths has yet to meaningfully expand beyond financial use cases. Meanwhile Ruvi’s AI powered platform is extending blockchain utility to solve global business inefficiencies and drive innovation. By combining blockchain with AI Ruvi has created a system that can unlock new efficiencies that will redefine how various industries operate. This universal applicability will push Ruvi higher than Cardano has in years. Don’t miss your window of opportunity Cardano’s rally proves early crypto investments can yield exponential returns. Ruvi’s presale gives you the chance to ride the next wave of blockchain innovation. With its multi industry utility and AI integration Ruvi might just be the narrative that shapes the future of blockchain.Get your $RUVI tokens now and be part of the blockchain revolution.

In 2025, they’re no longer just early investment opportunities; they’re the launchpads for the next wave of utility-driven platforms. As the market matures, investors have sharpened their radar for tokens with substance, sustainability, and real-world use. Gone are the days of hype-only launches. This year, a select few presales have already captured serious attention. But one stealth project is stirring an unusual buzz among insiders. If you’ve been watching Pi Network and XRP communities, you’ve probably noticed it: a growing curiosity, even urgency, surrounding OpenFundNet. And it’s not without reason. The Quiet Token Launch Making Big Noise Quietly but confidently, OpenFundNet has launched its presale, and those who know how to spot value are already moving in. Unlike most platforms, OpenFundNet isn’t chasing hype. It’s focused on revolutionizing crypto crowdfunding by creating a transparent, decentralized, and frictionless system where project creators and investors win together. This isn’t just a new token launch; it’s the beginning of a community-first ecosystem that puts blockchain backers in control. Early access is now open, but for a limited time, and only to those paying attention. A Closer Look at Tokenomics That Actually Work At the heart of OpenFundNet is its native utility token: OFNT. This token powers the entire ecosystem, from project backing to validator rewards to platform governance. Here’s what makes the presale structure attractive: Fair allocation : A sizable portion of tokens is reserved for early backers. Transparency : All presale stages, unlock schedules, and bonus tiers are clearly laid out. Sustainable economics : No inflated supply or sketchy lockups. Just clean, functional tokenomics. This is presale architecture done right. It’s built for long-term health, not a quick flip. The Power Behind Daily Emissions and Dual Rewards OpenFundNet isn’t just rewarding speculation. Its system is designed to fuel ecosystem activity with a balanced emission model. 2.7m tokens are minted daily, and here’s the kicker: they’re evenly split between two crucial roles: Backers ; who fund projects and get rewarded for supporting early innovation. Validators ; who secure and verify transactions, maintaining integrity and trust. This dual reward mechanism does more than just keep things running, it actively incentivizes real engagement on both ends of the platform. It’s a win-win for everyone involved. Breaking Barriers With Zero Platform Fees Most crowdfunding platforms suck value from both creators and investors. OpenFundNet? Not a single platform fee. This is huge. By eliminating fees, OpenFundNet gives projects a better shot at success and investors a cleaner return profile. Whether you’re backing the next killer DApp or staking to validate the network, more value flows back to you. It’s crowdfunding without the middleman. And that means better ROI for early believers. Why Pi Network Supporters Are Turning Toward OpenFundNet The Pi Network community has long focused on accessibility and decentralized tools for everyday users. As Pi continues building its utility ecosystem, some users are seeking more immediate use cases and rewards. OpenFundNet’s mobile-friendly, zero-fee model and daily emissions speak to Pi Network’s grassroots ethos. With Pi currently priced at $1.18 and projected to reach $3.00 in the next four weeks, many holders are exploring platforms like OpenFundNet that offer real-time utility and earning potential. For these users, it feels like the next logical leap. What XRP Whales See in OpenFundNet’s Infrastructure Model XRP has always stood out for its focus on efficient financial infrastructure. Now, some XRP whales are taking early positions in OpenFundNet due to its dual-incentive validator model and scalable emission system. With XRP’s price currently at $2.61 and projected to reach $5.80 in the next four weeks, investors are looking for platforms that offer both near-term rewards and long-term growth potential. OpenFundNet’s daily token output and transparent validator backing check all the right boxes. Bonuses and Perks for the Early Believers Let’s talk about perks. Early adopters of OpenFundNet aren’t just getting in before the crowd; they’re getting bonuses built to reward conviction. Presale participants enjoy: Tiered token bonuses for early contributions Exclusive Discord roles for backers and validators Early access to platform features Governance voting rights from day one These aren’t just fluff incentives. They’re designed to give early buyers a real edge as the platform scales. How to Join Before This Presale Goes Public Joining the presale is simple, but the window won’t stay open long. Payment method : USDT Access point : Join the Discord to verify and participate. Presale stage : Now live! The earlier you move, the better your allocation and rewards. The Final Push—Don’t Wait Until It’s Too Late Right now, OpenFundNet is still in stealth mode. But that won’t last long. With powerful tokenomics, no fees, daily emissions, and early buyer perks, it’s only a matter of time before this presale explodes onto the radar of retail investors, influencers, and major backers. And by then, it’ll be too late to catch the earliest rewards. So here’s your window: move early, or miss out. Because by the time everyone else hears about OpenFundNet, you’ll already be holding the token that helped build the future of crowdfunding.

Traders are piling into futures contracts. A notable performance has been in the Open interest department, which jumped by more than 40%. Related Reading: Avalanche Rumbles 21% Amid Record-Breaking Address Activity Rising Futures Activity According to Glassnode data posted on May 13, futures open interest for XRP surged from $2.42 billion to $3.42 billion in just one week. That $1 billion increase represents a nearly 42% rise in active contracts. When both price and open interest climb, it usually means new money is coming in and that traders expect more upside. $XRP Futures Open Interest has surged by over $1B in the past week, rising from $2.42B to $3.42B (+41.6%). This sharp increase in leverage coincides with a price rally from $2.14 to $2.48, suggesting elevated speculative activity and growing directional conviction, pic.twitter.com/QbsaOM9oxE — glassnode (@glassnode) May 13, 2025 Price Versus Market Gains Based on reports, XRP’s one‑week gain outpaces the broader cryptocurrency market, which has risen about 12% over the same period. A near‑20% jump is no small feat when most major coins are up in the low double digits. Traders see XRP as one of the stronger performers right now, and they are betting accordingly. Momentum Indicators Point Up XRP is trading higher than its 10‑, 50‑ and 200‑day moving averages. That indicates short‑term and long‑term trends are both in favor of buyers. The relative strength index is at 68, which is just short of the overbought zone. There is still space for the rally to continue before reaching a ceiling. The moving average convergence divergence has also crossed higher, suggesting continued upward momentum. Institutional Demand Grows Meanwhile, the XXRP ETF has drawn inflows for five straight weeks. Last week, it added $14 million in new money, up from $10 million the week before. The fund now holds almost $100 million in assets. Even with a 1.80% annual fee—almost twice that of some Bitcoin ETFs—investors still see value in a product tied to XRP. Odds And Projections Based on market‑prediction platforms like Polymarket, there is an 79% chance the US Securities and Exchange Commission will approve spot XRP ETFs soon. According to JPMorgan analysts, these ETFs could attract as much as $8 billion in the first year—more than what Ethereum funds saw after their September 2024 launch. That kind of demand could slingshot XRP even higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling Outlook And Risks Rallying price action, growing open interest, and steady ETF inflows make a bullish case. Fast gains could just as easily fade away if traders lock in profits; a drop through the 50-day average would serve as a warning signal. Regulatory delays or a broader sell-off in crypto could derail the rally as well. For now, XRP sits atop its key averages and sees fresh capital coming in. Many traders and institutions are leaning bullish. Yet anyone getting involved should watch the technical levels and keep an eye on news about spot ETF approvals. If those pieces fall into place, XRP could be set for another leg up. But if markets cool off or regulators hit pause, the run may stall.

Each is actively shaping May 2025 through quantifiable upgrades and measurable market momentum. As the blockchain sector processes a wave of technical developments, consensus is emerging across developer networks and professional trading circles, a shift is underway. In this developing narrative, Qubetics ($TICS), Hyperliquid (HYPE), and Tezos (XTZ) have positioned themselves at the forefront, each addressing distinct challenges while accelerating adoption within their respective domains. Qubetics ($TICS), currently in its 34th presale stage, isn’t merely stepping into the light—it’s redefining how digital assets solve real-world bottlenecks. Unlike prior projects that got tangled in compatibility silos or bloated throughput, Qubetics is sculpted to answer pressing concerns of financial interoperability, cross-chain interactions, and on-chain efficiencies. Let’s find out which Is the best crypto to buy for May 2025: Qubetics, Bitcoin, or Aptos? Qubetics ($TICS): The Real-World Problem Solver with Advanced Interoperability Qubetics ($TICS) operates with a singular principle: digital finance must evolve to reflect the multi-chain world users navigate daily. Incompatible chains once created roadblocks for smooth data and value transfer. Qubetics counters this by offering seamless interoperability among major blockchain ecosystems. It achieves this via a consensus-enabled bridge framework, allowing assets and information to move frictionlessly. A healthcare platform verifying insurance details instantly across blockchains, or decentralized exchanges pooling liquidity from different protocols without compromising execution speed. These use cases no longer belong to fiction. Qubetics’ architecture, built around dynamic validators and real-time oracles, enables execution at scale. The project has surpassed $17 million in raised funds in its 34-stage crypto presale . At a current price of $0.2532, over 512 million tokens have been acquired by more than 26,300 participants. If $TICS reaches $1 post-presale, participants could see a 295% ROI. At $10 post-mainnet, returns could soar up to 3,848%. These aren’t dreams; they’re calculated projections that reflect strategic momentum. For those seeking the best crypto to buy for May 2025, Qubetics offers a blend of utility, traction, and future-facing design that few can rival. The Strategic Value of Blockchain Interoperability As blockchain ecosystems expand, the capacity for networks to operate cohesively has become a fundamental requirement rather than a technical luxury. Interoperability facilitates seamless interaction between distinct chains, enabling decentralized applications to exchange information, automate cross-chain processes, and unlock broader utility across diverse platforms. This capability not only enhances system efficiency and user experience but also supports scalable infrastructure for real-world deployment in sectors such as finance, logistics, and data authentication. Projects like Qubetics ($TICS) exemplify how robust interoperability frameworks can transform isolated networks into an integrated digital economy. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Deep Liquidity and On-Chain Efficiency on the Rise Hyperliquid (HYPE) has carved a niche with precision. It’s not chasing headlines. It’s chasing perfection in liquidity distribution and execution layers. Currently trading at $25.96 with a 5.7% daily rise, HYPE is signaling institutional-grade performance with grassroots-level access. The platform’s smart routing engine tracks optimal liquidity paths and executes trades across multiple pools in milliseconds. While others are still patching up bottlenecks, HYPE is setting new execution standards. As of May 14, 2025, the coin has hit a high of $26.29 and dipped no lower than $24.54 intraday, showing strong confidence from digital asset participants. For anyone narrowing down the best crypto to buy for May 2025, HYPE earns its position through consistency, sharp engineering, and ecosystem scalability. Tezos (XTZ): A Reliable Beacon in Blockchain Governance and Smart Contract Flexibility Tezos (XTZ) continues to prove that steady doesn’t mean stagnant. With an intraday high of $0.6997 and a current value of $0.6922 (up 4.4% in 24 hours), Tezos showcases resilience that stands tall amidst rapid market oscillations. At its core, Tezos thrives on upgradable governance and smart contract adaptability. This means fewer hard forks, reduced friction during network upgrades, and more agile integration of features. With a layered approach to consensus and governance, the protocol adapts without disruption, making it ideal for NFT platforms, DeFi protocols, and DAO structures. Or a DAO system that can autonomously change voting parameters after governance approval. These efficiencies matter. They save time, reduce costs, and protect systems from exploit vectors. For those evaluating the best crypto to buy for May 2025, Tezos delivers an understated but potent promise: reliability meets evolution. Why These Three Should Be on Every Portfolio Watchlist When dissecting what truly qualifies as the best crypto to buy for May 2025 , it’s about more than numbers. It’s about momentum, community strength, technical vision, and real-world alignment. Qubetics ($TICS) leads the charge with interoperable frameworks that could redefine transactional efficiency across industries. Its crypto presale traction and ROI potential have created a growing wave of urgency. Hyperliquid (HYPE) brings institutional-grade execution to decentralized ecosystems. Tezos (XTZ) reminds the market that foundational strength and smart governance still matter. In a sector prone to hype and volatility, Tezos holds steady ground with performance and upgradability baked into its DNA. For early buyers who act before the cycle rotates again, these three coins don’t just offer upside—they offer a layered opportunity to be part of blockchain’s next evolution. Inaction may lead to hindsight.

These meme coins transformed modest investments into life-changing returns during previous market cycles. Now, in mid- 2025 , retail attention is swinging back toward the meme sector—and a new question is emerging: can MAGACOINFINANCE deliver a similar story? While SHIBA and DOGE remain influential, cracks are forming. SHIBA has faced setbacks following the departure of its key developer, Shytoshi Kusama , while DOGE is riding renewed optimism tied to stable prices, community growth, and potential celebrity endorsements. Still, seasoned meme coin holders are now eyeing earlier-stage plays like MAGACOINFINANCE for outsized return potential. SMART MONEY IS LOADING UP – ACT NOW SHIBA and DOGE: Veteran Players Prepare for a Second Wind SHIBA currently trades at $0.00002 with a market cap of around $12.9 billion , maintaining strong exchange volume (~$445 million daily). Despite developer exits and internal headwinds, SHIBA remains anchored in meme coin consciousness, bolstered by persistent community engagement and speculation-driven buyers. DOGE , meanwhile, has surprised many in 2025. With prices ranging between $0.15 and $0.20 , DOGE is eyeing a climb toward upper resistance around $0.29 to $0.41 . Its strength lies in its branding, widespread exchange access, and continued cultural relevance—fueled in part by figures like Elon Musk and Tesla references. It may lack formal roadmaps, but DOGE thrives on momentum. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT MAGACOINFINANCE Emerges as the Early-Stage Challenger In a meme coin cycle where timing is everything, MAGACOINFINANCE stands out—not for what it is today, but what it could become. Like DOGE in 2014 and SHIBA in 2020 , it offers early adopters exposure at the point where the biggest moves historically begin. Its combination of political meme culture and strong branding has caught the eye of crypto influencers, Telegram traders, and speculative buyers familiar with meme-driven trajectories. It hasn’t hit mainstream listings yet—but behind the scenes, its community is growing fast. On-Chain Signals Suggest Institutional Curiosity Blockchain activity is showing early signs of traction. Wallet analysis highlights the emergence of larger holder addresses, with accumulation by speculators and tracking from several whale-watching communities. Meanwhile, MAGACOINFINANCE is seeing increased mentions across meme-themed forums, further supporting its quiet momentum buildup. While it’s too early to predict long-term performance, the alignment of investor sentiment, cultural timing, and low entry pricing makes MAGACOINFINANCE a clear contender in the current meme rotation wave.

But the landscape has evolved. SHIBA and DOGE remain favorites for those seeking nostalgia and relative stability. MAGACOINFINANCE , by contrast, is drawing the risk-tolerant crowd—those hunting for outsized upside at the start of a narrative.

Analysts are already eyeing higher resistance levels at $0.85 and beyond, fueled by aligned EMA trends and growing market optimism. This resurgence not only underscores Cardano’s resilience but also highlights the appetite for cryptocurrencies that offer strong use cases and a vision for the future. Enter Ruvi, a game-changing project that could chart a growth story as compelling as Cardano’s. Ruvi blends blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) to create a dynamic platform tailored for creators, enterprises, and innovators. With its presale attracting early investors, some are already speculating that Ruvi could replicate, or even surpass, the stellar rise of projects like Cardano. What Cardano’s rise reveals about blockchain potential Cardano has consistently won over investors with its focus on scalability, sustainability, and academic rigor. With a supply cap of just 45 billion ADA tokens, it ensures scarcity while enabling utility across decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and NFTs. Its gradual breakout above $0.80 confirms bullish trends reflected in technical indicators like its EMA fan-out and RSI in the neutral zone. Analysts predict price targets ranging from $1.10 to $1.30 if resistance levels are broken. Ruvi stands to learn from this trajectory. Like Cardano, it combines scarcity with utility but focuses on integrating AI technology into its blockchain. By bridging these two high-growth sectors, Ruvi positions itself at the intersection of innovation and profitability. Why Ruvi could be the next bull run darling Ruvi’s unique proposition lies in its ability to use AI for predictive analytics, content generation, and operational optimization. This isn’t just a blockchain for trading or staking; it’s a platform designed to solve real-world inefficiencies in industries like healthcare, logistics, and digital media. The $RUVI token powers this ecosystem, allowing users to earn rewards while contributing to its decentralized growth. Its deflationary tokenomics mirror some of Cardano’s success. Ruvi’s token supply is capped at 5 billion, creating scarcity and paving the way for long-term value appreciation. Its innovative applications in predictive AI and community-focused reward mechanisms make it an enticing prospect for both retail and institutional investors. Investment scenarios with Ruvi Much like Cardano’s early days, Ruvi is giving investors a golden opportunity through its presale program. Here’s how investors can maximize their returns with Ruvi, based on a presale price of $0.01 per token and attractive bonuses: $800 investment At $0.01 per token, $800 secures 80,000 Ruvi tokens. Coupled with a 40% bonus, you gain an extra 32,000 tokens, totaling 112,000 tokens. Should Ruvi hit $2, this initial stake could grow to an impressive $224,000. $1,500 investment A $1,500 investment yields 150,000 tokens during presale. Applying the 60% bonus, you earn an additional 90,000 tokens, bringing your total to 240,000 tokens. If Ruvi reaches $2, this turns into a staggering $480,000. $7,000 investment High-tier investors benefit significantly from the 100% bonus. For $7,000, you receive 700,000 tokens, doubled to 1.4 million tokens after the bonus. At a projected token price of $3, this investment could soar to $4.2 million. These well-structured tiers are attracting savvy investors who understand the value of getting in early on a project poised for exponential growth. How Ruvi lessons from Cardano’s success Like Cardano, Ruvi is a project that aims to break free from speculative trading and instead focus on real-world impact. Cardano’s Vasil upgrade and zkSNARKs adoption show that long-term technological advancements can shift market sentiment. Similarly, Ruvi’s incorporation of cutting-edge AI places it ahead of the curve in sectors such as decentralized predictive modeling and automation. Get in on Ruvi’s presale before the next big breakout Ruvi is offering a chance to join a revolution that could reshape industries. With Cardano paving the way for blockchain adaptability, Ruvi’s AI-driven technology promises unparalleled potential. Early adopters who secure $RUVI tokens now are setting themselves up for exponential returns as blockchain and AI continue to disrupt conventional systems. Don’t miss out on Ruvi’s presale. Be part of the next big thing in cryptocurrency and watch your investment grow as Ruvi unfolds its vision of a smarter, decentralized future. The time to act is now!

The Russian media outlet RG quoted the North Caucasus branch of the national power provider Rosseti as stating that it has used the solutions to detect “dozens of underground crypto mining farms in Dagestan.” Russian Power Engineers: A New Way to Find Crypto Miners? The power firm and its Dagestan subsidiary Dagenergo say they pioneered these solutions in the villages of Balakhani and Maidanskoye. The village of Balakhani in Dagestan, Russia. (Source: Al-Gimrawiy [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Villagers had written to the firms complaining about frequent power outages. Suspecting the presence of crypto miners, the power providers contacted internet providers and mobile operators. The parties agreed to cut off residents’ internet access for a short period. Then, they measured the load on the villages’ power grid. The power firms found that the load dropped by 3.2 MW. They calculated that this meant that “about 900 crypto mining rigs” were operating in the two villages. Rosseti said that 3.2 MW would provide enough electricity to power up to 1,500 houses. The company added that the two villages are home to fewer than 900 families. Using similar methods could help power engineers quickly identify crypto miners on grid maps, power providers suggested. However, they conceded that tracking down illegal miners has become increasingly difficult. Many miners hide their rigs in outbuildings and livestock farms, or use mobile units housed in vans and trucks to avoid detection. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday he was in favour of imposing new sanctions on Russia in coming days if Moscow failed to agree to a ceasefire, mentioning financial services and oil and gas as possible targets. https://t.co/KbeNkCNkgj — Reuters China (@ReutersChina) May 14, 2025 Dagestan’s Crypto Mining Woes In Dagestan’s Sergokalinsky District, engineers say they found a crypto mining farm operating “several meters underground.” A recent crackdown in the republic’s Untsukulsky District has seen officers confiscate “dozens” of rigs. The crackdown saw the power providers launch 35 legal cases pertaining to “unauthorized and unmetered electricity consumption.” The providers have pressed charges against 30 people in four villages in Untsukulsky. Crypto mining is illegal during the winter months in Dagestan until 2031. But observers say that North Caucasus villages continue to buzz with the sound of cooling fans throughout the year. The region’s famously low electricity prices continue to draw crypto miners to the area. And many quasi-legal miners fail to declare their operations, paying heavily subsidized residential rates to power scores of mining rigs, Rosseti added. The Sergokalinsky District in the Russian Republic of Dagestan. (Source: Fred Schaerli [CC BY-SA 3.0]) Crypto Miners ‘Stealing Millions of USD from Grids’ Rosseti North Caucasus said that Dagestan leads in the North Caucasus region in terms of the number of illegal crypto farms it has identified. The power provided said that both the number of illegal mining farms and the volume of electricity stolen by miners in Dagestan doubled in 2024. The firm said that, over the past three years, illegal and quasi-legal crypto miners have stolen an estimated 400 million rubles ($5 million) worth of power from the Dagestan grid. Vyacheslav Afanasyev, a senior executive at the power system operator Southern Unified Energy System, conceded that quasi-legal and illegal mining continues to be a problem. Afanasyev said that many underground crypto mining farms continue to pay for electricity at household rates or “do not pay at all.” He added: “We can see that substations where the loads were once well short of full capacity are currently experiencing overloads.” Such a phenomenon can only be explained by the presence of illicit crypto miners, he suggested. President Donald Trump said Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other US officials will go to Istanbul later this week for potential talks between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders, even if there’s still no certainty that Vladimir Putin will show up. https://t.co/cp4uT1s0qf — Bloomberg (@business) May 13, 2025 More Mining Bans to Follow? Government bodies have said they are considering requests to issue year-round bans on mining in a number of regions . They are also considering extending the existing ban to encompass more parts of the country. Other Russian republics, however, have been encouraged to welcome miners if they have idle electrical capacity . In the southern part of the Bitcoin mining hub of Irkutsk, meanwhile, crypto mining has already been banned completely until 2031. Some Russian regulatory bodies have also argued that Moscow should introduce criminal liability for people who flaunt crypto mining rules . At present, courts only have the power to issue relatively minor fines for the improper use of electricity. Politicians claim that the threat of heavier fines or even jail time would serve as a more efficient deterrent.

While the market continues to swing with sharp volatility, savvy investors are looking beyond quick pumps and turning to tokens with structure, strategy, and sustainability. This week’s action proves the meme coin race is heating up once again. Shiba Inu ($SHIB) increased by 3.69% over the past 24 hours, pushing its price to $0.00001606. The movement reflects cautious optimism among holders after recent dips. In contrast, Moo Deng ($MOODENG) launched a dramatic 33.54% rally, now trading at $0.2816, fueled by short-term excitement and renewed community activity. But the real standout in this cycle isn’t a reactive token—it’s Troller Cat ($TCAT), which is proactively building value through a presale that’s already gained 72.8% across its first four stages. With the next price jump just days away and a projected ROI of 6,044.68%, $TCAT is quickly becoming the best meme coin to buy today. Don’t miss out— Buy TCAT while it’s still early and BuyTCAT to lock in maximum gains before Stage 5 hits. Troller Cat ($TCAT): A Meme Movement Built for Longevity Troller Cat’s presale began on May 2, 2025, at 6 PM UTC with a launch price of $0.00000500. As of Stage 4, it has reached $0.00000864—reflecting a 72.8% increase in value within just ten days. Its final listing price of $0.0005309 puts early investors in a position for a staggering 6,044.68% ROI, setting the tone for one of the most lucrative meme coin entries in the space right now. The presale isn’t a one-off marketing ploy—it’s divided into 26 strategic stages, each tied to a historic trolling moment. The narrative blends community engagement with scarcity mechanics, helping fuel sustained demand. More than 500 participants have already joined, contributing over $100,000 in funding, and that number is rising fast. Troller Cat is built on Ethereum, with full audit and KYC approval in place. It’s also more than a passive hold. Staking is already live in the presale, offering 69% APY to holders willing to lock their $TCAT. Unlike projects that inflate token supplies, this one is layered with deflationary pressure, creating upward price momentum by design. If a buyer enters now with a $40,000 investment at the current price of $0.00000864, they would receive approximately 4.62 billion $TCAT tokens. When the coin lists at $0.0005309, that bag could grow to over $2.45 million, excluding staking rewards and referral bonuses. Inside the Game Center: Where Ads Fuel Burns TrollerCat ’s Play-to-Earn Game Center isn’t just entertainment—it’s a utility powerhouse. Every user must watch in-game video ads at set intervals. Those ads, banner placements, and platform traffic generate consistent revenue, which is then used to buy back and burn $TCAT monthly. It’s a rare closed-loop system in meme coin territory, turning gameplay into real value. That makes every interaction more than fun—it’s profitable. More usage means more ad revenue, which in turn means more tokens burned. Over time, this deflation reduces supply and increases scarcity, helping support upward price action. Pair that with a referral program that unlocks after a $25 investment, and the viral growth factor multiplies. Both the referrer and the new buyer receive a 10% bonus, trackable through a clean referral dashboard. With Stage 5 priced 34.95% higher and less than 72 hours away, the window to maximize these incentives is closing fast. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): Recovering, But Still Uncertain Over the past 24 hours, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has seen a 3.69% increase, pushing the price to $0.00001606. This move follows a brief period of consolidation after several weeks of sideways activity. While the bounce is modest, it reflects growing confidence among short-term traders attempting to re-establish support near the $0.000015 level. Shiba Inu remains one of the most recognizable meme coins in the world, but its massive supply and long-term stagnation have raised questions about future performance. Chart analysis shows a weak breakout with resistance forming near $0.0000172, which it failed to break in its last three attempts. The token’s recent movement appears volume-driven, with small whale buys and social media buzz playing key roles. However, no new utility updates or ecosystem developments have been introduced in the past few weeks. While loyal holders remain active, the absence of fresh incentives or scarcity mechanisms continues to hinder meaningful momentum. For investors seeking long-term upside, Shiba Inu may require more than market sentiment—it needs innovation and deflationary redesigns to regain its former firepower. Moo Deng ($MOODENG): Sudden Rally, High Risk Moo Deng ($MOODENG) delivered a strong 33.54% price increase, rising to $0.2816 over the last 24 hours. This surprise jump came after a burst of online engagement and a sharp uptick in mid-level exchange volume. While the cause of the rally appears largely speculative, the community response has been bullish. The token broke past a resistance level at $0.21, converting it into a new short-term support zone. Technical indicators are flashing overbought signals, suggesting a potential cooldown unless fresh buyers continue to enter the market. That said, Moo Deng’s roadmap remains vague. There’s no staking, referral utility, or deflationary model backing its value—just short-term excitement and branding strength. While this may lead to further pumps, it also opens the door to sharp reversals if momentum fades. Right now, Moo Deng is riding the hype train effectively. But for investors looking for long-term confidence, it lacks the structural mechanics needed to maintain value once market euphoria fades. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Troller Cat offers more than hype—it offers layered utility, a deflationary economic engine, a gamified burn model, and clear ROI potential. Shiba Inu is recovering, but lacking fresh innovation, while Moo Deng is soaring on momentum but light on fundamentals. Troller Cat checks every box for investors searching for the best meme coin to buy today. With staking, a 6,000% ROI window, a referral program, and a thriving Game Center model, the opportunity is now. Head to Trollercat.com , secure your Stage 4 position, and prepare to leap to Stage 5 before the price climbs again.

These cutting-edge AI agents enable real-time content creation and dynamic meme generation, marking a significant transformation in how meme coins can integrate with artificial intelligence (AI). As the FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale approaches a full sell-out, bolstered by an 80% bonus, the timing of this strategic launch is generating serious momentum among early adopters and crypto analysts alike. Meme-o-Matic: A Cultural Engine Built To Outpace ChatGPT And GROK FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Meme-o-Matic, which is currently undergoing beta testing, represents a seismic leap in AI meme generation, positioning itself as a practical, real-time alternative to static tools like ChatGPT and GROK.

Designed for relevance and speed, this AI agent learns from live data feeds, user inputs, and historical patterns, enabling FloppyPepe (FPPE) users to instantly generate culturally resonant, trend-aligned memes. What makes the Meme-o-Matic AI agent particularly useful is its capability to pull sentiment from live market shifts, crypto news, and global events. Unlike GROK and ChatGPT, which rely heavily on prompt tuning for creative content, this AI agent eliminates that friction by auto-generating meme templates tailored to emerging narratives. It’s not just a creative assistant; it’s a cultural strategist that expands the project and solidifies it as a serious player in the $66B AI token market. FloppyX: The Video Bot AI Agent That Puts ChatGPT And GROK On Notice FloppyX AI agent introduces a real-time AI video creation framework that rivals the capabilities of GROK and ChatGPT’s multimodal systems. Powered by GPU-accelerated rendering and dynamic NLP, this AI agent crafts self-aware video narratives that adapt to feedback, market events , and sentiment. Key developments of FloppyX: Real-Time Interaction: Auto-reacts to market or global news with scheduled, branded video responses.

Effortless Content Creation Pipeline: Input Integration: Text, sentiment data, and prompts processed via NLU. Rendering Engine: CNN-based visual continuity. Dynamic Scheduling: Time-aligned delivery for maximum engagement. FloppyX AI agent positions itself not just as a content engine, but as a decentralized brand ambassador. The edge over ChatGPT and GROK is clear: deeper customization, stronger community roots, and meme-native intelligence. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Presale Almost Sold Out: Final Chance For 80% Bonus The FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale is nearing a full sell-out, presenting a final chance for investors to secure an 80% token bonus with the code FLOPPY80 —an offer that applies even to existing buyers. After raising $907,200 in just 24 hours during its private round and pricing the public presale at only $0.0000002 , the project is gaining strong momentum as it approaches its next stage. Investors are rushing into the presale due to FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) meticulously crafted floppynomics model. Each transaction triggers a 1% burn to curb supply and a 1% redistribution to reward holders. The zero-tax token design further maintains deep liquidity across platforms FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Vision For Viral Dominance FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) strategy is rooted in scale and community: Tier 1 CEX Listings Incoming Uniswap Integration Imminent CMC & CoinGecko Listings Secured Discord and X Community Exploding in Growth Influencer Backing: Endorsed by David In Crypto, Crypto Legends, etc. Future phases involve AI-powered market analytics, meme tournaments, global partnerships, and an airdrop campaign for loyal holders. Unlike ChatGPT or GROK, which exist behind paywalls and silos, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) tools are community-accessible and decentralized by design. FloppyPepe (FPPE) 80% Bonus Is Still On: Don’t Miss It While ChatGPT and GROK remain generalist giants, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Meme-o-Matic and FloppyX AI agents offer culture-native, community-driven, and meme-optimized tools that bring AI directly to crypto holders. The project is also protected with a regular audit conducted by SolidProof, multi-signature wallets, and an active bug bounty program to maintain system robustness. With only a few tokens left at the current presale price of $0.0000002 , the 80% bonus is still active with code: FLOPPY80, and exchange listings are already scheduled.

XLM price has closely followed XRP price action in the past, and both have hinted at potential rally toward price discovery soon. Stellar (XLM) price has gradually gained bullish momentum in the past six weeks. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $15.1 billion and an average 24-hour traded volume of about $314 million, rallied over 25 percent in the past four weeks to trade about $0.3033 on Wednesday, May 14, during the late North American trading session. The notable return of FOMO altcoin trading, as evident in the Ethereum price rally against Bitcoin, played a crucial role in the gradual rebound of XLM price. Moreover, XLM’s Futures Open Interest (OI) surged from $112 million on April 14 to about $196 million at the time of this writing Stellar Network and Institutional Adoption The Stellar network has grown over the past years to a vibrant web3 ecosystem. Since the launch of the smart contract capabilities through the Soroban upgrade in early 2024, the Stellar network has attracted more institutional investors seeking to tokenize real-world assets (RWA) to explore more global markets. For instance, several institutional investors led by Franklin Templeton, Circle USDC, IBM, and MoneyGram, among others, have explored RWA tokenization on the Stellar network. At the time of this writing, the Stellar network had over $54 million in total value locked and more than $353 million in stablecoin market cap. What Next for XLM Price In the past years, it is evident XLM price action mirrored that of rival Ripple Labs’ XRP. After six years of symmetrical consolidation, both XRP and XLM broke out and signaled the onset of the macro bull rally. In the daily timeframe, XLM price has already broken out of a falling wedge pattern and now aims at hitting 60 cents in the near term. Moreover, the daily MACD line recently crossed the zero line amid a potential breakout from an inverse head and shoulder (H&S) pattern.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XLM|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-14 23:35:25

Infrastructure-focused assets like KASPA , SUI , and XRP continue building on solid foundations—but capital is shifting. Meme coins, fueled by cultural sentiment and political virality, are driving exponential rallies. The meme cycle is no longer just noise—it’s attracting serious capital. While KASPA’s technical roadmap and DAG architecture keep it in high regard, and SUI continues its remarkable comeback, traders are increasingly rotating into tokens like MAGACOINFINANCE , drawn by its blend of political commentary and meme energy. THE CLOCK IS TICKING FAST – ACT NOW Technical Titans: KASPA, SUI, and XRP Hold Their Ground—for Now KASPA currently trades near $0.10 , with a market cap of roughly $2.7 billion . Backed by a unique blockDAG structure and a loyal developer community, KASPA has improved transaction speeds and scalability post-fork. Still, in this cycle, fundamentals alone aren’t always enough. SUI remains fundamentally strong, now valued over $8 billion , buoyed by consistent user growth and high-speed Layer-1 innovation. Price projections suggest a move toward $8.3–$9.0 by June—but volatility persists. XRP , one of the longest-standing giants, continues to average around $2.4–$2.5 with over $3.7 billion in daily volume. Though it enjoys deep liquidity and institutional interest, price growth remains tied to regulatory developments and macro adoption triggers. MAGACOINFINANCE: Quietly Rewriting the Meme Coin Playbook Amid meme favorites like DOGE , PEPE , and TRUMP , MAGACOINFINANCE is carving out a different path. It blends political branding with meme appeal—resulting in growing traction among retail traders and early-stage allocators seeking rotation trades. While it hasn’t reached billion-dollar daily volume yet, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining ground through a focused pre-sale phase. Its narrative-driven approach resonates with those seeking more than speculative hype—this coin is building a community centered around culture and identity. Early Momentum and Accumulation Indicators Though still in development, MAGACOINFINANCE is generating key early signals: Community Growth : Social engagement is up significantly, with Discord and Beacon activity rising over the past two weeks Retail Inflow : Wallet analysis shows increasing accumulation from TRUMP and DOGE investors Narrative Alignment : Influencers within the meme sector have begun covering MAGACOINFINANCE’s positioning While its market cap lags behind SUI or XRP, early acquisition of MAGACOINFINANCE mimics the early movements seen in PEPE and TRUMP before their explosive growth. Can Fundamentals Compete With the Meme Trade in 2025? The truth is: fundamentals and memes are now clashing more directly than ever. KASPA offers true innovation and developer commitment. SUI has liquidity depth and speed. XRP remains a regulated, institutional bet. But meme coins are winning attention—and fast. MAGACOINFINANCE may not be the most technically robust token, but its cultural resonance and early-stage nature could turn it into the breakout of summer. With a limited token supply and a community-first approach, it plays into 2025’s rotating narrative economy where sentiment drives price as much as code. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X Conclusion: The Rotation Is Real—and MAGACOINFINANCE Is on the Radar As this market cycle matures, capital is flowing toward tokens with momentum, not just technology. KASPA, SUI, and XRP will remain relevant—but MAGACOINFINANCE represents the other side of the market: fast-moving, meme-aligned, and potentially explosive. With growing volume, rising attention, and a politically infused brand, this altcoin may be poised for a short-term surge—before its listing hits full throttle. To learn more about MAGACOINFINANCE , please visit Website: https://magacoinfinance.com Twitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance FAQs What is MAGACOINFINANCE and how does it compare to major coins like SUI or XRP? MAGACOINFINANCE is a meme-driven token rooted in political culture. Unlike Layer-1 chains like SUI or settlement networks like XRP, it gains traction through narrative appeal rather than infrastructure use. Is XRP still affected by regulatory risk? Yes. While Ripple has gained clarity in some regions, global regulatory pressures remain a variable, and institutional demand is tied to long-term compliance.

Retail investor interest typically peaks 1 week after BTC breaks all-time highs. Bitcoin ( BTC ) retail traders are known for entering the market during periods of euphoria, typically after strong monthly gains or a new all-time high. This time is no different, with Bitcoin approaching $104,000 on May 14 while general public interest and retail activity continue to lag. Analysts estimate that in 2025, retail investors were the largest net sellers of BTC, while institutions were the main buyers. But if historical patterns hold, a surge in retail appetite is likely to occur about one week after Bitcoin surpasses the $109,350 mark. Source: X/River According to River’s estimates, individual investors sold a total of 247,000 BTC throughout 2025, equivalent to $23 billion based on the average price during the period. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s Strategy accounted for 77% of the 157,000 BTC acquired by businesses that year. Retail interest for Bitcoin nears 6-month lows Current search trends for the term “Bitcoin” match levels last seen in June 2024, when BTC was trading around $66,000 after three months of failing to break above $73,000.

Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph The retail excitement coincided with Bitcoin breaking its previous all-time high of $73,757 on Nov. 6, 2024, with excitement peaking nine days later. Although retail traders missed most of the gains from the $67,000 level a month earlier, the bullish trend persisted as Bitcoin surged to $107,000 by mid-December 2024. Related: Bitcoin bulls aim for new all-time highs by next week as capital inflows soar Buying Bitcoin near an all-time high is a sub-optimal strategy A comparable spike in retail demand occurred on March 9, 2024, when the Coinbase app rose to the fourth most downloaded in the US finance category, up from 35th place just two weeks earlier. At the same time, Google search interest for “Bitcoin” hit its highest level in 20 months, roughly six days after Bitcoin surpassed its prior record daily close of $68,000 from November 2021. The retail interest jump in March 2024 followed a 56% price increase in just 30 days, with BTC climbing from $43,100 to $68,100. In contrast to the November 2024 breakout, the following seven months saw erratic price movements, with Bitcoin struggling to maintain levels above $70,000. Retail traders tend to react to previous all-time highs, but this often means they miss out on most of the upside. The net outflows from retail investors while Bitcoin trades 5.5% below all-time high reinforce the “Bitcoin” search trends and Coinbase app rankings, supporting the idea that retail demand emerges roughly one week after a previous all-time high is surpassed.

Pseudonymous analyst Kaleo tells his 698,600 followers on the social media platform X Sui’s ( SUI ) price action over the last two years looks very similar to SOL’s 2020-2021 market structure. In 2021, Solana exploded and rallied by about 300% in just three months after shattering its resistance at $55. Says Kaleo, “SUI looks primed for a move similar to the one SOL made in the Fall of 2021. SUI has been the emerging layer-1 market leader this cycle, similar to what SOL was then. If current structural similarities continue to play out, things are about to get fun.” Source: Kaleo/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that SUI is close to skyrocketing and printing new all-time highs. At time of writing, SUI is trading for $4.04. Kaleo is also bullish on the leading memecoin Dogecoin ( DOGE ). The analyst shares a chart suggesting that Dogecoin may be repeating its 2018-2021 market structure. “It’s finally time to pay attention again to the king of memes.” Source: Kaleo/X Based on the chart, Kaleo believes that DOGE will soar to $3 before 2025 expires. At time of writing, DOGE is worth $0.239. As for Bitcoin, the trader sees BTC running close to $200,000 with short and shallow pullbacks. “Up only from here fellas.” Source: Kaleo/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $103,868.

Bonk (BONK) is drawing attention again after a sharp 10% jump, placing its $0.00002 target back in focus, especially if its wedge pattern continues to hold. At the same time, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading above $0.00001718, backed by a bullish cup and handle setup and rising interest from large holders. Those tracking top crypto gainers aren’t just looking at charts. BlockDAG is also in the spotlight, with its podcast-led push for openness helping the project collect over $247 million in presale funds. With strong community momentum and a clear roadmap, BlockDAG (BDAG) is one of the few names offering both data and direction this cycle. BONK’s Price Eyes the $0.00002 Break Bonk (BONK) is climbing again after bouncing 10% from support inside a rising wedge that began forming in March. With the price aiming for $0.00002, many traders believe a breakout is close. Several indicators support this view. The Stochastic RSI remains low, a level often linked to trend reversals. Analysts are focusing on the wedge pattern as a sign that price pressure is building. Above the current range, multiple liquidity points line up with the target. If these get cleared, price could move fast. With bulls in charge, $0.00002 may act as more than just a resistance, it could spark the next rally leg. BONK is shaping up to be one of the top crypto gainers to watch closely this month. SHIB Builds Momentum Above Key Support Shiba Inu (SHIB) is showing strength after moving past $0.00001718. Analysts are tracking a potential climb toward $0.00002215, which would be a 29% rise. The structure also supports a bullish cup and handle formation. Another strong sign is whale activity, large wallets have increased their buying by almost 3,000%, suggesting a growing interest. On the technical side, SHIB is holding above important moving averages and staying well above the $0.00001600 level. If SHIB keeps this pattern, it may reach $0.00002200–$0.00002700 soon. With Shibarium activity rising, this memecoin could remain in play for those tracking the top crypto gainers this season. BlockDAG Podcast Drives $247M Surge in Presale BlockDAG (BDAG) is taking a fresh approach to crypto communication. Instead of traditional PR, the team has launched a podcast series that opens the floor to the community. The show features engineers, analysts, and key figures discussing DAG structure, market insights, and future goals. The format is working. Community members ask questions, hosts reply on air, and the feedback loop grows stronger. As a result, the numbers tell a clear story. BlockDAG has raised over $247 million, sold more than 20.2 billion BDAG, and reached Batch 28 in its presale. Its early stages offered steep gains, returning 2520% from Batch 1 to the current price of $0.0262. But there’s still time to act. A limited offer is live with BDAG available at $0.0020, and this price is frozen until June 13th. More than 17,000 miners have already been sold, totaling over $7 million in miner sales. The project’s podcast has also helped build trust, with each episode increasing wallet sign-ups and community engagement. Core team guests keep the message clear: BlockDAG is here to explain, not just market. For those analyzing top crypto gainers, this podcast-backed momentum shows real traction before the final presale phases kick in. Strong Setups and Clear Signals Across the Board BONK and SHIB continue to show technical strength, with both tokens building on support and chasing higher levels. BONK’s price is nearing a breakout, while SHIB’s pattern points toward higher targets. Traders focused on short-term moves are watching both closely. Meanwhile, BlockDAG’s presale remains a highlight. Its podcast format has boosted community trust, making its growth numbers stand out. With over $247 million raised, more than 20.2 billion coins sold, and a frozen price of $0.0020 until June 13th, BDAG presents a clear opportunity in this market phase.

With countless new projects launching every month, spotting one with real potential isn’t easy. But when a token raises over $4 million in its presale and has a launch price 1,747% higher than its current sale price, it’s hard to ignore. That’s where Web3 ai stands out. Analysts aren’t just taking notice, they’re forecasting returns as high as 1000x to 5000x post-launch. For anyone looking for the best crypto to buy early, Web3 ai is shaping up to be a smart bet before it hits the exchange. Web3 ai Presale Hits $4M, And It’s Only Getting Started Web3 ai’s presale is blazing through the stages. Just days after launching stage 4, the project raked in over $4 million in total funds, and it’s not just the whales making moves. Investors from all corners are diving in at $0.000347 per token, setting themselves up for a launch price of $0.005242, a potential 1747% ROI even before exchanges come into play. For many, that’s already enough to put it on the radar as one of the best early crypto buys. But here’s where it gets even more interesting. What’s really grabbing the attention of analysts isn’t just the impressive price difference. It’s the solid foundation Web3 ai has built. This project isn’t riding on hype alone; it’s come out swinging with 12 cutting-edge AI tools aimed directly at crypto traders. From automated bots to fraud detection, arbitrage tools, and even portfolio rebalancing, it’s a one-stop-shop for everything a crypto trader needs. In a space where juggling multiple apps is the norm, Web3 ai is offering an all-in-one solution powered by real-time data and neural networks. With the presale still in stage 4, there’s time to get in early, though not for much longer. Analysts Predict WAI Could Deliver Over 1000x Returns! Crypto analysts are also touting Web3 ai as a breakout contender, and for good reason. The project combines cutting-edge AI functionality with practical real-world applications, launching at a price that could set early investors up for massive gains. Right now, the token is priced at $0.000347, with a confirmed exchange listing of $0.005242, offering nearly 18x returns just from the price difference alone. But the potential doesn’t stop there. While AI is making waves in the crypto space, most projects only tackle one niche use case. Web3 ai stands out by offering a suite of 12 interconnected tools, ranging from predictive models and staking advice to scam detection and DeFi optimization. These tools all work together, feeding data into one another, creating a platform that only gets smarter the more it’s used. Analysts believe this level of integration could place Web3 ai on par with well-known platforms like ChainGPT and Bitsgap, yet with a much smaller market cap and far more room to grow. If Web3 ai gains even a fraction of the adoption experts anticipate, early buyers could be looking at returns well beyond 1000x. No need for the project to crack the top 10 cryptos to see significant growth. With AI dominating tech and finance conversations, now might be the perfect time to get in on one of the best crypto opportunities before it hits the mainstream. Why Getting in Early with Web3 ai Is The Smart Move! What truly sets Web3 ai apart is its perfect timing. Unlike projects that ask investors to wait years for results, this one is already making waves. The project has a clear launch timeline and a confirmed exchange price of $0.005242, which means anyone buying in at stage 4 is getting in at a serious discount. With over $4 million raised and exchange listings on the horizon, this isn’t a “maybe”, the demand is real, and the roadmap is solid. From a tokenomics perspective, $WAI is built for lasting value. Beyond speculation, the token is used to access Web3 ai’s suite of tools and gives holders governance rights. This means real-world utility right from the start, and it aligns holders with the platform’s long-term growth. Add in an annual burn mechanism, and you’ve got a deflationary feature that helps boost token value over time. With a modular, cross-chain structure and support for wallet and API integrations, Web3 ai isn’t just a product, it’s a scalable ecosystem. This makes it one of the top crypto opportunities for long-term growth. The Bottom Line Web3 ai has quickly gone from under the radar to front and center. With over $4 million raised in its presale, a fully functional product suite, and the token priced at just $0.000347 before its $0.005242 launch, the opportunity for early investors is clear. Analysts are predicting huge gains, some even pointing to a 1000x or 5000x return. But the window to get in at this price is closing fast. For those looking for the best crypto to buy early, based on real tech, fundamentals, and timing, not just hype, Web3 ai is emerging as a solid and strategic investment choice.

Long liquidations and exchange outflows signal a bullish reset as smart money accumulates during volatility. Ethena [ENA] surged 17.35% over the past 24 hours, fueled by a trendline breakout and renewed on-chain strength across address activity and transaction size distribution. At the time of writing, ENA traded at $0.4332 and approached the $0.60 resistance, a level that capped gains for weeks. Although sellers have defended it repeatedly, ENA holds well above the mid-range. Therefore, if bulls push past $0.60, the structure could flip fully bullish with room for higher targets. Source: TradingView Address growth and large transactions point to deeper adoption On-chain activity has grown significantly. New addresses increased by 56.43% week-on-week, while active addresses rose 37.12% over the week. Simultaneously, mid-to-large transactions surged. Transactions in the $10K–$100K bracket surged 220%, while those in the $100K–$1M range ballooned 613.64%. Naturally, this pointed to rising interest from both institutional and large-scale retail participants. Therefore, the address and transaction trends align with the current price strength and suggest sustained market engagement. Source: IntoTheBlock Exchange data showed strong accumulation behavior. ENA Outflows totaled $24.11M, while inflows reached only $19.87M. Therefore, more tokens are leaving exchanges than entering them. This behavior often indicates that investors are securing assets in self-custody. As a result, sell pressure on centralized platforms decreases. Historically, Net Outflows during rallies support continued price expansion. In fact, this trend reinforces the bullish narrative and hints at deeper investor confidence in ENA’s long-term trajectory. Source: CoinGlass ENA leverage unwind intensifies as longs get wiped out Derivatives data shows a clear long squeeze. Long liquidations totaled $504.44K, while short liquidations reached only $75.45K. Overleveraged bulls initiated this reset as prices reached resistance. Clearing excessive long exposure, however, reduces market risk. This shift allows for a more stable continuation if buyers return. Therefore, the liquidation event, while sharp, may help ENA resume its climb from a healthier technical base, provided bullish momentum holds in the coming days. Short-term trader activity has spiked. Santiment data showed a rise in the 0d–1d Realized Cap HODL Waves metric, now at 0.0915. This uptick signaled heightened short-term activity, likely from momentum traders. While this adds volatility, it also injects fresh volume and liquidity. Importantly, it confirms that ENA has re-entered the market’s focus. Source: Santiment Can ENA sustain momentum and break above $0.60? Ethena continued to show strength in price structure and on-chain fundamentals. Network growth, large transactions, and reduced exchange supply support bullish sentiment. Although long liquidations caused a shakeout, leverage now looks cleaner. If ENA closes above $0.60, it may confirm a full trend reversal. Until then, the market remains cautiously optimistic.",Altcoin|News|News 1|Social|Trading View,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|ENA,"{'name': 'AMB Crypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/ambcrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",ambcrypto,2025-05-15 00:00:41

While PEPE , TRUMP , and Solana (SOL) have made waves in early 2025 , a quieter shift is unfolding beneath the surface—and MAGACOINFINANCE is emerging as a project quietly positioning for breakout. Unlike hype-driven pumps, MAGACOINFINANCE has opted for a deliberate growth path, combining a compelling political angle with disciplined token economics. Though still under the radar for many, its traction is beginning to accelerate. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Growing Attention as Investors Rotate into Value As of early May, MAGACOINFINANCE remains in its structured pre-sale phase, steadily building both its user base and community engagement across platforms like Discord and Twitter/X. This expansion is taking place at a time when investor sentiment is shifting—from overhyped launches to smaller, undervalued tokens with strong narratives. With broader interest forming around rotation trades, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining visibility among early movers and contrarian investors alike. Uptick in On-Chain Metrics and Wallet Activity Traders seeking overlooked opportunities are taking note of MAGACOINFINANCE for more than just its branding. Wallet analysis now shows increased inflows from mid-sized Ethereum wallets, often associated with early-stage venture plays. While volumes remain modest, these signs mirror pre-rally accumulation patterns seen in previous market cycles. In addition to rising community interest, its new tokenomics design—featuring time-locked releases and open developer wallets—aims to avoid the liquidity pitfalls common to meme-driven tokens. Tokenomics That Encourage Loyalty, Not Dumping Whereas most tokens struggle to sustain price post-launch, MAGACOINFINANCE integrates mechanisms to promote holding. Controlled liquidity access, transparent supply caps, and structured token vesting have helped it avoid early dumping, attracting more serious long-term holders. This stability-first approach sets it apart in a landscape often dominated by short-lived momentum trades. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW Is This the Breakout Rotation Trade of Summer 2025? Analysts are beginning to tag MAGACOINFINANCE in their rotation watchlists. Here’s what’s catching attention: Social Growth : A 60% surge in Twitter/X visibility over the past three weeks Holder Distribution : Balanced wallet distribution minimizes whale influence Engagement-to-Market Cap : Matching early FLOKI and TRUMP coin metrics from prior cycles These data points suggest that the token is being positioned for a strategic move. With altcoin rotation in full swing, MAGACOINFINANCE could become a standout from the smaller-cap sector. Conclusion: Quiet Today, But Not for Long Market interest is steadily shifting toward lower-cap, narrative-rich tokens that offer room to surprise. While projects like KASPA , XRP , and PEPE remain solid names, their large caps may limit near-term upside for new entrants. MAGACOINFINANCE , however, appears earlier in its cycle—right where long-term breakouts often begin. With increased on-chain signals, social traction, and a smart token design, this altcoin may soon move from quiet accumulation to center stage. Summer could tell the story—and MAGACOINFINANCE is writing the first chapters now.

Moderate optimism sees $210 as a likely outcome, backed by $187,000 in volume. RSI at 71 indicates overbought conditions, suggesting possible price correction soon. Solana (SOL) continues to draw investor attention in May 2025, with strong trading volumes shaping expectations for its monthly close. According to Polymarket data , market participants appear largely confident in SOL maintaining momentum, pricing in a 71% probability that the token will close near $190. This belief is backed by over $310,000 in trading volume, reflecting a strong consensus. As the market pushes forward, both technical and sentiment indicators provide further insight into potential price moves.

On-Chain Data Points To This,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-resistance-on-chain-data-points-this/,"On-chain data suggests this upcoming Dogecoin level could prove to be a resistance wall based on the investor cost basis distribution. A Large Amount Of Dogecoin Was Last Purchased At $0.36 In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about Dogecoin levels that appear significant on the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) of the memecoin. The “URPD” refers to an on-chain indicator that basically tells us about how much of the asset’s supply was last purchased at which price levels. The metric determines this cost basis for each token by checking its transaction history to see its last transfer price. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Up Despite Price Pullback, Data Shows Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the latest URPD data for Dogecoin: As displayed in the above graph, there are no levels immediately nearby to the current Dogecoin price that hold the break-even mark of a significant portion of the supply. The closest level that stands out in the URPD is around $0.21, which hosts the acquisition point of 7.5% of the DOGE supply. For the up direction, there aren’t any notable cost basis centers until all the way to $0.36, where investors last bought about 3.8% of all tokens in existence. Now, what’s the relevance of these levels to Dogecoin? To know the answer to that question, investor psychology needs to be understood first. To any holder, their cost basis is naturally an important level, so they can be prone to showing some kind of reaction when a retest of it happens. Whatever this reaction be, it’s not of significant to the cryptocurrency if only a few investors are showing it. For retests of levels that host the cost basis of a large amount of holders, however, the story can be different. The aforementioned levels could be important ones from this perspective. Generally, investors tend to react by buying if the retest is happening from above, granted the mood in the market is bullish. This is because these holders, who were in profit prior to the retest, might look at the price decline as just a ‘dip.’ Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharks & Whales Continue To Accumulate: Stage Set For New All-Time High? On the other hand, the holders who were in loss before the retest may decide to sell their Dogecoin, as they could fear that this might be their last opportunity to exit at their break-even for a while. As such, major supply walls below the DOGE spot price can act as potential support zones, while those above it may prove to be resistance areas. Given that the closest two such levels are at $0.21 and $0.36 for the asset right now, they may be where the coin could be the most probable to encounter strong support and resistance, respectively. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.237, up more than 37% in the last seven days.

Yaroslav Zhelezniak, Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Finance , Tax and Customs Policy, made the announcement. He said a bill to create the reserve is nearly complete. He hopes to bring it before parliament in the next few weeks. Ukraine has consistently been open to digital coins. The nation has been a trailblazer in embracing crypto-friendly rules, even as war with Russia rages. The war has made these things even more important for digital assets. Cryptocurrency donations helped Ukraine raise millions in humanitarian and defense aid in 2022 and 2023. Now, the government is planning a full set of overhauls, allowing cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology they are built on to go mainstream. The Ministry of Digital Transformation is leading the effort. The new law would categorize digital assets, establish exchange rules, and introduce clear tax guidelines. Officials said the measure could take effect as soon as possible if it becomes law. Binance backs Ukraine’s cryptocurrency plans Kirill Khomyakov, head of operations for Central and Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Africa at Binance, said that Binance will help Ukraine set up the Bitcoin reserve . He praised the concept but added, “It’s a heavy lift.” According to Khomyakov, founding a national cryptocurrency reserve would require several large-scale changes in Ukrainian law. These changes will take time. Additionally, he said that current legislation does not allow the owning and managing of digital assets within the frame of official reserves. But Binance is itself a believer in the long-term potential of the move. The company is also working with several countries to establish cryptocurrency-related legislation. Earlier, Binance co-founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao proposed that Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan should develop a sovereign approach to Bitcoin. Binance has already worked with the Ukrainian government on several projects, including providing education on cryptocurrency and implementing exchange regulations. Nations embrace Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset Ukraine is not alone. Other countries worldwide are beginning to see Bitcoin as a strategic resource. In March 2025, the United States took the lead by establishing its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . The reserve is supported by digital assets forfeited by law enforcement. This proves that the government is racing to embrace Bitcoin even as a tool for national security and economic independence. All over Europe, Switzerland has been weighing such measures. The Brazilian Central Bank has also indicated that it is interested in researching digital reserves. The Central African Republic joined the fray of Bitcoin, which became a legal tender after El Salvador paved the way a few years back. Experts say that as additional countries embrace Bitcoin, it could become an important part of global finance. It might be able to hold national wealth, underwrite international trade, or even stand in for parts of conventional foreign reserves. The Ukrainian plan may be the first in Europe, but it likely will not be the last. A new dynamic is now in play as potential ceasefire talks with Russia gain ground. A peaceful resolution could unleash economic recovery and optimism. That could, in turn, drive up confidence among investors and lift the prices of cryptocurrencies — making Ukraine’s proposed Bitcoin Reserve even more strategically valuable.

This early-stage opportunity has now crossed $8 million raised , sparking renewed interest among strategic XRP and Cardano (ADA) investors. What’s driving the move? Both ADA and XRP are still considered credible assets, yet their current trajectories have plateaued. In contrast, MAGACOINFINANCE is showing real traction through a combination of community growth, structured release phases, and strong attention from analysts looking for the next 35x performer . For seasoned holders, the appeal lies in clear mechanics—not hype. FINAL CALL — ACT NOW & SECURE YOUR SPOT! May Market Rundown: XRP and Cardano Stay Range-Bound Cardano (ADA) trades between $0.70–$0.72 , holding up on ETF speculation and protocol upgrades like LAOS, but struggling to break key resistance at $0.81 . Meanwhile, XRP hovers near $2.22 , facing short-term stagnation as ETF headlines cool and liquidity remains light. Although long-term forecasts remain optimistic, shorter-term catalysts are limited. That has prompted ADA and XRP holders to diversify toward faster-moving, high-potential projects— MAGACOINFINANCE chief among them. 50% Bonus Now Active — and ROI Forecasts Are Rising This isn’t just momentum—it’s a calculated entry. Analysts estimate over 3,000% return potential from the current entry to its $0.007 target listing price. On top of that: A 50% token bonus is live for a limited time Supply is capped at 100 billion tokens , with nearly half reserved for pre-sale Token allocation and pricing shift hourly as demand surges Unlike delayed development plays, MAGACOINFINANCE moves with structure, making it a standout amid market noise. Forecast: 25x–35x ROI by Year-End for Early Buyers Analyst models suggest MAGACOINFINANCE could realistically deliver between 25x and 35x ROI as listings approach. Supporting this are: A global marketing engine in rollout Partnerships with verified agencies and influencers Discussions underway for centralized exchange listings This framework reinforces why long-time holders of XRP and ADA are making early reallocations into this fast-moving altcoin. PRESALE SELLING OUT — TAP TO SECURE YOUR SPOT NOW! Analysts View MAGACOINFINANCE as a 2025 Power Entry While ADA and XRP remain anchored to market cycles, MAGACOINFINANCE is charting an independent growth path. With over 20,000 investors already participating and visibility increasing across media platforms, the project is positioning itself as one of 2025’s most strategic early entries . With the 50% bonus still live, but dwindling fast, now may be the final early window to get involved.

So that makes it very hard for us to make a return for our liquidity providers,” Tapeiro said while speaking in a panel discussion at the Consensus conference in Toronto on May 14. “So a lot of those deals we just pass almost automatically, even businesses that we really like, we won't invest in if the price isn't reasonable in the beginning.” 10T Holdings has passed on over 200 companies for similar reasons, including the now-bankrupt FTX, BlockFi and Celsius, Tapeiro said. Tapeiro said 10T Holdings looks for crypto projects that have valuations above the $400 million to $500 million range with a valuation-to-revenue ratio of 10x or less. Host of Crypto In America Eleanor Terrett (left) moderating a discussion with Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead (middle) and Dan Tapeiro (right) at the Consensus conference. Source: Cointelegraph VCs often prefer lower valuations because they offer more upside potential with less risk. Realistic valuations often make follow-on funding rounds more attractive to investors while also simplifying the exit process. “Valuation is very important,” Tapeiro said. Despite Tapeiro’s comments, it appears that crypto startups have had no problem attracting VC funds , as PitchBook reported on May 13 that the total value of crypto venture capital deals rose over 100% quarter-on-quarter to $6 billion in Q1 2025, while the number of deals only increased by 8.8%. VCs should diversify their bags Also speaking alongside Tapeiro was Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead, who said more VCs should opt to receive a mix of private equity and tokens when investing in crypto startups. “Each one has their pros and cons, and then they go in these wild pendulum swings where sometimes tokens are really expensive and ventures cheap. Sometimes it's the opposite.” Related: Crypto VC deals drop in Q1, but funding more than doubles: PitchBook “So as an investor, I always advocate people investing in a wide spectrum of tokens and ventures.” Morehead’s Pantera has taken a more aggressive approach than 10T Holdings over the years and seen considerable success, making a return on 86% of the startups it invested in, with 22 of those reaching unicorn status (companies reaching $1 billion valuations).

Crypto and stock trading platform eToro has seen its share price gain nearly 30% during its debut on the Nasdaq after the company made a last-minute boost to its initial public offering. Shares in eToro Group Ltd (ETOR) closed May 14 trading at $67, up 28.9% from its initial offering price of $52, according to Yahoo Finance. It brings the company’s market value to over $5.5 billion. Its stock price shot to a high of $74.26 during the trading day before cooling and has also slightly dipped by 0.7% after the bell to $66.53. EToro shares shot up and then traded sideways on the company’s debut US offering. Source: Yahoo Finance The day before, on May 13, eToro boosted its IPO to $620 million after pricing its shares above its previously suggested range of between $46 to $50 each. Initially, the firm aimed to raise $500 million by offering 10 million shares, but the company and its backers sold over 11.92 million shares at its IPO, split evenly between eToro and some existing shareholders. Some BlackRock-managed funds and accounts had signalled interest in buying up to $100 million worth of shares at IPO, eToro said in a May 5 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In a note to Cointelegraph, eToro Australia managing director Robert Francis said the company’s IPO is “a clear sign that retail investing is not a fad, but a long-term trend.” Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), a rival to eToro that went public in 2021, saw its share price sink 1.9% to $61.39, with its losses extending by 1.63% after-hours to $60.39, Yahoo Finance shows . In its regulatory filing, eToro reported its total 2024 crypto revenue, from sources such as trading fees and withdrawals, was $12.1 billion, up from $3.4 billion in 2023. It also expected crypto to account for 37% of its commission from trading activity in the first quarter of 2025, down from 43% in Q1 2024. The offering was led by Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, UBS Investment Bank and Citigroup. IPOs rebound after tariff turmoil EToro’s public debut marks a rebound for public offerings in the US after many firms put their plans on hold as US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs tanked global markets. EToro made confidential filings with the SEC in January for a public offering and publicly announced the plans on March 24, but delayed its IPO after Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” tariff plans, which put a stop to many in-the-works public offerings. Related: 8 major crypto firms announce US expansion this year The stock and crypto trading house was founded in 2007 and previously bid to go public in 2021 via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company at a valuation of $10 billion. It canned that plan a year later , in 2022, after stock and crypto markets took a massive hit due to the COVID-19 pandemic and sticky inflation that caused central banks to quickly hike interest rates. Crypto exchange Kraken is considering going public this year, as is stablecoin issuer Circle, which filed with the SEC on April 1 but paused its plan a day later due to Trump’s tariffs. Crypto fund manager Bitwise predicted in December that, alongside Kraken and Circle, crypto exchange Figure, crypto bank Anchorage Digital and blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis would also go public this year.

Backed by the successful rollout of the Pectra upgrade, which improved staking performance and enhanced user experience, Ethereum continues to show its dominance in the Layer 1 space. But while ETH regains strength, investors are already diversifying into early-stage projects with significantly more upside. One project gaining traction is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a DeFi protocol currently in presale that many believe could rise to $5 in the months following its launch, offering far more growth potential than major altcoins at this stage. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum’s surge to $2.5K is undeniably a bullish signal for the broader market. Institutional inflows are returning, and its Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism are also seeing increased activity. These networks reduce congestion and gas fees while helping Ethereum scale, boosting confidence in the ecosystem overall. Although ETH provides long-term stability, many investors recognize that the biggest gains often come from early-stage tokens — those with low entry prices, real utility, and solid fundamentals. Mutuum Finance fits that mold exactly. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized system that facilitates the lending and borrowing of digital assets through open-access smart contracts. It’s designed to give users full control of their holdings while unlocking yield or liquidity, depending on their strategy. Here’s where it gets interesting: instead of rewarding users through inflation or unsustainable emissions, Mutuum redistributes value in a smart, closed-loop system. A share of the platform’s revenue is allocated to buying MUTM tokens from the open market, which are then distributed to mtToken holders — tokens that represent their deposited assets. This structure ensures that actual usage drives demand. As borrowing activity grows, so does pressure to acquire and distribute MUTM — a dynamic many DeFi protocols fail to establish. Let’s say an investor holds $20,000 in ETH and believes it will continue to rise. Rather than selling and missing potential gains, they could deposit it into Mutuum to borrow $12,000 in stablecoins. Those funds could be used for real-world expenses, new investments, or even buying more MUTM — all without liquidating the original ETH. As long as the value of their collateral stays above the liquidation threshold, the position remains open, and they keep full exposure to the underlying asset. This concept is already gaining popularity across the DeFi sector, and Mutuum is building it into a user-friendly, scalable platform. One of Mutuum’s most important features is its Layer 2 compatibility. By building on networks like Arbitrum, the platform ensures that users can interact with smart contracts quickly and cost-effectively. Lower fees mean more participation, and higher volume leads to more platform-generated revenue — which, again, feeds back into the MUTM token. This gives the token utility beyond speculation. It becomes part of a functional ecosystem that benefits from every interaction — borrow, repay, deposit, withdraw — all feeding into token demand. The current presale price of MUTM is just $0.025. Based on its revenue model, projected usage, and early-stage positioning, analysts see a realistic path to $5 in the post-launch period. That represents a 19,900% gain — a level of upside that few established assets can offer. With over $8 million already raised and thousands of participants onboard, the token is gaining attention not just for its price, but for its structure. A beta version of the platform is expected to roll out at launch, giving users immediate access to borrowing and lending features — something most presale tokens delay for months. Ethereum’s return to $2.5K shows that the market is waking up — but investors looking for the next breakout opportunity are setting their sights elsewhere. Mutuum Finance delivers a streamlined, scalable platform supported by actual revenue — designed to incentivize user activity and generate genuine demand for its token. The opportunity to get MUTM at the $0.025 price level is quickly running out. As listings approach and platform activity begins, the price will no longer reflect early-stage access. For those asking what’s the best crypto to invest in before the next full bull run, MUTM is shaping up to be a top contender.

Exchange reserves dropped to 19.1 million ETH, suggesting rising demand and a brewing supply squeeze. Ethereum [ETH] recently regained the $2,700 level, a price it last traded at on the 24th of February. This followed a notable 5.63% rally in the past 24 hours. AMBCrypto found that this move into the $2,700 range runs counter to the bets of traditional investors, who were selling. This divergence has created room for a potentially stronger rally. Traditional investors backing out might be a good sign for ETH According to LookOnChain , spot ETH ETFs saw net outflows of $10.83 million over the past 24 hours. This means traditional investors offloaded more ETH than they bought, likely securing profits after recent gains. Source: LookOnChain However, the altcoin has continued trending higher, likely supported by institutional purchases made during this same period. One notable institutional investor contributing to the bullish momentum is Abraxas Capital. This group purchased 33,482 ETH worth $84.7 million within the past 24 hours. In fact, over the past week, Abraxas accumulated 211,030 ETH, valued at $477.6 million. Moves like this often instill confidence and help sustain rallies. If the Netflow of Spot ETH ETFs turns positive, it would reinforce the current upward movement driven by large institutional investors, potentially pushing ETH above $3,000. More confluences are emerging According to CryptoQuant, spot traders currently maintain a neutral position in the market. This indicates a level of balance, even as prices continue to rise. Spot retail activity remains in the grey zone, albeit trending slightly upward, with a 0.17% gain. Source: CryptoQuant If this trend continues, spot traders may not drive the next ETH upswing. With that in mind, AMBCrypto examined other market signals. However, Exchange Reserve data told a different story. ETH held on exchanges dropped to 19.1 million, confirming reduced sell pressure. This suggests strong demand, with traders accumulating ETH from exchanges and causing a gradual supply squeeze. Source: CryptoQuant At the same time, the Fund Market Premium, which reflects institutional flows like Grayscale’s, remained mildly negative at -0.3. This indicates room for further growth, particularly if these institutional players step back in. Overall, c urrent market dynamics indicate Ethereum could rally further if institutional, traditional, and spot traders re-engage.

Bitcoin’s recovery from lows near $74,000 just last month demonstrates its unmatched ability to deliver substantial returns for those who seize opportunities early. But as Bitcoin flirts with its all-time high of $109,000, a question arises for savvy investors—is it too late to ride this wave? While Bitcoin continues to prove its dominance, a new contender, Ruvi, has entered the scene with game-changing potential. Could Ruvi deliver the life-changing gains that early Bitcoin adopters experienced? Here’s why getting in on Ruvi’s presale could be your golden ticket. Bitcoin’s sky-high performance and Ruvi’s window of opportunity Bitcoin’s spectacular recovery, fueled by improved trade relations between the US and global partners, has reinforced its status as the king of cryptocurrencies. Its current price surge has sparked fresh enthusiasm among investors, but for many, the question remains whether Bitcoin’s volatility could limit further upside. This is where Ruvi enters the picture. While Bitcoin has set the benchmark for crypto success, Ruvi offers a unique edge, combining blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI) to tackle real-world inefficiencies. The multi-functional Ruvi ecosystem, powered by its native token ($RUVI), is poised to revolutionize sectors from logistics to healthcare. Unlike Bitcoin, which many treat as a store of value, Ruvi delivers both functionality and scalable solutions for pressing industry challenges, making it a visionary choice for forward-thinking investors. Best of all, Ruvi’s presale offers early adopters ground-floor entry at $0.01 per token, paired with substantial bonuses that could amplify holdings. Investment scenarios with Ruvi Ruvi’s presale features tiered bonuses designed to reward early participants. To demonstrate its potential, here are three investment scenarios at varying levels: Entry-level investment ($800) With an $800 investment, you would acquire 80,000 Ruvi tokens at the presale price of $0.01. Thanks to Ruvi’s 20% bonus, you’d receive an additional 16,000 tokens, for a total of 96,000 tokens. If Ruvi’s price reaches $2, your investment could grow to an impressive $192,000. Mid-level investment ($1,500) Investing $1,500 secures 150,000 tokens, and the 60% bonus further boosts your holdings with an additional 90,000 tokens. This totals 240,000 tokens, which could yield $480,000 if Ruvi attains $2 per token. That’s over 300x your initial investment. High-level investment ($7,000) For high-stakes investors, a $7,000 investment would acquire 700,000 tokens, doubled to 1.4 million tokens with Ruvi’s 100% bonus. Should Ruvi hit $3, your investment could soar to an astounding $4.2 million. These presale opportunities not only offer significant returns but also enable early investors to gain a stake in a project that parallels Bitcoin’s early trajectory. Why Ruvi could be the next big thing Ruvi is more than just a cryptocurrency; it’s a platform designed to pave the way for decentralized AI integration. With a limited token supply of 5 billion, Ruvi leverages deflationary tokenomics, aiming to create long-term value for its holders. Its combination of blockchain transparency and AI-driven solutions positions it to tackle inefficiencies in complex systems, from predicting supply chain disruptions to improving patient care in healthcare. Bitcoin’s current rally has shown the market’s appetite for innovative blockchain projects. Ruvi capitalizes on this momentum, targeting high-growth areas like automation and analytics while offering an unbeatable value proposition for early investors. Act now before the presale ends Bitcoin’s past performance shows the life-changing potential of getting in early. Ruvi offers a rare opportunity to invest at inception with a presale price poised for exponential growth. Don’t be someone who looks back and wishes they’d taken the chance when it presented itself. With Bitcoin dominating headlines, Ruvi offers an untapped opportunity to those ready to move fast and think strategically.

Earlier stages sold out faster than projected, and the current phase is already drawing inflows from both retail buyers and crypto analysts who view MAGACOINFINANCE as a central figure in Q2’s bullish altcoin narrative . Why Analysts Are Watching This Stage Closely Each new pricing tier in MAGACOINFINANCE ’s pre-sale represents more than a price hike—it introduces a carefully engineered shift in token distribution and buyer incentives. As prices rise and bonus supply narrows, analysts say the model is successfully creating urgency without relying on hype. This latest stage follows strong momentum: Over $8 million raised 20,000+ holders confirmed A visible surge in traffic across Telegram, Twitter/X, and YouTube coverage Unlike many meme coins that spike and fade, MAGACOINFINANCE has maintained a steady pace, drawing attention for its structure, staying power, and ability to convert narrative into traction. Forecasting a 25x–35x ROI as Pre-Listing Sentiment Grows What’s pushing investor interest even further are the projected returns. With the final listing price set at $0.007 , analysts see MAGACOINFINANCE still offering 25x to 35x upside , depending on entry point and launch conditions. Some forecasts stretch even higher, citing 5,000%+ ROI potential if broader market strength continues and key partnerships are confirmed. The difference with MAGACOINFINANCE is that these projections are rooted not in vaporware promises, but in sharp market design, cultural relevance, and growing demand. Where others lean on influencer-driven FOMO, MAGACOINFINANCE is building a base through politically charged virality and scarcity mechanics—both of which have historically triggered breakout phases for meme-sector tokens. Conclusion: The Window Is Narrowing Fast This new stage isn’t just a milestone—it’s a turning point. Prices are climbing. Bonus opportunities are narrowing. And those tracking altcoin rotations know this is the moment that often defines ROI outcomes. With momentum behind it and visibility rising across every key community channel, MAGACOINFINANCE is fast becoming the breakout name of 2025. Analysts aren’t just watching it—they’re highlighting it as the frontrunner for Q2’s altcoin surge.

The token is currently trading at around $0.86. The sharp drop comes after a May 14 announcement from the Pi Core Team that left many supporters disappointed and angry. What Happened? On May 14, the Pi Core Team announced the launch of Pi Network Ventures—a $100 million investment program designed to support startups and businesses that will help bring real-world use to the Pi cryptocurrency. The fund, held in both Pi and U.S. dollars, aims to back innovative projects across various industries to grow the Pi ecosystem. Users can learn more about the program directly from the home screen of the Pi Network app. The team described the move as a “pivotal step forward” meant to speed up the creation of useful apps and encourage adoption of Pi in everyday life. Why Are People Upset? Crypto analyst, Dr. Altcoin, criticized the announcement on social media, calling it “nothing short of a betrayal.” He said the update, which introduced a new project called Pi Network Ventures, ignored the hard work and loyalty of the community that helped build Pi over the last six years. “We waited, we believed, and we contributed,” Dr. Altcoin wrote. “Now we’re told that the real DApps (decentralized apps) the team promised still don’t exist—and that $100 million in value will be used to finally build them. That value came from the trust and efforts of the Pioneer community.” He also pointed out that most users, known as Pioneers, didn’t even earn 1,000 Pi tokens due to the team’s decision not to reward referral bonuses. “This is unfair and shows how the community’s work has been undervalued,” he said. With over 70 million users across more than 200 countries, Pi Network grew into a global movement—driven not by investors, but by its people. Now, many Pioneers feel left behind as the Core Team focuses on big ambitions and new projects. “The silence from the Core Team is deafening,” Dr. Altcoin added. “Pioneers aren’t just users—we’re the foundation of Pi Network.”",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MINING|TRADING|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-15 01:46:32

Wood also speculated that it was probable that benchmarks would chase innovation more quickly in the years to come. These remarks came after ARK analyst Frank Downing commented on ARK’s initial investment in Coinbase. Innovation-focused companies transformations equity markets and blockchain technology As for ARK’s original investment in Coinbase, Downing said that he had written a whitepaper with the exchange as far back as January 2017, well up to Series D at a $1.6 billion valuation. He praised Coinbase for its “effectiveness of new product development, the pace at which new products are coming to market, and how they cater to newly onboarded users,” He expressed. After that, Wood sounded similar notes, emphasizing that companies like Coinbase, which are in the vanguard of digital innovation, are pushing the envelope not just on traditional metrics but the benchmarks that investors use to track the market’s progress and activity. What this means for the future, Wood indicated that as innovation continues to speed up, benchmarks will need to change more readily, with the performance and values of their historical bundles adjusted more frequently. The comments were made following Coinbase’s announcement that it would be joining the S&P, which is a major step toward the crypto industry’s mainstream acceptance. In a previous 2023 ARK report, Wood projected that the S&P 500 would reach 6,400 in the next five years in a base case and 11,200 in a bull case, primarily due to the exponential growth of technology. Coinbase joins the S&P 500 index, a significant milestone in crypto world According to reports , Coinbase Global’s shares surged by almost 15% on May 13 after becoming the first player in digital assets to be included in the benchmark S&P 500 index. It will replace Discover Financial, a credit card issuer that Capital One acquires. The change will take effect before the start of trading on May 19. The action represents a significant turning point for an industry that was previously limited to the fringe of finance. Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau said this was a significant change for Coinbase and the industry. He added that it was also the model for other cryptocurrency companies hoping to go public and land a position in the S&P 500. Since President Donald Trump pledged to loosen regulations, cryptocurrency has quickly gained traction due to growing institutional interest. According to Oppenheimer analysts, who raised their price target to $293, they anticipated that Coinbase would benefit for some time from the inclusion of the S&P 500 as institutional investors took their time getting ready to buy the stock. Notably, the stock reached its highest level in almost three months during early trading, increasing the cryptocurrency exchange’s market value by over $8 billion. Since funds that track the benchmark index would have to include Coinbase in their portfolios, the inclusion might also increase demand for the company’s stock. Coinbase revealed a decline in first-quarter earnings last week. However, analysts have stated that a rebounding market might increase its momentum. To solidify its position as the biggest publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange globally, the company has been aggressively growing its institutional investor base and establishing a presence in markets outside the United States.

What’s really happening is a sneaky return to a tax scheme that favors the wealthy and leaves everyday Americans stuck holding the bill. The bill claims it’s about cutting taxes for families, seniors, and workers—echoing Trump’s 2017 promises. But don’t be fooled. The so-called “tax-free” tips and overtime pay for hospitality workers sound great, but there’s zero clarity on how the IRS will manage this without creating chaos for those it’s supposed to help. House Republicans have moved President Trump’s big tax reform plan closer to becoming law after a key committee approved the package. However, arguments over how much Americans can deduct in state and local taxes, also called SALT deduction , have created a serious divide in Congress that threatens to delay the next vote and may force changes before the plan can move forward. Republicans advance tax bill with Trump-era priorities House Republicans moved quickly on Wednesday morning to pass the new tax legislation through the House Ways and Means Committee after spending the entire night discussing the details. The House’s efforts show how determined they are to push forward President Donald Trump’s economic agenda that focuses on cutting taxes for families, seniors, and workers while continuing many policies from his time in office. The bill follows Trump’s promises in his 2024 campaigns, where he pledged to make the tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs ACT (TCJA) permanent and to reduce the tax burden for middle-income Americans. Tips and overtime pay in the proposal will be tax-free to help millions of hospitality, restaurant, and retail workers, but it doesn’t explain how the government would track and manage these earnings without confusing workers and the IRS. What’s more, the bill offers a $4,000 deduction for older Americans, but experts claim it might not help everyone equally. At first glance, the deduction for seniors looks like a win for retirees. However, a policy expert from the Tax Foundation, Garret Watson, explained that those whose main source of income is Social Security will see little or no benefit from this deduction, but retirees with pensions or investments may gain much more. Garret added that this $4,000 deduction would cost the federal government $90 billion over the next decade, far less than the $1 trillion it would cost to stop taxing Social Security benefits entirely. The bill also continues the $2,000 child tax credit created under the 2017 law and raises the amount to $2,500 per child through 2028, but critics argue that how the credit is designed still leaves many families out of the benefits. A senior tax policy expert from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Kris Cox, stated that around 17 million low-income children will miss out on the full benefits even if the credit amount increases because they don’t qualify for the full credit under current rules. SALT deduction fight delays House vote and risks Senate changes The State and local tax (SALT) deductions are causing disagreements among lawmakers representing high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California because middle-class families pay large amounts in property and income taxes and rely on this deduction to reduce their federal tax bills. 2017 saw people living in states with higher taxes pay more in total taxes even if their incomes weren’t very high because Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs ACT (TCJA) and lawmakers put a $10,000 cap on how much people could deduct for state and local taxes to help pay other tax cuts in the law. House Republicans want to help more middle-class earners in expensive states while limiting the benefit for wealthier taxpayers by raising the SALT cap to $30,000 for people earning less than $400,000 in modified adjusted gross income in the current tax bill. However, some moderate Republicans from high-tax states remain unsatisfied and are pushing for the cap to be raised higher or entirely removed, as they claim that $30,000 isn’t enough to represent their constituents’ tax burdens fairly. Senate Republicans and almost all Senate Democrats voiced concerns about how raising the SALT cap will mostly benefit higher-income households and reduce the tax code’s overall fairness, which made experts say the Senate could change the SALT provision even if the bill manages to pass in the House. Trump’s tax bill comeback is not the middle-class miracle it’s being sold as. It’s a half-baked plan filled with loopholes and giveaways to the rich while leaving millions of Americans behind.

Against that backdrop, independent analyst More Crypto Online (MCO) released a fresh video update outlining why the move is technically “very full but not necessarily overextended or overstretched.” In the clip, MCO reiterates that the advance from the 30 April swing low traces out “a five-wave pattern” and stresses that, because “there was no confirmed top, one more high was still likely especially as long as this micro-support area held.” The micro zone he referenced earlier in the week lay between $159.67 and $168.23, a range Solana tested briefly before powering higher. Solana Could Surge To $360 Zooming in, the channel’s Elliott-wave count now shows five clean waves even on what MCO calls “the nano level,” a configuration that, in classical wave theory, typically finishes either an impulsive first wave or the terminating leg of a diagonal. “If it’s a five-wave move, it can be a so-called A-wave,” the analyst explains, which would “result in a B-wave, ideally a higher low, and then a C-wave up.” The alternative—and MCO’s preferred scenario—treats the structure as wave 1 of a much larger impulse that could ultimately “easily get to $360 or higher.” Related Reading: Solana Network Activity Grows As 11M Wallets Now Hold 0.1 SOL Or More – Analyst For traders trying to calibrate risk in the near term, MCO isolates two numbers that matter most. On the upside he names $191.25 as “the next upside level to watch,” describing it as the 61.8 percent extension of waves 1 and 3—a textbook Fibonacci target for a fifth wave. On the downside he warns that “it takes a break below $172, which is the last swing low, to indicate that a price top has formed in wave 1.” In a follow-up post on X he put it even more succinctly: “5th wave to the upside is confirmed. $191.25 is the next upside level to watch … it takes a break below $172 … to indicate that a price top has formed.” Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone – $180 Level Could Define Next Move A clean, high-volume break of $191.25 would confirm that the immediate corrective risk has been deferred; a decisive daily close beneath $172 would instead signal that the first leg of the new advance has exhausted itself and that a retracement toward the upper-$160s or even the mid-$150s is underway. As ever, traders should remember that Elliott-wave projections are probabilistic rather than predictive. With volatility historically elevated in Solana, position sizing—alongside a clear plan for the two technical levels singled out in today’s analysis—remains the first line of defence. At press time, SOL traded at $180.

Longs now dominate with 68% positioning, but $0.53 could become a key resistance for short-term profit-takers. After struggling on its price charts, hitting a new all-time low, Official Melania Meme [MELANIA] has made a strong upswing. For the first time in two weeks, the memecoin has recorded gains for three consecutive days. In fact, as of this writing, MELANIA was trading at $0.47. This marked a 27.8% increase over the past 24 hours. Over the same period, its volume was up by 49.44%, reaching $124.19 million, while Open interest surged by 35.85%, hitting $49.10 million. The price pump over the past day signals growing demand and interest after the memecoin reached a bottom. Source: Coinalyze Buyers scoop up 402K tokens As such, buyers are back in the market as they entered to buy the dip. In fact, we can notice from the chart above, MELANIA buyers have scooped 402k tokens with a positive delta of 140k tokens. This suggests that buyers are dominating the market, with more buy orders. Sellers exited 261K tokens in profit, but for the first time in days, they were the smaller force. Source: TradingView This shift in market behavior is validated by recent bullish crossover on MELANIA token’s RSI. Looking at the memecoin’s RSI, it surged from 33 to 49.46 at press time. This uptick signals growing buying pressure with buyers starting to outpace sellers. A further move above 50 would confirm a full trend reversal. Thus, Stoch RSI has also made another bullish crossover, validating the previous move by the RSI. A move here indicates that MELANIA is seeing strong upward momentum with prices closing at highs. Is MELANIA set for a sustained uptrend? According to AMBCrypto’s analysis, MELANIA is experiencing strong bullish sentiment. This bullishness is evidenced by the fact that most traders are now taking long positions. The Long-Short Ratio showed that 68% of traders held long positions, while only 31% leaned short. This reflects a strong conviction in further gains. Accompanied by a high Trading Volume and buyers’ bias, it seems MELANIA memecoin is well-positioned for a strong jump on its price charts. Source: Coinalyze Therefore, if the current conditions hold and the uptrend continues, Melania will find the next significant resistance around $0.53. However, the recent gains mean a significant number of investors who have been underwater are now becoming profitable. If the cohort turns to profit realization, the uptrend could be short-lived, and Melania will retrace to $0.40.",Memecoins|News|News 1|Social|Trading View,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'AMB Crypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/ambcrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",ambcrypto,2025-05-15 02:00:55

Penned by representatives Gerald Connolly, Joseph Morelle, and Jamie Raskin, the May 14 letter asks Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent for all SARS filed since 2023 related to World Liberty Financial (WLF) and the Official Trump ( TRUMP ) token. Financial institutions in the US must file SARs with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau within the Department of the Treasury, when they detect suspicious activity, including potential money laundering or fraud. Source: Oversight Committee Democrats The sweeping probe asks for any SARs mentioning WinRed, America PAC, Elon Musk, political action committee, PAC, Trump, World Liberty Financial, WLF, TRUMP, MELANIA and Justin Sun, no later than May 30. The Democratic lawmakers say their probe is to “determine whether legislation is necessary to prevent violations of campaign finance, consumer protection, bribery, securities fraud, and other anti-corruption laws” and to guard against “financial misconduct connected to prospective or current federal officials.” Democrats argue WLF and Trump coin could be misused As part of the letter, the lawmakers argue WLF could be misused as a “vehicle for foreign influence peddling” because it served part of its token sale for foreign investors, who are “generally subject to less stringent regulation than US investors.” Justin Sun’s investment in WLF and the subsequent pause of the SEC’s lawsuit that alleged the crypto entrepreneur broke securities laws has also been flagged as a concern. Trump’s token has come under fire as well because the lawmakers argue in their letter that the identities of the coin purchasers are not publicly disclosed, which could open the door for bad actors to “curry favor with Trump” by purchasing the coin. At the same time, SARS related to Republican digital fundraising WinRed, Elon Musk’s super PAC, which poured $250 million into Trump’s election campaign, and two other PACs are being sought. Related: Trump-owned Truth Social denies it is launching a memecoin This effort is the latest Democrat-led salvo against Trump’s crypto ventures.

Among the notable players in this space, Qubetics stands out, driving excitement with its crypto presale and solid plans for real-world asset tokenization.

For those eager to maximize returns, Qubetics stands out as the best crypto for quick profit in 2025, offering an innovative blockchain solution with massive upside potential. Let’s dive into these coins to understand what makes each of them an essential player in today’s crypto space. Qubetics: A Revolution in Blockchain Finance Qubetics stands at the forefront of blockchain innovation, bringing solutions that bridge gaps in digital finance.

For those looking to get involved, $TICS tokens are available for purchase at $0.2532, with projections showing significant potential for growth. Analysts suggest that $TICS could see a 294% ROI at a price of $1 per token after the presale, and a whopping 1874% ROI at $5 per token after the mainnet launch. The Potential of Qubetics Qubetics is redefining digital finance by creating a non-custodial platform that enables individuals and businesses to take full control of their assets. As more users move toward decentralized finance, Qubetics is well-positioned to meet the growing demand for secure, multi-chain solutions.

The market eagerly anticipates the project’s mainnet launch, with analysts predicting a significant increase in token value post-launch. Render (RNDR) Up 1.54% as Trading Volume Falls Nearly 19% Render (RNDR) has seen a 1.54% price increase in the past 24 hours, bringing its value to $5.19, alongside a matching rise in market capitalization to $2.68 billion. Despite the price uptick, 24-hour trading volume dropped sharply by 18.74% to $103.6 million, reducing short-term market momentum.

The unlocked market cap is slightly lower at $1.86 billion, suggesting some variance in valuation metrics. However, 24-hour trading volume fell by 15.48% to $124.72 million, resulting in a volume-to-market cap ratio of 6.21%, a sign of moderate liquidity. Cosmos has a circulating and total supply of 390.93 million ATOM, with no maximum supply cap, leaving room for future inflation.

On the daily time frame, XRP has now closed two consecutive daily candles above a major resistance level at $2.46. This breakout is an encouraging sign as it confirms a clear bullish trend. For the first time in a while, the price structure is showing higher highs and higher lows, which is exactly what traders look for in a positive market trend. This latest breakout has officially ended the previous bearish phase and marked the start of a fresh, bullish run for XRP. Short-Term Slowdown Possible While the bigger picture looks strong, the short-term charts are flashing a small warning. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, a bearish divergence has appeared. This means that while the price is still climbing, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) is starting to dip. When this happens, it usually hints that the bullish rally might slow down temporarily. So, in the next couple of days, XRP’s price might either pull back slightly or move sideways. This isn’t necessarily bad news — a brief cooldown can actually be healthy for the market, helping indicators like the RSI reset and prepare for the next possible upward move. Important Price Levels Ahead If the price dips, the previous resistance level at $2.45 to $2.46 is expected to act as strong support. As for the upside, the next resistance points traders are watching are around $2.60, $2.77, $2.95, $3.15, and $3.30. For now, the overall trend for XRP remains positive, and nothing much has changed in the last 24 hours.

CEO Brian Armstrong has indicated that the company is actively exploring additional mergers and acquisitions to bolster its global presence and product offerings. In an interview on Bloomberg Television, Brian Armstrong said Coinbase is considering other mergers and acquisitions (M&A). He also emphasized that M&A was key to the company’s long-term strategy. The platform, which has over 35 million users, is among the most active dealmakers in crypto. Its purchase of Deribit earlier this month is its largest since it went public in 2021. The deal, which includes $700 million in cash and 11 million shares of Coinbase, cements the company’s position in the booming market for cryptocurrency derivatives. Coinbase drives global expansion with aggressive acquisition spree The purchase of Deribit will lead to strategic expansion into the global market. The cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, which relocated its platform to Dubai earlier this year, is the market leader in Bitcoin and Ether options, supposedly clearing over 90% of international crypto options trades. Its purchase also plants Coinbase firmly in the ranks of the international scene for crypto derivatives—a segment of the market that institutions are increasingly gravitating toward in favor of more structured financial products. Armstrong said the international deal is probably a sign of things to come in future acquisitions. Coinbase is particularly interested in businesses that “think similar” and have the potential to help them grow and innovate faster. While Coinbase has been linked to several potential acquisition targets, Armstrong declined to confirm specific plans. When asked whether Coinbase might pursue a deal with Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin and its current partner in a revenue-sharing agreement, Armstrong said there was no announcement to share. Circle, which filed for a public listing last month, has been the subject of acquisition rumors ever since it reportedly rejected a buyout offer from Ripple for being undervalued. Institutional demand supports new entry signals in the S&P 500 Coinbase isn’t only growing through acquisitions. The company will also make history next week as it enters the S&P 500 index — becoming the first crypto-native company to become a member of the prestigious index. Markets were already reacting to the announcement. Shares of Coinbase surged 24% after the S&P 500 announcement. Today, the stock is up nearly 4% for the year, recovering from the intense volatility of 2022 and 2023, when heightened regulatory pressures weighed heavily on the broader crypto market. The S&P 500 listing is a major milestone for Coinbase and the wider crypto industry. Analysts view it as a resounding endorsement of the legitimacy and maturity of digital assets in mainstream finance. The S&P 500 is a stock market index that tracks the performance of the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the United States, with a combined market capitalization of around $47 trillion. It provides a broad snapshot of the U.S. stock market and is commonly used as a benchmark to assess the overall health of the equity market. Coinbase’s latest moves reflect the ambitions of a rising force in digital banking, positioning itself at the forefront of a new era in finance. As U.S. crypto regulations begin to stabilize and institutional adoption gains momentum, the company is setting its sights on becoming a vital “bridge” between traditional financial systems and blockchain-based markets. The company’s achievements follow years of legal disputes between it and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with the agency ultimately dropping its lawsuit against the exchange in February. “Imagine battling the SEC for years, only to ascend to the S&P 500 just months later. There’s no worthier steward of this victory than Coinbase,” said Bitwise Head of Alpha Strategies Jeff Park in a Monday X post. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong highlighted that the milestone signifies “crypto is here to stay.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",News|Coinbase,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-15 02:40:58

The money laundering services were allegedly carried out on behalf of other criminal networks engaged in migrant smuggling and drug trafficking, Europol said in a May 14 statement. Spanish authorities said the criminal organization ran a secret informal money transfer system called hawala and was often compensated in crypto. A total of 17 individuals were arrested — 15 in Spain, one in Austria and one in Belgium — while 4.5 million euros ($5 million) worth of items were seized, including cash, crypto, 18 vehicles, four shotguns and several electronic devices. Of the 4.5 million euros, 183,000 euros ($205,000) came as crypto. Another 421,000 euros ($471,000) in cash was seized from 77 bank accounts tied to the criminal organization , which one Spanish news outlet described as a “mafia crypto bank.” Luxury bags, watches and even cigars worth 876,000 euros ($980,000) were also seized, Spanish officials said. Scenes of European law enforcement efforts and assets seized from the criminal organization.

Most of those arrested have already been detained Of the 17 arrested, 15 have already been imprisoned as alleged perpetrators of the crimes linked to the organization. Most of those arrested were of Chinese and Syrian nationality, targeting clients in China and the Arabic-speaking criminal world.

Big announcements teased could redefine Pi’s future — or deepen the decentralization debate. Just as the crypto crowd descends on Toronto for Consensus 2025, Pi Network [PI] has decided to steal a bit of the spotlight, shutting down its central node and open-sourcing its code in one bold move. Add to this an announcement wrapped in mystery, and we’ve got all the ingredients for a stunner. But is this a real step toward decentralization, or just a well-timed flex? Either way, the Pi community has reason to stay tuned – because the next chapter might just be the most telling yet. A central node no more Pi Network’s core team has officially shut down its central node. The announcement was paired with a network diagram that visually confirmed the node’s removal. Source: X The shift is in line with Pi’s mission to evolve into a decentralized blockchain, secured by its proprietary improved proof of stake (IPoS) mechanism. With the source code soon to be released, the Pi community awaits developments that bring in a new era of transparency. But while enthusiasts celebrate, critics remain unconvinced. The network’s referral-based mining model and notably opaque governance still raise eyebrows. Notably, the core team’s continued control over supernode selection — and its reported hold on 82.8 billion PI — have fueled ongoing concerns about the project’s decentralization claims. All eyes on Consensus The timing couldn’t be better. Just as the crypto world swarms to Consensus 2025, Pi Network is hyping the community up with a series of not-so-subtle teasers. First up: a major announcement slated for the 14th of May. Source: X Then? Promises of something “GREAT/GOOD” on the 15th, capped off by a speech from Pi co-founder Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis on the 16th. Source: X This is a three-day show that has the world talking — and the stakes have never been higher. The decentralization debate Even with the central node gone and open-source code on the horizon, Pi Network hasn’t fully shaken off the criticism. Its mainnet remains closed, coin transfers are still off-limits, and basic access features like “lightning” often require VPNs in some regions. For a project that champions decentralization, these roadblocks feel at odds with the message. The upcoming announcements may bring about a change, but until the network becomes truly open and borderless, nothing’s for certain.",Altcoin|News|News 1|Social|Trading View,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|MINING,"{'name': 'AMB Crypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/ambcrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",ambcrypto,2025-05-15 03:00:43

In a new essay titled Fatty Fatty Boom Boom , Arthur explained why he’s taking short positions even while holding onto his long-term conviction. He used obesity and the broken American economy as two sides of the same coin, blaming both on bloated systems that serve corporate profit over public health—or financial stability. According to Arthur’s essay, the US used to be lean. Not just physically, but economically. But now, he says both the country’s waistline and its balance sheet are out of control. He compared the rise of “fat-positive” narratives to the Federal Reserve’s addiction to money printing. The food industry, Arthur said, sold Americans processed garbage, and Big Pharma came along with drugs to treat the symptoms, not the cause. The economy, in his words, followed the same pattern: constant credit expansion without correction. Arthur Hayes says capital controls are coming Arthur said the US trade imbalance can’t be fixed with tariffs because voters won’t put up with higher prices or empty shelves. He pointed to Trump’s 90-day tariff rollback with China as proof that the hard route won’t work politically. Instead, the solution now favored by the White House is to tax foreign ownership of US financial assets. That’s where capital controls come in. Arthur laid it out simply: if foreigners want to buy American stocks, bonds, or real estate, they’ll have to pay for it. He gave a 2% yearly tax as an example. With $33 trillion in foreign portfolio assets held in the US, that tax could replace income taxes for most Americans. “Trump could eliminate income taxes for the vast majority of voters,” Arthur wrote, and that kind of math wins elections. Source: Arthur Hayes Arthur said capital controls are easier to enforce than tariffs and avoid the political fallout. If foreign money stays, it gets taxed. If it leaves, the dollar weakens, and American manufacturing comes back. Either way, voters win. “This is the Boiling Frog Theory,” Arthur wrote , predicting that the market won’t react violently because the change will be gradual. Arthur warns that financial markets will feel the pain Arthur said foreign investors won’t stick around forever. When they realize their returns are being taxed, they’ll start dumping stocks, bonds, and real estate. That puts pressure on the 10-year Treasury yield, which he called the first major battleground. If yields creep toward 5%, Washington will panic. That’s when, Arthur said, the government hits the “Brrr” button again. He listed steps that the Federal Reserve and Treasury would take: ending quantitative tightening, restarting bond buying, pushing short-term debt, and giving banks more flexibility through regulatory changes. Source: Arthur Hayes Chair Jerome Powell might sound tough in press conferences, but Arthur said he’s already playing ball behind the scenes. “Powell’s ass is sat firmly in the cuck chair,” Arthur wrote. Arthur also predicted that housing prices will jump again because mortgage rates will drop. With Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac back in play, the credit spigot will open wide. But none of this is a fix—it’s just a way to replace foreign capital with printed money. And that, Arthur says, will light a fire under Bitcoin. Arthur says Bitcoin is the only real escape Arthur argued that Asian countries like Taiwan and South Korea are already letting their currencies strengthen. That shows capital is heading home, and the global carry trade is unwinding. Private capital in Asia, which borrowed in local currency and invested in the US, is now flipping the trade. They’re selling US assets and converting back to their own currencies. That movement, Arthur said, will trigger more selling in long-term Treasuries, leading to more volatility and more printing. That’s why he thinks Bitcoin is the best place to be. It doesn’t need permission. Even in countries like China, where exchanges are banned, people still trade it peer-to-peer. “Lord Satoshi hath given unto the faithful, Bitcoin,” Arthur wrote. He said the US won’t kill Bitcoin because Trump’s team sees the old system as broken. If just 10% of the $33 trillion in foreign assets moves into Bitcoin, Arthur says the price will explode. “Just because I believe Bitcoin is going to $1 million,” he said, “doesn’t mean there won’t be opportunities to take tactical short positions.” Arthur ended by saying Trump has no fixed ideology—he responds to pressure. That means Bitcoin might rise, but it won’t be a straight line. “The trend is your friend, until it ain’t.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The firm began its BTC acquisition strategy in May 2024. Its most recent purchase was on May 12 when it bought 174 BTC. Its average acquisition price is $89,277 per BTC. The firm is the twelfth-largest public company BTC holder, just behind Germany’s Bitcoin Group SE, according to BiTBO. Semler CEO Doug Murphy-Chutorian said, “We are expecting growth and cash generation from FDA-cleared products and services, which will add to our Bitcoin treasury strategy.” However, its revenue figures were not as pretty, with $8.8 million in revenue reported, representing a 44% decrease year-over-year. Semler reported a net loss of $64.7 million or $6.74 per share compared to a $6.1 million profit in Q1, 2024. Company share prices (SMLR) were up marginally on the day but fell to $36 in after-hours trading. Semler stock has declined 32% since the beginning of 2025. The firm also reported reaching a $30 million settlement agreement with the US Department of Justice regarding a civil investigative demand. Businesses Bet Big on Bitcoin This week, Bitcoin investment firm River reported that businesses and corporations were acquiring BTC at a much faster pace than institutional funds and governments so far this year.

Bitcoin has surged back above $100,000, with ETH and SOL also posting strong gains. Yet beneath the surface of this rally, volatility risks remain. In this edition of HTX DeepThink, Chloe (@ ChloeTalk1 ) from HTX Research unpacks the macro catalysts, institutional activity, and market structure to assess whether this rally can truly last. Expectations for Rate Cuts Strengthened, Fed Liquidity Improves The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released on May 13, 2025, indicated a further moderation of inflation, reinforcing market expectations for potential Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year. Headline CPI rose 2.3% year-over-year (vs. 2.4% expected, 2.6% previous), marking the lowest level since March 2021; core CPI was 2.8% (in line with expectations, 3.0% previous). Goldman Sachs analysts noted that some U.S. companies had accelerated inventory accumulation prior to the early April implementation of tariffs, temporarily delaying the transmission of higher costs to consumers. Goods prices remained stable month-over-month, with core goods (excluding food and energy) showing a minimal increase of 0.1%, suggesting a limited immediate impact from tariffs. However, retailers have warned about the potential need for future price adjustments. It is also important to note that the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, core PCE, stood at 2.3% in March, still above the 2% target. Market support also stemmed from a phase of expanding macro liquidity. The Federal Reserve’s total assets rose slightly from $6.70 trillion on April 30 to $6.73 trillion in early May. FED Net Liquidity (balance sheet + TGA – RRP) increased from $4.89 trillion to $4.94 trillion over the same period, injecting about $50 billion of net liquidity. Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury General Account (TGA) balance rose to $583 billion, while the Reverse Repo Facility (RRP) balance dropped to a record low of $78 billion. This improvement in liquidity was mainly driven by the Federal Reserve slowing the pace of QT (reducing Treasury redemptions to $5 billion), the post-tax season Treasury cash inflows, and money market funds reallocating capital out of the RRP. A significant risk remains, however: should a debt ceiling agreement be reached in July or August, substantial Treasury issuance to replenish the TGA, coupled with an almost depleted RRP buffer, could lead to a tightening of system liquidity once again, potentially exerting downward pressure on risk assets. Institutional Inflows Power Crypto Rally Boosted by the improving macro backdrop, crypto market flows rebounded significantly. Bitcoin (BTC) futures open interest (OI) remained at elevated levels, with CME data showing about 660,000 BTC, representing 3.4% of circulating supply, highlighting strong institutional positioning. BTC OI on crypto-native exchanges also rose by 12%, with positions largely concentrated around the $100,000 level. Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) derivatives markets also saw a strong recovery, with ETH OI rising 15% since the first week of May and SOL rebounding 18% from late April lows. On-chain data showed ETH short-term holder (STH) profit addresses rising to approximately 90% and SOL to 88%, approaching historically high thresholds (>90% usually signals local top risk), raising concerns over near-term profit-taking pressures. Data from Deribit showed that the near-term implied volatility of Bitcoin options decreased from 65% prior to the CPI release to 58%, reflecting expectations of short-term price stability and encouraging some institutions to sell options to capture premium yields. The ETH options market displayed a longer-dated bullish structure, with strong demand for $4,000-$5,000 call options expiring in December, suggesting institutional investors are positioning early for the next potential rally. Macro Tailwinds Drive Bullish Bias, But Volatility Risks Linger In summary, the combination of macro liquidity expansion, cooling CPI strengthening rate-cut expectations, sustained institutional allocation, and a rebound in derivatives market risk appetite has driven the strong May rally in BTC, ETH, and SOL. However, in the short term, the high percentage of short-term holders in profit and the concentration of leveraged positions imply that any breakout or breakdown of key technical levels could trigger concentrated profit-taking and liquidation cascades, leading to heightened volatility. The overall market structure remains defined by a medium-term structural bull trend combined with a short-term consolidation phase. SEC Proposes Regulatory Sandbox for Tokenized Securities Following previous coverage of Trump Media Group’s launch of the DJT token, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce publicly disclosed that the agency’s digital assets working group is actively drafting a “tokenized securities exemption framework.” According to the draft, this mechanism would allow qualifying companies to issue, trade, and settle tokenized securities via distributed ledger technology (DLT) without undergoing the full traditional SEC registration process. To ensure compliance and investor protection, the exemption would still be subject to strict requirements: issuers must adhere to anti-fraud and anti-manipulation standards, disclose key information about smart contracts, platform operations, and potential conflicts of interest, undergo SEC supervision, and demonstrate adequate financial reserves. Custody providers would need to implement on-chain security frameworks and disclose custody arrangements. Initially, the program would impose limits on the types and volumes of tokenized securities allowed. If successful, the SEC may gradually expand the scope. If adopted, this framework would provide both legal legitimacy and regulatory innovation for utility tokens like DJT—especially those with political branding, real-world use cases, and high traffic ecosystems. *The above content is not an investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

This renewed activity is often a sign of growing confidence in the asset and can act as a catalyst for the next leg up in price. Bitcoin Witnesses Rise In Retail Participation According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by on-chain analyst Carmelo Aleman, retail investors – defined as wallets holding less than $10,000 worth of BTC – are steadily returning to the market. These participants are typically the most reactive to market movements. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Cycle Indicator Hints At Bullish Breakout Ahead, Analyst Says Aleman noted that while retail investors may not always time the market as effectively as institutional players, their behavior remains a key barometer of broader market sentiment. As more retail investors join, they tend to create a positive feedback loop, reinforcing bullish narratives and driving increased buying pressure, which can attract even more participants. The BTC: Retail Investor 30-Day Change indicator reflects this trend. Since turning positive on April 28, the indicator has shown a 3.4% increase in retail buying through May 13, signalling a strong resurgence in small-investor activity. Aleman added that if Bitcoin maintains its upward momentum, the broader crypto market could benefit, as retail investors may begin diversifying into other assets in search of higher returns. He wrote: This could benefit the entire crypto space, as small investors are likely to diversify into other projects, including DeFi, staking, futures, and other instruments. All signs point to this shift in retail behavior being the start of a new wave of mass adoption in the cryptocurrency market. Aleman also emphasized monitoring other on-chain indicators such as active addresses, unspent transaction output (UTXO) count, new addresses, and transfer volume, which often rise in tandem with growing retail activity. A Few Warning Signs For BTC While rising retail interest is encouraging, a few red flags suggest caution. Notably, the Exchange Stablecoins Ratio (USD) recently surged to 5.3 during Bitcoin’s rally to $104,000. This suggests that BTC reserves on exchanges now exceed stablecoin balances – a signal that selling pressure could be building. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashing Pre-Rally Signals Seen Before Major 2024 Breakouts, Analyst Says According to CryptoQuant contributor EgyHash, a reading above 5.0 is historically significant. A similar spike to 6.1 in January was followed by a sharp price correction, indicating that investors may be rotating from BTC back into cash. Despite some cautionary indicators, Bitcoin continues to exhibit bullish momentum. The Stochastic RSI is showing renewed strength, and other technical signals suggest the rally could continue.

In a recent Facebook post, Binance shared its logo with a cryptic caption, “This is what happens when devs touch art with 0 design sense.” At first glance, it seemed unrelated to Pi Network. But sharp-eyed users quickly noticed multiple Pi symbols subtly hidden within the logo design. The comment section exploded with excitement, with fans writing, “Let’s gooo Pi!” and “Pi Network listing when?” Is this for real? by u/StyleMindless2222 in PiNetwork This isn’t the first time Binance has teased Pi, but the signs are growing stronger. In addition to the post, there are unconfirmed reports that Binance has been testing Pi Network deposits and withdrawals using a known Stellar-based wallet associated with the exchange. Pi Network Launches $100M Venture Capital Fund While Binance hints stirred the community, Pi Network made a major move of its own. The project announced the launch of Pi Network Ventures, a $100 million fund aimed at investing in startups and developers building real-world applications using Pi. The goal? Drive utility and mass adoption of the Pi ecosystem. Pi Coin Price Prediction Pi Coin is currently down by more than 32% and is trading at $0.85. Pi recently surged by 90% and hit a monthly high of $1.40. However, the rally was short-lived. For Pi Coin to confirm the bullish trend, the bulls should push beyond the $1 mark. On May 15, 13 Million Pi tokens are set to unlock. This might also affect the rally and contribute to the downtrend. However, Pi is up by more than 13% in the last seven days.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-15 03:40:19
44638530,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=728322,1747280454,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44638530.jpeg,Japan’s carmakers are expecting $19 billion in losses from US tariffs,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/japans-carmakers-19-billion-loss-tariffs/,"Japan’s biggest carmakers expect to lose more than $19 billion after the tariffs that United States President Donald Trump placed on imported vehicles and parts sent shockwaves through the auto industry. The industry’s leading brands say the duties will squeeze financial performance this year and beyond. Some firms have even stopped giving guidance while they recalculate the cost of Washington’s changing policies and consider whether to shift future work away from North America. Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest carmaker, faces the steepest blow. The company told investors last week that its operating income will take a ¥180 billion ($1.2 billion) hit in April and May. Bloomberg Intelligence says the total damage in the fiscal year that ends next March could reach $10.7 billion, while Pelham Smithers analyst Julie Boote puts the range between $5.4 billion and $6.8 billion. Nissan Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co. each put the loss at about $3 billion. Subaru Corp., which brings roughly half of the cars it sells in the United States across the Pacific, withheld annual guidance after warning of a $2.5 billion dent. Mazda Motor Corp. also skipped a full-year outlook. Most vehicles that enter the United States have faced a 25 percent tariff since 3 April. Most parts crossed the same threshold on 3 May. Executive orders block the duties from doubling up, yet analysts say the levies will still add several thousand dollars to a new car bill. The United States is the single biggest market for Japan’s auto majors, many of which use factories in Mexico and Canada and then ship finished vehicles over the border. The new tariffs make that long-running model costly, even unworkable, and leave managers studying how to rebuild supply chains fast enough to avoid the charge. Automakers are putting their hopes on trade talks Negotiations between Tokyo and Washington are expected to speed up later this month, and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has pledged not to sign any deal that fails to tackle auto duties, a sector he calls vital to the nation’s economy. While they wait, companies are already changing course. Honda this week delayed by two years a C$15 billion ($11 billion) plan to set up an electric-vehicle supply chain in Canada, which would have included a plant able to turn out 240,000 cars a year. The firm has begun moving production of the hybrid Civic from Japan to the United States as well. Around 40 percent of the 1.4 million cars Honda sold in America in 2024 were imported, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. Subaru says all spending plans, including programs to develop electric vehicles , are now under review. Nissan has paused U.S. orders for sport-utility vehicles built in Mexico, and Mazda is ending shipments to Canada of one model made at the Alabama joint venture it runs with Toyota. Toyota for its part has kept production steady so far. Chief Executive Koji Sato told reporters last week that the group will look at raising U.S. output over the medium to long term rather than making sudden moves. The levy is especially hard on Nissan, which is already fighting its worst crisis in 25 years. Management has announced 20,000 job cuts and the closure of seven plants worldwide. Even with those deep cuts, the company still needs fresh cash after merger talks with Honda failed earlier this year. “Nissan’s plight could have been minimized if it had taken these steps sooner,” said Bloomberg Intelligence senior auto analyst Tatsuo Yoshida. “The impact of these measures, compared to what other carmakers are doing or even what Nissan has done in the past, is unclear.” Analysts warn that every month of uncertainty risks slowing new investment, eroding skilled jobs, and pushing research funds toward regions that still trade freely with few policy shocks or barriers.

He added that the firm has a large balance sheet that can be put to use. The firm revealed in its latest revenue report that its balance sheet has strengthened, ending the first quarter with $9.9 billion in US dollar resources. “Part of the benefit of being a public company is, you have a liquid currency to do that,” he said, adding: “We are looking at acquisition opportunities; doesn’t mean we swing at every pitch. We want it to be the right opportunity.” On May 8, the firm announced that it agreed to acquire crypto options trading platform Deribit in a transaction worth $2.9 billion that consisted of $700 million in cash and 11 million shares of Coinbase stock The acquisition, the largest in the crypto industry so far, will allow Coinbase to expand into the profitable crypto derivatives market and continue scaling the platform’s global growth. Armstrong told the outlet that he is looking particularly at international opportunities, “companies that think similar,” and can accelerate Coinbase’s product development and growth. Related: Coinbase’s Deribit buy shows growing derivatives market However, the crypto executive said he had nothing to announce when asked about a potential acquisition of stablecoin issuer and Coinbase partner, Circle, which has filed to go public . In late April, US fintech firm Ripple bid up to $5 billion in an effort to acquire the stablecoin issuer, but the offer was rejected, reported Bloomberg. Coinbase stock surges Coinbase will become the first crypto firm to join the coveted S&P 500 index on May 19. The S&P 500 is a stock market index that tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the US, and potentially opens up their stock to a broader investor base and exposure to passive funds that track the benchmark.

According to Europol’s statement on May 14 , the criminal network facilitated money laundering for organizations involved in migrant smuggling and drug trafficking. The group operated a shadow banking system using the informal hawala method, frequently settling transactions in cryptocurrency to obscure the origin of funds. Spain Leads January 2025 Arrests in Cross-Border Crypto Crime Bust Spanish law enforcement, leading the investigation, revealed that the arrests occurred in January 2025 across Spain, Austria, and Belgium. Fifteen suspects were apprehended in Spain, with one arrest each in Austria and Belgium. Most of the individuals arrested were of Chinese and Syrian descent, targeting criminal clients in both China and Arabic-speaking regions. Authorities seized a total of €4.5 million ($5 million) in assets, including €183,000 ($205,000) in crypto, €421,000 ($471,000) in cash from 77 bank accounts, and luxury goods valued at €876,000 ($980,000). Confiscated items also included 18 vehicles, four shotguns, designer handbags, watches, cigars, and various electronic devices. Fifteen of the 17 suspects have already been detained as alleged key figures in the organization.

The investigation was led by a court in Almería, Spain, with coordination from Belgian officials and support from Europol. Over 250 officers were involved in the operation. The crackdown underscores growing concern over the role of crypto in transnational crime. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis reported that illicit crypto transactions reached $51.3 billion in 2024, an 11.3% increase from the previous year. Crypto Hacks Surge in 2025 as Losses Top $1.74 Billion in Four Months Hackers stole over $92.4 million from crypto projects in April 2025 alone, according to blockchain security firm Immunefi . The figure represents a 27.3% year-over-year increase and more than double the losses reported in March. April’s attacks occurred across 15 incidents, with two major exploits accounting for the bulk of the damage. UPCX, an open-source platform, lost $70 million in a single attack, while decentralized exchange KiloEx was hit for $7.5 million. Other affected projects included Loopscale, ZKsync, Term Labs, and Bitcoin Mission, each experiencing losses exceeding $1 million. Cumulatively, the first four months of 2025 have already seen $1.74 billion in crypto losses—more than all of 2024, which totaled $1.49 billion. Immunefi previously noted that Q1 2025 was the worst quarter for hacks in crypto history, driven largely by massive breaches of centralized exchanges Phemex and Bybit.

Meanwhile, Tether is making strides of its own. A new integration with LINE NEXT and the Kaia blockchain places USDT deep into Asia’s Web3 system, allowing users to transact using stablecoins as easily as sending a message. While many projects gain traction, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands apart. Its Buyer Battles now move over 100 million BDAG coins daily, with large-scale buyers competing for remaining supply. BlockDAG has already secured $250 million, sold more than 20.4 billion coins, and attracted over 175,000 holders. Unlike others still planning growth, BlockDAG is already showing real-time demand. SUI Builds Momentum Ahead of May 17 Vietnam Showcase SUI’s positive trend is strengthening fast. The crypto is approaching a breakout above $4.20, backed by $11.7 million in recent weekly inflows. This pushes its year-to-date total to $84 million, topping both Solana and Ethereum. Technical indicators support the move. RSI has climbed near 72, and the MACD has turned bullish. SUI is reclaiming major Fibonacci levels, adding strength to the current trend. All eyes are now on the upcoming SUI event in Vietnam on May 17. With themes centered on DeFi, gaming, and AI, the event is expected to reinforce confidence in SUI’s market position and broader use. Tether Pushes Deeper into Asia Through LINE NEXT & Kaia Deal Tether is making a major play in Asia. Through a new partnership with Kaia blockchain and LINE NEXT, USDT is now embedded into the Web3 experience on LINE Messenger. Users can send and receive USDT, access in-app wallets, and interact with Mini Dapps. This move brings stablecoins into everyday mobile finance. With USDT powering new DeFi tools and payment solutions, the platform offers smoother cross-border transfers and boosts financial access. Backed by LINE’s huge user base across Asia, this step is likely to accelerate Tether adoption in the region. USDT’s role in Asia’s Web3 market is now stronger than ever. BlockDAG Buyer Battles Now Push 100M BDAG Coins Daily Crypto presales often feel unclear, with little proof of user demand. BlockDAG changes that. Its Buyer Battles system makes demand visible and competitive. Every day, 100 million BDAG coins are made available. If the full amount isn’t bought, the top buyer gets the rest. This model has created a daily race, and that race reflects strong demand. BlockDAG has now raised close to $250 million and sold more than 20.4 billion coins. Its user base has grown to 175,000+. The price rose from $0.001 in Batch 1 to $0.0262 in Batch 28, showing a 2,520% jump. Now, the price is frozen at $0.0020 until June 13 as part of its GO LIVE phase, while the confirmed future launch price is $0.05. Miner sales have crossed $7 million, and over 17,525 miners have been purchased. Forecasts project the coin could touch $1 soon, with long-term estimates going even higher. But the key detail is how BlockDAG is performing now. Its presale isn’t quiet or passive, it’s active, competitive, and high volume. Those watching from the sidelines may not get another shot. The market will soon set the price. What’s the Crypto with Most Potential Right Now? SUI’s strength is clear. With $11.7 million in weekly inflows and $84 million this year, it’s ahead of top altcoins. Tether is building its position in Asia, integrating USDT into everyday messaging apps and expanding its reach across Kaia blockchain. But BlockDAG is where activity turns into visible demand. With 100 million coins moved daily, close to $250 million raised, and over 20.4 billion coins sold, it’s already operating at post-launch volume levels. Prices have surged 2,520% from the start, and with a frozen price of $0.0020 until June 13, this might be the final window to join what many now see as the crypto with most potential.

On May 14, the Pi Foundation announced Pi Network Ventures, a $100 million fund to support startups that build real-world utility and drive adoption. As earlier reported by crypto.news, the initiative will function similarly to a typical venture capital firm in Silicon Valley. The fund will focus on startups in generative AI, gaming, FinTech, e-commerce, and social media platforms, in addition to blockchain-native companies. According to the Pi Foundation: “Pi Network Ventures plans to support not only blockchain-native startups, but also a wide array of businesses in generative AI, gaming platforms, FinTech, ecommerce, embedded payments, marketplaces, social networks, and other real-world applications.” Despite the scale of the announcement, the market’s reaction was muted, and in fact, negative. Pi Network ( PI ) slid from a daily high of $1.30 to a low of $0.8552 before settling near $0.92, a nearly 30% drop. You might also like: A 90-year-old theory suggests the Pi Network price may surge soon The sharp drop suggests that the news may have missed market expectations. Traders possibly anticipated a major exchange listing, which could have brought real liquidity and price discovery. Instead, with no listing announcement, some investors may have viewed the fund launch as underwhelming or already priced in, triggering a “sell the news” reaction. Technical indicators show a neutral to bullish bias. PI is trading above important moving averages, including the 50-day SMA and the 10-day EMA, which both indicate buy signals. While the relative strength index at 57.24 is neutral and indicates market indecision, the moving average convergence divergence points to a short-term bullish potential. Pi Network price analysis. Credit: crypto.news If PI holds above support at $0.85, there may be a brief recovery toward $1.10. On the other hand, PI might retest the $0.74 support area if it drops below $0.85. For now, the market appears to be digesting the announcement, with short-term traders rotating out, even as the project continues building.

The price is now correcting gains from $2.65 and might find bids near the $2.480 zone. XRP price started a fresh increase above the $2.550 zone. The price is now trading above $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2.550 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if it stays above the $2.480 support. XRP Price Corrects Some Gains XRP price remained supported above the $2.420 level and started a fresh upward wave, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to surpass the $2.50 and $2.550 levels. The bulls pushed the price above the $2.60 resistance zone. Finally, it tested the $2.650 zone. A high was formed at $2.650 before there was a pullback. The price dipped below $2.550 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.4220 swing low to the $2.650 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2.550 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.550 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.580 level. The next resistance is $2.60. A clear move above the $2.60 resistance might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.720 resistance or even $2.750 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.880. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.580 resistance zone, it could start another decline.

In a May 14 post on X, the analytics firm noted that LTH supply, which includes wallets holding Bitcoin ( BTC ) for at least 155 days, peaked at 14.29 million BTC after rising from 13.66 million BTC in mid-March. However, that figure has recently declined for the second time this month. Meanwhile, LTH spending, which tracks coins moving out of long-held wallets, has increased to 0.43, a level that historically tends to front-run local tops in price. #Bitcoin 's LTH supply rose from 13.66M $BTC in mid-March to 14.29M $BTC , but recently ticked down again for the second time in May. LTH spending has also picked up to 0.43.

WhaleWire analyst Jacob King argued that Bitcoin is forming a double top, a traditional pattern that has signaled the end of every significant bull cycle, in a May 15 post shared with his 520,000 followers on X. King claims that insider manipulation and Tether inflows are artificially maintaining the rally rather than it being driven by natural demand. He cautioned that the market is about to crash and is dangerously overvalued. Bitcoin’s recent surge is completing a double top — a pattern that has occurred at 100% of its major market cycle peaks.

Institutional players have been driving this rebound. On May 12 alone, Strategy added $1.34 billion worth of BTC, bringing its holdings to nearly 569,000 BTC. Japan’s Metaplanet also increased its stash by 1,241 BTC, now totaling to 6,796 BTC. Bitcoin spot ETFs, on the other hand, have attracted $1.94 billion in net inflows over the past month, according to SoSoValue data . Despite potential short-term retracements, particularly if retail investors begin to capitulate, the broader picture remains bullish. According to Santiment , institutions now hold around 68% of the total supply, with little sign of selling. The recent data suggests a potential short-term pullback if retail sentiment weakens. However, since institutions are still buying Bitcoin and ETFs are purchasing about 5,000 BTC every day, Bitcoin might soon find support , paving the way for more growth after profit-taking has subsided.

44640016,https://nulltx.com/?p=149627,1747283460,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Top DAO Projects by Social Engagement: What Drove These 10 to the Top in the Past Year,https://nulltx.com/top-dao-projects-by-social-engagement-what-drove-these-10-to-the-top-in-the-past-year/,"The past year saw a rapid evolution of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) into one of the most active and socially engaged sectors of Web3. They are seen as leading the way across various sectors, from DeFi to AI to infrastructure and even gaming. But if you had to narrow it down to the best of the best—these won’t necessarily be uncontroversial picks, and they’re certainly not exhaustive—here are ten DAOs that have emerged as powerhouses of not just governance and funding ecosystems but ecosystem engagement and even fun. Covering artificial intelligence calculations to decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity and gaming infrastructures, these DAOs not only rode with the market—but each one actively shaped its ecosystem, catalyzing not just adoption but also community conversation. AI, Infrastructure, and Developer-Led Growth At the top of the list is Bittensor’s TAO, decentralized AI, and community-led innovation true to AI parts. Natural Language Processing (NLP) models are gigabyte-sized, demanding not only storage space but also access to high-performance hardware for training and actualization. Thus, developers on TAO’s mission to build a better base layer for AI are up against formidable odds. Ranked right after that is Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) from DFINITY. ICP exhibited phenomenal momentum from developers, generating an average of 261 commits to its code each week, resulting in a 150% increase in developer involvement. The introduction of the subnet dashboard in May 2025 has brought improved transparency and functionality to the overall system. A notable point is that ICP has powered @piggycell to achieve its milestone of 3.5 million users specifically in South Korea. A truly staggering statistic is that 29.2 million ICP has been staked for 8 years through the Network Nervous System (NNS) DAO, a reflection of the team’s and the community’s deep long-term commitment. The ICE blockchain made quite a splash with its L1 network expansion! In July 2024, five new DeFi protocols joined the ICE network! The December launch of $20 million in staking rewards helped to drive adoption, too! But what really took the cake was how the ICE DAO funded ten community-led initiatives last year; this move really showed that the ICE ecosystem is ‘community-centric’ and a ‘participatory vibrant ecosystem.’ DeFi Dominance and Governance Innovation Uniswap kept leading the way for DeFi DAOs, showing that governance could lead to significant financial outcomes. In October 2024, Uniswap proposed activating a fee switch for its v3 pools, which could boost DAO revenue by $30 million annually. Then in February 2025, it pushed ahead with cross-chain swap capabilities, rolling them out across five new chains and extending its dominance well beyond Ethereum. Its blend of innovation, scalability, and governance kept the Uniswap DAO at the center of DeFi conversations. The origins of ApeCoin are in memes and pop culture, but it has made great strides in infrastructure over the past few years. In May 2025, the layer-3 blockchain known as ApeChain was born, grassroots-style, from an unusual $10 million public-funding effort called the Banana Bill. ApeChain has since become a reliable launchpad for a host of new developments in Web3 and the metaverse. What these nascent projects have in common is an investment in them by the ApeCoin DAO—a setup that makes sense for something funded by a pop-culture phenomenon. As of August 2024, Wormhole, a forerunner in interoperability, allowed ten new blockchains to use messaging across chains. By January 2025, it had completed more than $5 billion worth of volume; the same month, its global, decentralized, treasurer-less organization (DAO) distributed $15 million worth of grants to keep the protocols it helped develop highly engaged. Expanding Ecosystems and Governance Evolution Arbitrum fortified its dominance in the L2 market with the launch of Arbitrum Orbit in June 2024, which enables teams to deploy custom blockchains. As of March 2025, more than 50 dApps had joined Orbit, with a combined total value locked (TVL) of $2 billion. The Arbitrum DAO supported this growth with a $40 million incentive program, reinforcing its strategy of decentralized development. In September 2024, Curve Finance—a long-standing DeFi mainstay—launched stablecoin pools with extremely low fees of 0.1%. By February 2025, this had helped push its total value locked (TVL) to $3 billion, with a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) overseeing the protocol that gobbled up $25 million worth of CRV tokens to give to liquidity providers. Kadena spotlighted technology and sustainability when it upgraded its smart contract language to Pact 2.0 in July 2024. It then initiated partnerships with three DeFi protocols in November, while the DAO funded 15 eco-friendly mining projects—aligning the development of blockchain technology with green values and providing the community with a clear mission that extends beyond the profit motive. Ultimately, in August 2024, rebranded as Sky, the organization formerly known as MakerDAO launched a suite of dApps under the Sky Stars banner. In January 2025, we deployed $10 million in USDS rewards, and added five new sub-DAOs to the mix, under an engagement model reimagined as a governance model. This transition reengaged a whole new set of contributors under the hood, and helped position Sky as a next-generation DeFi protocol.

They may not be relevant to all communities, but the following DAOs have found ways to engage members in on-chain decision-making, and those communities now govern significant resources. The LAO is a venture fund run by its members, who decide which projects the fund should support, with most of that support being in the form of low-interest loans. The LAO’s mission is to support projects that benefit the world and its global communities in a decentralized way—all while serving as a use case for the Ethereum blockchain. The trailblazers of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are redefining how communities and capital interact. They offer a compelling blueprint for what sustained success and user-driven development can look like in the decentralized era. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

According to a May 14 official announcement , the goal is to make Ethereum ( ETH ) secure enough to support trillions of dollars in value held by individuals, companies, and even governments. Ethereum is already one of the most secure blockchains and powers thousands of decentralized apps. But the Foundation says this isn’t enough. To support the next wave of users and real-world adoption, Ethereum needs stronger protections across every part of its system, from wallets to smart contracts to the core protocol. The 1TS initiative will start by identifying weak spots across the Ethereum stack. This includes areas like user experience, smart contract bugs, wallet security, and threats to the consensus layer of the blockchain. The team will work on enhancements and support initiatives aimed at long-term security upgrades based on this review. You might also like: Linea woos Ethereum users with ‘free’ layer-2 bridging Fredrik Svantes and Josh Stark from the Ethereum Foundation will spearhead the initiative, with help from three renowned security specialists Zach Obront of Etherealize, Mehdi Zerouali of Sigma Prime, and Samczsun of SEAL. In addition, the 1TS program will fund bug bounties, official code checks, and improved developer tools. The goal is to make all users, from big organizations to private citizens, feel secure about storing value on Ethereum. The Foundation is asking the larger Ethereum community to participate and provide feedback on areas that require security enhancements. As more people and organizations rely on blockchain systems, Ethereum wants to make sure it can be trusted at the highest level. Aside from decentralized finance, the network already leads in market share for real-world assets, one of the fastest-growing and most promising sectors. As per RWA.xyz data , Ethereum currently holds $6.9 billion in tokenized real-world assets, accounting for over 58% of the total market. When including layer-2 networks like zkSync, that share rises to nearly 89%. The need for strong and reliable infrastructure is already becoming more urgent as more real-world assets move on-chain, hence the latest security initiative.

44640093,https://nulltx.com/?p=149626,1747283580,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Massive Token Unlocks Ahead: What Investors Should Know About Upcoming Supply Surges,https://nulltx.com/massive-token-unlocks-ahead-what-investors-should-know-about-upcoming-supply-surges/,"In the next year, a number of cryptocurrency projects will free up large quantities of tokens that were set aside for reserve and community purposes—creating what could be some major supply-side headwinds for the crypto market. Unfettered by their not-quite-circulating status, there are 8.5 million ETH that could now crisscross the market to affect price dynamics. They are 8.5 million ETH—which, if every last one of them were to be folded back into the market, might statistically amount to half of what retail investors are now holding—more than enough to upset the market for small-token floats. Internal token unlocks are not always associated with immediate price drops or token dumps. However, a “next-level” understanding of not just these unlocks, but also of their scale relative to the current circulating supply, can help us investors gauge the real risks. This is especially true in projects with some mix of: (1) aggressive emission schedules; (2) a near-term number of actual tokens that have a minimal market float. $CONX and $GUN: High Risk, High Supply Impact The next year sees the most spectacular unlocking for $CONX, with a stunning $507.3 million in tokens up for release—equivalent to a breathtaking 2,050% of its current circulating supply. While this supply should already be technically unlocked, it hasn’t yet entered the actual circulating market. The actual unlocking could cause major price disruption. If demand doesn’t keep pace, $CONX could experience some rough seas ahead. Holders and watchers of $CONX, prepare for volatility times two. Next in line is $GUN, with $65.75 million in tokens set to unlock, constituting 171.9% of its circulating supply. Here we have an extreme case of a low float token facing a high emission curve. With a fully diluted valuation (FDV) that is hard to fathom and a limited supply to work with, any upward move in GUN’s price could see an equally large down leg when one factors in that unlocked tokens serve as a makeshift treasury for the GUN project. Mid-Cap Pressure: $PARTI, $BMT, and $AI Mid-cap projects are also witnessing substantial unlock events that could remodel their supply dynamics. $PARTI is about to distribute $97.96 million worth of tokens, which is equivalent to 109.9% of its circulating supply. In effect, this means that more than double the currently tradable amount of $PARTI could be in circulation within a year. For investors, that’s pointing to potential dilution of our assets unless we see some equally aggressive growth in the ecosystem or demand that would absorb all those tokens. In the same way, the token with a smaller market cap, $BMT, faces an unlock of $27.95 million—equal to 102.8% of its circulating supply. Small-cap tokens are usually more vulnerable to unlocks because they have thin order books and very little liquidity. Even moderately heavy distribution can lead to an unlock that feels like a concentrated dump. And unless the project has a clear, staggered release mechanism, this is likely to happen, with the manner of the unlock ensuring that it feels like some sort of concentrated dump. Next is $AI, another project that’s gaining attention with the rise of AI in Web3. Yet, it has $25.07 million in reserves, and community tokens that are set to be unlocked constitute 99.4% of the current supply. While the AI sector is surging, $AI’s supply could very well outstrip its demand unless the token’s adoption and utility burgeon in kind. Long-Term Emissions: $WLD and $ELX Although it is not as extreme in relative terms, WLD leads in absolute value with 1.15 billion dollars worth of tokens that are scheduled to be unlocked, representing 88.6 percent of its circulating supply. The difference here is its slow emission model, which distributes the tokens in a consistent, monthly curve. Whereas sudden shocks to supply cause immediate price impacts (as seen with BICO), a long-term, consistent sell schedule can be just as harmful in terms of downward pressure but far less noticeable as it is happening. This is pricing in the impact of utility and demand over a much longer timeframe. Finally, $ELX will unveil tokens amounting to $17.98 million, which is 93.9% of its circulating supply. This number—in light of all the others—looks quite small. But relative to its market cap and supply, the impact could be notable. A few things to watch with this unlock and any potential future unlocks: 1. The distribution of the unlocked tokens compared to the pre-existing supply. 2. The presence of any secretive or overly vague vesting schedules. 3. The apparent motivation of the team for the unlocked tokens and in what context the tokens might be used. Biggest Internal TokenUnlocks Coming in the Next 12 Months Reserve & Community allocations are designed to grow ecosystems via contributors, marketing, and liquidity support But they also introduce significant supply pressure when released in bulk Here’s what’s coming pic.twitter.com/TVYmg8CaBL — Tokenomist (prev. TokenUnlocks) (@Tokenomist_ai) May 13, 2025 What This Means for Investors The upcoming unlocks highlight a critical aspect of tokenomics: large-scale emissions can create significant challenges for even the most highly regarded projects. Allocating tokens to reserves and communities is essential for the healthy growth of ecosystems. However, if those allocations are not made in a transparent and strategic manner, they can produce a pretty nasty side effect: suppressing the price of a token when the price is most vulnerable. Investors should examine not just the volume of the unlocks but also the manner in which the tokens are put to use—liquidity mining, for instance, grants, or incentives to the actual project teams—and whether real usage is happening in the project, if partnerships are being made, or if developer activity to speak of is occurring that could actually take up the new supply. The coming year will be a proving ground for the tokenomics across the board. Those who manage with clearly defined strategies and responsible unlock models may well survive whatever storm is brewing. Those who don’t could find their tokens subjected to a serious market haircut. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

It marked the very first time that protocols built on the Arbitrum network generated over a million dollars in revenue in a week. Specifically, the total revenue came in at $1.3 million. That’s a good number, representing a healthy and unprecedented 92 percent week-over-week increase. Leading that charge were perpetual decentralized exchanges, or Perp DEXs. The top three revenue-generating protocols on Arbitrum last week were all in the derivatives trading space. Meanwhile, a stablecoin issuer, called FDUSD, announced its expansion to Arbitrum, giving us a nice summary of the revenue picture on last week’s Arbitrum ecosystem. 1/ FDUSD Expands to @arbitrum Faster, low-cost stablecoin transactions Enhanced liquidity Greater access for users and institutions Bringing fast, cost-effective transactions to our global community. pic.twitter.com/zttTbRVdG5 — First Digital Labs (@FDLabsHQ) May 14, 2025 These developments underscore the commercial potential of Arbitrum’s DeFi environment and the ongoing advancement of blockchain-based financial services. Perp DEXs Lead Revenue Growth on Arbitrum The revenue increase was driven chiefly by the Perp DEX sector, where three leading platforms showed significant growth in weekly earnings. GMX, a long-standing protocol in decentralized perpetuals, led the way with $497,000 in revenue—more than twice what it earned the week before. This is an excellent example of the potential these up-and-coming DEXs have. In just one week, a sizable amount of crypto revenue was generated by GMX, a relatively small protocol compared to some of its DEX peers. The latest player in the space, Ostium Labs, pulled in $187,000 in revenue, indicating solid early adoption and the successful working of its protocol mechanics. In third place is Gains Network, which pushed its total revenue to $140,000 and pressed forward in its growth as a synthetic trading platform that offers a wide array of asset classes. Last week, @arbitrum protocols generated $1.3M in revenue (+92% WoW). The top 3 protocols by revenue generated are all Perp DEXs, with GMX leading by doubling its revenue WoW. @GMX_IO : $497k @OstiumLabs : $187k @GainsNetwork_io : $140k @pendle_fi : $73k … pic.twitter.com/mL9vZesdAH — Entropy Advisors (@EntropyAdvisors) May 13, 2025 Pendle Finance generated $73,000 in revenue, while Penpie generated $59,000, according to the protocols’ respective tokenomics. These profits came from largely uncharted territory, with Pendle and Penpie providing some of the kinds of financial instruments that users now expect from DeFi. Revenue growth overall demonstrates that Arbitrum is an increasingly core DeFi destination, thanks to its speed, efficiency, and the maturity of its dApp ecosystem. FDUSD Brings Stablecoin Liquidity to Arbitrum Along with revenue from its protocol, stablecoin issuer FDUSD upped its expansion to Arbitrum. The move marks its fifth blockchain deployment, following previous launches on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Sui, and Solana. FDUSD is about as low-key as a stablecoin can be, which is probably a good thing. Its addition to Arbitrum is not expected to disrupt anything, but rather it should fit into the network’s existing financial infrastructure. The integration will allow for even quicker and less expensive stablecoin transfers, while at the same time, it will better the liquidity for the traders, dApps, and DeFi protocols carrying out their business on Arbitrum. And for the enterprise and institutional participants that want efficient on-chain payment rails, now there’s another option for cross-chain activity that makes Arbitrum even more appealing as an enterprise-ready blockchain solution. The cross-chain expansion strategy of FDUSD is to generate a highly liquid, transparent, and accessible ecosystem of stablecoins that meets the needs of both retail and institutional users. Now that FDUSD is on Arbitrum, it is ideally situated to serve as a building block for stable, decentralized financial interactions. Arbitrum Solidifies Its Role in the DeFi Ecosystem Arbitrum is evidently transitioning from a promising upstart to a core factor in decentralized finance. Last year, the Ethereum Layer 2 enlargement pulled in more than $1 billion in revenues, and throughout 2023, it has emerged as a second-to-none sandbox for underpinning the DeFi space. OsStaking, run by Offchain Labs, allows users to stake ETH and makes it possible to use those staked assets for various not-too-linear DeFi applications, thus supporting high-volume perpetual DEX activity and toting the appearance of the second most liquid perp DEX in the ecosystem. Simultaneously, the FDUSD decision to join Arbitrum signals increasing confidence in the network’s infrastructure, security, and user base. Arbitrum will become a cross-chain bridge for access to all DeFi applications. With a transaction speed two to three times faster than Ethereum, Arbitrum is simply a more efficient platform for DeFi applications, which makes it an attractive destination for cross-chain stablecoin transactions. These advancements suggest that Arbitrum is achieving something greater than merely scaling Ethereum—it is becoming a destination. If you examine developer adoption, protocol revenues, or the sheer growth of infrastructure, it is hard to deny that Arbitrum has established itself as a vibrant, high-performance layer in the decentralized economy.

While we might think of energy as something that powers the different coins in the crypto world, what seems to be powering the broader crypto market lately are the altcoins. Their renewed strength seems to be coming from multiple sources, including investor optimism, the overall low-price levels of many altcoins compared to their previous highs, and a relatively low correlation with the current movement of Bitcoin. This could be the start of a new phase in the market cycle where altcoins gain more traction. That could be driven by positive regulatory signals, structural capital inflows, and the changing behavior of Bitcoin holders. Altcoins Rally Ahead of Regulatory Tailwinds Bitcoin has a 59% dominance rate, which is high in a historical context, especially when considering the consistent inflows that Bitcoin has experienced over the past year. But now, Bitcoin is being pressured downward, even as it has been making a series of higher highs and higher lows. The inflow of altcoin capital — combined with the speculative nature of this market and the anticipation of the next wave of breakout assets — has led to these outperforming Bitcoin in recent weeks.

However, due to the low price base of many altcoins, they have outperformed Bitcoin during the recent market rally. The future dynamics of… pic.twitter.com/12gKmtFg75 — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) May 13, 2025 One of the primary reasons for this transition is the changing regulatory atmosphere in the U.S. For most of 2024, we weren’t really sure what was going to happen with crypto legislation, and that kept altcoin enthusiasm in check. But now, in recent months, we’ve started to get some more positive signals — not just for Bitcoin, with multiple spot ETFs now up and running, for example, but also for the altcoin space. At present, ETF approvals related to leading altcoins are intense areas of focus for investors. They are also diligently pursuing the matters of ICO policy clarity and overall sector legalities. To approve an ETF is to effectively signal a green light for that entity and potentially many others to follow suit in terms of safely entering the crypto space. If the SEC were to signal that road sign, the actual pathway to the legally hazy space of altcoins beneath Bitcoin might quickly clear up and start attracting capital. Realized Cap Growth Confirms Capital Inflows Even though Bitcoin might be shedding some of its dominant market share, it persists in seeing very decent on-chain growth; it is just more lumbering than the on-chain growth seen in late 2024. In metric terms, we might look at Bitcoin’s Realized Cap. This is the total value of all coins based on the last-price movement and reflects a nearly $30 billion uptick since April. Running at about 3% per month, this growth is the result of fresh capital entering the Bitcoin network. I would state, however, that this is not happening with the level of intensity we saw in the on-chain accumulation that saw fresh capital enter right before the banking crisis in late March. After a period of stagnation in April, #Bitcoin 's Realized Cap has added nearly $30B, currently growing at ~3% monthly. While the uptick confirms renewed capital inflows, the pace still lags behind the aggressive accumulation seen in Nov–Dec '24. pic.twitter.com/kE6EbuevlC — glassnode (@glassnode) May 14, 2025 During the late 2024 months, there was a marked surge in capital as BTC moved toward its all-time highs. The pace now seems more measured and suggests that investor confidence remains, but is being tempered by broader macro concerns and a shift in focus toward undervalued altcoins. Also, a considerable sum of money was invested at the cycle peak of roughly $90,000 to $100,000. Data shows a group of coins bought at the top of the market is now safely stowed away in long-term investor wallets. These holders are betting the market will recover. In the meantime, the actual price of Bitcoin has not quite reached half of that realized price. Still, the gradual rise in this average purchase price signifies that these long-term Bitcoin holders are not making any moves to cash out. #Bitcoin 's LTH realized price has climbed to $45.34K -reflecting the aging of coins bought around $90K–$100K into long-term status. With the 155-day cut-off, buyers from Dec '24 are now LTHs, gradually lifting the cohort’s cost basis. pic.twitter.com/BZghQmnQLi — glassnode (@glassnode) May 14, 2025 ETF Activity Signals Mixed Sentiment Even though there are now confidence indicators for the long term, the market for spot Bitcoin ETFs took a significant dip last week. The total net outflow across all twelve U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs was $96.14 million on May 13, which is almost unheard of these days — a session with no net inflows. This pullback may be short-term profit-taking or risk management as investors ye reallocate capital elsewhere, including the altcoin space. It may also be that market participants are sitting on the sidelines, waiting for the next re-entry signal, whether that be a macroeconomic development or a regulatory push. On May 13, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net outflow of 96.14 million, with no net inflows across all twelve ETFs. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net inflow of 13.37 million, with no net outflows across all nine ETFs. https://t.co/YcNXWVZ8H6 — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 14, 2025 The ETF ecosystem is still a very vital part of Bitcoin’s institutional infrastructure and is expected to continue to take on a principal role in bringing new capital to Bitcoin and in Bitcoin’s long-term adoption. ETF flows, as a general matter, are supposed to not make any big headlines, and fluctuations in ETF flows during a week are rightfully viewed as very normal occurrences. Outlook: A Shifting Landscape The cryptocurrency market is once again experiencing its characteristic volatility. An ecosystem that has Bitcoin as its foundational asset shows signs of increased activity whenever this digital currency is not in a downtrend. But while it has been stable for a while, Bitcoin is in danger of losing its dominance. At the same time, Ethereum and several other coins that are seen to have solid technology are working their way into many investment portfolios. Caution is needed, yet a watchful eye is required. The three-way interaction of what is happening between Bitcoin dominance, ETF activity, and the regulatory situation could change things real fast—not over some long arc of history but in the coming months, say some folks, leading to the second half of 2025.

In a letter dated May 14, Representatives Gerald Connolly, Joseph Morelle, and Jamie Raskin asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to release all suspicious activity reports (SARs) filed since 2023 concerning several Trump-linked entities. These include World Liberty Financial (WLF) and the Official Trump token (TRUMP), both central to Trump’s recent foray into digital assets. Inside SARs: How FinCEN Tracks Financial Crime Suspicious activity reports are filed with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) when financial institutions detect potentially illicit activities, such as money laundering or fraud. The lawmakers also requested SARs mentioning WinRed, America PAC, Elon Musk, PACs in general, MELANIA, Justin Sun, and several other figures and organizations. They set a deadline of May 30 for the Treasury to respond. The goal, the lawmakers said, is to assess whether new legislation is needed to prevent potential violations of campaign finance, securities, bribery, and anti-corruption laws. “We must guard against financial misconduct connected to current or prospective federal officials,” the letter reads. A key concern is that World Liberty Financial may have enabled foreign influence. NEW TODAY: Oversight Dems, @HouseJudiciary , and @HouseAdm_Dems are demanding the Treasury Dept turn over Suspicious Activity Reports on these organizations to investigate election fraud & corruption. Democrats are fighting to protect the integrity of our govt and our elections. pic.twitter.com/H84miZjBbL — Oversight Committee Democrats (@OversightDems) May 14, 2025 The token sale reportedly included offerings to international investors, which Democrats argue are subject to looser regulatory oversight than their U.S. counterparts. Additionally, the involvement of crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun—who invested in WLF and recently saw the SEC pause its lawsuit against him—has raised further red flags. The Trump coin is also under scrutiny. Lawmakers pointed out that the identities of buyers are not publicly disclosed, creating a potential avenue for undisclosed influence or favoritism toward the former president through token purchases. This is the latest in a series of Democratic efforts to scrutinize Trump’s ties to the crypto sector. Earlier this month, senators called on the Department of Justice and Treasury to investigate links between Trump and Binance. On May 6, House Democrats introduced two bills and opened a subcommittee investigation into whether Trump could personally profit from these digital ventures while campaigning for reelection. Senate Democrats Target Trump Family in New Bill Banning Crypto Issuance by Officials Last week, Senate Democrats introduced new legislation aimed at curbing financial gains by federal official, including former President Donald Trump and his family, through cryptocurrency ventures. The move comes amid growing scrutiny over Trump-linked digital asset projects, including a meme coin that has drawn significant public attention. The proposed legislation, titled the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act, was unveiled on May 6 by Senator Chris Murphy. The bill seeks to bar the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior executive officials, as well as their spouses and children, from issuing, sponsoring, or promoting digital assets, including securities, commodities, and futures.

This sharp rally is backed by strong on-chain accumulation signals, shrinking exchange balances, and an influx of investor confidence that has found its way — in no small part — into Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In less than a week, $ETH 's worth has moved from $2000 to $2500. With -971.89m in Netflows, investors seem to be withdrawing their ETH from exchanges with the intention to hold it long term. Are you holding #Ethereum ? Data: @SentoraHQ pic.twitter.com/Mdgoochuw7 — champagne mami (@EkponoAkwaowo) May 13, 2025 When institutional and retail sentiment enhances, Ethereum looks to be moving into a fresh accumulation phase. There are a few key reasons this seems to be happening: 1. Supply is tightening. 2. Sell-side pressure has lessened significantly. These are two major factors that could lead to an extended rally for Ethereum. The institutional side of the market is still not fully in. When it does actually come in, this rally could lead to price levels we haven’t seen in a while. Exchange Outflows Signal Accumulation Ethereum’s recent rise is backed by a considerable withdrawal of ETH from centralized exchanges. In just the last week, around $1.2 billion worth of ETH has vacated those trading floors, resulting in a net outflow of -971.89 million. This is not an isolated incident but rather part of a sustained move of funds out of exchanges and into the hands of the private wallet holders. More and more, it seems, a substantial number of ETH holders are opting to keep their assets well away from any centralized services. $1.2 billion worth of ETH has been withdrawn from centralized exchanges in the past 7 days. This sustained trend of net outflows, intensifying since early May, signals continued accumulation and reduced sell-side pressure. pic.twitter.com/fMYJmPOnB0 — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 14, 2025 Since early May, this behavior has sped up and now stands as one of the most vigorous exchange outflow trends for Ethereum that we have seen in several months. While some outflows caused by traders on the move or by large overhauls of custody solutions (that, for security reasons, necessitate changing the way assets are stored) can undermine the Ethereum price, we believe that these latest outflows—caused by a combination of node operators and deFi users—are more likely to result in price appreciation. The present change in ETH’s exchange dynamics reflects the same pattern as seen during the previous bull cycles. In those cycles, the reserves of ETH on exchanges had been declining. This decline in exchange reserves, in both cases, acted as the supply shortage indicator that was leading us to the path of the price increase. Spot Ethereum ETFs See Consistent Inflows Besides the on-chain accumulation trend, Ethereum has also received a boost from growing institutional interest. On May 13, Ethereum-focused spot ETFs registered a total net inflow of $13.37 million across all nine active funds—with not a single fund reporting net outflows. This situation marks an apparent contrast to what was happening in the Bitcoin ETF market on the same day when it was reporting net outflows. On May 13, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net outflow of 96.14 million, with no net inflows across all twelve ETFs. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net inflow of 13.37 million, with no net outflows across all nine ETFs. https://t.co/YcNXWVZ8H6 — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 14, 2025 The consistent inflows into ETH ETFs reflect a strong investor demand for vehicles of regulated nature that can deliver exposure to Ethereum. These Ethereum ETF investors might not be viewing the asset as mere speculation but rather as an integral enabler of DeFi and something the investment community can build on. A lack of outflows strengthens the notion that these ETF investors are in for the long haul, which means less sell-side liquidity in the spot market. It also suggests that there is a very much increasing adoption of Ethereum and a mainstream acknowledgement of its long-term value proposition (especially as it gets continuously upgraded with, e.g., proto-danksharding and Layer 2 scaling solutions). Long-Term Outlook Strengthens These factors converge in a way that gives a snapshot of some key drivers behind the change in picture for Ethereum. Price momentum is certainly one of them. A historic outflow of tokens from exchanges is another. And a third one involves a shift in the types of actors that are coming into the system. It seems that more and more institutional players are choosing to build on Ethereum, either by using it directly as part of their system or by purchasing a big hunk of ETH and holding it. For a society that largely prizes the outrageousness of living for today, this is all starting to feel a lot like a way of planning for an outrageous tomorrow. The recent surge in Ethereum’s price from $2,000 to nearly $2,500 (about 25% in less than a week) is not merely a reflection of market hype but is underpinned by fundamental shifts in investor behavior: 1. A strong reduction in liquid supply. 2. An accelerating in-depth conviction among existing holders. 3. An increase (mostly from U.S.-based investors) in ETH exposure via traditional investment vehicles. Continued consistency in ETF flows and on-chain data almost seem to guarantee Ethereum a path to higher resistance tests in the near future. Flows into Ethereum ETFs have been consistent during this recent rally, and the on-chain data continues to show accumulation. In a wider sense, Ethereum’s present path shows a reawakened trust in the crypto potential. Of course, it’s still regulatory clarity and the good ol’ macroeconomic backdrop that usually make or break a digital asset’s price. But looking at Ethereum, you can’t help but notice its fast strength gains, both in on-chain metrics and in traditional market embraces. While the market keeps absorbing these happenings, it is inevitable that all attention will be on Ethereum and its effort to maintain the recent breakout it has sustained. It may sound boring to some, but it is nonetheless thrilling for the space when Ethereum defies gravity. And this past week, following the price movements, you kind of realize it is what Ethereum does. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

It introduces a new economic model that lets developers from different blockchain ecosystems build and interact without needing to convert tokens.

Retailers’ transactions ranging between $10K to $100K have surged 130.20%. The past few days have been favorable for Chainlink [LINK] , as it has recorded a price surge of over 30% and a breakout of bullish price action. Following these developments, both whale and retail participation in the asset have skyrocketed, and it is currently on the verge of an upside rally. 2.54 million transfer from Bybit Recently, the blockchain-based transaction tracker Whale Alert reported two large transactions totaling 2.54 million LINK moving from Bybit to an unknown wallet in the past 24 hours. One transfer involved 1.25 million LINK ($20.5 million), while the second moved 1.289 million LINK ($21.1 million). It seems like this unknown wallet belongs to the same whale. Such transactions, given the current market sentiment, are often considered potential accumulation by whales or institutions. Meanwhile, this transfer was recorded following the breakout of a bullish inverted head and shoulders price action pattern. It’s not just whales in motion. On-chain data from IntoTheBlock showed a strong spike in transaction volume from retail and long-term holders. Transfers between $1K–$10K jumped 87.21%, while $10K–$100K transfers surged 130.20%. Source: IntoTheBlock When combining the participation of both whales and retailers, it appears that bulls are currently dominating the asset, and LINK seems to be preparing for a potential upside rally. Volume dips amid short-term caution At press time, LINK traded near $17.07, up 2.10% over the past day. Despite the bullish price action, its Trading Volume dropped by 15%, indicating reduced participation by crypto enthusiasts amid the ongoing correction. According to AMBCrypto’s technical analysis, LINK appears bullish and is on the verge of a massive upside rally. The daily chart reveals that the asset has recently broken out of a bullish inverted head and shoulders price action pattern and has successfully retested the breakout level. Source: TradingView Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if LINK holds above the $15.70 level, there is a strong possibility that the asset could soar by 35% and reach the $23.15 level in the coming days. On the other hand, this bullish outlook could fail if the LINK price falls below the $15.30 level. At press time, LINK’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) neared the overbought zone, as it stood at 65.

But over the past year, its performance hasn’t been great. As we move through 2025, many investors are wondering if Cardano’s current price is a chance to buy at a low price or if it’s still too risky. How is Cardano Performing Right Now? At the moment, Cardano’s ADA token is trading around $0.80. That’s about 72% lower than its all-time high of $3.10. In comparison, Bitcoin is close to its record high, and Ethereum is down about 50% from its peak. This means Cardano’s drop has been much steeper. Even with this big price drop, Cardano is still one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market value. Apart from stablecoins, only Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, BNB, Solana, and Dogecoin have bigger market caps. So despite its struggles, Cardano still gets plenty of attention in the crypto market. Why Do Some People Still Believe in Cardano? One reason Cardano has loyal supporters is because of how carefully it’s being built. While Ethereum has led the way in smart contracts and decentralized apps, Cardano has taken a slower, research-based approach. Smart contracts were launched on Cardano in 2021, and the network keeps improving through regular updates. Developers can build apps on Cardano using programming languages like Plutus (based on Haskell) and Marlowe (for financial contracts). There are already some decentralized apps and NFT collections running on Cardano, and the community continues to grow. So, Should You Invest in Cardano in 2025? Whether or not Cardano is a good investment this year depends on how much risk you’re willing to take and how long you plan to hold it. According to CoinCodex, the project is still active, with a clear plan for the future. If the team can deliver on its promises and attract more users, the price could recover. However, without faster adoption and a major increase in activity, Cardano might continue to fall behind other faster-growing projects. Right now, it’s a high-risk, high-reward investment — one that could pay off in the long run, but also comes with plenty of uncertainty. What Are the Price Predictions for Cardano? Looking ahead, predictions for Cardano’s price are mixed. Some analysts think ADA might go above $1 in the coming months. Others believe it could drop to around $0.55 by mid-2026. These big ups and downs are normal in crypto, but they also show how unpredictable it can get.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-15 05:08:09

It also aims to ensure organizations are comfortable storing over $1 trillion in a single contract or application on Ethereum . Surpassing World’s Legacy Systems The initiative has a three-part approach, which begins with security landscape mapping. This creates a comprehensive overview of security strengths and vulnerabilities across all layers of Ethereum’s technology stack. There are also targeted improvements, such as implementing high-priority fixes and investing in longer-term enhancement projects. Finally, better communication will make Ethereum’s security standards more understandable and comparable to other systems. 0. Announcing the Trillion Dollar Security (1TS) initiative: an ecosystem-wide effort to upgrade Ethereum’s security to help bring the world onchain. — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) May 14, 2025 The project’s co-chairs are Fredrik Svantes, protocol security lead, and Josh Stark from the Ethereum Foundation management team. Ecosystem stewards are samczsun, founder of Security Alliance (SEAL) and security advisor at Paradigm, Mehdi Zerouali, co-founder of Sigma Prime, and Zach Obront, co-founder of Etherealize. The initiative is seeking broad ecosystem participation through a feedback form and is open to in-depth discussions with stakeholders. This project represents Ethereum positioning itself not just as the most secure blockchain, but aspiring to become truly “civilization-scale” infrastructure with security that surpasses traditional financial systems. Ethereum already has billions of dollars worth of assets on-chain. It is the industry leader and standard for stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets. There is currently more than $22 billion in RWA tokenized on blockchains, and Ethereum has a commanding market share of 58%, according to rwa.xyz. ETH Price Outlook Spot Ether prices have seen a resurgence over the past few weeks following what has been a very bearish year so far. The asset reached its highest level for almost three months on Wednesday when it came just shy of $2,700. ETH has gained 43% over the past fortnight and was trading down slightly at just below $2,600 during the Thursday morning Asian session.

In a recent interview on the “Crypto Beat” podcast, MetaMask co-founder Dan Finlay hinted that a token could still happen, simply saying “Maybe,” with a knowing smile. While that’s far from confirmation, it’s a clear sign the idea hasn’t been scrapped. Decentralization Dream Still Alive The idea of launching a token isn’t new. Parent company Consensys has talked about promoting “progressive decentralization” across its platforms for years, and MetaMask has been central to that vision. As far back as 2021, talks about a MASK token and a developer DAO were underway. Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin even teased the idea publicly on X. Andrew, ConsenSys has thousands of tokens on our balance sheet. ConsenSys is vigorously controlled by its employees, which includes me. And we are driving towards decentralization of several of our projects. Wen $MASK ? Stay tuned. Wen objective journalism, ser? — Joseph Lubin (@ethereumJoseph) November 8, 2021 But the real goal is not just decentralization, but also ensuring the token wouldn’t be used for hype or exploited by airdrop farmers. If It Happens, You’ll Hear It from MetaMask Directly Finlay made it clear that if MetaMask does launch a token, users won’t have to rely on shady links or Telegram rumors. “It’ll be advertised directly in the wallet,” he said. “It won’t be an email, it won’t be a text message, we don’t even have your number.” He also warned that the ongoing speculation creates easy openings for scammers. What Next? With the regulatory climate shifting, Finlay suggested a more permissive U.S. administration could make token launches safer. Still, he acknowledged that gray areas remain. Despite the cautious optimism, Finlay reminded that securities laws still apply, regardless of who’s in charge at the SEC. With around 30 million monthly users in 2024 and about 500 team members, MetaMask remains the largest Ethereum wallet. Finlay admitted the team is focused on improving user experience as rivals like Rainbow and Rabby pick up steam.

Law enforcement has been increasingly successful at tracing stolen funds and crypto ransom payments, resulting in a “lot of arrests,” Levin said during the 2025 Consensus crypto conference, covered by Cointelegraph. “For whatever reason, there is a perception that’s out there that crypto is an asset that is untraceable, and that really lends itself to criminals acting in a certain way,” he said. “Apparently, the know that crypto is not untraceable hasn't been received by some of the organized crime groups that are actually perpetrating these attacks, and some of them are concentrated in, you know, France, but not exclusively.” Jonathan Levin (left) says criminals targeting the crypto industry should know that the funds are traceable and law enforcement can track them. Source: Cointelegraph There have been two serious crypto-related attacks in Paris so far this month. On May 13, three assailants attempted to kidnap the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat , the co-founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium. Earlier in the month, on May 3, Paris police freed the father of a crypto entrepreneur who was held for several days as part of a 7 million euro ($7.8 million) kidnapping plot. The attacks have prompted France’s interior minister to meet with crypto professionals and address rising security concerns. Last year, blockchain investigator ZachXBT sounded the alarm in October that he’d been receiving messages from multiple victims of crypto home invasion thefts in Western Europe at a much higher rate than other regions. “The message needs to get out there that these payments are traceable and that these units within the law enforcement agencies have actually been very successful at holding some of those people to account in those kidnapping cases,” Levin said. “And even if it’s not the people that are kidnapping those people, but actually going upstream to the organized crime groups that are orchestrating these,” he added. Online streamer Amouranth was the victim of a home invasion in March 2025 when several armed assailants held her at gunpoint and demanded the keys to her crypto wallet, four suspects were charged in connection with the incident and arrested by law enforcement. Crypto kidnapping “not such a profitable business” Levin says he hopes organized crime takes a message from crypto robbers being arrested, specifically, that it’s “not such a profitable business to be in,” and in some instances, the ransom payments might even be recoverable. “There is the ability to potentially recover some of those payments as well. I think that in general, the goal here is not necessarily the recovery of the money, but it’s holding those people to account,” he said. However, despite law enforcement having some success in tracking down criminals targeting the crypto industry , Levin says the spate of offline robberies is still a “bleak” situation, and the industry should be taking extra steps to stifle theft as well. “People need to be very careful about what information is shared about them online,” he said.

A University of Cambridge study released in September last year found these so-called “wrench attacks” are often underreported due to revictimization fears. Additional reporting by Vince Quill.

This situation shows that investors have started to use more leverage to counter the increased volatility appetite and downside risks. According to data shared by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, DOGE futures open interest increased by 63.9% in the last week, from $989 million to $1.62 billion. During the same period, the DOGE price gained about 40%, rising above the $0.23 level. Related News: Seasoned Analyst Evaluates ETH, XRP, DOGE and SOL - Where Are Critical Resistance and Supports? “This divergence shows that speculative positioning continues despite weakening price momentum. This situation should be monitored carefully,” Glassnode said in a statement on social media platform X. A similar trend is observed on the XRP front. Open interest in XRP futures increased by 41.6% in a week, from $2.42 billion to $3.42 billion. However, the increase in the XRP price was more limited compared to DOGE, rising from $2.14 to $2.6. Glassnode’s data also shows a remarkable movement in the Bitcoin spot market. Bitcoin’s 7-day moving average spot trading volume increased, reaching $5 billion as of yesterday. This increase represents a “net buying” demand that has only been seen a few times this year. Analysts say this shows that the psychological threshold of $100,000 is supported by real spot buying. *This is not investment advice.

XRP Sees Over 720 Million Tokens Moved as Bullish Momentum Builds Ripple’s XRP has witnessed a massive surge in on-chain transaction volume, with more than 720 million XRP tokens transferred across multiple accounts in just 24 hours, according to fresh data from CryptoQuant. This transfer spike, which translates to over $1.8 billion in value based on May 13 prices, signals a significant shift in sentiment across the crypto market as XRP positions itself as a leader in the ongoing bull run. The transfer activity is the latest in a series of bullish developments for XRP , which has broken through the psychologically $2 barrier and now appears to be solidifying its position above $2.5. That’s as the broader crypto market has recently roared back to life, and XRP is among the clear beneficiaries. Renewed institutional interest, favorable macroeconomic indicators, and rising retail confidence have helped fuel significant momentum across the digital asset space. XRP’s price action has been particularly notable given its historical volatility and protracted legal battles with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which have clouded its performance over the past few years. Now, with many regulatory headwinds fading and utility-driven narratives gaining steam, XRP appears to be capitalizing on the broader resurgence. The current volume of token transfers—among the highest recorded in months—suggests whales and large holders are reorganizing portfolios, potentially in preparation for further rallies. Resistance in Formation Although XRP’s upward climb has momentarily slowed, technical analysts point to the token forming a new resistance level above $2.5, marking a potential setup for an even stronger bullish continuation. Historically, such large-scale token movements have preceded major price breakouts, especially when the overall market sentiment remains positive. Daily chart for XRP/USDT (Source: TradingView ) This hypothesis is further bolstered by XRP’s ability to maintain its gains despite minor pullbacks in the overall crypto market. Analysts note that the market’s resilience to sell pressure near the $2.5 mark signals a strengthening support base, which may soon turn into the launchpad for the next leg up. A Sustainable Rally? While skeptics point to the minor daily decline as a sign of exhaustion, most technical and on-chain indicators continue to paint a bullish picture for XRP. With transfer volumes at a multi-month high and the price hovering resiliently above key support zones, XRP’s trajectory appears firmly pointed upward—provided broader market conditions remain supportive. Still, caution remains essential. Rapid price surges can lead to increased volatility, and traders are advised to watch for potential retracements or resistance rejections. However, as of now, XRP continues to signal strength both in terms of price and market structure. Whether the recent momentum will be enough to push XRP to the $3 mark—and beyond—remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: XRP is once again capturing the attention of both retail traders and institutional players, reigniting optimism that its long-awaited breakout may finally be materializing. Whale Goes Short on XRP and ETH With Millions in Leverage as Liquidations Surge and Market Speculation Grows Meanwhile, a cryptocurrency whale has opened highly leveraged short positions against XRP and Ethereum (ETH), two of the most-watched altcoins during the current bull run. According to data from blockchain analytics platform Onchain Lens, the trader deposited $4.4 million into decentralized derivatives platform HyperLiquid to initiate an 8x short position on XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Opening such large, leveraged short positions signals the whale’s conviction, or gamble, that both XRP and ETH are nearing local tops and are due for corrections. With 8x leverage on XRP, the $4.4 million deposit enables a $35.2 million short position. The ETH short is even more precarious, as the 20x leverage allows the trader to control a vastly larger notional value, with substantially less margin for error. These moves are significant not just due to their size but also because they were placed on a decentralized platform, where transparency and real-time visibility into large trader behavior can influence market sentiment more directly than on traditional centralized exchanges. According to insights from CryptoQuant, Tuesday saw a notable wave of selling activity on Binance for XRP. However, analysts observed that the selling pressure was being absorbed by buyers, suggesting resilience in the market and a potential setup for an upside breakout. Despite this strength, the short positions taken on HyperLiquid could serve as a warning sign that at least one major player believes a reversal, or at minimum, a strong pullback, is imminent. $8 Million in Liquidations Signal Rising Risk Adding fuel to the fire, data from CoinGlass shows that $8 million in XRP positions were liquidated in 24 hours, with $5.8 million of that coming from long positions. This suggests that some traders who were chasing the bullish momentum may have been caught off-guard by sudden pullbacks or volatility spikes. The whale’s bet against ETH is particularly striking given Ethereum’s performance this past week. As ETH soared 40%, many traders and analysts began revising their targets upward, anticipating continued bullish momentum. To short such a fast-moving asset at 20x leverage is a high-stakes gamble that could result in significant losses if the market moves even slightly against the position. Given ETH’s recent correlation with broader market sentiment, any rapid move downward could also have spillover effects on other altcoins, potentially validating the bearish outlook if the short proves successful. Battle of the Bulls and Bears The current scenario paints a picture of a market at war: on one side are the bulls, emboldened by strong price action, bullish on-chain metrics, and high open interest; on the other, are large players making aggressive bearish bets using decentralized tools, likely in anticipation of an overheated market correction. While short-term price action has shown strength, especially with XRP’s ability to hold above $2.50, the market is now walking a tightrope. Traders will be watching key support levels and liquidation zones closely as leveraged bets could trigger cascading liquidations in either direction. The whale's highly leveraged short positions have introduced an air of suspense to what was, until recently, a euphoric rally. With XRP and ETH sitting at multi-week highs and leveraged interest climbing, the market is poised for either a continuation of the bull run or a sharp correction that validates bearish bets. In the short term, XRP must hold above $2.50 and ETH must maintain support above its breakout zones to avoid giving strength to the short positions. However, if buyers continue absorbing sell pressure as they did earlier this week, the whale’s positions could be squeezed—leading to a potential short-covering rally that sends prices even higher.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|ZRX,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-15 05:30:00

This marks a 0.4% decrease over the last 24 hours and more than 20% over the past month. While the rally has reaffirmed bullish sentiment in broader markets, recent data points to a shift in the sources driving this momentum. A CryptoQuant analyst has observed a growing disparity between regional and global market behavior, especially regarding the price of Bitcoin across different exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Treasury Firms Are This Cycle’s Bubble, Experts Warn Upward Momentum as Global Investors Take the Lead CryptoQuant analyst Avocado Onchain recently analyzed a key metric known as the “Korea Premium,” which tracks the price difference between Bitcoin on Korean exchanges and international platforms. Despite Bitcoin’s rising market price, the Korea Premium has been on a consistent downward trend. This suggests the ongoing rally is largely being driven by institutional flows and investor sentiment in markets outside Korea, rather than from the historically active Korean retail segment. In previous cycles, particularly in 2017 and 2021, South Korean exchanges often traded BTC at a premium due to local demand surges, sometimes up to 20% higher than international prices. These periods were typically seen as signals of retail-driven euphoria. Avocado explains that this change in market dynamics reflects a new phase of capital distribution in the crypto space. With spot Bitcoin ETFs now operational in the US, and growing interest from corporations and even sovereign wealth entities, a larger share of trading activity is being driven by institutional strategies rather than retail speculation. This is reflected in the subdued Korea Premium, which failed to spike even as BTC crossed major resistance levels in recent months. Institutional Activity Redefines Bitcoin’s Market Drivers According to Avocado, even if a rebound occurs, any Korea Premium near 10%—once considered modest—should now be interpreted as elevated. The absence of excessive domestic premiums highlights that Asian retail is no longer setting the pace in Bitcoin markets. Instead, global institutional actors, armed with new vehicles like ETFs and custodial platforms, appear to be the primary drivers of demand. This shift is significant because it may signal more sustained and less volatile growth for Bitcoin, in contrast to previous boom-and-bust cycles fueled by retail enthusiasm. Related Reading: Buyers Take Control: Indicator That Predicted Previous Bitcoin Rallies Fires Again Avocado’s observations suggest a maturation of the crypto market. With retail sentiment lagging and institutional interest rising, Bitcoin’s price trajectory may now be more responsive to global macroeconomic events, policy shifts, and capital allocation trends from major asset managers. This evolving dynamic could also change how traders interpret volume spikes and volatility, especially as retail signals like the Korea Premium lose some of their predictive power.

The internet’s largest illicit marketplace, Haowang Guarantee, formerly Huione Guarantee , said it will shut down following Telegram’s ban of thousands of associated accounts on May 13. “Since all our NFTs, channels and groups were blocked by Telegram on May 13, 2025, Haowang Guarantee will cease operations from now on,” read the notice on the marketplace website. A report from Wired said that this involved banning thousands of accounts and usernames that served as the infrastructure for the crypto crime marketplace and its vendors. Telegram spokesperson Remi Vaughn told the outlet, “communities previously reported to us by WIRED or included in reports published by Elliptic have all been taken down,” before adding that “criminal activities like scamming or money laundering are forbidden by Telegram’s terms of service and are always removed whenever discovered.” Closure notice on Haowang Guarantee website. Source: Haowang Guarantee The Chinese language black marketplace facilitated an estimated $27 billion in illicit transactions, predominantly using the Tether stablecoin ( USDT ), according to blockchain security firm Elliptic. Elliptic researchers also found that the wider Huione Group of companies had facilitated over $98 billion in crypto transactions.

Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson said it was a “huge win” as the “largest darknet marketplace to have ever existed has been shut down.” “It’s a game-changer in terms of overall online criminal markets, and it's huge for victims of online fraud. This marketplace was a key enabler of the global scam epidemic, and I think this will put a real dent in the ability of online scammers to do what they do.” In early May, the platform was designated as a money laundering operation by the US Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). It was to be severed from the US banking system. Xinbi Guarantee growing However, another Telegram-based illicit marketplace called Xinbi Guarantee has been identified by Elliptic, which discovered thousands of crypto addresses used by the merchants on it. On May 13, the firm said that it has seen $8.4 billion in transactions so far, but that should be considered as “lower bounds of the true volume of transactions on the platform.” Xinbi was linked to a Colorado-based company that was incorporated in 2022 but listed as delinquent in January 2025. Black marketplaces such as these have unveiled a “China-based underground banking system,” based around stablecoins and crypto payments, which is being leveraged for money laundering on a “significant scale,” Elliptic stated.

This follows Brazil’s central bank’s suggestion of stricter regulation of stablecoin transfers as part of the new regulatory framework. Brazilian officials are considering issuing Panda Bonds Brazil’s financial approach would change significantly; the potential introduction of yuan-backed sovereign bonds reflects the country’s effort to diversify its financial partnerships and reduce reliance on traditional Western financial systems. Panda bonds are a specific type of bond or debt security company outside China’s mainland that sells on the country’s domestic bond market. Panda bonds also allow non-Chinese organizations to raise capital without being concerned about currency fluctuations. The issuer of these fixed-income investments promises to pay back the principal plus interest at a specific rate. According to sources familiar with the matter, Brazil’s potential issuance of Panda bonds remains under evaluation, with no final decision made. Government officials have indicated that while discussions are ongoing, the plan is still in the exploratory phase. In addition to the potential issuance of sovereign bonds, the Central Bank of Brazil is a major player in the national economy. In keeping with its tougher stance on cryptocurrency transactions within the country, the county’s Central Bank has also set stricter rules for stablecoin transfers that forbid sending stablecoins to wallets owned by non-Brazilian entities. Governments worldwide are creating new cryptocurrency regulations. The need to regulate crypto assets has long been discussed, but the urgency was raised after several bank failures connected to crypto asset operations. Local leaders in Brazil are following the global trend. There are now reports in the region that the Governor of the Central Bank of Brazil, Roberto Campos Neto, has announced he plans to push for more stringent Brazilian cryptocurrency regulations. The push comes as the country has experienced a boom in crypto activity: From January to August 2023, the county imported $7.4 billion in cryptocurrency, a 45% increase over the same period last year. Campos Neto also noted the growing prominence of stablecoins in the Brazilian market. He emphasized that unlike other cryptocurrencies primarily used for trading, stablecoins are increasingly being adopted for payments, signaling a shift in how digital assets are used in the country’s economy. The biggest bank in Brazil is thinking about launching its own stablecoins Last month, reliable sources revealed that Itaú Unibanco, the largest bank in Brazil in terms of assets, was thinking of launching its own stablecoin as regulatory discussions developed and US financial institutions began to join the market progressively. This move follows lawmakers’ rejection of a digital currency that the US Central Bank issued in favor of private tokens. It is worth noting that the changes in Brazilian regulations and how well American financial institutions implement stablecoins would influence the bank’s choice. To further illustrate, the choice may depend on how well US institutions implement stablecoins, according to Guto Antunes, Itaú’s head of digital assets. Antunes spoke at an industry event in São Paulo about the growing acceptance of blockchain-based settlement systems. Itaú did, however, voice concerns regarding stablecoins. According to reports, he said that they cannot “overlook” blockchain’s atomic transaction settlement capabilities. Stablecoins remain on the agenda. Since lawmakers in the US favored promoting private stablecoin alternatives over a digital currency the central bank issued to maintain the dollar’s dominance, there has been a recent surge in interest in stablecoins.

And now, it’s eyeing the country’s first sovereign bonds denominated in Chinese yuan, also known as Panda Bonds. This isn’t just another financial move, it’s Brazil quietly rewriting global money rules. Brazil Strengthening Ties With China By exploring yuan-denominated bonds, Brazil is signaling interest in deepening its economic ties with China, its biggest trading partner. These Panda Bonds would allow Brazil to borrow money in Chinese currency instead of U.S. dollars, the usual global choice. That’s a big move because it shows Brazil wants more flexibility and less reliance on the dollar, especially at a time when many countries are rethinking their dollar exposure. Though the bond plan is still under discussion and hasn’t been finalized, it reflects Brazil’s ambition to reshape its financial strategy. Meanwhile, some experts say this strategy could help diversify Brazil’s debt market and attract more investors from Asia. Tighter Rules for Stablecoin Transfers While looking outward with Panda Bonds, Brazil is tightening its grip on stablecoin transfers. As its central bank has proposed new rules that would limit stablecoin transfers to wallets outside Brazil. This is part of a wider crypto framework that aims to keep digital money safe and under better control. By preventing funds from moving easily to foreign-controlled wallets, the central bank wants to reduce risks like fraud, tax evasion, and untraceable money flows. It’s also a way to make sure that innovation in crypto doesn’t come at the cost of financial security. Brazil’s New Path: Innovation with Safety Brazil is clearly trying to play both offense and defense, pushing bold new ideas like the XRP ETF and Bitcoin reserves, while building stronger rules at home.

Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis said onstage at an event by Coinbase’s lobbying arm, Stand With Crypto, that she thinks it's a “fair target” to have the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, passed by May 26 — Memorial Day in the US. Joining her onstage was Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who hinted that the bill’s language was changed to scrap provisions that targeted Trump's various crypto projects, which include memecoins, a crypto platform, a stablecoin, and a crypto mining company that plans to go public, among others. “When this language comes out, people will see really good refinement, a lot of progress, on things like consumer protection, and bankruptcy protection, and ethics,” Gillibrand said. “Things beyond just ‘what’s the structure?’ and ‘what’s required for an issuer?’” Source: Brian Armstrong Senate Democrats pulled support for the bill on May 8 and stalled its momentum, airing concerns that it wouldn’t help address multiple crypto-tied deals that will personally enrich Trump. “A lot of what President Trump is engaged in is already illegal,” Gillibrand said. “I also think his issuance of a memecoin is illegal based on current law.” “It’s literally offering anyone who wants to curry favor with the administration to just send him money — that’s about as illegal as it gets.” “I’m not so worried about this bill having to deal with all President Trump’s ethics problems. What this bill is really intended to do is regulate the entire space of stablecoins,” she added. Gillibrand said the revised bill includes “some ethics requirements,” but it was “not an ethics bill.” “If we were dealing with all President Trump’s ethics problems, it would be a very long and detailed bill,” she added. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, also on stage, was hopeful the Senate would vote on the stablecoin bill “early next week.” Armstrong, whose company cozied up to Trump by donating $1 million to his inauguration fund, declined to comment when asked if the President’s memecoin could impact the passage of bipartisan crypto bills. “It’s not my place to really comment on President Trump’s activity,” he said. “What I do think is important is that this bill remains focused on stablecoins.” Crypto bills “absolutely critical” to pass before midterms The crypto industry is pushing for Congress to pass the GENIUS Act and a Republican-drafted crypto market structure bill before the midterm elections on Nov. 3, 2026, where all 435 House seats and a third of the 100 Senate seats are up for election. “We have a very narrow window to get legislation through between now and the midterms,” Marta Belcher, the president of the crypto lobby group the Blockchain Association, told Cointelegraph at the Consensus conference in Toronto. “I strongly suspect that window is going to close very quickly. I don't know if we're going to get another window like this to get legislation through,” she added. “It's absolutely critical that we get it through now, especially because there really is a real possibility that in the future we end up with an administration that is hostile to crypto.” The Association’s communications director, Chris Jonas, added that it’s critical the bills pass before Congress takes a recess for the month of August. Related: Crypto execs flock to DC to support Senate stablecoin bill “Once you get into the calendar year of the midterms, historically not a lot of legislation moves, so that's why it's so critical,” he explained. Trump should be on track to sign both crypto bills before the August break, according to Bo Hines, the executive director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets. Hines noted on stage at Consensus on May 13 that negotiations on both bills are still ongoing, but it was “the President's desire” to sign both “stablecoin legislation and market structure legislation before the August recess.""

Pioneers Speak Out appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Pi Network Core Team is facing heavy criticism from its own community after announcing Pi Network Ventures , a $100 million fund to build decentralized applications (DApps) on its platform. Rather than celebrating, many long-time Pioneers are calling the move a betrayal. Pioneers Feel Betrayed by Ventures Fund According to Pi analyst Dr Altcoin , over 94% of Pioneers never even earned 1,000 Pi due to uncredited referral and ambassador bonuses. Now, they’re being told that the very apps they were promised years ago will be built using funds generated from their time, effort, and belief. The disappointment runs deep. Since 2021, users have endured delays in KYC verification , repeated postponements of the Open Network, and vague justifications. One major condition for mainnet launch was 100 live DApps—yet most are still missing. Pioneers now question where previous ad revenue and hackathon results have gone. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network News: Did Binance Just Include the Pi Symbol in Its Logo? , Delays and Lack of Transparency Shake Trust The Core Team’s latest announcement briefly pushed Pi’s value higher. But once details dropped, the token fell sharply to $0.80, signaling market disappointment and shaken trust. More than 70 million users across 200 countries helped grow Pi Network into a global phenomenon, not because of funding, but because of belief in the project. Now, many feel sidelined. Dr Altcoin stated, “Pioneers are not just users—we are the reason Pi exists. This silence from the Core Team speaks volumes.” As frustration mounts, one thing is clear: without transparency and delivery, Pi risks losing the very foundation that made it possible—its community. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Amelie emphasized, “XRP is coming for the No. 1 spot,” reinforcing her belief in the asset’s long-term potential. WOW! ASSET MANAGER WISDOMTREE EMPHASIZES THAT #XRP WOULD NEED TO ACHIEVE A PRICE JUMP OF 14x TO $34.86 TO OVERTAKE BITCOIN! I BELIEVE THIS IS POSSIBLE! XRP IS COMING FOR THE NO. 1 SPOT pic.twitter.com/PmtNglaU9Y — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 13, 2025 The claim was accompanied by a data chart comparing Bitcoin and XRP, sourced from CoinGecko as of November 27, 2024. It showed Bitcoin’s circulating supply at 19.8 million and XRP’s at 57 billion. Bitcoin’s maximum and total supply were both listed as 21 million. Although XRP’s maximum supply stood at 100 billion, its total supply is less than 100 billion, due to over 13 million XRP being burned. WisdomTree’s Valuation Context WisdomTree’s estimate assumes a market capitalization parity scenario in which XRP would match Bitcoin’s current valuation. At the current circulating supply, reaching a price of $34.86 would represent a 14x increase from XRP’s recent levels. Such a rise would push XRP into the lead in total market value, assuming Bitcoin’s market cap remains static. Experts have projected for years that XRP will flip Bitcoin , and with the asset’s history, a 14x price surge is a possible feat. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reaction and Sentiment Reactions from the cryptocurrency community suggest that many see the forecast as ambitious but not entirely out of reach. One user noted that “$34.86 feels bold,” yet acknowledged that such moves are not unprecedented in crypto markets. Another wrote that predicting a 14x surge to flip Bitcoin is the kind of comment that draws attention, especially from those who may have previously overlooked XRP. The general tone across responses was supportive, with users expressing confidence that XRP has a realistic path to higher valuations. XRP is Coming for Bitcoin’s Spot XRP has outperformed expectations over the past few months. It briefly surpassed Ethereum’s Fully Diluted Value (FDV), and many experts believe it can beat ETH’s market cap and regain its spot as the second-largest cryptocurrency. While XRP will have to grow significantly to beat Bitcoin, proponents argue its utility and scalability offer long-term value propositions that justify such expectations. Experts have also shown that XRP can’t be limited by its market cap and expect it to reach as high as $100 , much higher than WisdomTree’s $34.86 target.

Known for its whimsical meme-driven branding, SHIB is currently trading at $0.000016 and has sparked speculation about whether it could reach the ambitious milestone of $0.001 . Recent price action shows a promising 2.8% weekly increase , touching highs of $0.00001730 before stabilizing. These movements reflect growing investor confidence and the potential for further breakout attempts. While Shiba Inu continues to intrigue the market, a new crypto project, Ruvi , is poised to take the industry by storm. Combining blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI) , Ruvi is redefining possibilities in the crypto space. But could this innovative project carve out an even more groundbreaking trajectory than SHIB? Let’s explore why Ruvi could be your next big investment opportunity. Shiba Inu’s Climb and Its Ambitious Future Shiba Inu started as a meme coin and has steadily evolved into a formidable contender in the crypto world. With its growing ecosystem encompassing decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and NFTs, SHIB now occupies a high-confluence zone on trading charts. Technical analysts highlight its upward move above the resistance level of $0.00001550 , sparking hopes for a possible rally toward $0.001 in the long term. Achieving such a milestone is not without challenges. The math is eye-opening. With a supply of 589 trillion tokens , reaching $0.001 would catapult SHIB’s market cap to a staggering $589 billion . While not impossible, this hinges on sustained global adoption and significant ecosystem enhancements. Why Ruvi Is the Future of Crypto Unlike Shiba Inu, Ruvi isn’t just a symbol of community enthusiasm. It combines AI-powered analytics with blockchain infrastructure, offering real-world solutions to industries like healthcare, logistics, and digital content. Imagine organizations relying on Ruvi for predictive analysis to optimize supply chains or automate complex workflows. This practical utility positions Ruvi not as a meme but as a game-changing platform. At Ruvi’s core is its $RUVI token , capped at just 5 billion , ensuring long-term scarcity and value growth. This sharply contrasts with Shiba Inu’s supply scale, making Ruvi an intriguing option for value-focused investors. And with its deflationary model , Ruvi establishes itself as a token offering not just short-term hype but sustainable financial growth. How to Invest in Ruvi for Maximum Returns Timing is key in cryptocurrency, and Ruvi is currently in its presale phase at the low cost of $0.01 per token . This is your chance to secure a position early, aided by an attractive bonus structure that rewards investors handsomely at different levels. Entry-Level Investment – $500 For $500 , you’ll receive 50,000 tokens . A 40% bonus adds 20,000 extra tokens , bringing your total to 70,000 tokens . Should Ruvi reach $2 per token , this modest investment transforms into a lucrative $140,000 . Mid-Level Investment – $1,500 A $1,500 investment nets you 150,000 Ruvi tokens . With a 60% bonus , you receive an additional 90,000 tokens , giving you 240,000 tokens total . If Ruvi hits $3 , this compounds into a remarkable $720,000 . High-Level Investment – $5,000 For seasoned investors, $5,000 secures 500,000 tokens , doubling to 1,000,000 tokens thanks to a 100% bonus . Should Ruvi’s price reach $4 , this amounts to a monumental $4 million return. Ruvi vs. Shiba Inu While Shiba Inu thrives on community-driven momentum, Ruvi builds its appeal on real-world utility and cutting-edge technology. Shiba Inu’s path to monopolizing the meme coin market relies heavily on speculative buying, whereas Ruvi’s AI-driven services ensure relevance across industries and economies. Ripple’s rise during its early days is a testament to what is possible with the right blend of timing, utility, and investor interest. Ruvi has all the ingredients to not just repeat but redefine this success story. Secure Your Ruvi Stake Before It’s Too Late While Shiba Inu’s upward momentum continues to spark dreams of exponential gains, Ruvi is emerging as a beacon of innovation that could surpass even the boldest crypto milestones. But remember, the chance to buy Ruvi at $0.01 won’t last forever. Seize this pivotal moment to secure your stake in blockchain’s next major disruptor. Lock in your $RUVI tokens during the presale and position yourself for a future of unparalleled growth. The time to act is now, before the window of opportunity slams shut. Don’t be late to the next big thing in crypto.

However, experts like Anndy Lian warned that past political promises have fallen short, and actual implementation will depend on various factors including market conditions and investor sentiment. Meanwhile, corporate interest in Bitcoin is rising globally, with Michael Saylor’s Strategy continuing to aggressively acquire BTC. While Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional equities remains inconsistent, its record-low volatility and increased institutional adoption suggest it is maturing into a more stable and globally recognized financial asset that is increasingly seen as a valuable portfolio diversifier. South Korea May Join Global Bitcoin ETF Wave South Korea may be on the brink of a major shift in its approach to digital assets, especially with leading presidential candidates expressing strong support for legalizing spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This potential policy change could align South Korea more closely with global trends and be a huge turning point for its crypto regulatory landscape. Currently, institutional investment in cryptocurrencies is still banned in the country, with 100% of trading volume coming from retail participants. This is according to Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant. In a May 6 statement reported by The Korean Economic Daily, Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung pledged to not only legalize spot crypto ETFs but also reduce transaction fees and create a safer investment environment. The goal, he said, is to help the younger generation accumulate assets and plan for the future. The Democratic Party made similar commitments during its 2024 campaign, but those promises have yet to materialize into tangible policy. Despite the enthusiasm from political leaders, regulatory experts advise caution. Anndy Lian, a blockchain adviser, explained that while the candidates' pro-crypto rhetoric is encouraging, historical precedent makes it difficult to predict actual progress. Lian pointed to past promises made by the People Power Party, which won the 2022 election on a similarly crypto-friendly platform but failed to implement any major reforms before the impeachment of President Yoon. Lian also pointed out that even if policy changes do actually occur, the success of any future Bitcoin ETFs will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions and investor sentiment. He believes that a pro-crypto president could help drive reform and potentially bring South Korea in line with jurisdictions like the US, where Bitcoin ETFs have attracted billions in net inflows. The Financial Services Commission’s recent tone also hinted at a more open stance toward crypto regulation, which could help support this shift. Still, the experience of Hong Kong, which launched its own batch of Bitcoin and Ethereum-based ETFs in April 2024 to lukewarm market reception , serves as a reminder that regulatory approval does not necessarily guarantee investor enthusiasm or success. Strategy Eyes Top Spot with Bitcoin Power Bitcoin is also the top priority in other countries. Michael Saylor’s Strategy, the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, could become the leading publicly traded company in the future, according to Strategy analyst Jeff Walton. Featured in the Financial Times documentary Michael Saylor’s $40 Billion Bitcoin Bet, Walton made the bold claim that Strategy will be “the number one publicly traded equity in the entire market,” largely due to its unmatched Bitcoin holdings and aggressive accumulation strategy. The company currently holds around 568,840 Bitcoin, with a value of approximately $59 billion. According to Walton, no other company holds as much “pristine collateral” as Strategy, and its Bitcoin position puts it in a league of its own. He also talked about the firm's remarkable fundraising capacity, and specifically referred to a $12 billion raise over just 50 days in late 2024. “It’s incredibly hard to raise $100 million of capital, and they just did that 120 times in 50 days,” he said. Strategy Bitcoin purchases (Source: SaylorTracker ) Saylor, the company's co-founder and Executive Chairman, doubled down on his bullish vision for both Bitcoin and Strategy. In the documentary, he predicted that Strategy could evolve from a $100 billion enterprise into a $10 trillion one. He also forecasted that Bitcoin could hit $1 million per coin in the next decade, and as much as $13 million by 2045. Strategy is currently ranked as the 151st largest company in the world with a $117 billion market cap, and will need to surpass Microsoft, which has a market cap of over $3.3 trillion, to achieve the top spot. While extremely bullish, Saylor acknowledged the risks and reiterated that Strategy’s capital structure is designed to withstand severe Bitcoin drawdowns, even scenarios where BTC drops 90% and remains depressed for several years. Although such an outcome would be very painful for equity holders, Saylor said the company’s structure ensures other stakeholders will still be protected. Bitcoin Not Yet a True Market Hedge? Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s changing relationship with US equities is fueling debate about its potential as a global safe-haven asset. According to new research from blockchain data firm RedStone Oracles, Bitcoin recently showed a strong negative correlation with the US stock market when looking at short-term trends, particularly the seven-day trailing correlation. However, this relationship weakens over longer periods. RedStone's analysis of the 30-day correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 index revealed a fluctuating correlation coefficient ranging from -0.2 to 0.4, which means that Bitcoin does not consistently behave as a hedge against equities. The study suggests that to qualify as a reliable safe-haven asset, an asset must show a sustained negative correlation with equities below -0.3. Bitcoin’s failure to meet this threshold implies that it cannot yet serve as a dependable counterbalance during periods of financial stress. Despite this, the researchers still argue that Bitcoin holds value as a portfolio diversifier. Its tendency to move independently from traditional assets can help investors achieve better risk-adjusted returns, particularly when stocks are underperforming. RedStone’s co-founder and COO, Marcin Kazmierczak, said that while Bitcoin may not yet have the stability or behavior of traditional safe-haven assets like gold or government bonds, it is gradually maturing into a more globally recognized financial instrument. He pointed to the growing involvement of institutional investors and corporate treasuries, like BlackRock’s support and strategic Bitcoin allocations, as signs of increasing market legitimacy and reduced volatility. Kazmierczak believes that these factors are helping Bitcoin inch closer to behaving like a long-term investment asset. Bitcoin’s weekly volatility reached a 563-day low on April 30, and fell below the realized volatility of both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100. This reinforces the view that Bitcoin is beginning to resemble a more stable and serious financial asset.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-15 06:00:00

Traders reacted to Beijing’s decision to lift export curbs on rare earths and military-use technologies for 28 U.S. entities, effective Wednesday, allowing exporters to apply for licenses during a 90-day window. China also temporarily lifted trade and investment bans on 17 U.S. firms, calling the move a potential reset in bilateral ties. Geopolitical risks also eased, with India-Pakistan tensions stabilizing and rising optimism that Trump may lift sanctions on Syria during his Middle East visit. Gold declined to around $3,140 per ounce on Thursday, extending a 2% drop from the previous session and reaching a five-week low. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 0.94% to around 37,700 while the broader Topix Index dropped 0.7% to 2,745 on Thursday, with Japanese shares sliding for the second straight session. The Japanese yen appreciated toward 146 per dollar on Thursday, marking its third straight session of gains, as persistent global trade uncertainties pressured the dollar while lifting other currencies. Meanwhile, investors are closely monitoring developments in the US-Japan trade talks, with Tokyo aiming to finalize a deal by June. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.64% to below 3,390 while the Shenzhen Component dropped 0.8% to 10,270 on Thursday, paring gains from the previous session as persistent trade-related uncertainties weighed on sentiment. Trade negotiations between the two countries are expected to continue in the coming weeks in an effort to reach a broader deal. In a positive sign, China lifted its export ban on rare earths targeting US entities, signaling further de-escalation in trade tensions. Gains were capped by weak April credit data from China, where new yuan loans fell to a 20-year low of CNY 280 billion, reflecting early fallout from trade tensions. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.79% to 23,691 during Thursday’s morning session, marking a second straight day of gains. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.13% to 80,962 in morning trade on Thursday, halting gains from the previous session, with most sectors trading in the red, led by tech, realty, and financials. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.20% to below 8,270 on Thursday, snapping a six-day winning streak, weighed down by losses in mining and energy stocks amid weaker commodity prices. The Australian dollar climbed to around $0.644 on Thursday, recouping some losses from the previous session, after stronger-than-expected jobs data bolstered a more hawkish outlook for monetary policy. Official figures showed the Australian economy added 89,000 net new jobs in April, lifting total employment to a record high of 14.64 million—well above the forecast of 20,000. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%, in line with expectations. Consumer inflation expectations in Australia stood at 4.1% in May 2025, barely changed from 4.2% in the previous month. In the U.S., on Wednesday, all three major indexes ended mixed as investors digested shifting trade policies and renewed momentum in the tech sector Looking ahead, investors are eyeing US retail sales and producer inflation data due Thursday for fresh insight into consumer demand and inflation trends.

Its approach of the psychological $4 resistance could be met with setbacks. Raydium [RAY] has been in a steady uptrend over the past eight days. After retesting the $2.2 support zone, Solana’s [SOL] decentralized exchange token has rallied 64.9% at press time. Two weeks ago, it was reported that RAY bulls have a strong case. It has proved correct since then, although early May saw a 27% price dip from $3 to $2.2. Recently, altcoins have been surging higher, and holders might witness further gains in the coming days and weeks. Raydium to test $4 next, but can it break through? Source: RAY/USDT on TradingView On the 1-day chart, Raydium has a bullish market structure. It has breached a significant lower high set during early March. In doing so, the swing structure of Raydium on the 1-day chart was flipped bullishly. This previous lower high was $2.85. On Saturday the 10th of May, the price surged past this local resistance, and two days later, retested is as support before bounding higher. However, its ascent came with a challenge. The Awesome Oscillator has not formed a new higher high, even though the price broke $2.85 first, and was not nearing the $4 resistance. This bearish divergence could see RAY unable to challenge $4, or unable to break this resistance on the first try. The CMF was above +0.05, a sign of strong buying pressure. Source: RAY/USDT on TradingView On the 4-hour chart, the capital inflow has not been as swift or sure. The CMF was at -0.02, and had dipped to -0.26 just 36 hours before the time of writing. Hence, even though the Awesome Oscillator showed bullish momentum, a lack of demand could stall further gains. Source: Coinalyze Data from Coinalyze showed speculative interest. The Open Interest surged from $7.8 million to $11.26 million within a day as Raydium climbed past the $3.2 local resistance. The Funding Rate was positive, and alongside the rising Open Interest, showed bullish market expectations in the short-term. However, the 1-day bearish divergence could stall the rally or induce a pullback from the $4 resistance.

The Exclusive Investor Deal Explained appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Here’s another twist in the Trump memecoin world – some top holders say that the Gala dinner with Trump is just costing them $1,200 each. These five were among the top 220 time-weighted holders of the Trump memecoin over the past three weeks. Although it usually takes about $54,500 in holdings to get through, Christensen and his friends found a smarter way to do it in less.

They bought the memecoin, shorted the same amount to offset the risk, and then sold both positions as soon as the dinner winners were announced. Christensen, who runs AirdropAlert.com, said that with this strategy, attending the dinner didn’t really cost them anything, as they just paid some fees. “I didn’t even think it was in the possibility I’d go in to meet the president of the United States. We figured it won’t cost us that much to compete, so we gave it a shot and we made it,” 39-year-old Christensen said, as reported by Bloomberg . “ They joined the memecoin dinner contest at the last minute when they saw it wasn’t as tough as they expected. They even built a program to track the top holders and bought more tokens at the last minute to secure their spots. $320M Poured Into Trump Tokens for Trade and Crypto Plans Trump is hosting this dinner at his golf club, where the top 25 memecoin holders will also get a chance for a White House tour. Big companies like Freight Technologies plan to raise $20 million to build a Trump token treasury for U.S.-Mexico trade. Meanwhile, China-linked GD Culture Group aims to gather $300 million to create a reserve with Bitcoin and Trump tokens. However, some have called this dinner a “pay-to-play” scheme. The Democrats also delayed the stablecoin rules over concerns that Trump’s family’s growing crypto ties could cause problems. As per recent reports, investors have spent over $148 million for a chance to dine with the President, as he called it the “most exclusive invitation”. The coin is currently trading at $13.20.

In the May 9 judgment in the Singapore Supreme Court, Justice Kwek Mean Luck granted a request from Sonic Labs, formerly the Fantom Foundation, to declare Multichain bankrupt and appoint liquidators from global audit, tax and advisory service KPMG. Sonic Labs CEO Michael Kong said in a May 14 statement to X that the team behind the layer 1 Sonic blockchain felt it had no choice but to file a lawsuit to forcibly wind up Multichain because its former employees were being “completely uncooperative” and “hid from victims.” “Going forward, the liquidators can now start working with other parties to initiate the process of trying to acquire funds that should eventually be returned to users if those legal proceedings are successful,” Kong said. Source: Michael Kong In July 2023, the Multichain Foundation experienced abnormally large outflows , later confirmed as a hack, leading to the loss of assets across multiple chains, including Fantom, Ethereum, BNB, Cronos and Polygon. Blockchain security firm Beosin and Fantom estimated in an August 2023 report that the total losses for all chains were at least $210 million. Wind up action followed legal win The High Court of Singapore granted a default judgment ruling in January 2024 as part of Sonic Labs’ legal action against Multichain for breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentations and claims the crosschain protocol had lost $122 million of its funds. Related: Multichain’s ‘mysterious withdrawals’ have whiffs of a ‘rug pull’ — Chainalysis Following the ruling, Sonic Labs said in March 2024 it would leverage the legal win to petition the court to wind up the Multichain Foundation and appoint a liquidator, equivalent to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the US, to help recover and distribute missing or frozen assets. Previously, Sonic Labs indicated it planned to use the legal win to forge a path for other victims of the Multichain hack to lodge claims for their losses as well. Multichain shut down in July 2024 due to a lack of operational funds, and after its CEO, known as Zhaojun, was detained by Chinese police .

Speaking to Bloomberg Television on Wednesday, Armstrong reaffirmed Coinbase’s commitment to growth through strategic acquisitions, noting that the company has ample financial resources to pursue such opportunities. “We are always looking at M&A opportunities,” Armstrong said. “We have a large balance sheet that can be put to use. Part of the benefit of being a public company is, you have a liquid currency to do that.” Further, Armstrong said that while Coinbase is actively considering acquisitions, it is selective about which opportunities to pursue. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is on Capitol Hill as crypto executives push for stablecoin legislation to be revived. Senators are working on legislation backed by the crypto industry that faltered after a furor over President Trump’s crypto ventures https://t.co/tm6T3OeNVd pic.twitter.com/gjhEkIXn3i — Bloomberg TV (@BloombergTV) May 14, 2025 Armstrong Silent on Potential Circle Acquisition The CEO specifically pointed to international markets and companies with similar business models as areas of focus for future acquisitions. When asked about the possibility of acquiring stablecoin issuer Circle, with which Coinbase already shares revenue, Armstrong did not provide a definitive answer, stating he had “nothing to announce today.” Meanwhile, Ripple’s attempt to acquire Circle was reportedly rejected as its offer was deemed too low. Circle has also filed to go public. Deribit Deal Solidifies Coinbase Strategy to Expand into Crypto Derivatives Market Coinbase’s acquisition of Deribit, the largest global exchange for Bitcoin and Ether options, is a significant move. It reflects the company’s goal to strengthen its position in the crypto derivatives market. The $2.9b deal includes $700m in cash and 11m shares of Coinbase stock. This is subject to typical purchase price adjustments. In 2022, Deribit processed nearly $1.2t in volume. This shows the strategic importance of the acquisition as Coinbase works to diversify its offerings. The exchange has long been an active player in the crypto M&A space, consistently seeking to expand its market footprint. Armstrong’s comments suggest that the company will maintain this aggressive growth strategy, particularly in markets that can help accelerate its product development and growth. As it continues to build on its growth trajectory, the company is also poised to join the prestigious S&P 500 index next week.

Despite the recent dip, the layer-1 token remains one of the top performers in the sector, having risen over 100% during its most recent rally. However, momentum has slowed. 24-hour daily trading volume is down 30.5% to $1.13 billion, while derivatives activity has dropped 31.2% to $3.07 billion, as per Coinglass data . Open interest has edged down 1.8% to $1.8 billion, pointing to cooling short-term speculation. The decline comes just as Sui ( SUI ) announced a new partnership on May 14, with 21Shares, a well-known issuer of crypto exchange-traded products. The collaboration will focus on boosting global awareness and adoption of SUI, especially in the U.S., where 21Shares is expanding as regulatory conditions improve and institutional demand grows. “Partnering with Sui speaks to where we see the future of blockchain infrastructure heading,” said Federico Brokate, head of U.S. business at 21Shares. He cited Sui’s speed , scalability, and expanding DeFi ecosystem as important strengths that might help it play a major role in the upcoming wave of crypto growth.

According to DeFiLlama data , Sui currently has $2.06 billion in total value locked, placing it eighth out of all blockchains. Over the past month, that number has increased by almost 70%, indicating a rise in both user and developer activity. Looking at the technical picture, SUI appears to be consolidating just below resistance at $3.92 after its rally. Although it has fallen from recent highs, the relative strength index is still above neutral at 63. The moving average convergence divergence has turned bearish with a negative crossover developing, and may be an early warning sign of momentum loss. Sui price analysis. Credit: crypto.news Short-term momentum indicators, such as the Stochastic RSI, flash neutral-to-sell signals and show waning strength. All of the major moving averages, from 10 to 200 days, are still in buy territory, indicating that the overall trend is still bullish. A slight narrowing of the Bollinger Bands suggests less volatility. SUI may consolidate before making another upward move if it can maintain support at the $3.66–$3.80 range, especially if developments like the 21Shares partnership boost investor trust and sentiment.

Among them, crypto analyst Capt Toblerone has projected a significant price increase for XRP, contingent on a major expansion of the global crypto market. According to Toblerone, if XRP’s market capitalization reaches $1.2 trillion during this bull cycle, its price could rise to $22 per token. A rough market cap estimate for top 10 crypto coins by @Grok if my 2026 bull run scenario plays out . Assuming a total crypto market cap of $35 trillion, BTC at $300,000 (yielding 16.94% dominance), ETH at $30,000, SOL at $7,500, XRP at $22, and the remaining top 6… — CAPT. PARA8OLIC TOBLERONE (@CaptToblerone) April 24, 2025 Currently trading around $2.5 with a market cap of $146 billion, XRP would need to increase its total valuation by nearly tenfold to meet this target. Toblerone’s projection suggests this scenario is plausible within a broader market surge, where XRP captures a substantial portion of the capital inflow into digital assets. $35 Trillion Market Forecast Could Redefine Crypto Valuations In a recent tweet, Toblerone outlined a vision of a $35 trillion global cryptocurrency market by 2026. This represents an over tenfold increase from today’s total market capitalization of approximately $3.03 trillion. Within this scenario, Bitcoin’s dominance is expected to fall from 64% to just 16%, allowing more capital to flow into altcoins such as XRP. Under this outlook, Toblerone estimates that Bitcoin will rise to $300,000 per coin, equating to a $5.928 trillion market cap. Ethereum , traded at $1,830 with a $220 billion valuation, is projected to grow even more significantly. He predicts ETH could reach $30,000, resulting in a $3.609 trillion market cap. XRP’s $22 Projection Draws Support from Other Analysts Toblerone’s expectation for XRP aligns with other market observers. Bitcoin analyst Davinci Jeremie has reaffirmed his $24 XRP price forecast, commenting that the token “has a good chance to hit that level this year.” Similarly, South Korea-based Elliott Wave strategist XForceGlobal believes XRP may reach anywhere between $10 and $40 during this bull cycle. A $40 valuation would place XRP’s market capitalization at approximately $2.32 trillion. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Even more ambitious projections have emerged from analysts like Javon Marks, who has stated that XRP could rise to $100. This would suggest a market cap of nearly $6 trillion—an outcome dependent on extreme bullish conditions and significant adoption. Broader Altcoin Market Expected to Surge Toblerone’s bullish view on XRP is part of a broader altcoin outlook that includes aggressive price targets for other major tokens. His projections include Solana (SOL) reaching a $3.5 trillion market cap, BNB at $872 billion, Cardano (ADA) at $407 billion, and Dogecoin (DOGE) at $290 billion. However, only Ethereum, Solana, and XRP are seen as likely candidates to cross the trillion-dollar threshold in this cycle. This redistribution of capital away from Bitcoin toward altcoins is central to Toblerone’s thesis, as it enables other blockchain networks to scale significantly during the current market expansion. Long-Term Implications for XRP Investors While such predictions are speculative and depend on macroeconomic trends, regulatory developments, and investor sentiment, they reflect a growing belief among some market participants that digital assets could absorb a much larger share of global capital soon. As for XRP , a climb to a $1.2 trillion valuation would significantly alter its market rank, positioning it beside the largest crypto assets by market capitalization. For many investors, these projections serve as both a signal of market potential and a reminder of the volatility and uncertainty inherent in crypto forecasting.

Exploring the $100M Fund and Its Impact on Pi Coin,https://coinpedia.org/news/what-is-pi-network-ventures-exploring-the-100m-fund-and-its-impact-on-pi-coin/,"The post What is Pi Network Ventures? Exploring the $100M Fund and Its Impact on Pi Coin appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Pi Network has introduced Pi Network Ventures, a $100 million fund aimed at supporting startups that build real-world use cases for the Pi cryptocurrency. The initiative, backed by 10% of the Pi tokens allocated to the nonprofit Pi Foundation, is intended to shift Pi from a widely held asset to one that’s actively used in daily life. While the announcement was meant to spark excitement, Pi Coin’s market reacted negatively. With growing confusion, the token plunged over 45% this week, wiping nearly $5 billion in market cap and knocking it out of the top 20 crypto list. After briefly touching $1.5, Pi is now trading around $0.88, leaving investors and the community rattled. Driving Real-World Adoption THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, Why? Utility will increase — Pi will be able to become a real currency used for payments and trading, instead of just a mining token. Startups will be funded — $100M will be given to projects that implement Pi in real-life. Ecosystem will be… pic.twitter.com/t4ivK1a9Pt — The Times of PiNetwork (@PiNetwork24X7) May 14, 2025 Pi Network Ventures wants to give money to new businesses that use Pi in useful ways, like letting people pay with Pi or using it in their apps or services. The idea is to make Pi something people use in real life, not just something they mine on their phones. This funding comes right after Pi entered its “Open Network” phase, which now lets it connect with other apps and systems, making it easier for Pi to work in the real world. This means Pi could finally become something useful, like real money. The fact that the Core Team is doing this also shows they are serious about Pi’s future. They believe this could finally turn Pi from just an idea into something real. Community Support Still Key This fund represents just one part of Pi’s two-track growth strategy. While it focuses on select high-potential businesses, the other half is driven by grassroots efforts, hackathons, open development tools, and builder platforms aimed at energizing the global Pioneer community to innovate with Pi. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Did Pi Network Mislead Its 70M Users? Pioneers Speak Out , But Where Are the DApps? Despite years of promises, the Pi community says there’s little to show in terms of functioning decentralized applications (DApps). Influential figure Dr. Altcoin called the $100M fund announcement “a betrayal,” pointing out that after six years, the core team has yet to deliver on its commitment of launching 100 working DApps. The Pioneer base, with around 70 million users worldwide, is feeling ignored. Dr. Altcoin also noted that many users couldn’t even earn 1,000 Pi tokens due to limited referral rewards and inconsistent communication. The lack of transparency and progress has left many feeling sidelined despite their early contributions. Volatility Adds to Pressure On the flip side, Pi Coin’s crash is also linked to a 5.2 million token unlock, causing more selling pressure. Trading volumes surged 35% to $951 million, signaling high volatility. While the fund aims to shape a stronger future for Pi, it’s clear the project must first rebuild trust within its own community. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

According to a May 14 statement , Europol coordinated with Spanish, Belgian, and Austrian law enforcement in January to arrest 17 suspects accused of running a parallel banking structure. The operation followed earlier investigations into migrant smuggling and drug trafficking rings that reportedly relied on the group’s illicit financial services. The dismantled organization operated a hawala-style money transfer system, allowing clients to bypass formal banking channels. Europol described the network as “one of the most significant in this crime area”, which offered cash courier services and crypto-for-cash exchanges to criminal groups. Investigators found the group ran two core branches, with one targeting Arabic-speaking clients and another servicing Chinese networks. Spanish authorities said 13 property searches were carried out across multiple cities, including Madrid, Valencia, Málaga, Almería, and Cádiz. Of the 17 individuals arrested, 15 have already been jailed. Most of the suspects were of Chinese and Syrian origin.

Authorities also blocked 10 real estate properties worth over €2.5 million (approx. $2.8 million), confiscated 18 vehicles, four shotguns, and dozens of encrypted electronic devices. Additional luxury items included cigars valued at over €622,000 (approx. $696,600), branded handbags worth more than €230,000 (approx. $257,600), and high-end watches and wines. The group allegedly advertised its laundering services on social media, masking its operations as a legitimate remittance provider. Local media described the group as “the most powerful international organization” in its field. One suspect, identified as a key hawaladar, allegedly managed transaction records and appointed trusted brokers to coordinate the group’s branches. Authorities documented 32 money transfers worth over €5.5 million in just three months. One crypto wallet used as a transfer hub reportedly handled over 21 million euros ($23.5 million) between mid-2022 and late 2023. The crackdown comes amid a broader push by European agencies to tackle crypto-related crime. Earlier this month, Frankfurt authorities shut down crypto exchange eXch, which was used to launder funds from some of the biggest hacks in recent years, including the $1.5 billion Bybit breach and the $1.4 billion Multisig exploit. According to a May 9 announcement, the Frankfurt Prosecutor’s Office seized crypto assets worth €34 million (around $38.2 million), calling it the third-largest crypto seizure in the BKA’s history. Officials accused the team behind eXch of running a criminal trading platform and engaging in large-scale money laundering . The exchange reportedly had ties to the FixedFloat exploit, Genesis Creditor theft, and various phishing scams, according to on-chain sleuth ZachXBT.

In a May 14 press release , the company said the VanEck Onchain Economy ETF, under the ticker NODE, will offer exposure to “digital transformation companies and digital asset instruments.” The fund is actively managed and focuses on public companies involved in the blockchain space, including crypto miners, exchanges, data centers, energy providers, and fintech firms using crypto technology. It will hold between 30 and 60 companies, chosen from a wider pool of over 130, with the portfolio adjusted based on market trends and each firm’s connection to Bitcoin ( BTC ). NODE won’t hold cryptocurrencies directly but can invest up to 25% of its assets in crypto-linked exchange-traded products like Bitcoin ETFs. These investments will be made through a Cayman Islands subsidiary, which will allow the fund to comply with U.S. tax laws while indirectly gaining exposure to cryptocurrency-related products like swaps and futures. NODE won’t invest in stablecoins and will restrict subsidiary exposure to 25% of assets every quarter.

With a 0.69% management fee, NODE complements VanEck’s line of crypto-related products, which already includes the passively managed Digital Transformation ETF. The launch coincides with the rising institutional interest in blockchain infrastructure, alongside the growing availability of products from traditional asset managers that are suited to the changing on-chain economy. VanEck has also filed for ETFs tied to individual digital assets, including Avalanche ( AVAX ) and Binance Coin ( BNB ), indicating its ongoing expansion in the crypto investment space.

Bitcoin Price Outlook: Key Technical Levels to Watch Bitcoin price prediction seems bearish as BTC is trading at $102,299, slipping below the 50-EMA ($103,160) and testing a key ascending trendline support, now hovering just above the 38.2% Fibonacci level at $101,924. This breakdown beneath both dynamic (EMA) and diagonal (trendline) support could signal a deeper pullback if confirmed by a sustained close. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Key Technical Highlights: Fibonacci Levels : Price is flirting with the 38.2% retracement from the $95,828–$105,692 move. A break below $101,924 exposes the 50% level at $100,760 and deeper support at the 61.8% zone near $99,596. Trendline Support : The ascending support trendline from May 7 has been broken, which may invalidate the recent bullish structure. MACD : The MACD is in bearish territory with widening negative histograms and a bearish crossover, signaling ongoing momentum loss. Immediate Resistance : The $103,364 level (23.6% Fib) and the EMA ($103,160) are now flipped to resistance. Next Support Levels : Watch $101,951, $100,784, and $99,596 on the downside. Bitcoin Outlook: The bias turns short-term bearish unless Bitcoin can quickly reclaim the $103,000 zone. A confirmed breakdown below $101,900 opens the door toward $100,760 and $99,600. Watch for a potential bullish divergence or a reversal candle at those Fib levels to reassess long entries. Until then, momentum favors the bears. BTC Bull Token Crosses $5.70M as 73% Staking Yield Captivates Crypto Investors BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) continues to attract strong investor interest, now surpassing $5.70 million in funds raised as it approaches its $6.69 million presale cap. With its current price holding at $0.00251, BTCBULL is positioning itself as a high-yield staking solution rather than just another meme coin, delivering tangible utility amid rising market volatility. Flexible Staking Model Offers 73% APY, No Lockups What sets BTCBULL apart is its flexible staking architecture, offering investors an estimated 73% annual yield—with no lockup periods or exit penalties. In an environment where most DeFi staking protocols require long-term commitments, BTCBULL’s model allows participants to earn rewards while maintaining liquidity, appealing to both cautious and active crypto traders. This agility has resonated with yield-seeking investors looking to participate in the 2025 crypto cycle without being bound by rigid staking conditions. Current Presale Stats: USDT Raised: $5,703,683.87 / $6,690,863 Token Price: $0.00251 per BTCBULL Total Staking Pool: 1,432,976,427 BTCBULL Estimated Yield: 73% annually With less than $1 million remaining before the next price tier is triggered, the presale is entering its final stretch. This limited-time window is prompting renewed urgency among prospective investors. BTCBULL ’s real-world utility and DeFi-friendly staking structure continue to set it apart in a crowded altcoin market.

A $999K liquidation cluster sits at $3.66, potentially triggering a breakout rally. Toncoin [TON] prices have been trading in a bullish pennant pattern. The pattern signals a potential continuation of its current uptrend. The altcoin prices have had a three-day bullish run since the 8th of May. However, momentum shows signs of exhaustion as the asset tests a crucial pennant resistance at the round $3.5 price level. A renewed breakout could result from a bullish rally above the key price point. But so far, TON bulls are finding themselves struggling to get over it, making price movement lag behind just shy of the resistance zone. Source: TradingView Whale activity sparks bullish signals Interestingly, while price stalls, on-chain signals suggest growing accumulation. As of writing, TON’s large transactions spiked by 84%, hitting $6.12 billion. That kind of spike usually reflects whale or institutional activity, often a precursor to major moves. The increased transaction volume suggests that the TON key players could be positioning for a breakout. Liquidation cluster may act as rocket fuel Adding to the bullish case is the Coinglass liquidation data. At the $3.66 level, over $999K in liquidations are clustered. This level lies just above the current resistance and could act as a price magnet to pull the price even higher. If TON manages to break out above $3.5, it could trigger a cascade of liquidations, pushing the price even higher. Traders caught in short positions may be forced to buy back TON, adding further fuel to a possible rally. Source: Coinglass What’s next for TON? For Toncoin (TON) bulls, the focus now is a strong close above the $3.5 level of resistance. If so, focus will shift to the $3.66 area as the next closest target. Bullish pennant, whale accumulation and leverage liquidation all point to a potential bullish run. However, until the break materializes, there might still be a consolidation in the market.",Altcoin|News|News 1|Social|Trading View,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|TON,"{'name': 'AMB Crypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/ambcrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",ambcrypto,2025-05-15 07:30:11

Price predictions suggest ALGO could reach $0.90 by the end of 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate potential highs of $5.65 by 2030. Algorand’s strong push for scalability and decentralization is paying off. With the launch of AlgoKit 3.0 in Q1 2025 and growing developer interest, ALGO adoption is on the rise. But the big question remains: Can ALGO Price hit $1 this cycle? Read our in-depth Algorand Price Prediction 2025 and long-term outlook through 2030 to find out.

With a potential altcoin market in Q1 2025, the ALGO coin price might skyrocket toward a new high. If the network maintains the staggering growth, the ALGO coin price may reach $0.89 in 2025. Conversely, if the network fails to expand, then the price can flip into a bearish trap and dip to $0.45. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.45 $0.67 $0.89 Algorand Price Prediction 2025 The previous peak seen in Algorand price was in Q4 2024, which was $0.613, then came Q1 2025, where the price of Algorand fell drastically. However, the situation in Q2 2025 improved when the ALGO price started recovering in April, with global altcoin crypto recovering. By May Algorand price has reached $0.24 from Q2’s low of $0.150, which shows a gain of 70%. When writing, the price is struggling to pass a critical zone, and the price action has built a bullish structure known as inverted head and shoulders (H&S), which shows that odds are higher that with increased bullish pressure, the resisting zone, which aligns with the fibonacci 0.236 level, could be cleared. Algorand / US Dollar 1D Chart Once it’s cleared, by May end in 2025, the price could reach Fibonacci 0.5 and 0.618 respectively, and could even penetrate higher if adoption increases. Also, the funding rate is on the green side, which highlights that long-term bullish positions are continuously building in ALgorand, and that makes it more likely that the ALGO price would rise northwards.

Bitcoin’s realized price reflects the average price at which all BTC was last transacted on-chain, weighted by the supply. It offers a more accurate representation of the market’s cost basis compared to the current market price. Meanwhile, the 30-day simple moving average is around 0.10% per day or around 35% to 40% annualized. “These positive yet moderate returns indicate a sustained bull phase underpinned by solid fundamentals,” he said. Bitcoin is trading near $100K, with the realized price around $45K and still climbing. Daily RP yield ranges from 0.10% to 0.23% (approximately 36–85% annualized), while the 30-day SMA sits at about 0.10% (around 35–40% annualized).

The metric is growing at roughly 3% per month, it added. However, while the uptick confirms renewed capital inflows, the pace still lags behind the aggressive accumulation seen in November and December 2024 following the election of US President Donald Trump. It also observed that Bitcoin’s long-term holder realized price has climbed to $45,340, “reflecting the aging of coins bought around $90K to $100K into long-term status.” Buyers from December are now long-term holders, “gradually lifting the cohort’s cost basis,” it added. After a period of stagnation in April, #Bitcoin ‘s Realized Cap has added nearly $30B, currently growing at ~3% monthly. While the uptick confirms renewed capital inflows, the pace still lags behind the aggressive accumulation seen in Nov–Dec ’24. pic.twitter.com/kE6EbuevlC — glassnode (@glassnode) May 14, 2025 This signals reduced selling pressure as distribution risk from the long-term holder cohort eases, keeping sentiment bullish. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant analysts reported that retail was returning to Bitcoin markets. On May 14, they noted that small retail investors with balances below $10,000 were gradually returning to Bitcoin, signaling renewed market confidence. From April 28 to May 13, there was a 3.4% increase in purchases from this group. “As they enter the market, they tend to create a positive feedback loop, reinforcing bullish narratives and increasing buying pressure,” they said. BTC Price Outlook Bitcoin’s intraday high was just over $104,000 on Wednesday, but markets have cooled off since, with the asset falling below $102,000 during the Thursday morning Asian trading session. It has spent a week holding above six figures , however, and the longer it does so, the more likely it is to move higher. BTC has made 20% over the past month and is currently just 5.6% away from its January all-time high of $108,786, according to CoinGecko. Technical analyst Tony Severino said that range breakouts “tend to be strong and happen in one large weekly candle,” suggesting that this could happen by the end of May.

The onchain economy represents the next phase of digital transformation built on blockchain and automation, quietly reshaping sectors far beyond crypto. Bitcoin adoption is accelerating among corporations, governments, and consumers, not just as an asset, but as a monetary alternative in an increasingly fragmented world. Trends like de-dollarization, the onshoring of energy and compute infrastructure, and the rethinking of global trade flows align with onchain investment themes. The onchain economy represents the next phase of digital transformation built on blockchain and automation, quietly reshaping sectors far beyond crypto. Understanding the Next Phase of Digital Transformation Global commerce is undergoing a significant overhaul. New digital infrastructure that is decentralized (no single entity controls it) and programmable (it can be customized and automated) is replacing outdated legacy systems. This transition is unfolding alongside broader macro shifts: rising interest in alternatives to the U.S. dollar, de-globalization, and a growing focus on domestic energy and infrastructure. The onchain economy is emerging as the connective tissue across these trends, where financial services, computing, and monetary systems are being reimagined from the ground up. This blog defines the onchain economy, breaks down the categories that make it up, and explores its positioning to benefit from a world increasingly influenced by Bitcoin and the digital asset ecosystem. From Online to Onchain The onchain economy describes economic activity enabled by blockchain-based infrastructure, where transactions, data, and assets are managed directly, transparently, and efficiently, reducing reliance on traditional middlemen and intermediaries. Over the past 25 years, most of the global economy has digitized, but not all of it has been truly transformed. Despite decades of innovation, much of today’s digital economy still relies on outdated systems: slow payment networks, siloed databases, and frustrating intermediaries — think the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)’s online portal. Systems like these often feel sluggish, clunky, and frustrating — a far cry from the seamless experience users expect today. The onchain economy is different. It’s a shift in how industries handle trust, value, and coordination — using code instead of paper, automation instead of middlemen, and transparency instead of opacity. It’s also emerging when confidence in legacy institutions is fading. Governments are exploring alternative reserve assets. Consumers are looking for digital-first stores of value. Corporations are integrating bitcoin into their balance sheets or treasury strategies. The onchain economy is the infrastructure layer enabling this evolution Mapping the Onchain Economy The onchain economy isn't one industry; it's a set of connected pieces working together. Here's what it looks like in practice: Category What It Is What It Might Include Example Company Mining Companies that validate blockchain transactions using energy-intensive computing. Specialized mining operations, including hybrid AI/crypto compute. CleanSpark, Riot Platforms Exchanges Platforms that allow users to buy, sell, and store digital assets. Centralized trading platforms, token swap services, crypto-native brokers. Coinbase Holders Entities holding a material amount of digital assets as a strategic or treasury reserve. Public companies with significant Bitcoin on balance sheets. Strategy, Block Asset Managers Firms that create and manage crypto-focused portfolios for investors. Crypto ETP sponsors, actively managed crypto strategies, fund-of-fund offerings. CoinShares Data Centers Physical infrastructure operators supporting blockchain and AI workloads. High-performance computing centers, converted mining facilities. Equinix, Digital Realty Energy Infrastructure Providers of power and grid services for energy-intensive technologies. Utilities, nuclear, and renewable energy firms supporting blockchain Constellation Energy, NextEra Energy Traditional Finance (TradFi) Enablers Traditional finance companies adopting blockchain for greater speed, transparency, or cost-efficiency. Fintech apps, payment networks, digital ID PayPal, Robinhood Semiconductors/Hardware Hardware manufacturers building chips for mining, AI, and edge computing. Designers and fabricators of ASICs, GPUs, and HPC chips. Nvidia, AMD Consumer & Gaming Applications using tokens, NFTs, or smart contracts to deliver new digital experiences. Blockchain games, digital wallets, token-powered consumer apps. MercadoLibre, Shopify Crypto ETPs Exchange-traded products that provide exposure to digital assets through public markets. Spot Bitcoin products, Ether trackers, diversified crypto index notes. n/a Each category reflects a different angle on how increased Bitcoin and blockchain adoption drive real economic activity, whether it's miners scaling energy usage, holders securing treasuries, or energy and data providers capturing digital infrastructure demand. Take MercadoLibre ( MELI ) , the Amazon of Latin America, which has integrated crypto payments to help millions gain exposure to digital assets through everyday transactions. This integration allows unbanked and underbanked people to transact securely and efficiently. Or consider CleanSpark ( CLSK ) , a Bitcoin mining company that contributes to grid stability by managing high-load computing infrastructure, a key component of how blockchain intersects with energy strategy. CleanSpark shows how blockchain-linked businesses can deliver real-world infrastructure benefits. These examples highlight how the onchain economy is already reshaping industries. Key parts of finance, energy, and computing are being rebuilt to meet the needs of a more decentralized global landscape. Why It Matters: Building a Better System Bitcoin adoption is accelerating among corporations, governments, and consumers, not just as an asset, but as a monetary alternative in an increasingly fragmented world. In 2024 alone, bitcoin ETPs saw $35 billion in inflows (CoinMarketCap), while stablecoins processed over $11 trillion in value, outpacing some major card networks. This is driving demand for infrastructure that supports this adoption: miners scaling energy capacity, data centers shifting workloads, and asset managers designing new ways to access the ecosystem. Meanwhile, trends like de-dollarization, the onshoring of energy and compute infrastructure, and the rethinking of global trade flows align with onchain investment themes. From power producers and semiconductor manufacturers to public companies holding bitcoin in treasury, the onchain economy is where monetary evolution meets real-world infrastructure. It's not just a story of blockchain efficiency—it's a broader economic shift that reflects how the next generation of financial and industrial systems is being shaped. The Economy Is Going Onchain The systems that power the economy are becoming more digital, more connected, and more automated. Blockchain and related technologies are starting to reshape how money moves, data is stored, and services are delivered. This defines the onchain economy—not just crypto but an entire stack of infrastructure, starting with everything from sovereign asset strategy to domestic energy production. This shift is still early, but it's quietly laying the foundation for the next generation of financial and industrial systems. The economy isn’t just going digital— it’s going onchain .

The Jeju Metropolitan Police Agency announced the arrest of 25 individuals connected to four separate criminal organizations behind the elaborate scheme, local media outlet yna reported . According to officials, the fraudsters operated call centers designed to appear as legitimate investment advisory services. The operation allegedly led to losses totaling nearly 734 million won ( $540,000 USD) from at least 48 victims between June 2023 and April 2025. Posing as cryptocurrency investment professionals or team leaders from fake firms, the perpetrators persuaded individuals to register on counterfeit crypto exchanges. Victims were assured they would receive compensation for losses or could earn significant returns by purchasing tokens falsely claimed to be on the verge of listing. Manipulated Accounts and Withheld Withdrawals To build trust, scammers showed fake profits in the victims’ online accounts, manipulating dashboards to make it appear that cryptocurrency assets had been credited. These fabricated gains were used to push victims into making larger follow-up investments. Authorities noted that once victims attempted to withdraw funds, their requests were either delayed indefinitely or outright ignored. In most cases, the fraudsters vanished with the funds. Investigation Ongoing, More Crypto Scam Victims Expected Of the 25 individuals arrested, 20 have been taken into custody while the rest face further legal action. Police have charged the suspects with crimes including organizing and operating a criminal group and violating the Telecommunications Financial Fraud Victim Refund Act. Investigators believe there may be additional victims who have yet to come forward. The police are continuing their probe, including efforts to identify and apprehend higher-level operators involved in the scheme. Authorities are urging the public to be vigilant about unsolicited investment advice and to verify the legitimacy of crypto platforms and advisors before engaging in any transactions.

Brian Armstrong was hopeful the vote could happen as early as the 15th of May. The U.S Senate stablecoin bill , the GENIUS Act, may be back on the table this week, according to people familiar with the matter. Speaking from Washington D.C, Coinbase founder, Brian Armstrong, stressed that 52 million crypto users want regulatory clarity. He expected the bill to be voted on again on the 15th of May and added, “We’ve been meeting with members of Senate, both sides of House and there’s lot good excitement about getting this done, like any negotiation a lot details work out at last minute.” Will Democrats drop the resistance? Last Thursday, the bill failed to pass after falling short of the 60 votes required to advance it. Several pro-crypto Democrats defected, bringing the count to 48 votes. The holdout, led by Senator Ruben Gallego and Elizabeth Warren, cited several reservations, including President Donald Trump’s conflict of interest in the space and corruption concerns. However, there has been a reported push for a consensus to advance the bill, and there was remarkable progress, too, noted Galaxy head of research, Alex Thorn. “Progress being made on the GENIUS act, more to come the phone calls may have worked.” Likewise, former Fox Business crypto reporter Eleanor Terrett reiterated the bipartisan push. According to her sources, the final vote on the bill may happen before Memorial Day recess (26-30 May). “Senate leadership is discussing the procedural path forward to resume consideration of the GENIUS Act, including the amendment process and a motion to reconsider.” However, she cautioned that the deadline may not be honored if the Democrats’ agreement isn’t achieved by then. For his part, Majority Leader John Thune was noncommittal on whether the final vote would be achieved before the 26th of May. Per a Politico report , he said, “They’re, I think, hearing from Democrats. So we’ll see how committed everybody is to getting a result and if they can get whatever differences they think they had worked out.” The bill seeks to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins and their issuers in the U.S. If passed, the bill would mark a historic milestone for the crypto sector. It could also strengthen the U.S., which lags behind regions like the E.U. in regulation. On Polymarket, the odds of passing in 2025 exceed 80%, reflecting strong market confidence.

While the broader trend remains bullish, short-term indicators show fading momentum after a multi-week rally that began from $74,000. A rejection from key resistance has left BTC vulnerable to a pullback as traders eye intraday support zones. What’s Happening with Bitcoin’s Price? After a sharp rise from $78,000 to $105,700, Bitcoin price action has entered a cooling phase. The 4-hour chart shows BTC forming a narrowing triangle structure with lower highs and horizontal support near $100,800. This range-bound behavior indicates market indecision. At the time of writing, price is testing the lower boundary of this formation. BTCUSD price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Meanwhile, the weekly Fibonacci chart shows BTC rejecting from the 0.786 retracement level at $101,970 and unable to reclaim the 1.0 Fib at $109,396. This level marks a strong historical resistance. If BTC fails to break above this zone, it could enter a broader retracement phase toward the 0.618 level at $96,556.

The country is currently pushing to legalize cryptocurrency and expand its financial system. As reported by Incrypted , officials have confirmed the plans to introduce the bill soon. However, the proposal is not yet finalised. Earlier this year, top finance official Yaroslav Zhelezniak talked about draft laws to create crypto reserves, but no details were shared. Kirill Khomyakov, Binance’s head for CEE, Central Asia, and Africa, said that Binance fully supports Ukraine’s plan. Although it will need big changes and won’t happen overnight, he added that it is still a big step forward that will clear up crypto rules in Ukraine. Ukraine Pushes for Crypto Framework Ukraine is pushing to legalize crypto by 2025 with a draft bill in the works that will include capital gains taxes on crypto-to-fiat conversions and stricter anti-money laundering rules. A previous bill faced delays in the President’s office due to some concerns, particularly from the National Securities and Stock Market Commission. However, the Commission denied blocking the bill, and instead proposed 80 amendments. Binance is working with several countries on introducing Bitcoin reserves and crafting crypto regulations, and has recently held high-level talks with Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan. It has also worked with Ukraine on crypto education and exchange regulations. Even during war, Ukraine embraced crypto and raised millions through donations to help with humanitarian and defense aid. Ukraine Eyes Europe’s First Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Ukraine is not the first to explore this idea. El Salvador was the first to create a Bitcoin Reserve with 6,000+ BTC. In 2025, the US also launched its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, and Brazil is researching digital reserves.

The Canadian miner brought in $67 million in revenue for Q1 2025, marking a 33% increase year-over-year. However, despite the higher revenue, its mining operation’s gross profit margin dropped from 63% to 43%. The company attributed this decline to the April 2024 Bitcoin halving, which cut mining rewards in half, and to price volatility in Bitcoin, which saw its spot price fall from over $100,000 in January to below $80,000 in March. Bitfarms Shifts Focus from Mining Rigs to Data Centers In response to these shifting market dynamics, Bitfarms has begun refocusing its infrastructure away from pure Bitcoin mining and toward AI-focused data centers. CEO Ben Gagnon emphasized the company’s strategy to turn its mining foundations into a base for long-term growth in HPC. “During the quarter, we executed across several key areas in our strategic pivot to the U.S. and HPC,” Gagnon said. “The mining business now provides a stable, low-capex and free cash flow foundation for the Company that positions us very well to grow and develop our U.S. assets into HPC/AI data centers while still capitalizing on any potential Bitcoin upside in 2025 and 2026.” Coin Metrics noted in a recent report that more miners are looking to diversify into AI data-center hosting to create new revenue streams and utilize their existing power and hardware infrastructure more effectively. Expansion and New Capital for AI Push To fund its AI ambitions, Bitfarms secured a $300 million line of credit from investment bank Macquarie in April. The funding will help expand its HPC operations, particularly a new facility in Pennsylvania. In another strategic move, Bitfarms sold its Paraguay mining facility to Hive Digital for $85 million in January, further signaling its shift away from traditional crypto mining. The company is also expanding its footprint in the U.S. to hedge against potential international trade tensions. As interest in AI infrastructure continues to grow—highlighted by CoreWeave’s $1.5 billion IPO in March—Bitfarms appears poised to tap into a booming market while continuing to ride the waves of Bitcoin’s volatile cycles.

Analysts project Dogecoin could reach $0.39 by the end of 2025. Long term projection highlights that by 2030 it could even reach the $3 mark. Dogecoin, the memecoin category leader, has picked up the pace amidst the uptrend in the market. Between the turn of events, marketers are still hoping for it to match its June 2021 high. The hopes could soon be fulfilled, as the House of Doge within the Dogecoin Foundation has opened the doors to the “Official Dogecoin Reserve” by acquiring 10 million DOGE to boost payment utility and transaction efficiency. Talking about DOGE’s price, it is currently trading at $0.1835, a bullish push from here could lead DOGE to its resistance at $0.20. On the flipside, if bears hunt DOGE down, its price could tumble to $0.15 in the very short term. As the underlying dynamics shift amid broader market volatility, investors have started wondering, “Will Dogecoin ever hit $1?” to “Will Doge go back up?” Are you wondering the same? Worry not, Coinpedia’s Dogecoin price prediction 2025 to 2030 will clear all such doubts. Look at this well-researched and detailed DOGE price prediction for the upcoming moves.

On the other hand, if the market is hit again by external forces like regulations or negative statements by influencers. Hence, the meme coin might trade at a potential low of $ 0.62 . We expect the DOGE price to reach a new swing high of $1.07 by the end of 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.62 $0.84 $1.07 Dogecoin Price Prediction for May 2025 Dogecoin faces bearish pressure as it struggles below the 9-day SMA , with RSI dipping to 44, suggesting weakening momentum. After a failed breakout near $0.20, prices are forming a descending triangle pattern, typically bearish. The broader trend remains sideways with a slight downward bias. Unless bulls reclaim the $0.18–$0.20 zone, further decline is likely. Potential Low: $0.145 Average Price: $0.165 Potential High: $0.195 DOGE Price Forecast 2025 The Dogecoin price is most watched all because of previous historical moments that gave unprecedented returns to investors, a glimpse of its parabolic move was seen last in November 2024, when Donald Trump won the presidential election . The price reached a yearly high of $0.4846 by the end of last year, 2024. However, people realizing profits built a supply zone at that peak and started pushing its price down. Still, the bulls tried in January to sustain the Q4 2024 gains, but the high volume profile level at $0.39 pushed the price downwards, falling as low as $0.130 by early April, which is the same demand zone where the last Q4 2024 parabolic move was observed. Even in the past 30 days, the surrounding environment is building for altcoins like DOGE to rise. As a result, once following a downward channel, it is on the brink of reaching and piercing the upper border of that very same channel. Dogecoin/US Dollar 1D Chart If it’s broken in May or in the coming months, then there is a higher possibility that it will head northwards once again to retest the $0.39 high volume profile level. Also, ETF odds are more than ever . If it’s approved, then strong adoption could even flip the high of $0.484, and start a new journey for higher levels, and by that time, if it even reaches $1, t would not be much of a surprise then. However, things would get difficult for DOGE price action and its investors if it’s repelled by $0.39 by the end of 2025, it could even come back to the demand zone at $0.13 Also Read: Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030!

Given DOGE’s success, largely driven by hype with some technical progress, crossing $1 by 2025 remains a realistic possibility. A sustained media frenzy and growing endorsement deals could maintain bullish momentum. Expanded merchant adoption would also strengthen confidence in its long-term viability. Dogecoin’s Tokenomics and Long-Term Outlook The future of Dogecoin hinges on its utility. Meme popularity alone may not sustain it indefinitely, but advancements in transaction fees, speed, and business collaborations could help it thrive as a mainstream digital currency. Its large and passionate community will likely continue to drive positive evolution. Conclusion Given Dogecoin’s past price behavior, driven largely by online hype and media coverage, it has the potential to reach over $1 in 2025. DOGE has shown remarkable resilience, and key factors like expanded merchant adoption, community growth, and protocol upgrades could enhance its viability.

That wasn’t the case. Instead, the team announced a $100 million initiative to invest in startups, but the native token’s price reacted with immediate price slumps after the recent hype-driven surge. The Big Announcement On May 8, the official X channel behind the project with over 4.3 million followers said a big ecosystem announcement was coming on May 14. Although it failed to provide any further details, the community started speculating with a few options, but a possible Binance listing was at the forefront since some members claimed that the exchange had experimented with backend PI deposits and withdrawals. However, such a listing on the world’s largest crypto exchange would have to wait, as the actual statement revealed yesterday has nothing to do with any trading platforms. The team announced the launch of Pi Network Ventures, which is a $100 million initiative in PI and USD that will invest in “startups and businesses that advance the utility and real-adoption of PI.” Pi Network Ventures has officially launched—a $100 million initiative, held in Pi and USD, to invest in startups and businesses that advance the utility and real-world adoption of Pi.

It almost tripled within less than a week, going from $0.6 to over $1.7. However, this hype-driven rally came to a screeching halt at that point and has tumbled below $0.9 as of now. This seems to be a classic ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ event, in which the asset’s price surges ahead of the actual announcement but slumps after it. PI is down by 28% in the past 24 hours and has shed 50% of its value since its local peak registered just a few days ago. PI Token Price.

In a recent tweet, SMQKE emphasized the shared use of standard internet protocols by the two systems, stating:“- SWIFTNet runs on standard internet HTTP protocols. The XRP Ledger connects to applications via HTTP. The overlap makes XRPL naturally compatible with SWIFT infrastructure.” To support the claim, SMQKE provided two screenshots from official documentation. One highlights that “applications can connect to the XRP ledger through HTTP or WebSocket APIs,” and notes that these tools allow developers to interact with the XRP Ledger using languages like Python and JavaScript. This structure supports approximately 1,500 transactions per second, making the ledger a high-throughput platform. – SWIFTNet runs on standard internet HTTP protocols. – The XRP Ledger connects to applications via HTTP. The overlap makes XRPL naturally compatible with SWIFT infrastructure. See for yourself. Documented. https://t.co/1N8QgKoXcM pic.twitter.com/Ag0brEH8VD — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 13, 2025 SWIFTNet’s Modernization Efforts The second image is a section from LinkedIn describing SWIFTNet’s infrastructure. It confirms that SWIFTNet allows users to browse financial websites securely “using standard Internet technologies and protocols such as HTTPS and HTML.” This makes it evident that SWIFTNet relies on common internet standards, particularly HTTP-based communication layers. SMQKE’s tweet directly links these two elements—HTTP access to the XRPL and HTTP usage by SWIFTNet—as evidence of inherent technical compatibility. While SWIFT has traditionally operated through a closed and proprietary network, recent years have shifted toward modernizing and adopting open internet protocols, particularly with the push toward ISO 20022 messaging standards . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Implications for Integration Potential This observation comes when the global financial infrastructure is undergoing significant transformation. SWIFT’s ongoing migration to ISO 20022 aims to increase interoperability, speed, and data richness across its messaging ecosystem. Similarly, XRPL is designed for interoperability and high efficiency in cross-border payments . The underlying reliance on similar internet standards suggests that the XRPL can integrate with or function alongside legacy financial systems like SWIFT with fewer barriers than previously assumed. The technical alignment does not suggest direct collaboration or planned integration between the two systems. However, SMQKE emphasizes the documented use of identical communication protocols, which reduces complexity for developers and institutions seeking to bridge traditional and blockchain-based infrastructures. It also supports the narrative that XRPL is enterprise-ready and capable of interacting with financial networks without requiring proprietary systems or closed frameworks.

That’s why Polygon became popular during the last bull market. But this time, in 2025, Polygon has tougher competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. However, Polygon’s Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism.

Over the past six days, the king of crypto saw its volatility curtailed severely. This short-term coiled-up price action could hint at a consolidation phase before the next move.

At press time, Bitcoin had slipped below the mid-range support at $103.3k. This was a sign that it would likely test the range lows. At the same time, the OBV was testing the lows formed on the 9th of May. This was another sign that sellers had the upper hand in the short-term.

A build-up of liquidity was also seen at $102.4k and $100.3k, and these regions were closer to the market price than the $106k level. Combined with the slump in the OBV and the price’s dip below the mid-range level, another Bitcoin drop appeared likely.

However, the price recently rose to a high of $1.56, before hitting a reverse. Despite the current bearish trend, technical indicators still paint a bullish picture for Pi Network’s price action. The token has recently broken above its 50-day moving average.It also surged past its Bollinger Bands, a signal that typically points to increased volatility and strong upward momentum. Despite falling from its earlier high of over $3, the token is steadily regaining ground. On platforms like CoinGecko, Pi Network’s 7-day price performance had climbed an impressive 151%. However, Pi Network is set to unlock 275 million tokens in the next 30 days. On May 15, 12.8 million tokens will be unlocking. Today was a big day for the Pi Network community as the project’s CEO spoke at the Consensus Forum in Canada. For weeks, Pioneers had been looking forward to this event, hoping for big news — especially a major exchange listing. While a listing on top exchanges like Binance didn’t happen, the event still brought some important updates that could help shape the future of the Pi Network. The CEO stressed during the Consensus presentation that Pi Ventures isn’t just about financial investment — it’s about providing startups with direct access to Pi’s sizable user base. With over 19 million users already KYC-verified and active across 200 countries, any startup partnered with Pi Ventures gains immediate exposure to a global, verified audience. This user base advantage, combined with financial backing, gives these startups a competitive edge, fostering a feedback loop of adoption and innovation within the Pi ecosystem.

Another positive aspect is that this initiative is likely to lead to greater clarity in the regulation of crypto assets in Ukraine, as the government will need to more clearly state its position on this issue.” *This is not investment advice.

According to local media , Ukrainian MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak, who also serves as First Deputy Chairman of the Finance Committee, has confirmed plans to introduce the draft bill in parliament soon. “We will soon submit a draft law from the industry allowing the creation of crypto reserves,” Zhelezniak was quoted as saying. While the final version is still being refined, Zhelezniak has clarified that the initiative will focus exclusively on Bitcoin, shifting from earlier mentions of broader crypto reserves. If the bill is passed, Ukraine would become the first European country to establish a state-run Bitcoin reserve. The proposal has drawn interest from Binance, whose regional head for Central and Eastern Europe, Kirill Khomyakov, expressed support for the initiative. Speaking to local media, Khomyakov said the creation of such a reserve would require “significant changes in legislation,” noting that while the process may not be quick, it could bring long-term benefits. “Another positive aspect is that this initiative will likely lead to greater clarity in the regulation of crypto assets in Ukraine, as the government will need to more clearly articulate its position on this issue,” he added.

Similar reserve models are already gaining traction elsewhere. In the United States, Texas lawmakers recently advanced Senate Bill 21, which would allow the state comptroller to invest in digital assets with a market cap above $500 billion. Arizona and New Hampshire have already taken steps in this direction. Arizona’s fund will be sourced from unclaimed digital assets, while New Hampshire has authorized up to 10% of its general fund to be allocated to Bitcoin and similarly capitalized assets. Outside the U.S., there have been talks of establishing Bitcoin reserves in countries such as Taiwan , Brazil , the Czech Republic, Russia , and Sweden. Ukraine’s growing interest in a Bitcoin reserve comes as the country continues to reshape its digital asset framework. In April, the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Finance, Tax and Customs Policy unanimously approved a draft law on virtual assets. However, the bill was later withdrawn from consideration, reportedly at the initiative of the President’s Office. While the draft law’s progress was stalled, regulatory efforts have not. Ukraine’s securities regulator has separately proposed a 23% tax on crypto income, combining personal and military levies.

As Bitcoin ( BTC ) adoption grows, ownership continues to concentrate among larger wallets, leaving retail investors with a shrinking share, per new data from Santiment. As of May 13, wallets holding at least 10 BTC — worth about $1 million or more — controlled over 82% of the total mined Bitcoin supply. As Santiment analysts suggest, only around 17.5% of Bitcoin is held by wallets “holding less than $1 million in BTC.” Wallets with 100 BTC or more — currently valued at over $10 million — now hold more than 60% of the total supply. Santiment noted that the 10-100 BTC group can be broadly classified as “mainly comprised of small institutional investors,” while wallets over 100 BTC are mostly held by “institutionals and liquidity providers (with occasional exceptions of very large retail wallets, of course).” Cohort of wallets holding 10 BTC vs 100 BTC | Source: Santiment Some 3.47 million BTC remain in wallets holding fewer than 10 BTC, worth an estimated $358 billion. Whether this smaller group will continue to hold or sell could depend on future market sentiment, the analysts claim. “Historically, major price retraces tend to instigate retail panic-selling, followed by larger wallets absorbing more of the loose coins that retail is no longer comfortable holding for the long run.” Santiment You might also like: Bitcoin’s declining long-term holder supply shows signs of market top: Glassnode Crypto mining has also become less accessible for individuals due to high costs and lower rewards. On top of that, many crypto miners have fully “embraced eager institutional investors, and often take profit shortly after their successful mining sessions are complete,” the analysts added. Santiment estimates that between 3 million and 4 million Bitcoin “could be gone for good” due to lost private keys or inaccessible wallets, while around 1.14 million coins still remain to be mined until the year 2140.

Follow The Path Of This $8K-to-Millions Investor,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/best-crypto-to-buy-now-follow-the-path-of-this-8k-to-millions-investor,"What if an $8,000 investment could turn into $5.7 billion? That’s not just a dream; it’s the reality of one early crypto investor who bought trillions of Shiba Inu coins in 2020 and saw gains of over 7 million percent. This mind-blowing story has captured the attention of investors worldwide. But what can it teach us about cryptocurrency today? While the meteoric rise of Shiba Inu Coin might seem impossible to replicate, it highlights the ongoing trend of meme coins reshaping the market. The latest meme coin making waves? Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) —a next-generation project blending community hype with cutting-edge AI technology. Here’s a deep-dive into the Shiba Inu success story, the rise of meme coins, and why Dawgz AI might just be the best crypto to buy now. The $8,000-to-$5.7 Billion Shiba Inu Phenomenon Back in August 2020, an anonymous crypto investor made what’s now being called the “greatest individual trade of all time.” They purchased approximately 70 trillion Shiba Inu coins for just $8,000. At the time, Shiba Inu was priced at $0.000000000189. Fast forward 14 months, and the value skyrocketed more than 7 million percent, leaving the investor sitting on a jaw-dropping $5.7 billion fortune. Beyond just being an incredible financial success story, Shiba Inu’s rise also revealed how meme coins could defy expectations and create immense wealth for early adopters. Key Stats: Initial Investment: $8,000 Current Value (Oct. 2021): $5.7 billion Total Return: +7 million percent Shiba Inu wasn’t just a fluke but a sign of how meme coins, fueled by strong communities and viral marketing, could dominate the crypto landscape. But here’s the twist—not all meme coins are the same. This brings us to the next generation of meme coins, like Dawgz AI, that combine fun, community, and real-world use with AI advancements. Meme Coins Need More Than Hype The success of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin underscores one undeniable lesson for crypto investors: hype can drive massive returns.

The government is working on a new law that could let the country officially hold Bitcoin as part of its national reserves. Member of Parliament Yaroslav Zheleznyak says the bill is almost ready. If this happens, Ukraine could join the short list of countries treating Bitcoin like a key financial asset. Ukraine Draft Bitcoin Bill Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zheleznyak has confirmed that a draft bill is being finalized to allow the government to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve. This move is part of a bigger vision to integrate digital assets into national policy and improve Ukraine’s financial preparedness. He first hinted at the idea back in February 2025, but this time, the legislative text is almost ready. The proposal would open the door for Ukraine to legally create crypto reserves, including Bitcoin. While details remain limited, the effort signals Ukraine’s growing interest in placing digital assets at the core of its financial strategy. Ukraine Working On Full Crypto Legalization Alongside the Bitcoin reserve plan, Ukraine is working on a broader crypto regulation bill, which is expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2025. In a statement made back in December, Daniil Getmantsev, head of the Verkhovna Rada’s Tax Committee, revealed that a specialized group is coordinating with the National Bank of Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to shape the new law. The upcoming legislation is set to introduce clear rules for crypto taxation and anti–money laundering procedures. Binance Backs the Idea Kirill Khomyakov, who heads Binance operations in several key regions, including Central and Eastern Europe, has expressed support for Ukraine’s plan. According to him, forming a crypto reserve will require major updates to existing laws. He also noted that these efforts could finally bring clarity to how digital assets are treated under Ukrainian law. Only 4% of the World Owns Bitcoin Globally, only 4% of people own Bitcoin, and Ukrainians are among the early adopters.

The recent Ethereum (ETH) mainnet upgrade brought major performance improvements, marking one of ETH’s strongest rallies in recent years. At the same time, Pi Network (PI) price speculation is rising sharply as traders anticipate a big announcement on May 14, pushing both volume and interest higher. While Ethereum and Pi ride on updates and rumors, BlockDAG (BDAG) is moving on real-time activity. Its Buyer Battles model has added a layer of competition to the presale, driving close to $250 million in funding and over 20.5 coins sold. For those scouting the next big crypto , the trend lines are getting clearer. Ethereum Mainnet Upgrade Renews Interest in ETH The Ethereum (ETH) mainnet upgrade , called Pectra, delivered a 22% surge in price within a day, making it one of ETH’s sharpest increases in years. This upgrade rolled out several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) designed to boost validator performance, reduce transaction costs, and improve the experience for users and developers, especially those building on layer-2 networks. Many market observers suggest this Ethereum (ETH) mainnet upgrade could draw more activity to ETH if these gains prove sustainable under growing demand. With ETH now trading above $2,500, the question for traders is whether this shift in structure could act as a broader trigger for other altcoins. PI Price Builds Momentum as May 14 Announcement Nears Pi Network (PI) price speculation gained momentum following a 17% surge that took PI to $0.7463, fueled by buzz around a key update expected on May 14. The focus now is whether PI can break the much-anticipated $1 milestone. Trading activity rose more than 58%, and technical indicators show a Bollinger Band squeeze, often a prelude to sharp movements. Speculation further intensified after blockchain data showed a substantial number of PI tokens being transferred to an unknown address, prompting speculation about potential exchange listings. Traders are now waiting to see if the May 14 event will confirm such moves or introduce a developer fund. Either way, Pi Network (PI) price speculation continues to draw attention. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles Put It on the Map as a Next Big Crypto Contender BlockDAG (BDAG) has reimagined the presale process by turning it into a competitive event. Every 24 hours, 150 million BDAG coins enter the Buyer Battle arena. Buyers purchase what they can, and any unsold coins go to the biggest spender of the day. This setup has powered the project to almost $250 million raised and more than 20.5 coins sold, earning serious recognition in presale circles. Early participants who bought BDAG at less than a cent are already seeing paper profits of 2,520%. Despite that, new buyers are still engaging because the current pricing remains favorable. At $0.0262, BDAG is offered at nearly half the $0.05 launch price, and the chance to win leftover coins adds to the appeal. For now, the price is fixed at $0.0020 until June 13. Even a leftover pool of just 5 million BDAG could award the top buyer a bonus worth $131K today, with potential value rising to $250K at launch. What sets Buyer Battles apart is how they turn funding into active engagement. It is not just passive holding, it is daily competition, with each round offering strategic decisions and real-time rewards. This format is making BlockDAG a strong candidate for the next big crypto label. Wrapping Up! The recent Ethereum (ETH) mainnet upgrade and the uptick in Pi Network (PI) price speculation have each added a new dynamic to the market. ETH brings improvements to a proven infrastructure, while PI stirs anticipation ahead of a critical update. In contrast, BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles tap into a different appeal, competition, immediate rewards, and daily action. Each cycle presents an opportunity to gain more, a model that’s consistently bringing traders back. With over $246 million raised and 20.5 coins already sold, and with early supporters locking in gains of up to 2,520%, BlockDAG’s format has proven effective. For those actively seeking the next big crypto , BlockDAG might already be delivering what they’re looking for.

The Rockville, Maryland-based company announced the deal on May 14, saying that the move will allow it to expand validator node operations and build recurring revenue from Ether ( ETH ) staking. BTCS CEO Charles Allen said the move follows Strategy’s (formerly MicroStrategy) high-profile Bitcoin ( BTC ) accumulation blueprint and will leverage Ethereum for long-term growth. “We are executing a disciplined strategy to increase our Ethereum exposure and drive recurring revenue through staking and our block building operations,” Allen said. Source: BTCS BTCS issues initial $7.8 million convertible notes As part of the agreement, BTCS issued an initial $7.8 million tranche in convertible notes, with the option to draw an additional $50 million in funding subject to mutual agreement. The notes are convertible to BTCS common stock at a fixed price of $5.85 per share, almost 200% more than the company’s $1.99 stock price on May 13. The notes carry a two-year maturity and a 6% annual interest rate. This means that BTCS has two years to repay the loan if it’s not converted into stock, and that while the notes are active, the company will pay 6% in interest yearly. In simple terms, investors are betting that BTCS stock will rise. In exchange, the company gains access to capital for scaling its Ethereum operations. Investors also received an option to buy 1.9 million shares at $2.75 each for the next five years. This is much higher than the current stock price but lower than the conversion rate stated in the agreement. The financing agreement follows the company’s recent use of the lending protocol Aave to borrow funds to acquire ETH. However, the company did not disclose in the announcement how much ETH it had acquired through the protocol.

The web was not really built with payments in mind, especially not for autonomous agents or machines. But with the rise of AI and decentralized finance (DeFi) , the need for seamless, native digital payments has never been more urgent. Coinbase x402 announced a new open protocol designed to let APIs, apps and AI agents pay instantly using stablecoins like USDC ( USDC ), all via the familiar HTTP protocol. This isn’t just a product update. X402 revives a long-forgotten piece of internet infrastructure and reimagines it for a future powered by agentic systems and crypto. HTTP status codes: A quick refresher Understanding HTTP status codes helps clarify how the web communicates behind the scenes. Here are some key ones to know: HTTP 200 — OK: Standard response for successful HTTP requests. HTTP 401 — Unauthorized: Indicates the request requires user authentication; typically used when credentials are missing or invalid. HTTP 403 — Forbidden: The server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it (often due to lack of permissions or access control). HTTP 404 — Not found: Indicates that the requested resource could not be found. HTTP 402 — Payment required: Originally intended to support digital payments directly within the protocol but left as a “reserved for future use” status code due to the lack of global payment infrastructure at the time. HTTP 500 — Internal server error: A generic error message when the server encounters an unexpected condition. Although the creators of the web imagined a future where online services might request payments directly through the protocol, for decades, no one found a practical use for it. It sat dormant for over 25 years, with no widespread adoption or defined behavior. Today, HTTP 402 is finally coming to life, thanks to Coinbase’s x402 protocol. X402 turns HTTP 402 from a placeholder into a real mechanism. It allows websites, APIs and services to signal that a payment is required before granting access to digital goods or services. Unlike traditional payment systems, which rely on external redirects or complex integrations, x402 enables native, in-protocol payments using stablecoins directly over HTTP. But why do x402 and the activation of HTTP 402 matter? With machine-to-machine interactions, autonomous agents and AI-driven services on the rise, the internet needs a payment layer that is: Instant Programmable Interoperable Trust-minimized. Activating HTTP 402 positions it as a key enabler for decentralized commerce, autonomous agents and crypto-native applications. It could become as foundational as HTTP 200 or 404 in a future where services charge micro-fees, stream value or sell access dynamically. Coinbase x402: A native payment layer for the web Coinbase’s x402 is an open protocol that allows websites and APIs to request and receive payments in stablecoins directly over HTTP. It works by using the existing HTTP infrastructure and augmenting it with a lightweight payment layer. Here is the step-by-step process for machine-to-machine transactions using the x402 protocol: Client requests a paid resource: A client, such as an AI agent, app, or browser initiates a request to an x402-enabled server (e.g., an API, data set or digital service) that requires payment to access. The server responds with a 402 Payment Required: In response, the server returns an HTTP 402 status code, along with the payment details. This includes the amount to be paid, the supported token (such as USDC) and a payment payload or address to use. Client submits the payment: The client uses its crypto wallet to sign and submit the payment. This happens programmatically — no user interaction is needed, which enables fully automated or agentic payments. It resends the original request, this time including the encoded payment information in an X-PAYMENT HTTP header. The payment is verified and settled onchain: A payment facilitator service, such as Coinbase’s x402 Facilitator, checks the blockchain to verify that the payment has been made and confirmed. The server delivers the resource: Once the payment is validated, the server fulfills the request and returns the data or content. It also includes an X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE header confirming the success of the transaction. In x402, payments happen over standard HTTP using two custom headers: X-PAYMENT and X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE. These headers allow seamless, automated payments between apps, agents and servers — without changing how HTTP works. It’s a simple yet powerful way to enable web-native, machine-to-machine commerce using stablecoins. What makes x402 revolutionary is that it doesn’t require platforms, plugins or third-party integrations. It creates a native payment layer for the web itself, just like HTTPS added security or cookies enabled session management. Did you know? HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the foundational protocol used to transfer data on the web. What are agentic payments, and why are they important? As AI systems become more advanced, the agentic era has begun. In this new paradigm, software agents, ranging from AI bots to autonomous scripts, are expected to act on behalf of users or even independently. AI agents will need to perform actions like accessing data, subscribing to services or renting compute power. And all of these tasks often require payments. This is where the concept of agentic payments comes in. These are payments made by agents, not humans — fast, automatic and often low-value. Think of a data-scraping AI paying a cent to read a scientific article or a supply chain bot paying fractions of a dollar for live port data. Traditional payment infrastructure wasn’t built for this kind of use case. It falls short because of the below reasons: Built for humans, not machines. Requires logins, manual steps and batch processing. High fees and slow settlement times make them unsuitable for high-frequency, low-value, autonomous transactions. Because of the limitations of traditional payment systems, agentic payments matter for several key reasons: They enable a machine-first economy, where software can transact just like humans. Make real-time AI decision-making possible by removing friction from access to paid services. Pave the way for composable services, where agents can chain together paid APIs and tools autonomously. As discussed, such payments require machine-readable protocols, instant settlement and predictable pricing, all of which x402 enables. It’s a vital step in building a transactional layer for a machine-first internet. x402 vs. traditional payment systems Today’s online payment systems are deeply human-centric. Whether it’s signing up for a subscription, entering credit card information or passing Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, the current infrastructure assumes a person is at the center of every transaction. This design becomes a bottleneck when payments need to be made automatically, in real time and at scale. APIs that want to monetize often face hurdles like creating user accounts, handling fraud , managing disputes and integrating with centralized processors like Stripe or PayPal. These systems are slow, costly and often region-specific. X402 removes these barriers by allowing servers to ask for and receive payment directly through the protocol itself. There’s no need for logins, billing dashboards or delayed bank transfers. The value transfer is embedded into the fabric of the internet, optimized for agents and apps. The contrast between x402 and traditional payment infrastructure is stark. While x402 is protocol-first, built on crypto rails, systems like Visa, Stripe and PayPal are platform-first. X402 enables payments to settle in seconds using onchain transactions, while traditional rails typically settle over one to three business days. Moreover, x402 supports micropayments as small as fractions of a cent, making it viable for high-frequency, low-cost interactions — something that’s infeasible on credit card networks due to fees. It’s also global by design, requiring no currency conversions or regional banking relationships. Chargebacks, fraud risk and intermediary fees are virtually eliminated, thanks to the immutability of onchain transfers. Where traditional systems focus on human users with front-end interfaces, x402 enables machine-native, backend-to-backend monetization. Did you know? You can detect HTTP 402 responses using tools like Sitechecker Pro, which scans your site like a search bot and flags unusual status codes — including payment-related ones. Incumbents’ act: How Visa, Stripe and PayPal are exploring AI-powered payments To be fair, incumbents aren’t ignoring this trend. Visa, Stripe and PayPal have all acted to be in line with the trend and incorporate appropriate changes in their approach. Visa Visa has announced initiatives to allow AI agents to make purchases on behalf of users by linking them to its global payments network. This move aims to facilitate autonomous AI assistants capable of performing shopping tasks, such as managing routine purchases, based on user-defined budgets and preferences. In partnership with Bridge, a stablecoin infrastructure provider, Visa is launching stablecoin-linked Visa cards across multiple countries in Latin America. This collaboration enables users to make everyday purchases using cryptocurrency tokens, with plans to expand to Europe, Africa and Asia in the coming months. Stripe Stripe has unveiled a new AI foundation model aimed at improving fraud detection and authorization rates. This model, trained on billions of transactions, has significantly increased the detection rate for fraudulent activities, such as card-testing attacks, enhancing the security of its payment systems. Stripe has introduced Stablecoin Financial Accounts , allowing businesses in over 100 countries to hold balances in dollar-backed stablecoins like USDC and USDB. These accounts support global payments and enable firms to manage stablecoins alongside traditional payment methods. PayPal PayPal is set to launch a rewards program offering users a 3.7% annual yield on holdings of its stablecoin , PayPal USD ( PYUSD ), in PayPal or Venmo wallets. This initiative aims to encourage the adoption and utilization of PYUSD for various transactions, including merchant payments and peer-to-peer transfers. PayPal has expanded its partnership with Coinbase to increase the adoption and utilization of PYUSD. This collaboration focuses on developing stablecoin-based payments and banking solutions, as well as exploring other use cases for PYUSD in DeFi and onchain platforms. Protocols vs. platforms: The distinct approaches While Visa, Stripe and PayPal are making significant strides in integrating AI and stablecoins into their services, these companies still operate within walled gardens. They offer services, not protocols. Their infrastructures are: Centralized: Governed by corporate policies and APIs. Permissioned: Access requires onboarding, KYC and platform approval. Closed ecosystems: Where user experience and interoperability are tightly controlled. In contrast, x402 is permissionless and open, allowing any developer to plug into it without needing a merchant account. And the distinction between centralized services and open protocols like x402 will play a crucial role in shaping the future landscape of digital payments, potentially leading to a more decentralized and agent-driven economy. What is x402’s monetization model? One of the most practical use cases for x402 is API monetization. In today’s model, developers must create keys, handle access tiers, and enforce rate limits manually. With x402, APIs can simply respond to unauthenticated requests with a 402, indicating a cost, for example, $0.001 to access a data endpoint. A client can then send the required stablecoin payment and receive the response instantly. This turns APIs into microservices with embedded pricing, enabling fine-grained monetization at the level of individual function calls. It’s a model that fits naturally with both AI workloads and human developers who want to pay only for what they use. Stablecoins like USDC are central to the success of x402 and agentic payments more broadly. Their key benefit is price stability, allowing developers and agents to transact in predictable units without worrying about crypto volatility. That’s critical for applications that operate with tight budgets or usage-based pricing. USDC also offers fast finality, especially on chains like Base, Solana and Ethereum layer 2s , where transfers can confirm in seconds with minimal fees. Its broad support across wallets , APIs and ecosystems makes it a practical choice for integration. Other stablecoins like PYUSD or EURC may become relevant, but USDC’s dominance in DeFi and institutional finance gives it a clear head start. Challenges and opportunities for agentic payments Agentic payments raise important questions around security, like how can bots manage private keys safely? There’s also the issue of abuse — will bad actors flood servers with fake payments or exploit pricing models? Regulatory concerns also loom. But the upside is enormous. The emergence of a machine-to-machine economy has led to a situation where agents transact for data, compute, bandwidth and services without human input. Protocols like x402 are the rails that will power this fast, open and crypto-native economy. Coinbase’s x402 is more than a technical upgrade; it’s a new payment primitive for the programmable web. By bringing crypto payments over HTTP to AI agents and APIs, x402 transforms how the internet handles value. It opens the door to a future where transactions are embedded, automatic and driven by machines, not just people. As the digital economy evolves, protocols like x402 could become the foundation of the new internet, powered by a new-age financial infrastructure.",Coinbase|Crypto payments|AI|http|API,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|USDC|PYUSD,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-15 09:02:00

Mills was accused, in a May 14 Illinois court filing, of stealing at least $3 million and of failing to supply promised equity dividends to key participants and investors. The lawsuit, filed by multiple plaintiffs, claims that Mills led them to transfer assets of the project to a company he owned — Satoshi Labs LLC, formerly Proof of Work Labs. The plaintiffs accuse Mills of committing fraud and breach of fiduciary duty, and they are seeking full legal recovery. $1.46 Million Raised, Zero Returns The plaintiffs assert that they collectively made $1.46 million in two NFT drops on the Solana and Bitcoin blockchains in anticipation of a fair return on their investment. However, they allege they were left with nothing since Mills maintained control over funds and assets. The suit also has allegations that Mills ghosted the plaintiffs and created a shareholder agreement awarding himself 67% company equity. Other contributors, who had invested up to $20,000, were allegedly offered only 2% stakes. A Deceptive Beginning and Disappeared Promises The Hashling NFT project is said to have originated from an earlier concept that Mills and one of the plaintiffs, Dustin Steerman, discussed. Although he had no knowledge of working with NFTs and had no funds, Mills was ushered into the project because he was excited about it and wanted to assist initially. Eventually, Steerman and Mills contracted others to take care of everything from social media and NFT art to grass-roots marketing at NFT conferences. Mills even brought in his girlfriend to invest, the complaint alleges. Legal Action and Requests for Compensation Not only is the plaintiff seeking damages for fraud and fiduciary breaches, but also for the imposition of a constructive trust on all assets of the NFT and mining businesses.

Swiss digital crypto-friendly bank Sygnum has added staked Solana ( SOL ) to its portfolio of tokens eligible as collateral for Lombard loans, allowing clients to access fiat liquidity while continuing to earn staking rewards. In a Thursday blog announcement , the Swiss bank said the new feature applies to loans in Swiss francs, euros, Singapore dollars, and U.S. dollars. The new update allows Sygnum clients to unlock liquidity from their staked Solana holdings while continuing to earn staking rewards, creating “dual-income potential from a single crypto asset,” the bank said. Sygnum also noted that Lombard loans that pledge staked SOL as collateral are “low-cost because the generated staking rewards are used to cover the majority of the fees.” You might also like: Swiss crypto bank Sygnum adds Deribit into off-exchange custody platform The move comes as Sygnum’s lending business has seen significant growth as its loan volume doubled over the past 12 months, the press release reads.

In a recent interview , the Block’s Head of Growth, Tim Copeland, asked the crypto wallet’s co-founder Dan Finlay if the company was still planning to launch a native token sometime in the future. Finlay simply replied to the question with “maybe.” When asked for more details, Finlay said that there’s still a lot of speculation surrounding whether the company will launch a token or not. It has been hinting at a token launch since as early 2021. At the time, MetaMask engineer Erik Marks prompted the idea of community ownership of the wallet through a token launch, which was followed by a post from ConsenSys CEO Joseph Lubin saying a “Wen $MASK?” Although there does not seem to be any concrete plan about a token launch, Finlay did reveal that if the MetaMask team were to launch a token, it would be linked directly to the user’s digital wallet. “You’ll be able to find a link directly in the wallet. You will not find some account on social media that you’ve never heard of giving you a link,” said Finlay in the interview. He said information about a native token launch from MetaMask would not be distributed to users through email or a text message. Instead, it will be announced through official channels. You might also like: Consensys establishes a Swiss non-profit to support Linea decentralization “It will be in the wallet, it will be on our main website. Use the channels you already know to find communications from us,” Finlay continued. Moreover, Finlay cited the shifting regulatory regime in the U.S. under the more crypto-friendly Trump administration provides more “safety for far more kinds of token launches.” “Hopefully people take this opportunity to push the boundaries and establish precedence for things that we can all be doing,” said Finlay. In early March, MetaMask published a notice, warning users about accounts promoting fake MetaMask tokens. The platform clarified that claims suggesting the existence of a MetaMask token are false and potentially harmful. Back in 2023, it issued a similar notice debunking rumors of an official token airdrop linked to the platform.

According to Coindesk, Hoskinson announced that NIGHT governance tokens and DUST privacy transaction tokens will be distributed to approximately 37 million users on 8 major blockchains. Cardano’s privacy sidechain Midnight will airdrop NIGHT and DUST to 37 million wallets across 8 blockchains, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), ADA, XRP, Solana (SOL), BSC, AVAX, and POL, excluding VCs. In a notable move, unlike most airdrops, nothing will be given to venture capitalists (VCs) this time around. Hoskinson made it clear that no venture capital firms will be involved in the airdrop process. Instead, the entire airdrop will go only to retail users, who will be free to hold or trade the tokens. This means that both NIGHT and DUST tokens will only be issued to retail users. Midnight is currently on testnet, with a mainnet launch expected in late 2025. How Does Midnight Work? Midnight is not just about privacy. It offers a new economic model that allows developers from different blockchain ecosystems to securely interact on the blockchain without the need for token conversion. Developers can pay network fees in their native tokens, such as ETH, SOL, or BTC, as this model is reportedly designed to encourage collaboration across ecosystems rather than competition. *This is not investment advice.

The news television network France 24 reports that four masked men attacked a couple and their child in broad daylight in Paris on Tuesday. Video footage shows that three of the perpetrators jumped out of a white delivery van to force the woman and her child into the vehicle. They also beat the woman’s partner, who tried to intervene. But the woman, the daughter of France-based crypto exchange platform Paymium CEO and co-founder Pierre Noizat, resisted. She grabbed one of the attackers’ handguns and threw it away. The commotion caught the attention of passersby who tried to help, including one man who brought out a fire extinguisher. The attackers eventually ended up fleeing in their waiting vehicle. The victims sustained injuries and were taken to the hospital. The attack follows a series of incidents targeting crypto entrepreneurs in France. In January, kidnappers abducted crypto wallet firm Ledger co-founder David Balland and his wife and demanded a large ransom in cryptocurrency. The police managed to rescue the couple and the suspects, including the alleged mastermind, are now detained. Last month, masked men also kidnapped the father of a crypto millionaire in the French capital and demanded ransom. The police were able to locate the place of detention and freed the man during a raid.

Joao Wedson, CEO and founder of crypto data analysis platform Alphractal, expects a full-blown alt season to unfold in June. Bitcoin's dominance rate, which measures the leading cryptocurrency's share of the total digital assets market, has dropped from roughly 65% to 62% in one week, ending a prolonged five-month uptrend, according to data source TradingView. During the same time, the total crypto market capitalization has increased from $2.90 trillion to $3.24 trillion. The contrast suggests a shift in investor interest from bitcoin toward alternative cryptocurrencies. Per Wedson, the altcoin season is already underway and the BTC dominance is expected to decline rapidly in the coming months. Wedson's proprietary altcoin season index, which focuses on select 57 altcoins, shows 37 of those coins have outperformed BTC in the past 60 days. ""Even if BTC drops in the coming weeks, most altcoins have already bottomed out, and it’s unlikely they’ll fall below recent price levels. Part of bitcoin’s $2 trillion market cap is likely to flow into altcoins. So make sure to analyze your altcoin against BTC pairs (e.g., ETH/BTC or COTI/BTC),"" Wedson said on a detailed post on X. However, broader measures suggest the bull market has yet to expand beyond BTC. For instance, CoinMarketCap's altcoin index , which focuses on top 100 coins, remains stuck at 27 to suggest ""bitcoin season.""",Markets|Bitcoin|Altcoins|Markets|market analysis|Top Stories|News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-15 09:19:09

The timing aligns with Coinbase’s upcoming inclusion in the S&P 500, which fueled a 50% stock surge over the past month. Meanwhile, crypto VC funding dynamics are shifting. Although deal volume dropped by 40% year-over-year in Q1 of 2025, total investment more than doubled to $6 billion. Most capital went to infrastructure and financial service firms. However, some startups may be missing out on funding due to inflated valuations, according to 10T Holdings' Dan Tapeiro. Coinbase Acquisition Strategy Gains Momentum Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong recently reaffirmed the company’s intention to continue pursuing merger and acquisition (M&A) opportunities after its landmark $2.9 billion deal to acquire Deribit. In an interview with Bloomberg Television on May 14, Armstrong explained that the company is more than ready to deploy its financial resources toward strategic acquisitions. He explained that Coinbase ended the first quarter with $9.9 billion in US dollar resources, which means that it has a very strong balance sheet that gives the firm a lot of flexibility. “We are always looking at M&A opportunities,” Armstrong said, though he stressed that the company is still very selective: “We want it to be the right opportunity.” The acquisition of Deribit involved $700 million in cash and 11 million Coinbase shares, and is the largest in the crypto industry to date. It was also Coinbase's entry into the lucrative crypto derivatives market, a move seen as critical to its ongoing global expansion. Armstrong indicated that the company is focused on international targets, especially companies that align with Coinbase’s mission and are capable of accelerating product development and growth. However, when asked specifically about rumors surrounding a possible acquisition of stablecoin issuer Circle, Armstrong declined to comment by stating that there was “nothing to announce.” Circle isa key Coinbase partner, and recently filed to go public. It was also previously the target of a $5 billion bid from Ripple, which was ultimately rejected . Coinbase’s bold acquisition strategy comes as the company prepares to become the first crypto-native firm to join the prestigious S&P 500 index on May 19. The inclusion is expected to help broaden Coinbase's investor base and increase exposure to passive investment funds that track the benchmark index. Coinbase share price over the past month (Source: Google Finance ) The company’s stock surged 2.5% in after-hours trading to $263. COIN shares climbed by over 30% since the start of May and nearly 50% over the past month, buoyed by the Deribit deal and the upcoming S&P 500 listing. Fewer Crypto Deals But More Money in Q1 2025 Venture capital activity in the crypto sector saw a big shift in the first quarter of 2025, according to PitchBook’s latest Crypto VC Trends report . While the number of deals declined quite a bit compared to a year ago, the overall value of those deals surged. This could mean that there is renewed confidence in core crypto infrastructure. The report was released on May 14, and it revealed that 405 deals were made during the quarter, down nearly 40% from the 670 that were recorded in Q1 of 2024. However, it was still an increase from the 372 deals seen in Q4 of 2024. Despite the drop in deal volume, the total capital invested more than doubled year-over-year, hitting $6 billion in Q1 2025 compared to just $2.6 billion in the same quarter last year. This also represented a steep climb from $3 billion in Q4. PitchBook’s senior crypto research analyst, Robert Le, said that despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, investors continued to allocate funds toward the foundational elements of the crypto ecosystem. VC funding by segment (Source: PitchBook ) A large portion of the funding—almost $2.55 billion—was concentrated in just 16 deals involving crypto asset managers, exchanges, and financial services firms. Crypto infrastructure and development companies followed, and raised close to $955 million across 30 deals. Looking forward, Le specifically pointed to Circle’s upcoming IPO as a pivotal moment for the industry. He argued that its valuation could set a benchmark for future exits and help restore confidence in late-stage crypto equity. A valuation exceeding the estimated $4 to $5 billion range could attract more capital and elevate valuations across payment and infrastructure segments. Circle has raised $1.18 billion in venture funding so far, and PitchBook estimates a 64% probability it will eventually go public. Stablecoins also stood out in Q1, with their market cap growing from $202.3 billion to $227.1 billion. This happened even after the broader crypto markets remained flat or declined. Le said that dollar-based settlement continues to be crypto’s standout use case. He expects increased investment in startups focused on payment, remittance, and treasury management that benefit from stablecoin transaction flows. Finally, the $1.4 billion Bybit exploit in February, which was the largest in crypto history , is likely to drive more demand for tools like real-time proof-of-reserve systems, improved custody technologies, and simplified key management solutions. Le suggested that startups operating in these areas may find a more welcoming funding environment. Crypto Startups Overprice Themselves Out of VC Deals Despite the fact that the value of crypto VC deals are going up, crypto startups may still be missing out on critical funding opportunities by seeking unrealistically high valuations. This is according to Dan Tapeiro, CEO of 10T Holdings. Dan Tapeiro at the Consensus conference At the Consensus conference in Toronto on May 14, Tapeiro criticized founders for trying to raise capital at valuations between 50 to 80 times their revenue, a multiple he says is unsustainable for venture capital firms trying to generate returns for their investors. He explained that even when 10T Holdings is impressed by a project, they will pass if the valuation is unreasonable from the outset. So far, this approach led the firm to reject more than 200 potential investments, including high-profile names like FTX, BlockFi, and Celsius. Tapeiro explained that his firm looks for crypto companies with valuations of at least $400 million to $500 million but insists that a reasonable valuation-to-revenue ratio—ideally no higher than 10x—is critical for long-term success. He added that realistic valuations not only improve the potential upside but also ease follow-on fundraising and simplify eventual exits. Despite these concerns, PitchBooks’s report indicated that the broader venture capital environment seems healthy. Also on the panel was Dan Morehead, CEO of Pantera Capital, who offered a different view. He suggested that investors should aim for a balanced mix of equity and tokens when backing crypto startups. According to Morehead, different market cycles cause tokens and equity to alternate in value, making diversification a strategic advantage.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-15 09:30:00

Amidst a wave of optimism regarding global trade and the implementation of Pectra upgrade, the market movement of Ethereum signals improved days ahead. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , meanwhile, is shining in this rally with its phase 4 presale at $0.025 per token. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has raised $8,100,000 and distributed over 460 million tokens held by 9,800 holders. The protocol provides a possible selling gain of 140% when listed at $0.06 and forecast estimate it could rise to 16,550% (which is $4.15) in the year 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) becomes an equally attractive proposal for investors, thanks to Ethereum’s fast growth. Ethereum’s Resurgent Climb A period of re-gained trust of traders regards Ethereum. The fact that it has a 30% weekly performance, and it has a market capitalization of $286.19 billion, shows a lot of investors excitement. The outcome of the Pectra upgrade has led to improved transaction speeds bestowing on Ethereum a desirable anchor status for the decentralized financial services. Assuring moves in international trade like US and UK example have reduced the fears, caused by tariffs and increased the price of Ethereum. Latest 24-hour trading stood at $39.44 billion with active market movements. With Ethereum pricing-in a floor above $2,393, Market commentators expect a jump to a $3,500, based on institutional investment and token burning. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Is Experiencing Surge of Demand Mutuum Finance’s phase 4 presale is attracting strong participation now at 75% fill with tokens at $0.025 each. With the prices raised from $0.01 during phase 1, this stage gives investors an opportunity to purchase tokens ahead of the 20% jump to $0.03 in phase 5. Once the tokens list at $0.06, tokenomics will guarantee a 140% profit. Market analysts predict Mutuum Finance to be at $4.15 after launch in 2025 representing an incredible rate of return of 16,550%. MUTM team have launched a dashboard to celebrate top investors which record the 50 biggest token holders with bonus for maintaining their positions, thus adding excitement for investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Lending Strategies. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is bringing its decentralized lending platform to market. Users can hold assets including the ETH, and earn interest by depositing it to generate mtTokens, whose value grows with time. Overcollateralized assets are a prerequisite for acquiring funds for borrowers ensuring the stability of the platform. Revenue raised on the platform is allocated to pay MUTM token purchases, both rewarding stakers and increasing overall demand. Certik is currently going through Mutuum Finance’s smart contract code, with a very detailed report to be posted on social media to improve transparency. The strength in this system makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shine amongst notable projects throughout the thriving decentralized finance of Ethereum. Capitalizing on Dual Opportunities The momentum about Ethereum makes investors scoop up the currency when it corrects, as price predictions go as high as $3,500. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) comes out as a clear winner among the surrounding Ethereum market trends. Since 75% of phase 4 presale has been sold, a fast response to grab tokens before the price rises to $0.03 during phase 5, is recommended. The promise of post-launch value at $4.15 adds a very strong value addition to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) making it a must for a significant 16,550% return.

In a letter sent to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, top Democrats from three powerful House committees requested all suspicious activity reports (SARs) related to Trump’s cryptocurrency ventures, Elon Musk’s PAC, and the GOP’s WinRed fundraising platform. Lawmakers seek review of Trump coin’s foreign funding and token control President Donald Trump, through World Liberty Financial (WLFI), launched the $TRUMP meme coin earlier this year. He promoted it on his social media accounts and at campaign events, which led to a surge in the coin’s price and attracted thousands of investors. However, lawmakers are growing more concerned because over 80% of the token’s total supply exists in digital wallets that Trump and his allies control. This means they can manipulate the price and supply to benefit themselves at the expense of ordinary investments that lack inside information or control. Lawmakers further noted that the earliest investors in the $TRUMP meme coin made millions of dollars selling their tokens at peak prices before the market crashed, leaving regular investors who bought later to suffer huge losses. The letter also highlights USD1, a proposed new stablecoin that plans to raise $2 billion through a Binance deal, a global cryptocurrency exchange, and MGX Capital (controls 90% of the token’s ownership). This proposal raises constitutional concerns because heavy foreign ownership could violate the Emoluments Clause of the American Constitution, which forbids U.S. government officials from accepting gifts or financial benefits from foreign government entities in ways that could influence elections or policy decisions. In short, USD1 could potentially open doors for foreign governments or investors to hold undue influence on the U.S. political and financial systems. To that end, lawmakers want the Treasury to review suspicious activity reports connected to World Liberty Financial and its digital wallets to trace the source and movement of funds, verify the true owners behind these wallets, and ensure that the entire operation complies fully with U.S laws to prevent money laundering, foreign interference, and other financial crimes. Democrats raise red flags over Musk’s PAC spending and GOP’s WinRed platform Elon Musk’s America PAC spent over $250 million on political campaign advertisements, voter giveaways, and messaging that strongly supports Republican candidates across multiple races, forcing Democratic lawmakers to send a formal letter demanding a thorough investigation into it. Lawmakers suggest that this large-scale spending could have influenced the elections in ways that don’t comply with existing campaign finance laws and question whether the America PAC coordinated its spending and messaging directly with GOP candidates’ campaigns or if it hid the identities of its donors. The letter cited public examples that show that Musk’s America PAC incentivized voters with prizes and held aggressive outreach through social media, which lawmakers warn crossed legal lines by “paying” or bribing voters to support specific candidates. In addition to concerns about Musk’s PAC, lawmakers stress that the Treasury must investigate WinRed, the dominant online fundraising platform the Republican Party uses to collect millions of dollars in donations, to confirm whether it verified the identity of donors, screened out legal or foreign contributions, and ensured all funds processed comply with U.S campaign finance laws. The Democrats were specific about the possibility of improper connections between the activities of Musk’s America PAC and public endorsements or promotional events involving Musk’s companies like Tesla. Lawmakers requested that Treasurey’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) review the SARs related to Elon Musk’s America PAC, the GOP’s WinRed platform, and other associated entities to support their review, and trace true suspicious financial flaws, uncover any hidden or unlawful donations, and ensure full compliance with the law.

Starting this week at a loss, it currently appears weak as it undergoes a pullback. Last week saw Brett through its highest price level in three months after five weeks of recovery. This recovery was triggered by a steady increase in the demand level after reaching an extremely oversold condition during the bearish corrective phase in the first quarter of the year. However, the $0.091 level stopped the bulls and the crypto entered this week on a sell mode. Losing roughly 20% since the start of the week, it now appears weak on a daily, although there’s still hope for the bulls. Looking at the latest drop, which looks more like a pullback of the last leg up, we can expect a rebound anytime soon. If that comes into play, we should anticipate a massive price movement above the $0.1 level For a rebound, the $0.05 level is a key pivot line to keep in mind. If this level fails to contain selling, we may see more drawdown until it finds a solid ground for a major rebound. Losing April’s low in the process may activate a bearish move in the long-term. Technically, there’s still room for more growth as the market is still surrounded by positive sentiments. BRETT’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview In the latest drop, the $0.0585 level is the nearest support to watch for a test. The next level to watch for drops would be $0.042 and $0.0313. A rebound above the previous $0.091 resistance should trigger a rally to $0.124. Pushing through this price level could send the price back to the yearly high of $0.159.

Lawmakers are reportedly working on a Bitcoin ( BTC ) national reserve proposal, with a draft bill in its final stages, according to Yaroslav Zhelezniak, a member of parliament who confirmed the plan to local media outlet Incrypted. The proposal was announced during the CRYPTO 2025 conference in Kyiv on Feb. 6. “We will soon submit a draft law from the industry allowing the creation of crypto reserves,” Zhelezniak said. Cointelegraph reached out to Zhelezniak for comment on the bill’s status but had not received a response by publication.

On March 7, Trump signed an executive order to establish a national Bitcoin reserve seeded with BTC confiscated from criminal cases.

Related: Satoshi Nakamoto turns 50 as Bitcoin becomes US reserve asset Legal challenges may delay adoption While Ukraine’s push for a national Bitcoin reserve marks a potentially historic shift in crypto policy, it may require “significant legal change,” according to Kyrylo Khomiakov, regional head of CEE, Central Asia and Africa, at crypto exchange Binance. “We commend Ukraine’s ambition to establish a strategic crypto reserve,” he told Cointelegraph. “Implementing such a reserve would necessitate significant legal changes, indicating that this process will not be swift.” He added, “Another positive aspect is that this initiative will likely lead to greater regulatory clarity in Ukraine, as the government will need to articulate its stance more clearly.” Ukraine was reportedly planning to legalize cryptocurrencies in early 2025 with the finalization of a draft bill in coordination with the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), according to Daniil Getmantsev, head of the tax committee of the Verkhovna Rada. On April 8, Ukraine’s financial regulator proposed taxing certain crypto transactions as personal income with a rate of up to 23%, excluding crypto-to-crypto transactions and stablecoins. Not all voices in Ukraine’s crypto industry are optimistic about the timing of the proposal. ” The country is broke. More than 50% of the budget is in grants and loans from the European Union,” said Michael Chobanian, the founder of Ukraine-based Kuna exchange. “The population is decreasing at the fastest rate in the world. Men are kidnapped and sent to the army against their will.” “What kind of BTC reserves are we talking about here? This is done only to divert your attention,” Chobanian claimed.

DOGE 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold Although the latest move was downward, DOGE’s performance remains primarily driven by the wider cryptocurrency market positivity and regulatory developments such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledgment of 21Shares’ updated filing for a spot Dogecoin exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). With retail interest surging, the odds of regulatory approval rising, and volatility soaring, Finbold consulted ChatGPT-4o about where the popular meme coin is likely to stand on June 1, 2025. ChatGPT sets DOGE price target for June 1, 2025 The artificial intelligence (AI) platform was swift to zero in on the staggering rise in Dogecoin addresses, given they skyrocketed from 74,640 to 469,477, together with the meme coin’s price. The soar in DOGE network activity has been ongoing for days. For example, prominent on-chain analyst Ali Martinez noted a rapid rise to 127,570 active addresses already on the morning of May 14. Based on the information ChatGPT retrieved, the platform concluded that the daily rise was likely driven by and, at the very least, coincided with the SEC acknowledging the spot ETF filing. Although it focused on the May 13 activity as mostly positive, the AI noted that DOGE open interest – the measure of all active positions in a specific contract – surged to approximately $3 billion, helping generate volatility and possibly leading to the downward pressure observable by May 15. ChatGPT outlines the bullish and bearish pressures on DOGE price. Source: Finbold & ChatGPT-4o ChatGPT also examined technical factors such as Dogecoin’s relative strength index ( RSI ), which it said indicates neutrality with a reading of 47.6. The popular ‘Fear & Greed Index’—an index that gauges investor confidence in the strength of the market—however, tells a more bullish story and stands at 73, firmly in the ‘Greed’ territory. ChatGPT sets June 1, 2025 DOGE price target. Source: Finbold & ChatGPT-4o AI explains why DOGE is likely to mostly trade sideways by June 1, 2025 When challenged that its prediction means that DOGE will stay mostly level by June 1, 2025, ChatGPT retorted that investors are overwhelmingly bullish on the one hand, but the meme coin continues being driven by hype, and the hype from the ETF has already been priced in with the latest upsurge. The AI did acknowledge that a handful of factors could drive Dogecoin further up, naming a possible broader ‘melt-up,’ a sooner-than-expected spot fund approval, or the billionaire Elon Musk posting ‘something stupid again’ on X . ChatGPT reveals what could make DOGE go parabolic by June 1, 2025. Source: Finbold & ChatGPT-4o Technical analysis contradicts ChatGPT’s cautious bullishness External technical analysis only partially backs ChatGPT’s assessment. The RSI has risen to 69.42, moving Dogecoin from ‘neutral’ to ‘overbought’—thus signalling a ‘sell’ recommendation. Similarly, not rounding DOGE’s price reveals that the cryptocurrency is trading dangerously close to its nearest support of $0.225542 and at $0.22621. The closest resistance level of $0.242749 has, however, already been tested and rejected on May 10, 12, and 14, increasing the odds of a deeper bearish turn.

Institutional focus shifts to Ethereum’s Layer 2 and RWA adoption for digital finance. Hedge funds unwind ETH shorts as blockchain utility regains investor confidence. Ethereum (ETH) has recovered 56% over the past month, reaching $2,565.95 at the time of writing on May 15, 2025. This renewed growth for Ethereum, following months where it lagged Bitcoin and newer Layer 1 competitors, points to shifts in institutional strategy, emerging blockchain technology use cases, and a broader market move away from single-asset dominance.

In a first for Bahrain – and the entire Middle East – Al Abraaj Restaurants Group has taken a giant leap by becoming the region’s first publicly listed company to hold Bitcoin as part of its treasury reserves. This is as clear a sign as any that Bitcoin is moving from something people watch nervously to something companies are actively embracing in the Gulf. After all, when a fully regulated, publicly traded firm makes this move, it changes how everyone looks at crypto in the region. Here are the deets. It’s Not a Trend: What This Means for Crypto in Bahrain Bitcoin treasury adoption has been mostly a Western story, with companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla leading the way . Now, Al Abraaj is showing the Middle East wants in on the action. It’s a great move to hedge against inflation and future financial uncertainties. For a company in the food sector to do this in Bahrain, a country working hard to be a tech-friendly hub, it’s a clear signal the region’s mindset on crypto is evolving. Big shoutout to the legend Michael @saylor — your laser-eyed conviction lit the path. Al Abraaj just became the first public company in the Middle East to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy. We’re stacking sats for real. @davidfbailey @10xcapitalusa @bitcoinmagazine … pic.twitter.com/dhfq2ctnBM — AlAbraaj Restaurants Group (@AbraajRestGroup) May 14, 2025 What Could This Mean for the Gulf? Here’s my take: this move might be the first domino to fall. It could encourage more firms in the Gulf to rethink their treasury strategies and consider digital assets seriously. This is exactly the kind of shift that could bring crypto deeper into the mainstream here. Let’s hope the government takes note and endorses the move. That would make for a great 2025, wouldn’t it? .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump To Sign Crypto Laws By August, Says Bo Hines , Joining the Global Bitcoin Treasury Club We’ve seen big countries like U.S, China, UK build significant Bitcoin stockpiles.

Altcoins Crash After Massive Profit-Taking,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-crypto-market-is-down-today-altcoins-crash-after-massive-profit-taking/,"The post Why Crypto Market is Down Today? Altcoins Crash After Massive Profit-Taking appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After a strong week-long surge, the crypto market has entered a cooling phase. Major altcoins like Dogecoin, Cardano, and Solana have dropped over 5% in the past 24 hours as investors chose to lock in recent gains. The broader sentiment remains cautious as traders await fresh catalysts. Profit-Taking Hits Major Altcoins The latest dip in prices comes after a macro-driven rally last week that pushed Bitcoin to nearly $104,000 and Ethereum to $2,700. But both hit resistance at key levels, prompting traders to step back. Solana, Cardano, and Dogecoin saw notable declines, following the lead of large-cap assets as momentum slowed. According to FxPro analyst Alex Kuptsikevich , Bitcoin is struggling to break past its December-January highs, while Ethereum is showing signs of a possible correction toward $2,400 after gaining 55% in just a week . Overheated Market? Sentiment indicators are now flashing caution. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has dropped to 71 from 74, a level that typically signals excessive bullishness and potential overbought conditions. Analysts suggest the market may need to cool down before making the next move, especially after last week’s bullish run was largely driven by external events. The rally had been sparked by a combination of lower-than-expected U.S. inflation data, strong earnings from China’s tech sector, and a breakthrough in U.S.–China trade relations . While those factors gave markets a boost, crypto prices have now begun to stabilize as traders reassess risk.

According to Santiment , Bitcoin’s largest holders, wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC, have accumulated over 83,000 BTC in the past month, signaling strong confidence in further upside. In contrast, small retail investors holding less than 0.1 BTC have offloaded 387 BTC, likely locking in profits amid fears of a market top. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bahrain’s Al Abraaj Adds Bitcoin to Reserves in Historic First , Coinbase S&P 500 Listing Could Be Next Boost Looking ahead, all eyes are on Coinbase’s inclusion in the S&P 500 on May 19.

But as the broader crypto market matures, investors are increasingly seeking assets with real-world utility and tangible growth prospects. Enter VeChain (VET), JasmyCoin (JASMY), and Remittix (RTX) , three under-the-radar cryptocurrencies that are not only gaining momentum but also showing signs of outpacing DOGE in the race toward the coveted $1 mark. Let’s examine each of them and why you should have them in your portfolio. Dogecoin at a crossroads: Will it break through $0.25 or fall back again? Dogecoin (DOGE) has been hovering just below the $0.25 resistance zone for the past three days, prompting traders to question whether a breakout is brewing—or if another rejection is on the cards. This level has historically acted as a ceiling for DOGE, with the last test triggering a sharp sell-off. With the current pattern mirroring past setups, many are bracing for either a decisive move up or a repeat of history. Source: Trading View Technical analysts are watching $0.22 as a critical support level. A daily close below it could usher in renewed bearish momentum. On the flip side, a breakout above $0.255 might trigger a mini-rally toward $0.30—a potential 20% gain. The next few candles could determine whether DOGE remains stalled or roars back to life. VeChain’s roadmap: From fear to future growth, will it hit $0.11 by 2027? VeChain (VET) has gained 37.62% in the past 30 days, with predictions suggesting a potential rise to $0.0679 by May 2025. Despite the current extreme fear in the market (Fear & Greed Index: 26.79), technical indicators remain bullish, showing promising short-term recovery. VeChain Price Prediction – Forecasts from year 2025 to 2034 Nonetheless, VeChain is still trading below its 200-day and 50-day simple moving averages, so be careful. In the long term, the VeChain is set to trade at $0.11 by the end of 2027, representing a 214.76% growth. Notwithstanding the mixed feelings, the technical signals of VeChain indicate its future growth, making it a good buy for long-term investors. JasmyCoin’s bullish flag pattern sets the stage for potential gains JasmyCoin (JASMY) has gone from a low of $0.00817 in April to its current level of $0.019, and recently tested the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.021. The token is currently building a bullish flag pattern and is about to make a mini-golden cross. With the momentum indicators such as the ADX above 30 and the MACD crossing into positive territory, the next important target for JASMY may be $0.03340, 75% higher than the current price. However, a fall below $0.015 will nullify this bullish outlook. JASMY price chart | Source: TradingView JasmyCoin’s growth could also benefit from Bitcoin’s ongoing surge and improving US-China trade relations. Additionally, as the Internet of Things (IoT) market expands, JasmyCoin stands to gain from rising demand in this sector. Remittix is disrupting cross-border payments with blockchain innovation Remittix is focusing on the $250+ trillion cross-border payments market by connecting traditional banking and blockchain technology. In contrast to such platforms as Stripe, Wise, and Coinbase, Remittix allows for easy crypto-to-fiat remittances, directly connecting with local payment networks to provide faster and more efficient payouts. Remittix promotes financial inclusion by providing crypto wallets to the 1.4 billion unbanked individuals, operating without banking restrictions or geographic barriers. The platform ensures complete security and autonomy for users, with no third-party custodians and immutable blockchain records. Additionally, Remittix supports microtransactions and cross-border e-commerce. This makes it adaptable to various decentralized applications and payment systems, enhancing its reach and functionality. Conclusion Dogecoin may still grab headlines, but utility-focused tokens like VeChain, JasmyCoin, and Remittix are quietly rising. As DOGE flirts with key resistance, these emerging contenders offer real-world use cases and long-term growth potential. For investors seeking more than meme momentum, the shift toward utility could define crypto’s next breakout winners.

Ethereum’s ( ETH ) dominance as the foundational layer faces a nuanced challenge. While it focuses on making its underlying tech better and faster, other networks, primarily Solana ( SOL ) in this case, have seen a huge growth in the number of apps people can use. This makes us wonder whether Ethereum’s current way of doing things is helping or hurting its ability to attract and keep the people who build these apps. You might also like: The Ethereum paradox: Too big to fail or too slow to matter? | Opinion New app ideas face many tough questions and are scrutinized and challenged by the ‘ecosystem police’—vocal members and influential figures within the Ethereum community who often raise fundamental and philosophical concerns. This makes it less appealing for people to experiment with new ideas on Ethereum than in places that are more open to trying new things. Thus, talented builders choose the cabal that welcomes them with open arms, benefiting the ecosystem and building a positive environment for builders. Letting all kinds of ideas grow and stop policing Ethereum’s community and leadership need to be more open to ingenuity and crazy ideas, even those that might seem risky or just for fun. Not every new project needs to be a world-changing infrastructure or technology. Sometimes, the apps that attract a lot of users are the ones that are more experimental or focused on new trends. We should appreciate the energy and interest these kinds of apps bring to the ecosystem. The recent success of ‘ degen ’ focused apps like Pump.fun and platforms alike show that a big user base is interested in these kinds of experiments. Solana’s success , as evidenced by the rapid user acquisition of platforms like Pump.fun, shows us this. They have supported projects, even those just starting or exploring new areas, leading to the network’s adoption and growth. Ethereum can learn from this by not being too quick to dismiss these kinds of projects and recognizing their potential to grow the overall user base. Communication with everyday user Ethereum focuses on technical improvements as a team; while these are important for the developer community, they don’t mean much to regular internet users or degens looking for new and exciting opportunities or experiences. Specifically, people want to know what they can do with all these new primitives or apps. Other networks are doing a better job of showcasing apps built on them, which are even easy to use for your grandmother and rewarding for many. Focusing on supporting these money legos has attracted talent, users & network usage. Clearly, Ethereum lacks this. I criticize Ethereum because I am an avid supporter and user of it. Making app growth a priority We need to actively work on getting more apps built and more users to try them. This means having a clear plan beyond just improving the technology. One way to do this is by creating a special team within the Ethereum ecosystem that focuses on helping new apps grow across the spectrum, from serious tools to fun experiments. One of the most important goals for this team would be to find promising projects and understand what they need help with. A focused effort to help apps on Ethereum succeed while not being directly controlled by the Ethereum Foundation for day-to-day operations would create space for builders to experiment. Ethereum has a strong base and much potential to revitalize the ecosystem. By being more open to all kinds of apps, supporting them, and creating a special team to help apps grow, Ethereum can get its app ecosystem going again. Ethereum’s future success depends not only on its technology but also on the number of useful and fun apps people can actually use.

Both XRP and LTC have seen renewed attention after recent transaction spikes. However, some investors are shifting focus to newer entrants like RTX , which analysts say could offer a different kind of upside in 2025. As sentiment builds around utility and early entry, the market may be watching more than just the usual names this cycle. While Others Chase Pumps, Traders Are Positioning Early in RTX Remittix isn’t building quietly, it’s making noise where it matters. While most PayFi tokens recycle the same stablecoin playbooks, RTX is refining the backend infrastructure that moves money across networks. That’s why traders and analysts are treating it less like a gamble and more like a utility asset in the making. Instead of using traditional pooled liquidity, Remittix spreads its modular design across optimized micro-pools to support large-volume settlements without bloating fees or slowing down. This makes it attractive not just to users but also to platforms integrating on-chain payments. Remittix’s protocol is being built with enterprise-grade interoperability in mind. It doesn’t need wrapped assets or clunky bridges to move value between chains and its compliance-ready structure already supports KYT and whitelisting. Moreover, RTX isn’t just a token, it’s the backbone of the Remittix platform . It keeps things simple, fair and transparent. Every RTX transaction runs on a system users can trust. Remittix supports over 30 fiat currencies and 50 crypto pairs. It also works with modern payment options like Google Pay, which makes the platform as flexible as it is innovative. In a market crowded with short-term pumps, Remittix is drawing attention by solving boring but essential problems. That’s the type of groundwork tokens like XLM and XRP were built on except RTX is arriving with modern tech and far fewer limitations. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Gears Up for Another Surge Analysts who previously anticipated the rally of XRP from $0.5 to over $2 now suggest its potential to surpass $3. This is partly due to the upcoming launch of XRP futures on the CME Group’s platform, scheduled for May 19, 2025. The CME’s decision follows a brief appearance of a beta page referencing XRP futures, which was later confirmed as part of their expansion into altcoin markets. While the launch of XRP futures could propel the altcoin, it also brings to mind historical precedents, such as the introduction of Bitcoin futures in 2017. With a few days to go, XRP is already up 20% from the previous week. Source: CoinMarketCap Litecoin Resilience Signals Momentum as Coinbase Plans cbLTC While the broader market struggles to find consistent footing, LTC has shown resilience, holding key levels and drawing increased attention from investors. LTC’s inclusion in Unstaked’s top 30 leap list also reflects growing interest in the asset. Data from IntoTheBlock reveals that over 70% of LTC holders are currently in profit. This high profitability rate suggests strong long-term confidence in the asset and adds weight to its potential as a lead player in the upcoming leg of the market. Coinbase has announced plans to launch cbLTC, a 1:1 wrapped version of Litecoin. Though no official launch date has been disclosed, cbLTC is designed to expand DeFi liquidity options, making LTC more accessible in decentralized applications. Source: CoinMarketCap Conclusion Currently priced at $0.757 in its ongoing presale , Remittix is offering a utility-first play before market sentiment catches up. While XRP and LTC prepare for another rally, early-stage traders are stacking RTX, with over $15 million accounted for. If 2025 belongs to real adoption, RTX may be the token everyone wishes they bought earlier.

Points to August!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/trumps-chief-cryptocurrency-advisor-bo-hines-talks-about-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrencies-points-to-august/,"Bo Hines, US President Donald Trump's advisor on cryptocurrencies, said that despite all the negativity experienced recently, President Donald Trump wants and plans to sign important cryptocurrency laws by August. Speaking at Consensus 2025 in Toronto, Bo Hines said that despite the rejection of the stablecoin bill GENIUS, negotiations on its legislation are ongoing. At this point, Hines emphasized that they need to ensure that the stablecoin law is passed before Congress goes into recess in August. “Discussions on the stablecoin bill are ongoing. However, I remain optimistic that we will pass stablecoin legislation and market structure legislation before the August recess. That is also the President's desire.” Hines also addressed concerns about potential conflicts of interest regarding the Trump family's cryptocurrency project, emphasizing that the president's children and family have the legal right to participate in the crypto market as private investors. “President Trump's sons have the right to participate in capital markets like other private entrepreneurs in the United States. “I don't see the Trump family project as a conflict of interest. A talented entrepreneur should look at digital assets and think, 'How can I get involved?' because digital assets are the next generation of finance.” Finally, Hines added that the White House and members of the working group continue to work on a strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve. *This is not investment advice.

The newly launched USP synthetic dollar is fully backed by real-world private credit, Pareto told Cointelegraph on May 15. To mint USP, users must deposit stablecoins such as USDC ( USDC ) and USDt ( USDT ), which are then held as collateral. “USP is backed 1:1 by the stablecoins used during the minting process,” Pareto co-founder Matteo Pandolfi told Cointelegraph in a written statement. The deposited funds are placed into Pareto’s credit vaults and lent to what the company describes as “vetted institutional borrowers,” generating yields for participants. To maintain its peg to the US dollar, Pareto uses what it calls a “native backing” process. Each USP token is minted only when an equivalent amount of USDC or USDT is deposited, ensuring full collateralization when the token is created. An arbitrage mechanism also supports the dollar peg’s ongoing stability. In addition, Pareto has set up a protocol-funded stability reserve to act as a buffer in case of borrower defaults. Related: Coinbase invests in Canadian stablecoin issuer Institutional entry into RWA credit market The company said the synthetic dollar gives institutional investors a regulated onchain entry point into real-world asset (RWA) credit markets — a segment of the tokenization industry that has expanded rapidly over the past year. Recent examples of private credit tokenization include Tradable’s portfolio of 30 credit positions and Apollo’s Diversified Credit Securitize Fund . When asked about the potential risks of connecting DeFi to the often opaque private credit sector, Pareto acknowledged the concern but emphasized its approach to risk management. “That’s a fair concern, but Pareto was specifically built to address the inefficiencies and opacity that have historically plagued traditional credit markets,” Pandolfi said, adding: “By bringing private credit onchain, we enable real-time transparency, programmable risk management, and automated settlement while reducing counterparty risk and operational friction.” A chart highlighting the growth of the tokenized credit market.

Ethena, the largest synthetic dollar network by market capitalization, offers Staked USDe (sUSDe) tokenholders an annual percentage yield of 10%. Roughly 368,000 investors were earning yield as of January, Cointelegraph reported . Despite the success of synthetic variants, collateralized stablecoins continue to dominate the market — a position US regulators are keen to preserve through proposed legislation like the GENIUS Act and STABLE Act. Under President Donald Trump, the US government has recognized the role of stablecoins as a “way to support the dollar’s worldwide use as a reserve currency,” Komodo Platform’s chief technology officer, Kadan Stadelmann, told Cointelegraph in a written statement. “Stablecoins are the second-most adopted blockchain use case behind Bitcoin — more than NFTs and DeFi,” he said. “US dollar-pegged stablecoins account for a mind-boggling 1% of the M2 money supply.” The total stablecoin market is approaching $250 billion, with Tether accounting for roughly $150 billion. Source: DefiLlama Sergey Gorbunov, CEO of Interop Labs and co-founder of Axelar Protocol, told Cointelegraph that US regulators have prioritized stablecoin legislation because they know there’s more at stake than just crypto. “This is about setting the conditions for regulated US financial firms to lead on stablecoins and preserve the primacy of the US dollar, globally,” he said.

In a post on X, the crypto entrepreneur said the scammers had contacted various people and asked them to install a script. According to Nailwal, scammers are using deepfake avatars of him and another Polygon executive to deceive crypto founders on video calls. He explained that the attackers breached the Telegram account of Polygon Ventures lead Shreyansh Singh and have been using it for the scam. Through Singh’s account, they contacted all crypto founders and portfolio companies with whom Singh had previously communicated, asking them to reconnect and set up meetings via a Calendly link. However, the scammers send a Zoom meeting link to potential victims, requiring them to join a video call that can only work on a desktop. Anyone who joins the call will find deepfake videos of Nailwal, Singh, and another woman purported to be a Polygon employee. Interestingly, the audio is disabled on the call, and the scammers usually send a link asking the founders to install a software development kit (SDK) to enable voice. Nailwal noted that it is game over for anyone who installs the script, as it infects the user’s computer and allows the scammers to steal their assets. Victims acknowledge the incident as deepfake concerns grow Meanwhile, some crypto founders who joined the call have also raised alarms about the risks of deepfake calls. Rabble co-founder Prasad Kaavya noted the deepfake avatars of Nailwal and others on the call looked very real, and the only reason he was suspicious was that he did not expect the call to be a team call. He added that he knew Nailwal personally and that the Polygon co-founder does not join any random Zoom calls. Thus, he immediately closed the call and sent a Google Meet link to the person, leading them to delete the chat and block him. He said: “Here’s the scary part: If I wasn’t personally connected to these people, I might have trusted the deepfake.” Powerloom protocol co-founder Swaroop Hedge also confirmed that they got a similar message from the scammer, but he quickly caught the scam and did not join the video call. Meanwhile, several crypto entrepreneurs have confirmed this attack’s prevalence, highlighting scammers’ increasing use of AI tools and fake video calls in recent months. Deepfake impersonations have targeted major crypto stakeholders and celebrities and led to the loss of over $200 million in 2025 Q1 alone. Nailwal advises crypto users on security With the incident showing the significant risks that crypto users face, Nailwal has advised followers against installing anything on their device when someone else initiates an interaction. This appears to be the easiest way for scammers to access users’ devices. According to security researcher Tayvano, several scammer groups on Telegram use this method, and one such group has made over $50 million. She explained that attackers try to inject malware into user devices to steal their private data, such as private keys, telegram messages, and browser data. Meanwhile, Nailwal added that the best thing for users is to have separate laptops to manage their crypto wallets and sign in and not use the laptop for any other purpose. He said: “These attacks keep getting more and more sophisticated, so the best approach is to keep a separate laptop for signing via your wallets only from that laptop and never do anything else on that wallet.” He also noted that it has been impossible to get Telegram to act on this issue, even though it is prevalent on social messaging platforms. As for users who joined the video call with the scammers, many of them confirmed that they had already formatted their computers as a precaution. There has been no report of the scammers being able to steal anyone’s funds. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Crypto adoption surges as Ukraine ranks sixth globally, surpassing major economies. As the United States accelerates efforts to establish a Strategic Bitcoin [BTC] Reserve across both federal and state levels, other nations are not staying on the sidelines. Ukraine becomes the first European state to pursue a Bitcoin Reserve Ukraine, amid ongoing conflict and widespread digital reform, is positioning itself to become the first European nation to pursue a similar initiative. Ukrainian MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak, who also serves as Deputy Chairman of the Finance, Tax, and Customs Policy Committee, is preparing to introduce legislation that would create a national Bitcoin reserve as per an Incrypted report . While earlier discussions had considered a broader crypto reserve, the new proposal focuses solely on Bitcoin, signaling a strategic shift amid Ukraine’s evolving digital asset landscape. With Binance reportedly involved, and Switzerland already making moves in this direction, Ukraine’s push for a Bitcoin reserve reflects a growing global momentum to formally integrate BTC into national financial infrastructure. Remarking on the same, the MP said, ‘“We will soon submit a draft law from the industry allowing the creation of crypto reserve.” Kirill Khomyakov, who leads Binance operations across CEE, Central Asia, and Africa, also expressed the exchange’s support for Ukraine’s initiative to establish a strategic crypto reserve. He added, “The creation of such a reserve will require significant changes in legislation, which indicates that this process will not be quick. Another positive aspect is that this initiative will likely lead to greater clarity in the regulation of crypto assets in Ukraine, as the government will need to more clearly articulate its position on this issue”. Ukraine’s crypto journey to date This highlights Ukraine’s momentum in the digital asset space that is still strong despite the war backwash. In fact, according to Chainalysis’ 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index , Ukraine ranks 6th, surpassing major economies like the UK, Russia, and South Korea. For those unaware, since Russia’s 2022 invasion, the country has leveraged crypto to raise over $100 million in donations, highlighting blockchain’s real-world utility during a crisis. With the legalization of crypto through its “Law on Virtual Assets,” a CBDC pilot underway, and strong government backing, Ukraine is not only building infrastructure but actively shaping the future of DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 amid ongoing geopolitical turbulence. Mixed reactions from states in the U.S. Needless to say, Ukraine’s bold step toward establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve underscores how U.S. policy initiatives continue to influence global crypto strategies. While the United States has led the conversation at the federal level, internal divisions persist in states like Florida , Montana, and South Dakota , which have opted out of the federal proposal, highlighting a fragmented approach. Meanwhile, pro-crypto states such as Texas , New Hampshire , and Arizona are pushing forward. Now, as this global momentum builds, Bitcoin continues to ride the wave of optimism, trading above $102,000 with a modest 1.27% daily gain, according to CoinMarketCap . Therefore, with geopolitics and innovation intertwining, Ukraine’s move may just be the catalyst for a broader, more unified shift in how nations approach digital assets.",Bitcoin|BTC Trading View|News|News 1|Social|Trading View|ambcrypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'AMB Crypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/ambcrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",ambcrypto,2025-05-15 10:00:35

Some analysts have suggested that reclaiming this area could kickstart a rally toward the next key resistance levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For $2,850 Rally, But Analysts Warn Of Potential Dip To These Levels Avalanche Targets $32 Resistance Avalanche has seen a nearly 40% surge over the past week, jumping from the $19 mark to a three-month high of $26.84 on Monday. The cryptocurrency hit an 18-month low of $14.66 during the early April retraces but recovered around 37% ahead of its recent breakout. Amid the market recovery, AVAX has broken out of its five-month downtrend, which saw the cryptocurrency retrace over 73% from its Q4 2024 high. Moreover, Avalanche formed a 2-month Cup-and-Handle pattern, with the neckline at the $23 resistance. Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems pointed out that the formation had a “super clean” target and was “in confluence with the next resistance level,” at around the $32 mark. This area, lost in early February, was a crucial resistance and support zone before the Q4 2024 rally and the Q1 2025 market shakeouts. After the neckline breakout and reclaiming this level over the weekend, the analyst noted that the target “is clear now.” As such, Avalanche could likely see another 30% rally toward the $32 mark. Meanwhile, analyst CW highlighted that AVAX has a key sell wall near the $27 level, where it has faced resistance over the past few days. However, if it breaks through this barrier, it could surge to the $36 level before facing the next selling wall near the $38.5 area. Another wall between the $42.5-$46.5 levels lies ahead. On the contrary, if the cryptocurrency gets rejected from the first resistance, the price could revisit the breakout levels and the downtrend line around the $20 mark, with a selling wall below it that could serve as support. AVAX To Repeat BTC And SOL’s Playbook? Crypto Amsterdam suggested that many altcoins, including Avalanche, are forming a setup seen in Bitcoin’s (BTC) and Solana’s (SOL) charts. According to the analyst, the setup follows a Macro range, divided into five cycle stages. The first stage, set during the bull market, sees a cryptocurrency move quickly toward the highs, setting the range’s upper boundary. During the second phase, at the start of the bear market, the token’s price records “steep lower lows and highs” toward the range’s low before moving to the third stage, the accumulation phase. In this stage, the cryptocurrency registers a deviation below the range’s low. The fourth stage sees the cryptocurrency register its first higher high and reclaim the range lows again. Lastly, the cryptocurrency moves toward the past cycle’s high during the fifth stage, breaking past the range’s high after reclaiming the mid-zone. Crypto Amsterdam explained that AVAX’s chart is “another super clean mini cycle example.” After hitting its all-time high (ATH) of $146 in November 2021, Avalanche set its range between the $20-$130 levels, falling below the range’s low in mid-2022. The cryptocurrency reclaimed the range low in late 2023, ending the third stage and entering the fourth one during the early 2024 rally. Since then, it has retested the range lows after its deviation, recovering this level during last week’s breakout.

If Avalanche continues to follow this setup, it must reclaim the mid-range, at around the $75 mark, to surge to the upper boundary and potentially hit a new ATH. However, the analyst also suggested that falling below the local bottom would invalidate the setup.

But Digital Perspectives founder Bradley Kimes argues that XRP Ledger’s vision goes far beyond any single company like Meta. Let’s break down the scenario and what it means for Ripple, XRP, and the broader crypto industry. Meta’s Hypothetical Acquisition of Ripple: What You Need to Know In this fictional scenario, Meta is looking to acquire Ripple’s payments, custody, and stablecoin divisions while Ripple keeps its XRP tokens. This has raised eyebrows as Ripple’s XRP holdings alone are worth far more than its entire business valuation. Ripple’s XRP Holdings: A Game-Changer for Valuation Ripple currently holds a staggering 44.8 billion XRP tokens, valued at $2.50 each. That’s a total value of $113 billion. Yet, Ripple’s business valuation stands at just $15 to $30 billion, highlighting the massive gap between XRP’s value and Ripple’s operations. This leaves the question: Could Ripple, like MicroStrategy, become a pure XRP-holding company if it sold its business units? Ripple’s Future as a Pure XRP-Holding Company: Could It Follow MicroStrategy’s Model? MicroStrategy has built a reputation as the largest Bitcoin holder , with a whopping 568,840 BTC tokens. In a similar fashion, Ripple could evolve into a company that holds only XRP, linking its success directly to the token’s price. This potential shift could provide much-needed clarity for investors and XRP holders, who have often wondered if Ripple’s decisions truly benefit the token. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP News: Why Did Ripple’s President Meet With UAE Officials? , How Would Meta Benefit from the Acquisition? For Meta, acquiring Ripple’s crypto infrastructure would mean enhanced regulatory-compliant capabilities across platforms like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads. Meta could integrate Ripple’s technology to power payments and stablecoins, creating new financial opportunities within its ecosystem. Bradley Kimes Weighs In: XRP Ledger’s Global Financial Impact Despite the speculative nature of this deal, Bradley Kimes emphasizes that the XRP Ledger’s potential reaches far beyond powering social media payments. According to Kimes, the XRPL’s role in global financial systems is far greater than Meta’s immediate needs. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

On May 14, the Ethereum ( ETH ) Foundation announced the launch of an initiative called “One Trillion Security”, which aims to make the network resilient enough to safely support trillions of dollars in assets. The network will benefit all kinds of users from individual savings to corporate treasuries and potentially government-issued instruments. The Foundation stated that as more value flows on-chain, the system needs stronger protection at every level. from user wallets and smart contracts to validators and the base protocol. This push comes as tokenization continues to accelerate faster than many expected. In a May 8 post on X, Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan noted some recent major developments. Among them, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce backed blockchain-based equity issuance, while Superstate unveiled “Opening Bell,” a new platform for trading tokenized shares on Ethereum and Solana ( SOL ). Stocks are going to move on-chain much faster than people think.

That figure jumps to nearly 89% when factoring in Ethereum layer-2 networks like zkSync. The Foundation believes long-term adoption depends on making the network more secure for high-value use cases. A bigger wave is coming. A report by Boston Consulting Group estimates the tokenized asset market could reach $16 trillion by 2030, roughly 10% of global GDP. To support that scale, Ethereum is now establishing itself as the infrastructure layer for tokenized finance. As demand from fintech platforms and enterprise issuers rises, Ethereum’s security roadmap reflects a growing urgency to meet institutional standards.

44651568,https://ambcrypto.com/?p=491634,1747304129,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/ambcrypto.png,Google searches for Bitcoin stay flat — Where’s the retail FOMO?,https://ambcrypto.com/google-searches-for-bitcoin-stay-flat-wheres-the-retail-fomo/,"Google search activity for Bitcoin remains flat, indicating a shift in retail appetite for the asset. Liquidity flows across the market suggest that retail investors have rotated into altcoins, with a particular focus on memecoins. After reclaiming the $100,000 mark, Bitcoin [BTC] has struggled to break past its recent high of $105,819—especially as liquidity inflows remain stalled. Retail traders have contributed to this. Contrary to expectations, the move above $100,000 did not spark increased spot buying from retail. Instead, traders have redirected funds toward other asset classes they believe offer greater long-term potential. Here’s how AMBCrypto discovered this trend. Retail interest in Bitcoin gradually fades There has been a decline in interest in Bitcoin-related search terms on the Google Search engine. According to Google Trends, search interest in Bitcoin has dropped to 37—one of the lowest points this year. Normally, one would expect interest to be higher given the current Bitcoin euphoria. However, that is not the case. A case in point is the sharp increase in search interest from 56 to 100 following the announcement of President Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 election. Source: Google Trends This spike suggested that retail investors were actively searching for Bitcoin, likely with the intent to buy. In fact, Bitcoin witnessed a significant rally to new market highs as liquidity flooded in during that period. When there is a drop in search interest like this, it implies that market liquidity is moving toward other assets. Bitcoin dominance drops as reserves stall The outflow of liquidity from Bitcoin is further confirmed by the decline in Bitcoin Dominance and Exchange Reserves. The metric, which measures BTC’s market cap relative to the entire crypto market, has dropped from 64.4% on the 8th of May to 61% at press time. This drop implies that capital is flowing into alternative assets. Source: CoinMarketCap At the same time, Bitcoin Exchange Reserves have seen a slight increase and have stalled around 2.44 million BTC held on centralized exchanges. Source: CryptoQuant This slight uptick and continued stagnation suggest that retail holders are gradually moving their Bitcoin back to exchanges, likely intending to sell. Many are probably swapping their assets for stablecoins or other cryptocurrencies. Where’s the market moving? An analysis of overall ecosystem activity and the performance of top tokens shows that memecoins have attracted the most liquidity. According to CoinMarketCap, the top-performing altcoins—cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin—over the past 90 days have been primarily memecoins. Source: CoinMarketCap Four of the top 10 performing assets during this period are memecoins: Fartcoin [FARTCOIN] , dogwifhat [WIF] , Brett [BRETT] , and Pepe [PEPE] . Further analysis shows that more memecoins are likely to join the ranks of the top-performing cryptocurrencies, as the sector’s momentum continues to tilt in their favor. According to sector-specific performance metrics, Bitcoin and the broader Bitcoin ecosystem have dropped by -0.9% and -0.5%, respectively, over the past seven days. In contrast, memecoins have rallied 11.4% in the same period. Source: Artemis If this trend continues, assets like Pudgy Penguins [PENGU] and Bonk [BONK] , which are currently among the top 15 performers, could soon break into the top 10.",Bitcoin|BTC Trading View|News|News 1|Social|Trading View|ambcrypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'AMB Crypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/ambcrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",ambcrypto,2025-05-15 10:15:29

Although the bears are exerting pressure, the bulls continue to dominate the token, which has been reflected in the chart pattern. The formation of higher highs and lows hints towards a strong presence of bulls. As a result, the BTC price is primed to trigger a strong rebound and revive a strong upswing towards the target of forming a new ATH. Ever since the rebound from the lows below $75,000, the BTC price has been rising within a pattern. The price spikes high, consolidates for a while and later triggers the next breakout. During every consolidation, liquidity accumulates on either side of the price, which indicates the growing uncertainty among the market participants. A similar accumulation has been observed during the current consolidation, which suggests another breakout could be fast approaching. Source: X The BTC price is hanging between the two major cliffs, as a drop below $101,000 could activate the magnet at $100K or below, while a break above $105,000 may revive a strong rally towards new highs. Besides, a steady drop in the USDT dominance since April is a clear sign of funds pouring into BTC and altcoins. Moreover, the institutions are buying more than the miners can produce, which suggests a 3 times more supply squeeze is incoming. Coming to technicals, the Bitcoin Z-score indicator has printed a new cycle high, signaling more price acceleration to come for the token. Historically, this indicator moving up fast usually indicates the start of a parabolic run on Bitcoin. Besides, the daily MACD hints towards a bearish crossover, while the rise of buying pressure is seen in the weekly timeframe. However, the RSI in both timeframes is plunging, hinting towards a drop in the strength of the rally, which could result in a pullback close to $100K.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|USDT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-15 11:40:01

The Cailian News Agency reports that during the Bloomberg New Voices event in Hong Kong on Tuesday, UBS co-head of wealth management for Asia Amy Lo says that the Swiss bank’s high-net-worth clients are increasingly veering away from US dollar assets and turning to gold, cryptocurrency and Chinese assets. In an interview with Bloomberg correspondent Yvonne Man during the event, Lo says that gold is very popular now. Gold is traditionally regarded as a safe haven investment and prices of the yellow metal have been surging to record highs this year amid concerns that economic slowdowns will ensue following US President Donald Trump’s imposition of higher tariffs. Lo says that the trade tension between the US and China is also prompting investors to diversify their asset allocations, which have been traditionally “quite US-centered”. The conflict between the two nations escalated after the Trump administration imposed a sweeping 104% tariff on Chinese goods. In response, China imposed an 84% tariff on American imports. Lo says investors are also funneling more funds to cryptocurrencies, commodities and alternative assets. She warns that volatility will continue.

This meeting, highlighted by crypto analyst Amelie on X , underscores the deepening relationship between Ripple and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a nation rapidly emerging as a global hub for digital finance. Strengthening Ties with UAE Leadership His Highness Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, a prominent figure in the UAE’s economic landscape, serves as the Chairman and CEO of Emirates Airline and Group and holds influential positions in various financial institutions. His engagement with Ripple’s leadership signifies the UAE’s commitment to embracing blockchain technology and fostering innovation in the financial sector. BREAKING: RIPPLE PRESIDENT MONICA LONG HAD THE HONOR OF MEETING HIS HIGHNESS AHMED BIN SAEED AT DUBAI FINTECH SUM! #XRP UAE pic.twitter.com/o72s7hZlV0 — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 14, 2025 The Dubai FinTech Summit provided an ideal platform for this high-level interaction, bringing together global leaders to discuss the future of financial technology. Monica Long’s meeting with His Highness reflects Ripple’s strategic focus on the Middle East, particularly the UAE, as a key market for expansion and collaboration . Ripple’s Strategic Initiatives in the UAE Ripple’s presence in the UAE has been marked by several strategic initiatives aimed at integrating blockchain solutions into the region’s financial infrastructure. In 2020, Ripple established its Middle East and Africa (MEA) headquarters in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), recognizing the UAE’s progressive regulatory environment and its potential as a fintech hub. In November 2023, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) approved XRP for use within the DIFC, making it the first virtual asset to receive such approval under the DFSA’s regime. This milestone allowed licensed firms in the DIFC to incorporate XRP into their virtual asset services, enhancing the utility and adoption of Ripple’s digital asset in the region. Further solidifying its commitment, Ripple partnered with the DIFC Innovation Hub in August 2024 to accelerate the adoption of blockchain technology in the Middle East. This collaboration aims to connect developers with the region’s largest innovation community, fostering the development of real-world use cases on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In March 2025, Ripple achieved another significant milestone by receiving approval from the DFSA to offer regulated crypto payments and services in the DIFC. This approval marked Ripple as the first blockchain-enabled payments provider licensed by the DFSA, enabling the company to expand its seamless, compliance-first global payments product to businesses in the UAE. Implications for XRP and the Broader Crypto Ecosystem The meeting between Monica Long and His Highness Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum is more than a ceremonial engagement; it symbolizes the UAE’s openness to integrating advanced blockchain solutions into its financial systems. Ripple’s strategic partnerships and regulatory approvals in the UAE position XRP as a key player in the region’s digital transformation. With the UAE’s proactive approach to fintech and Ripple’s robust infrastructure and regulatory compliance, the stage is set for significant advancements in blockchain adoption. The collaboration between Ripple and UAE institutions could lead to the development of innovative financial products and services, enhancing cross-border payments and fostering economic growth. Monica Long’s meeting with His Highness Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum at the Dubai FinTech Summit marks a pivotal moment in Ripple’s expansion strategy in the Middle East. The UAE’s supportive regulatory environment and commitment to innovation align with Ripple’s mission to revolutionize global payments through blockchain technology. As Ripple continues to forge strategic partnerships and secure regulatory approvals, XRP’s role in the UAE’s financial ecosystem is poised for significant growth, heralding a new era of digital finance in the region.

In 2025, big institutions have been buying most of the Bitcoin, while retail investors have been selling. However, retail interest may pick up if Bitcoin breaks above $109,350. Businesses are the largest net buyer of bitcoin so far this year, lead by @Strategy which makes up 77% of the growth. pic.twitter.com/Bbj89gyk2h — River (@River) May 12, 2025 According to Google Trends, retail interest in Bitcoin appears to be fading, with search trends for “Bitcoin” falling to levels last seen in June 2024, when BTC was trading around $66,000. Similarly, Coinbase has slipped to 15th in the US finance app rankings, a position it last held in mid-2024. Retailers Missing Out on BTC Rally? Historically, retail investors tend to buy later, right after major breakouts, often missing out on the early gains. Analyst Sky Wee explains that Bitcoin was made to protect people from traditional banks and systems, and it stays “people’s money” as long as they keep holding it. Right now, more individuals are selling Bitcoin while big institutions are buying, which could make Bitcoin more controlled by the institutions. He is concerned that Bitcoin could just become another tool for Wall Street. “Bitcoin doesn’t need Wall Street, but Wall Street needs Bitcoin,” he said. Analyst Ali Martinez also shared a chart that shows Bitcoin’s long-term holders are moving from a phase of extreme optimism into potential “Belief” (expecting the bull run to continue) and “Denial” (fearing a potential market reversal) stage as prices surge above $100,000. A Full-Fledged Altseason Next? Bitcoin’s dominance is fading, which could bring altcoins back, especially if Ethereum beats Bitcoin at the 0.03 level. Ethereum is also down over 2% in the past day, currently trading at $2,552. After a 55% rally in the past week, a pullback is expected around $2,400. Analysts have observed that market corrections can be volatile, but this doesn’t mean altcoins are dead or the market is over. These dips could be great buying opportunities. As long as Bitcoin stays above $98K, the market remains healthy, altcoins have a chance to bounce back. Experts predict a full-blown altseason this June, with many altcoins already beating Bitcoin.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-15 11:47:54

If it can, a powerful rally is predicted, which can lead ETH to a point as high as $5800 by July, driven by its ongoing development through Ethereum 2.0 and its increasing dominance in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. However, this upward momentum faces competition from Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is rapidly gaining traction in the DeFi market. The presale has attracted over 9800 participants, and many anticipate that the token price will rise to $0.03 at the start of the next phase. Those investing at this stage stand to make up to 140% in profit once the projected launch price of $0.06 is reached. Investors have limited window since phase 4 is almost closing as over 70% has been sold. As ETH pushes for new heights, investors are also eyeing the potential of Mutuum Finance, which promises to offer unique opportunities in the market. The battle for attention and growth between these two could shape the next phase of the crypto market. Ethereum price prediction: will ETH break $3000 and surge to $5800? Ethereum (ETH) is currently at a tipping point and investors are holding their breath to determine whether it can break through the resistance level of $3000 in May. If ETH breaks this ceiling analysts are forecasting a big spike that will drive the price all the way to $5800 by July on the back of the implementation of Ethereum 2.0 and its continued dominance in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. As Ethereum makes its presence felt in the market with faster transactions and less energy consumption, it is poised to expand in the coming months. But other new projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also making their presence felt, infusing an element of competition into Ethereum’s uptrend. Mutuum Finance presale: a growing DeFi solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors due its advanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending solutions is gaining significant momentum in the market. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform has collected more than $8.1 million and accumulated 9800 holders in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.025 before their value will grow to $0.03 within the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 140% when Mutuum Finance hits its initial launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position. Social media channels will release the results of an ongoing Certik smart contract audit after the completion of this audit by the team. Rewarding early investors & expanding the community Mutuum Finance strives to acquire more users and provides financial benefits to its initial investor community. To award early investors MUTM platform provides ten lucky winners a total of $100,000 distributed in equal amounts of $10,000 value MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance allows new investors to benefit when they refer members to the platform which creates an inclusive investor community. The first users who join gain complete access to premium platform updates which encourages them to stay involved. Mutuum Finance leverages modern lending innovations and secure operational platforms to execute permanent changes within Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Ethereum may surge to $5,800 if it breaks $3000, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is grabbing investor attention fast. With over $8.1M raised, 9,800+ backers, and Phase 4 now over 70%+ sold out, tokens at $0.025 offer up to 140% gains before the $0.06 launch. Act now, before the next price hike leaves you behind.

The ETF is heavily concentrated in crypto and tech stocks, with limited diversification and strong correlation to Bitcoin's price movements. LFGY's strategy is attractive in uncertain or sideways crypto markets, offering downside protection and income versus direct crypto exposure. Given current market greed, high valuations, and low volatility, I rate LFGY a 'Buy' for conservative, income-focused crypto investors. Introduction The YieldMax Crypto Industry & Tech Portfolio Income ETF (LFGY) aims to generate income through derivatives based on some of the most volatile assets available on Wall Street. Since option premiums increase with higher volatility, LFGY has an incredibly high dividend yield of 20.91% and pays it out weekly. Key ETF Data Currently, the ETF has an expense ratio of 0.99%, which is normal when compared to other income ETFs like the YieldMax AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF (APLY). When looking at the holdings breakdown, shown in Figure 1, one can see that the ETF mostly holds financials, with more than 50% of its portfolio. Additionally, it is heavily invested in technology stocks or derivatives. Figure 1 - LFGY Holdings Breakdown (Seeking Alpha) All of this generally speaks to a relatively low level of diversification, which is confirmed when looking at the specific holdings displayed in Figure 2. As can be seen, most exposure is to either cryptos such as iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) or crypto-related stocks such as MicroStrategy Incorporated (MSTR) and Coinbase Global, Inc. (COIN). Other stocks like MARA Holdings (MARA) and Robinhood Markets (HOOD) are also heavily reliant on the movements of crypto. Figure 3 also shows this by highlighting the beta and correlation of different stocks to Bitcoin. Figure 2 - LFGY Top 10 Holdings (Seeking Alpha) Figure 3 - LFGY Holdings Correlation and Beta to Bitcoin (Self-Calculated in R) Since LFGY was only introduced at the start of this year, it is so far hard to determine the ETF's performance. However, when thinking about the investment strategy, the ETF is quite solid. During upturns, the ETF will, of course, gain less than its underlying stocks / ETFs as it sells options on them, meaning that gains are capped. Nevertheless, it should outperform in times of sideways performance and downturns. Also, it should even increase its already great yield, with rising volatility, as it will receive higher premiums. Investment Thesis As we have just seen, the performance of LFGY is strongly dependent on the performance of its underlyings, which again is dependent on the movements of Bitcoin and crypto in general. Because of this, it makes sense to look more closely at the current state of the crypto market. When looking at the crypto fear and greed index, shown in Figure 4, one can instantly see that there currently is a lot of greed in the market. Generally speaking, this should make investors more cautious as it suggests that many potential buyers have already done so at the moment. Figure 4 - Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index (Alternative.me) Furthermore, Figure 5 shows the implied volatility of 90-day at-the-money options on Bitcoin. As can be seen, it is currently low on a one-year scale. On one side suggests that options are currently cheap, giving LFGY much more potential. On the other hand, it could also suggest a less positive outlook as volatility has normally moved upward from current levels. Figure 6 also shows the daily chart of Bitcoin. While the crypto does currently have strong momentum and is in an uptrend, the resistance at $106k could be a potential initiator for a bounce back. All of this favors a more cautious approach, which LFGY brings to investors. Figure 5 - Bitcoin ATM Implied 90 Day Volatility (Theblock) Figure 6 - Bitcoin Daily Price Chart (Etoro) When looking at the underlying companies, one can also see some risks that favor selling options on them instead of just holding them directly. COIN currently trades at extremely high valuations, with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 78.42 and a P/E ratio of almost 50. The same can be said of MSTR at a forward EV/EBITDA of over 4000 and negative earnings. Furthermore, MSTR has negative revenue growth and an ROE of more than -30%, while COIN has negative EBITDA growth of over -40%. All of this suggests a lot of risk in the crypto and crypto-related company sector, making LFGY an attractive, more conservative bet that is also great for income investors. Risks Considering risks, the biggest one when just looking at performance would be a big crash in the crypto sector. While LFGY would outperform the sector, it would still show negative performance. At the same time, a huge rally, while benefiting the ETF, would lead to underperformance. While these two risks have to be considered, LFGY looks interesting in market phases like this that are driven by a lot of uncertainty. Conclusion In total, LFGY looks like a very interesting play at the moment, as it gives crypto investors more security in a phase where it is hard to say where the market is going.

Yaroslav Zhelezniak, a member of Ukraine’s parliament, confirmed during the CRYPTO 2025 event in Kyiv that lawmakers are about to submit the proposal, which would legally allow the government to build crypto reserves. This potential move comes at a time when global interest in Bitcoin as a strategic asset is rising . The United States recently created a national Bitcoin reserve using coins seized in criminal cases, and Swedish politicians have also begun promoting Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. However, Ukraine’s adoption could face legal hurdles. Binance’s regional head, Kyrylo Khomiakov, noted that significant changes to current laws will be needed , and progress could be slow. Still, the initiative could bring more clarity to Ukraine’s crypto regulations, especially as the country continues efforts to legalize digital assets with help from the National Bank and the IMF. Meanwhile, not everyone is on board. Critics like Michael Chobanian, founder of the Kuna exchange, argue the country’s current financial crisis and declining population make the Bitcoin plan unrealistic.

This means their investment strategies are likely influenced by the actions of wealthier investors, who are consistently scooping up the available Bitcoin supply. In the latest market update from Santiment, analysts explained that bitcoin (BTC) is increasingly being integrated into national and corporate financial strategies. This can be traced to U.S. President Donald Trump’s establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. How the Rich Can Shape Crypto’s Future Since Trump took major steps in positioning the U.S. at the forefront of the crypto revolution, the network has witnessed more institutional adoption and the emergence of supportive policies. Bitcoin is now placed alongside traditional reserves like gold and oil as long-term strategic assets. Large institutions and ultra-wealthy individuals have been buying BTC, and even the U.S. will no longer sell анъ obtained via legal forfeitures. At the state level, governments are passing laws to allow the use of public funds to buy cryptocurrencies and precious metals. One example is New Hampshire. In the global corporate sector, Bitcoin-holding companies like the business intelligence entity Strategy and the Japanese hospitality firm Metaplanet have been increasing their BTC bags non-stop. Strategy recently expanded its BTC holdings with a $1.34 billion purchase, while Metaplanet acquired an additional $126 million worth of assets. These firms keep buying BTC regardless of the market’s state. On the other hand, retail investors have a pattern of taking profits during market rallies. Santiment says this leads to a redistribution of BTC holdings toward institutional buyers and highlights the growing influence of large-scale investors. Small Fish in a Big Pond According to Santiment, most retail traders, including miners, cannot resist the urge to take profits to handle life expenses during market rallies. However, the ultra-wealthy can afford to continue to hold and accumulate coins over the long term. Currently, wallets holding less than $1 million in BTC (less than 10 BTC) account for just 17.5% of the total coins in circulation. Those having at least 10 BTC own over 82% of the supply. Santiment said addresses holding 10-100 BTC are classified as small institutional investors, while those holding 10-10,000 bitcoins belong to large institutions and liquidity providers. The latter cohort has more than two-thirds of all BTC in circulation. Hence, it is evident that “long-term holders with deep pockets” are taking control of the market.

Digital assets like stablecoins are the “perfect” financial instrument for real-time collateral management, according to a recent pilot by DTCC Digital Assets, which suggests that digital assets, particularly stablecoins, could modernize and simplify this critical function. “Digital assets really are the perfect use case for collateral management, whether it be uncleared derivatives, clear derivatives, central counterparties, repo, or any other type of collateral,” said Joseph Spiro, product director at DTCC Digital Assets, during a panel at Consensus 2025. From left: Ian Allison, CoinDesk reporter; Jelena DDjuric, CEO of Noble; Kyle Hauptman, chairman of the National Credit Union Administration, and Joseph Spiro, digital assets product director at DTCC Digital Assets. Source: Cointelegraph Collateral management requires complicated manual processes due to stringent requirements for locked-up collateral that can only be released to the appropriate parties at pre-set intervals. “All of that can be accomplished better, faster, more efficiently through digital assets and smart contracts,” Spiro said, adding that “all the manual processing can go away.” Related: Top South Korean presidential hopefuls support legalizing Bitcoin ETFs The pilot, dubbed the “Great Collateral Experiment,” comes as US policymakers work toward clear regulatory frameworks for stablecoins. On May 14, at least 60 of the top crypto founders gathered in Washington, DC, to support the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act. The bill initially failed to get enough support from Democrats on May 8. Coinbase CEO in Washington, DC on May 14. Source: Brian Armstrong The GENIUS Act seeks to establish collateralization guidelines for stablecoin issuers while requiring full compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws. The bill stalled on May 8 after failing to gain support from key Democrats , some of whom have voiced concerns about US President Donald Trump potentially profiting from digital assets through his crypto-related ventures. Related: Ukraine strategic Bitcoin reserve bill reportedly in final stages Stablecoins can streamline lending and settlement Incorporating stablecoins into traditional fiat-backed loans could further streamline TradFi processes, according to Kyle Hauptman, chairman of the National Credit Union Administration. The programmability of stablecoins could make the loan repayment process more transparent and streamlined for all participants. It is currently a “clunky process where they settle at the end of the month,” Hauptaman said during the same panel discussion, adding: “Stablecoins and their programmability can make this vastly easier.” “We not only made life easier for credit unions to settle these things up, you could do it for smaller amounts of money, but the borrower should get a better deal here because now this thing has some of the traits of a large bond issuance. It’s now liquid,” he said. Another piece of legislation — the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act — passed the House Financial Services Committee on April 2 in a 32–17 vote.

PEPE surged over 50%, fueled by meme coin mania and strong on-chain accumulation, while ADA broke key resistance levels, buoyed by network upgrades and renewed investor interest in its long-term smart contract potential. The rally for both assets hints at a broader altcoin breakout that could gain steam in the coming weeks.

After a rejection at the $145 resistance zone, Solana, which trades at about $125.41, has lost 12% over the previous week. With experts cautioning that SOL might decline below $112.15, marking its lowest level this year, a bearish flag formation on the charts indicates more downside pressure. By contrast, Binance Coin costs about $661.34. Technical signs are less hopeful, even if they show relative stability. Should BNB fall short of the $550 support line, it might land at $530 or $500. Given their slow growth potential and bearish sentiment, many investors increasingly consider SOL and BNB overpriced. Given these circumstances, focus has turned to three low-cost tokens selling under $0.25, low-cost substitutes with far more upside potential. These tokens not only equal Solana and Binance Coin's usefulness but might also generate tremendous gains as the market recovers. Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance (RXS) is changing the blockchain investing scene by closing the distance between distributed finance and conventional real-world assets. Rexas Finance lets regular investors acquire fractional ownership of valuable assets through its simple platform by providing tokenizing services for real estate, intellectual property, and commodities. The infrastructure is designed to democratize access, streamline investing, and offer liquidity for illiquid markets. The token's journey has already been a standout story in 2025. Launching quietly in a presale that began in September 2024, RXS has now raised $48,208,023, with 92.21% of its final stage complete. The token price has increased by 567% from its $0.03 launch price to $0.20 as of writing, indicating notable momentum before its official listing on June 19. Rexas Finance has decided to prioritize dispersed ownership among retail investors instead of depending on venture financing, which appeals to crypto purists wanting community-driven development. Market experts are especially positive on RXS. After rising over 500%, estimates indicate that RXS might reach $13 in the months following its tier-1 exchange listings at $0.25. From current levels, this would provide a shocking 65x return on investment. If predictions come true, a little $1,000 investment now might grow to $65,000. By placing RXS as a major new actor in the Ethereum ecosystem, this upside surpasses predictions for Solana or Binance Coin. Rexas Finance is proving a reputable, high-growth rival in the altcoin market. A Certik audit has been completed, and listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko have already been confirmed. RXS might be the summer's breakout star as investor confidence rises before its June debut. VeChain (VET) VeChain (VET), another underpriced asset that is attracting interest from market observers, trades at just $0.22. On its daily chart, VET has recently formed a bullish double bottom pattern, indicating a possible strong reversal. Both markers indicate increasing purchasing momentum: the RSI has risen over 50, and the MACD has crossed into positive territory. Two main sources of long-term value are VeChain's real-world alliances and ability to open supply chains. Given the increased demand for traceability and digital tracking solutions, VET stands to benefit from broader industry developments. Analysts estimate that the token may reach $0.50 by the end of 2025—a 20x spike from its current value. If this happens, it would outperform SOL and BNB in percentage terms. Hedera (HBAR) Another low-cost altcoin showing good signals is Hedera (HBAR), which currently costs about $0.045. The token has since climbed over its 50-day moving average, emerging from a declining channel. The MACD histogram continues to build positive momentum, while the RSI reaches an overbought area, suggesting the trend is becoming stronger. Renowned for its enterprise-grade security and hashgraph consensus, Hedera is drawing collaborations in everything from banking to healthcare. Analysts estimate HBAR might reach $0.50 by year's end due to scalable technology and an expanding development community. This would be more than a 10x rise, establishing HBAR as a competitive rival to Solana and Binance Coin. Conclusion Although Solana and Binance Coin are both highly regarded assets in the crypto space, their near-term future seems subdued. On the other hand, at a fraction of the price, Rexas Finance , VeChain, and Hedera present more appealing value propositions. These three low-cost tokens, all under $0.25, could outperform the giants due to excellent fundamentals, optimistic technical setups, and explosive price expectations. One, Rexas Finance, might just steal the summer show with a possible rise to $13.

Uniswap price analysis gives out a highly bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. Coin value has dropped down to a $6.26 low in the past 24 hours. If sellers continue to dominate the UNI coin price, we might see a drop below the $6 support level. On the other hand, if buyers hold confidence and push the price above immediate Fib levels, we might see a strong recovery toward $7.2. Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $20.52 level by 2027 and above $42.11 by 2031. Why is UNI down? The broader crypto market is experiencing a decreasing phase today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are losing value, and so is UNI. As buyers lost confidence around $6.8, sellers plunged the price hard. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $9.72, while the average price is expected to be around $8.10. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading below the $6 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $6.2 and $8.3; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2027. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting, as the coin’s value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $42.11 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

The company remains highly dependent on Bitcoin mining but is making promising strides in AI Cloud revenue, which is growing rapidly, albeit from a small base. Shareholder dilution persists, but the stock trades at a reasonable 3x forward sales multiple, in line with sector medians even after recent ATM issuance. Given IREN’s operational efficiency, profitability at current BTC prices, and sector leadership, I’m upgrading my rating back to 'buy.' After a profitable quarter for the three months ended December 2024, IREN Limited ( IREN ) has produced yet another quarter with positive net income and a second consecutive quarter of improvement in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining margin. In my prior piece covering the company from October, I downgraded the stock from 'buy' to 'hold' and looked quite foolish shortly after when IREN nearly doubled by mid-December: Data by YCharts More recently, the stock has come back down to earth. Yet after falling below $6 per share in April, the stock has quietly outperformed the index since April and since my mid-October article. Before we dive into IREN Limited's fiscal year earnings for Q3-25, I'll provide a quick recap on my general view about the company. My Prior Points Regarding IREN Broadly, I think IREN is an interesting company because it is one of the few Bitcoin miners in the public equity market that still sells all production each and every month. With this strict 'no-HODL' approach to capital management, IREN is perhaps less appealing to potential shareholders who want a mix of BTC-denominated revenue as well as BTC treasuries. Longer term, IREN's Bitcoin mining business could ultimately perform quite well if transaction fees become a larger share of mining rewards. Short of that, the company's pivot to HPC/AI revenue through data center infrastructure as a secondary revenue stream is necessary: AI Projections (IREN Limited) That said, I wouldn't say I'm as bullish AI/HPC as the average US equity market investor seems to be, but my view has been that companies with an ability to do both BTC and HPC are probably wise to attempt both. Though IREN is one of just a handful of BTC miner-turned-HPC providers that is actively generating revenue from the HPC/AI segment, IREN is still highly dependent on BTC for top and bottom line performance. With all of that reiterated, IREN's numbers from FY Q3-25 actually look pretty good, in my view. FY Q3-25 Results For the quarter ended March 2025, IREN Limited reported $148.1 million in total revenue. This was a year-over-year improvement of 172% and a sequential increase of 24%: FY Revenue Q3-25 Q2-25 Q3-24 YoY Bitcoin Mining $141.2 $113.5 $53.4 164% AI Cloud Service $3.6 $2.7 $0.6 500% Other $3.3 $3.4 $0.4 725% Total Revenue $148.1 $119.6 $54.4 172% % From Mining 95.3% 94.9% 98.2% -3% Source: IREN Limited, Dollars in millions By percentage, AI Cloud growth was terrific, at 500% over the prior year period. Though at just $3.3 million in the quarter, AI Cloud Service revenue continues to make up a small portion of top line revenue. At $141.2 million in Q3 revenue from mining, IREN's percent of revenue from mining actually grew slightly sequentially. From an expense and profit standpoint, IREN reported a 492% year-over-year increase in operating profit from $6 million last year to $35.5 million in Q3-25: FY Expenses Q3-25 Q2-25 Q3-24 YoY Depreciation $47.4 $36.2 $8.7 445% Electricity $39.4 $30.2 $19.8 99% Operating Profit $35.5 $31.1 $6.0 492% Source: IREN Limited, Dollars in millions This is now an operating profit for IREN in three of the last five quarters even as depreciation has surged 445% year over year. IREN likes to share 'hardware profit' which essentially shows mining profitability after electricity costs: Fiscal Year Mining Rev Hardware Profit Mining Margin Q4-24 $54.3 $29.9 55.1% Q1-25 $50.0 $20.8 41.6% Q2-25 $112.9 $76.3 67.6% Q3-25 $141.2 $104.5 74.0% Source: IREN Limited, Dollars in millions Q3-25 was the second consecutive quarter IREN was able to grow gross margin on Bitcoin mining. Bottom line, after $7.9 million in interest expense and $5 million in taxes, IREN Limited reported a $24.2 million quarterly profit for Q3-25. That was a sequential increase of 28%. Balance Sheet and Dilution At the end of March, IREN had over $184 million in cash and just under $256 million in total current assets: Assets 000s Cash and Equivalents $184,333 Total Current Assets $255,911 Property, plant and equipment $1,575,107 Total assets $1,989,755 Liabilities 000s Trade/other payables $172,272 Convertible notes $322,480 Total Liabilities $564,188 Total Equity $1,425,567 Source: IREN, as of quarter ended March The company has just $564.2 million in total liabilities. 98% of those liabilities are current through payables and convertible notes. The company's total equity of $1.4 billion is essentially entirely due to property, plant, and equipment. Shares Outstanding as of December 2024 214.4m Shares Outstanding as of March 2025 223.6m Shares Outstanding as of April 2025* 241.0m Source: Seeking Alpha, IREN, *Analyst Estimated Shareholder dilution - which has been a significant factor over the last two years - wasn't all that horrific during the three months ended March with roughly 9 million more shares through the ATM. However, since the end of March, IREN raised an additional $107.6 million from the ATM through issuance of another 17.4 million shares. Looking Ahead & Valuation IREN Monthly BTC Production (IREN, Author's Chart) During the month of April, IREN produced 579 BTC and generated $50.1 million in revenue. The company is still guiding for 50 EH/s per second in the first half of calendar 2025 but will pause further scaling plans for Bitcoin mining and will instead focus on growing AI Cloud revenue. That segment, while still comparatively small at just $3.6 million last quarter is already off to a good start for fiscal Q4: IREN Monthly AI Cloud Revenue (IREN, Author's Chart) At $2 million in AI Cloud revenue during the month of April, IREN has grown AI revenue for the third consecutive month and has an annualized AI/HPC revenue rate of $19.2 million over the last three months. Still, the company's bread is buttered with Bitcoin mining. And if we value the business based on future expected revenue from BTC sales, we see that IREN stock may not be a bad buy at just under $8 per share. Market Capitalization $1,920,770,000 3-Month Avg BTC Production 524 FWD P/S At $85k BTC 3.59 FWD P/S At $100k BTC 3.05 FWD P/S At $150k BTC 2.04 FWD P/S At $200k BTC 1.53 Source: Author's Estimates, 3-month average production based on Feb-Apr actuals Given the company's three-month average production of 524 BTC per month, IREN's not terribly expensive on a forward sales multiple at current BTC pricing. If we assume an annualized rate of production that is reasonably close to what IREN is currently doing, the company is only trading at 3x forward sales even factoring in the April ATM dilution. This is in line with the 2.9x info tech sector median, and that's before any potential price gains in BTC between now and the end of the year. Closing Takeaways I've been covering IREN for Seeking Alpha for three years. During that time, I've gone back and forth between 'buy' and 'hold' on the company. Dilution has been an ongoing problem and the company's pivot to AI, while admittedly more promising than most mining peers, is still far from a sure thing. But with Bitcoin back above $100k per coin and IREN maintaining a top 3 position among public miners regarding EH/s, it's tough to argue with the results from fiscal Q3. IREN Limited is one of the most efficient operators in the sector and is a profitable company at current BTC prices. Pre-halving back in 2024, my view was and continues to be that BTC miners are great trading tickers, but not necessarily strong long-term investments. However, if you want one BTC miner to hold on fundamentals, IREN is the one I'd pick. I'm upgrading back to 'buy.'",BTC-USD|IREN,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-15 12:00:00

The $300M Macquarie loan supports a strategic pivot into HPC, reducing dilution risk but introducing execution and speculative revenue risks. Bitfarms' U.S. expansion, now 80% of its energy pipeline, positions it to capitalize on AI and HPC infrastructure growth where capital is concentrated. While Bitfarms is operationally and strategically upgraded, investors should watch for HPC monetization over the next 2–3 quarters before re-rating. It's been a gut-check season for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miners that have reported earnings this month, and we’ve seen mostly mixed bag financial results, which most management attributed to the April 2024 Bitcoin halving event. With all the equity funding and loans undertaken in 2024 by miners, I think by now miners should have scaled mining operationally and strategically and be better positioned for the next leg of the cycle and the next halving. Or is mining becoming the second fiddle and all focus now on HPC? It seems. Results are in for Bitfarms ( BITF ) , and I must say Bitfarms results aren’t exactly impressive despite the YoY top-line growth. My very first and most recent coverage of Bitfarms (in June last year) was around the time of Riot Platform’s ( RIOT ) proposed takeover of Bitfarms at $2.30 per share (about 25–30% premium at the time) and at a total equity value of $950 million. Riot remains one of the best-capitalized miners in the space, and a takeover interest signaled market confidence in Bitfarms’ undervaluation. I thought BITF had found a floor at that price point at that time, and whether the takeover went through or fell through, there would be limited downside and potential strategic upside for investors. The Buy rating I issued at the time was based on that premise, and the stock has since fallen by over 50% to today’s price of $1.10. Bitfarms Q1 2025 financial snapshot (Bitfarms) Bitfarms reported Q1 total revenue of $67 million, up 33% Y/Y and beating estimates by $1.89 million. Gross margin decreased by 20 percentage points YoY from 63% to 43%. SG&A expenses increased to $20 million, a ~53% jump from last year's, including a non-recurring $2 million cost related to the closing of the Stronghold acquisition. This puts adjusted EBITDA margin at 23%, a 26 percentage point drop from 46% a year ago. Net loss deepened to $36 million and basic EPS was -$0.07, missing consensus estimates by $0.04. Operating loss deepened to $32 million compared to $24 million in Q1 2024. Overall, the results reflect cost pressures and margin compression despite stronger revenue. Operationally, Bitfarms increased its hashrate under management by 200% from a year ago. Exahashes under management now stands at 19.5 EH. Mining efficiency as of Q1 end was 19 watts per terahash, a 44% improvement compared to a year ago. More Debt, Less Dilution We are excited to have joined forces with Macquarie to finance our HPC business cost-effectively and with much less dilution than equity funding, creating long-term value for shareholders. - CFO Jeff Lucas Those were the words of the CFO of Bitfarms in the commentary of the Q1 earnings. There will be less dilution moving forward. But Bitfarms just secured a $300 million loan facility from Macquarie. The funds are earmarked for developing the Panther Creek HPC data center. This is strategic and doesn't pose any near-term threat to the balance sheet since net assets remain positive, though total liabilities have increased from $59.6 million to $112.2 million due to the $50 million first tranche out of the $300 million debt facility drawn in Q1. Equity position is also strong at $664.7 million (lots of dilution happened last year), and BTC holdings are currently 1166 BTC amounting to ~$121 million as of today’s ~$104,000 BTC price. I believe the $300 million debt can be well absorbed within the capital structure without any near-term financial strain. The only concern I’d have as an investor is the fact that Bitfarms' HPC business and its success remain entirely speculative at this point. No sales have been recorded yet from HPC. While Panther Creek has strategic advantages like scale, power access, and fiber connectivity, execution risk remains high, and any execution missteps could burden Bitfarms with fixed obligations from this loan, and in turn strain liquidity and likely delay ROI. Other Operational Highlights from Bitfarms’ Q1 First, we completely transformed our energy portfolio with the strategic and profitable disposition of one of our Paraguayan Bitcoin mining campus, Yguazu, and the strategic acquisition of two large power campuses in Pennsylvania with the Stronghold acquisition. - CEO Ben Gagnon Bitfarms is executing a clear exit from regions where the economics don’t offer long-term upside. The bigger picture is now the strategic pivot to the U.S., where ~80% of Bitfarms’ 1.4 GW energy pipeline is now concentrated. This matters. U.S.-based miners have been capitalizing on structural advantages in energy arbitrage and regulatory incentives, take RIOT and the ERCOT demand response program for example, an income streams the miner taps into to improve cash flow during periods of high-energy prices or market volatility. Experimentation with international expansion has largely underperformed and introduced more risk than upside for most miners pivoting to HPC. A new strategic play I think investors should watch for, especially for miners pivoting into HPC, is the localization of infrastructure near major U.S. power grids, which brings them closer to potential enterprise HPC clients. The sheer size of private AI investment in the U.S. offers better economics and stronger return potential. Private AI investment in the U.S. ($109.1 billion in 2024) is way bigger compared to the rest of the world, and is even 12 times higher than that of China (at $9.3 billion in 2024), the next closest rival. The preceding figures can be found in Stanford University's 2025 AI Index report . Takeaway As the strategies in Q1 shows, Bitfarms is clearly evolving from a traditional Bitcoin miner into a diversified infrastructure player with long-term ambitions in HPC and AI hyperscaling (much like the strategic trend among miners currently). The Q1 results, while reflecting YoY top-line growth (BTC price is much higher compared to a year ago, so top-line growth is unsurprising) and operational scale, a closer look at the expansion strategy also highlights the cost pressures and potential execution risk that come with aggressive expansion into HPC. The $300 million debt facility secured with Macquarie is great as it is targeted for a high-potential vertical. But until revenue materializes from HPC, it remains a speculative bet. That said, Bitfarms’ strong equity base of $664.7 million and $186 million in combined cash and BTC holdings provides ample cushion in the near term. The U.S. pivot is the bigger structural story here. Bitfarms is aligning itself with where the capital is flowing not just in energy arbitrage, but in future-proof computing demand. With 80% of its 1.4 GW pipeline now in the U.S., Bitfarms is better positioned to tap into HPC and AI infrastructure growth, especially as enterprise AI spending in the U.S. vastly outpaces other markets. Execution remains key. Investors should watch for initial HPC contracts, utilization metrics, and cash flow trends over the next 2–3 quarters. Until then, Bitfarms sits in a liminal space - operationally upgraded, strategically well-positioned, but still awaiting proof of monetization beyond Bitcoin.",BTC-USD|RIOT|BITF|BITF:CA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-15 12:00:00

With BTC now well over the $100K mark, market momentum is undeniable. LTH spending is rising, STH SOPR remains above 1, and the broader mood feels bullish. But growing profit-taking could soon test the market’s resilience.

Their SOPR has consistently held above 1, signaling that recent sellers are locking in gains. This is a key indicator of bullish momentum: when STHs are in profit, they’re less likely to panic sell and more inclined to ride the trend.

33767162,[object Object],1747310413,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Shiba Inu Large Transaction Volumes Crash 49% In One Day, Are Whales Leaving?",https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-large-transaction-49/,"Shiba Inu whales have been known to make their presence known during major market moves, and the recent price recovery was no different. In the last week, these large investors have been returning to the market in varying degrees to take advantage of the Shiba Inu price rise above $0.000017. However, there has been a turn in the tide as these large transaction volumes have suffered a notable decline in the space of one day. Shiba Inu Whale Volumes Drop 49% According to data from IntoTheBlock, Shiba Inu whale volumes have been rising steadily since the start of May. On May 12, it hit one of the highest levels for the month so far when the SHIB price touched $0.000017. In total, 6.35 trillion SHIB were moved in transactions carrying at least $100,000. This came out to a staggering $100 million in large transactions for the single day period. But this was short-lived as the direction changed rapidly. By May 13, the large transaction volumes declined drastically as the transactions crashed by almost half. Large transaction volumes for the day came out to only 3.25 trillion SHIB, which is a 49% decline from the previous day’s numbers of 6.35 trillion SHIB. This brought the dollar figure to only $53.05 million. This crash in the large transaction volumes coincided with the slowdown of the crypto market rally. The Shiba Inu price had seen a small retrace from $0.000017 to $0.000015 in the one-day period and the large transactions had fallen in response. Given this, it suggests that these whale investors could’ve been moving so much SHIB at the time to sell. It would explain the sell pressure that pushed the SHIB price down, as well as the decline in the large transaction volumes, as they moved in favor of selling instead of buying. SHIB Profitability Still Remains Low The recent decline in the Shiba Inu price has also affected the profitability of its holders, as less than 50% are seeing a profit at current prices. With only 45% of all holders in the green, the majority of investors are still nursing losses. Currently, this figure stands at 50% of all SHIB holders being in the red right now, according to data from IntoTheBlock.

That’s a 35% gain in seven days. Traders and investors are watching closely, as some charts and on‑chain data point to more upside ahead. Related Reading: Avalanche Rumbles 21% Amid Record-Breaking Address Activity Breakout Above Long‑Term Barrier According to chart watchers on X, Dogecoin cleared a descending trendline that’s been capping gains since January 2025. That line had knocked back rallies around $0.43, $0.19 and $0.16. Now, with prices trading above it, some see a fresh floor under DOGE’s price action. Ichimoku Cloud Turns Support Based on data, the Ichimoku cloud has flipped bullish. After the price moved above the cloud, the green span settled above the red. For many traders, that shift turns what was once resistance into a cushion for future climbs. Fibonacci Levels Point Higher Analysts have also plotted Fibonacci extensions on the recent move. The 1.619 level sits at $0.69 and the 2.0 level at $0.81. If Dogecoin follows that path, these lines could mark key stopovers on the road up. $DOGE 1D – The technical fib target for Dogecoin is the green box above with this daily breakout occuring. I’m calling for $1 $DOGE because I think it will extend higher to that psych level. All of this happens by the end of summer, imo. pic.twitter.com/V3rvmre1HR — Chris (@StonkChris) May 13, 2025 Forecast Puts $1 Within Reach One independent analyst has mapped out a timeline pushing DOGE to $1 by the “end of summer” this year. That would require a whopping 320% rise from its current $0.2317 price. If it happens, market value could swell to almost $150 billion, up from roughly $34.5 billion today. DOGE’s market cap rose 3.4% over the past 24 hours alone. Network Activity Ramps Up On‑chain figures back the buzz. New addresses have climbed over 100% in a week, active wallets are up 110%, and zero‑balance addresses jumped 154%. Those moves hint at growing retail interest and wider engagement beyond quick trades. Futures Traders Stay Busy Meanwhile, futures open interest on Dogecoin has surged from $989 million to $1.62 billion. That’s a strong shift compared to mid‑February through April, when futures heat and DOGE’s price rose and fell together. Now, open interest keeps climbing despite a pullback from $0.25 to around $0.22. Related Reading: Price Down, Bets Up: Dogecoin Open Interest Climbs To $1.62 Billion Other Voices Eyeing $1 Mark Studies last year showed that Dogecoin could hit $1 and push its market cap near $100 billion in 2025. Another market watcher has tracked a cup‑and‑handle pattern forming since 2021, and uses it to project a $0.80 price target. What This Means For Traders Momentum is clearly building, but history warns against getting too carried away. Trendlines can be broken on low volume and bounce back into place. Fibonacci levels offer guidance, not guarantees. And on‑chain spikes sometimes come from short‑term bots or wash trading. That said, a clear move above these technical hurdles could open the door to bigger swings. Risk management remains crucial.

The breach didn’t come from hackers breaking through firewalls—it came from insiders leaking private information of coinbase customer. This cyber attack is expected to cost the company anywhere between $180 million and $400 million. How the Breach Happened According to a blog post by the company , some overseas customer support agents working for Coinbase were bribed by cybercriminals. These agents leaked personal customer data, including names, home addresses, phone numbers, and even government ID photos. Some records also had partial Social Security and bank information. However, Coinbase clarified that none of the leaked data included passwords, wallets, or two-factor authentication codes. Who Was Affected? Coinbase says the breach impacted less than 1% of its active users, which is around 84,000 customers. These users were targeted with social engineering scams, where attackers pretended to be Coinbase employees to steal funds. The financial cost for Coinbase is expected to be between $180 million and $400 million. While that’s a big hit, the company says protecting customers is more important. What Majors Did Coinbase Take? To fix the damage, Coinbase is taking several major steps. First, the company confirmed that any user who was tricked into sending funds will be fully reimbursed. Second, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong refused to pay the $20 million bribe the attackers demanded and instead launched a $20 million reward fund for anyone who helps catch those responsible. https://t.co/evpIBMFvRW pic.twitter.com/f6UPdkL5R0 — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) May 15, 2025 Coinbase Takes Action After Cyber Attack To prevent this from happening again, Coinbase is making some serious changes. They’re opening a new customer support center in the U.S., strengthening how they detect suspicious activity inside the company, and increasing the monitoring of risky transactions. Chief Security Officer Philip Martin admitted the situation was tough but said the company is owning up to its mistakes. “When something like this happens, we don’t hide—we fix it,” he said. For Coinbase, this incident is not just about losses, but about rebuilding trust in a fast-changing industry.",News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|MINING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-15 12:06:15

Nevertheless, analysts remain confident in XRP’s future price movements, as long as the asset remains above a critical support line. As cryptocurrency continues to expand, here are the daily averages of new wallets created over the past month for the top 4 market caps: 1⃣ Bitcoin $BTC : 309K Per Day 2⃣ Ethereum $ETH : 112K Per Day 3⃣ XRP $XRP : 3.5K Per Day 4⃣ Tether $USDT : 36.4K Per Day pic.twitter.com/8mAjH6Hscp — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 14, 2025 Santiment’s analysis shows the substantial lead BTC has in terms of new wallets being created on average every day for the past month. This aligns with previous reports on CryptoPotato’s website claiming that retail investors have returned for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Ethereum, whose price also picked up the pace in the past few weeks, has enjoyed over 110,000 new wallets created daily on average within the past month, while USDT sits far behind with 36,400. However, Ripple’s situation is rather worrisome as only 3,500 new wallets emerge on a daily basis (again, on average). This suggests that retail investors have remained on the sidelines when it comes to new engagement with XRP, which is in stark contrast with the developments in December 2024. At the time, the newly established wallets shot up to well over 20,000 while XRP was in the middle of its spectacular run to and beyond $3. Now, though, the lack of actual retail demand could spell trouble for the asset. The past 24 hours have been somewhat painful for XRP, whose price has tumbled by over 5% and sits below $2.5 after getting rejected at $2.7 earlier this week. However, analysts are adamant that Ripple’s cross-border token has a clear sky ahead of it and will continue to rise as long as it doesn’t lose the $2.38 support level.

At the Sohn Investment Conference in New York, Chanos told CNBC he’s “selling MicroStrategy stock and buying Bitcoin.” The investor described the move as buying something for $1 and selling something for $2.50, referring to what he sees as a significant price mismatch. Chanos argued that Strategy is selling the idea of buying Bitcoin ( BTC ) in a corporate structure, and that other companies are following suit in hopes of receiving a similar market premium. Chanos said this was “ridiculous.” He described his trade as “a good barometer of not only just the arbitrage itself, but I think of retail speculation.” Selling Strategy stock to buy Bitcoin Chanos’ recent move assumes investors overpay for Bitcoin exposure through corporate wrappers like Strategy and other firms that follow its Bitcoin accumulation blueprint. The investor’s move reflects a stance that purchasing Bitcoin directly would be better than purchasing Strategy’s stocks for indirect Bitcoin exposure. Chanos’ move suggests that holding Bitcoin through companies reflects excessive speculation and risk mispricing. It assumes that retail investors’ idea of having Bitcoin indirectly through corporate wrappers can inflate the company’s stock valuations. While shorting Strategy may seem like a good idea, investors have already lost billions shorting Saylor’s company. In 2024, investors who bet against the firm lost about $3.3 billion as the stock rose. As of May 2025, Strategy holds about 568,840 Bitcoin, valued at around $59 billion . Since the company started accumulating Bitcoin in 2020, its stock price has surged by 1,500%, outperforming the S&P 500’s gains during the same period. In a recently released documentary from the Financial Times, Strategy analyst Jeff Walton said that the company’s Bitcoin holdings would help it become the “number one publicly traded equity in the entire market” in the future. Chanos previously called Bitcoin a “libertarian fantasy” Chanos has not always been favorable toward Bitcoin. In a 2018 interview, Chanos described Bitcoin as a “libertarian fantasy.” Chanos said that having digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario wouldn’t work. The investor said that if fiat currency brings the world down, the last thing he’d want to own is Bitcoin. “Food would work the best,” he said. He also criticized Bitcoin for enabling illicit activity, calling the crypto sector “the dark side of finance” in a 2023 interview, and accusing the industry of facilitating tax evasion and money laundering. Chanos also expressed skepticism about spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), saying that Wall Street needs to keep the public interested in crypto to profit from the fees. Despite those critiques, Chanos now appears to see value in holding Bitcoin directly, particularly in contrast to investing in public companies with large BTC treasuries. Related: $1B Bitcoin exits Coinbase in a day as analysts warn of supply shock Chanos’ history in short-selling Chanos is best known for his short position against the energy company Enron before the firm filed for bankruptcy in 2001. The move generated profits for Kynikos Associates, a firm that he founded. A short position involves borrowing assets from a broker, selling them at the current price, and then repurchasing the assets once the value falls to give back what is owed to the broker. Short sellers profit when the asset’s value declines, but face losses when the asset appreciates. While the investor profited from short-selling Enron, Chanos’ predictions weren’t always correct. Chanos was bearish on Tesla and announced a short position in 2016. Tesla stock skyrocketed by 2,200% between 2015 and 2021. The event caused major losses to Chanos’ fund. In 2020, the fund ended with $405 million in assets under management after having over $900 million the previous year. The fund was converted into a family office, and external assets were returned to investors.

Unilabs (UNIL) has quickly captured investor interest by offering AI-powered tools and a blockchain-based profit-sharing model, which aims to democratize access to high-growth crypto opportunities, traditionally reserved for institutional investors. As Unilabs rises, popular tokens like DOGE and XRP remain in the spotlight. Dogecoin price recently recovered, avoiding a breakdown below the long-term diagonal support level. Meanwhile, XRP ETF has taken a massive step forward, pointing to a growing institutional future. Let’s uncover XRP ETF developing news, Dogecoin price prediction, and why Unilabs could be the next big thing in 2025. XRP ETF Developments and Increased Institutional Interest XRP price has seen renewed interest, sparked by the approval of ProShares Trust’s launch of several XRP futures ETFs. The approved funds will offer leveraged and inverse exposure through future contracts, but not spot holdings. This move will attract a new class of institutional players. Other firms like WisdomTree, 21Shares, and Bitwise have also filed for similar products, reflecting XRP’s growing institutional demand. Source: SEC.GOV website Adding to the momentum, CME Group is expected to list XRP futures in May. Market insiders believe XRP could break above its immediate resistance level at $2.60, rallying towards $2.75 and $3.00. For long-term prospects, analysts anticipate that XRP ETFs could boost its price, reaching $10 by 2030. However, investors should remain cautious. Macro-economic factors, market volatility, and competition from altcoins that offer greater returns remain key risks. Still, with XRP ETF progress, growing institutional interest, and a near end to the SEC case, the altcoin has an enhanced outlook, potentially reaching $10 in 2030. Dogecoin Price Prediction Dogecoin price bounced off its ascending support trendline, forming a bullish candlestick. However, the meme coin has not broken out of its resistance trendline―a barrier that has existed since the start of the year. Dogecoin price must move above this level to confirm the end of its correction phase. In addition, DOGE’s technical indicators are yet to turn bullish. Source: TradingView While its MACD and RSI are rising, they still remain in bearish zones. As a result, DOGE’s weekly chart hasn’t confirmed whether its trend could be bullish or bearish. Meanwhile, the Dogecoin price has completed a five-wave downward movement and started an A-B-C corrective structure, which could steer DOGE towards $0.29, but clear its immediate barrier at $0.25. Recent bullish divergences formed on the chart have also aligned with this scenario. These divergences have triggered the formation of a bullish double-bottom pattern for the altcoin. Therefore, the Dogecoin price could rise above the $0.25 level and later rally towards the $0.29 resistance. DOGE & XRP Prices Rally, But Unilabs Could be Next Despite XRP ETF development and DOGE’s price action, newer projects like Unilabs (UNIL) are attracting investors seeking deeper value and innovation. As the first AI-backed asset manager in crypto, Unilabs currently manages over $30 million AUM (as of Q2 2025). The project removes human error from investing through intelligent automation. This enables users to identify and invest in promising blockchain projects early before they blow up. Even more interesting, Unilabs offers specialized funds for various investor profiles. They include the AI Fund, which focuses on projects within the AI market, BTC Fund, which invests in tokenized real-world assets, fusing traditional commodities and blockchains; the RWA Fund focuses on transformative Web3, blockchain, and DeFi technologies, and Mining Fund, which invests in crypto mining ventures to generate stable returns. Unlike DOGE, which heavily relies on speculative hype, Unilabs operates a transparent profit-sharing model, with several investments, like yield and arbitrage wins, that are pooled together and distributed to investors. This provides consistent profits and clear visibility into fund performance. With an entry price of $0.004 and an expected rise to $0.0051, now could be the optimal time to buy UNIL for greater returns. UNIL, DOGE or XRP: Which Is A Better Investment? While XRP and DOGE remain strong contenders in the market, newer players such as Unilabs (UNIL) are positioning themselves to capture the next generation of AI and blockchain intersection. With a comprehensive roadmap and innovative investment solutions in the cryptocurrency space, Unilabs has the potential to outperform established tokens in the market.

The ruling, granted by the Singapore High Court on May 9, authorizes accounting firm KPMG to act as the official liquidator and oversee the recovery of lost assets. The court’s decision comes after months of legal proceedings initiated by Sonic Labs, which accused Multichain of non-cooperation in tracing and recovering stolen funds. According to Sonic Labs CEO Michael Kong , “Unfortunately since Multichain and its former employees have been completely uncooperative, we were compelled to file a lawsuit against Multichain and to forcibly wind-up the company. If Multichain had not hid from victims, this entire process would’ve been unnecessary and we would’ve saved more than a year.” I'm pleased to announce that on 9 May, 2025, Fantom Foundation's (now @SonicLabs ) winding up application against Multichain Foundation Ltd by the Singapore High Court was granted in full. Individuals from KPMG Singapore were also appointed as liquidators on the same day.… — Kong.sonic (@michaelfkong) May 14, 2025 The 2023 Multichain exploit led to a significant loss for Sonic Labs Multichain, a cross-chain bridge protocol formerly known as Anyswap, suffered a major security breach in July 2023, which led to an estimated $210 million being drained from multiple blockchain networks, including Fantom, Ethereum, BNB Chain, and others. The incident dealt a heavy blow to users and decentralized apps that relied on the protocol to facilitate cross-chain asset transfers. Chainalysis suggested that it had some indications of a rug pull. Sonic Labs, which was still known as the Fantom Foundation then, lost about $122 million due to the incident. The loss of funds and the series of events that followed led to Multichain ceasing operations altogether. The whereabouts of CEO Zhaojun were also unknown for some time until it came to light that he was arrested by Chinese authorities due to the fallout of the breach. Legal action and the path to liquidation Sonic Labs filed for breach of contract, fraud, and loss of $122 million of its funds against Multichain in the High Court of Singapore, which granted a default judgment ruling in January 2024. After the ruling, it was still hard to reach the Multichain team, prompting Sonic Labs in March 2024 to petition the court to wind up the Multichain Foundation and appoint a liquidator to help it recover and redistribute its assets. The Singapore High Court ruling now enables the appointment of KPMG to oversee the liquidation of Multichain Foundation’s assets. “Going forward, the liquidators can now start working with other parties to initiate the process of trying to acquire funds that should eventually be returned to users if those legal proceedings are successful,” added Kong. The case also points to a growing trend of leveraging traditional legal systems to seek justice and restitution in the otherwise borderless and largely pseudonymous world of crypto. Some see this as a move in the right direction, as the sector at large is pushing for more legitimacy and protection for users.

The presale to date has generated $8,200,000 with 465 million tokens bought by 9800 investors. At $0.025 and on the brink of its fifth phase, this DeFi token has attracted growing interest as a result of its focus on lending and a thoughtful scale. Unlike capricious crypto movements, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) holds promise, exciting investors for disproportionate returns in the next few years. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Surge In phase 4, 75% of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens have already been snatched by eager investors. Demand for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also apparent at $0.025 and increasing since the launch at $0.01. The capture of tokens at this stage permits the buyers to take advantage of a 20% surge when phase 5 comes in at $ $0.03. Project tokenomics predicted to be listed at a cost of $0.06 and would provide investors with an expected 140% return during the official launch. According to analysts, the token can skyrocket to $3 after the launch, which means that ROI will be 11900%. In the past few days, the development team announced a dashboard of top 50 token holders, and they are set to reward them more tokens if they hold these top positions, thus increasing general engagement. This presale’s momentum underscores urgency. With Phase 4 selling out quickly, investors have a tightening time frame in mind fueled by the reduced window in which they can acquire tokens at cheaper prices. The smart contracts of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are going under a Certik audit and the details regarding the audits will be out on social media of the platform shortly. This transparency creates trust, cementing the reputation of the project as a stable player in the crypto world. Investors are racing to buy tokens today in expectation of large profits once the prices increase even more. Lending Model and Buy Pressure A decentralized lending system on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enables the participants to earn passive income by lending or borrowing. By depositing funds, one earns mtTokens such as mtETH when ETH is deposited and they earn interest continuously. Lenders have the borrowers to deposit collateral, in excess of the value of the loan, in the name of stability. By its buy-and-distribute operation, Mutuum Finance builds up revenue for buyback of MUTM tokens and distributes them to the stakers. Peer to peer lending product of Mutuum Finance brings users closer to negotiating terms directly, thus increasing flexibility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts investors with sustainable returns because of its real-world utility and differs from merely speculative coins. A well-crafted presale and open roadmap fully ground Mutuum Finance as a powerful player in the DeFi environment. As phase 4 nears an end, speculation heats up in the crypto space pending MUTM’s exchange listing, which is set to raise prices further still. Portfolio-Zooming Potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents an outstanding investment for ambitious 2025 portfolio builders to increase returns. The 15200% growth potential is highly dependent on its reliable lending structure and well-organized economic design. Interested parties should benefit from the current $0.025 entry price in order to obtain tokens before a scheduled increase in phase 5. Buying MUTM tokens at current levels opens a door for investors to benefit from meaningful returns with the anticipation of post-launch value hitting $3. Signing up for the presale at this moment is the opportunity for you to stake a claim in DeFi’s next most profound growth opportunity.

The proposal passed with a 99.96% approval rate. On May 14, an advisory proposal recommending World Liberty Financial to test its airdrop function by sending WLFI holders a small amount of the project’s USD-pegged stablecoin has officially been passed. Garnering a total of 12,000 votes, the proposal gained a 99.96% approval rate from the governance vote. Although the proposal does not contain an estimated date for when the airdrop would take place, it does reveal key details about the anticipated airdrop . According to the official website, all current holders of the WLFI token will receive a fixed amount of USD1. However, the exact amount remains undetermined and will be calculated based on the number of eligible wallets in the ecosystem and the budget available for the airdrop allocation. WLFI token holders will also be subjected to eligibility requirements which the project will determine once the decision is made final. The project also warned that even though the airdrop proposal has been approved, World Liberty Financial, Inc. can still choose to suspend, modify or terminate the test airdrop at any time, as well as establish additional requirements for holders. You might also like: World Liberty Financial opens vote to airdrop USD1 stablecoin to WLFI holders The purpose of conducting a live airdrop test is to ensure the project’s smart contract functionality, system reliability, and readiness for such an event. The airdrop is also a way for the project to reward its holders with USD1, especially early adopters who have supported the project from the start. Through an airdrop event, the project hopes to promote its homegrown USD-pegged stablecoin and boost circulation for USD1 ahead of a broader rollout. What is USD1? USD1 is World Liberty Financial Inc.’s stablecoin. It is backed by U.S. Treasuries, cash, and other dollar-based equivalents, while BitGo serves as its official custodian. Shortly after its initial launch in April 2025, the stablecoin’s trading volume skyrocketed by more than 6,700%, reaching as high as $140 million. At press time, USD1’s market cap stands at more than $2.1 billion. The stablecoin has a circulating supply of 2.1 billion tokens. On May 1 at Token2049, World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff declared that USD1 has been selected as the official stablecoin for MGX’s $2 billion investment into Binance . The deal marked the largest investment ever paid in stablecoins. On the same day, Witkoff announced that USD1 will be integrated into the Tron ( TRX ) blockchain.

Europeans face tightening capital controls, inviting a recommendation to take back control of personal funds. Seven-figure BTC price targets are already gaining traction. Bitcoin ( BTC ) will shoot to $1 million in just three years thanks to global macroeconomic shifts, Arthur Hayes forecasts. In his latest blog post released on May 15, the former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX doubled down on his sky-high BTC price prediction . Hayes: $1 million Bitcoin due “between now and 2028” Bitcoin has two giant tailwinds that will help propel it to seven digits in just a few years. For Hayes, shifting capital controls worldwide, as well as US treasury “devaluation,” mean that Bitcoin will become the go-to safety net for investors everywhere. He summarizes: “Foreign capital repatriation and the devaluation of the gargantuan stock of US treasuries will be the two catalysts that will power Bitcoin to $1 million sometime between now and 2028.” TLT US exchange-traded fund indexed in gold, Bitcoin (screenshot). Source: Arthur Hayes/Substack While that date may appear arbitrary and demand 900% BTC price gains, Hayes argues that the financial landscape could change in an instant depending on the next US governmental administration. “I say 2028, because that is when the next US presidential election occurs and who knows what type of politician will win and what policies they will enact,” he continues. While the Presidency of Donald Trump has enacted various pro-crypto policies, these could also begin to reverse if a shift in government occurs. In Europe, meanwhile, an increasing desire to control and even suppress crypto use by the general population signals a growing divergence. “Not even China has banned the private ownership of Bitcoin because it knows it’s counterproductive and impossible,” Hayes writes. “For you Euro-poor-peans, whose governments practice a less effective form of communism than China, don’t expect the European Central Bank (ECB) to learn this lesson without trying. Therefore, get your money out now!” Betting on a seven-figure breakout As Cointelegraph reported, Hayes has not been shy about predicting both short-term and longer-term BTC price expansion in the years to come.

The attackers then attempted to extort $20 million worth of Bitcoin from Coinbase, threatening to leak sensitive personal data including names, addresses, and government-issued IDs unless a ransom was paid. Coinbase stressed that no passwords, private keys or funds were compromised and that Coinbase Prime accounts were not affected by the breach. “We will not pay the racketeers. Instead, we are offering a $20 million reward to anyone who can provide information leading to the identification and conviction of those responsible,” he said. Coinbase reported the incident to law enforcement and promised to fully refund affected users. The company did not disclose specifically how many accounts were affected but noted that the scope of the breach was limited. This is not the first time Coinbase has faced extortion attempts, with the company issuing a bounty following a similar extortion attempt in 2022.

Here’s Why This is Good for XRP,https://timestabloid.com/trump-says-u-s-is-winning-china-in-the-crypto-sector-heres-why-this-is-good-for-xrp/,"President Donald Trump has declared that the United States is outpacing China in the crypto sector, which suggests growing federal alignment with digital asset development. The president’s pro-crypto stance has benefited top assets like XRP, and this statement has excited many in the XRP army. Financial market reporter Walter Bloomberg shared Trump’s comment on X, where the president said, “We are winning China in the crypto sector.” Trump’s America-first approach to cryptocurrencies is another reason XRP holders are bullish. While China is home to many Bitcoin miners, XRP is the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency, giving it an edge in a crypto market dominated by the U.S. Policy Actions Supporting Domestic Growth The comment comes amid a recalibration in U.S.-China trade dynamics. Earlier this year, both countries placed aggressive tariffs on foreign goods, initially as high as 145% on Chinese imports and 125% on American goods. However, these have been dropped to 30% and 10% respectively. With trade tensions easing, the competition appears to be shifting toward financial technologies. Trump is working to advance industries in the U.S., and the crypto industry is important to him. He launched his cryptocurrency in January, and his family members have shown support for cryptocurrencies and a blockchain-powered financial system.

With the U.S. set to dominate global finance under Trump, these U.S.-based digital assets could rise to the top of the market, outpacing others without financial incentives. China’s Restrictions Highlight U.S. Opportunity China continues to enforce strict measures against crypto use, banning it for payments and investment while sustaining a mining ban initiated in 2021. Although underground mining persists and some restrictions have eased , official policy remains hostile to the sector. In contrast, the U.S. is developing a framework for legal use and market growth. The U.S. currently holds 198,012 BTC, slightly more than China’s 194,000 BTC, accumulated mainly through seizures. These holdings reflect an underlying strategic interest in crypto as part of national reserves. Additionally, Trump has reaffirmed his support for the market. According to Walter Bloomberg, Trump stated , “I’m a big crypto fan.” During his campaign, Trump promised to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world. As the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency, XRP is at the forefront of this movement to dominate the global digital asset market.
