Investors are optimistic about a potential price surge in the coming days, driven by encouraging on-chain data. Key metrics from Glassnode indicate a decline in ETH inflows into exchanges, suggesting that investors are holding onto their assets rather than selling. This trend typically points to increased accumulation and could foreshadow a bullish breakout. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Bullish Pattern Could Ignite A Breakout: Analyst Sets $15 Target As the broader crypto market evolves, Ethereum investors remain vigilant, anticipating a bullish reclaim that could propel prices higher. The decrease in exchange inflows could signify that traders are positioning themselves for a potential upward movement, as they seem more inclined to retain their holdings during this crucial phase. Should Ethereum successfully break above critical resistance levels, it could reignite bullish momentum and attract further investment. The next few days will be pivotal for ETH, as traders closely monitor price action and on-chain metrics for signs of a resurgence. With the right conditions, Ethereum may set its sights on new highs, reinforcing the overall positive sentiment in the market. Ethereum Exchanges’ Net Position Change Decreases Ethereum (ETH) is currently at a crucial price level following a 15% dip from its local highs. The broader crypto industry is brimming with anticipation for a massive rally after the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates a couple of weeks ago. However, despite the optimistic outlook, prices have struggled to climb higher, leaving many investors on edge. Fortunately, on-chain data from Glassnode suggests a reduction in selling pressure, which could improve market sentiment and pave the way for a potential ETH rebound. One key metric to consider is the Ethereum Exchanges’ Net Position Change indicator, which has been downward since mid-September. This indicator tracks the flow of ETH into and out of exchanges, and its recent decline signifies that inflows have dropped significantly. Lower inflows typically indicate reduced selling pressure, as fewer investors are moving their assets onto exchanges to sell. This shift in momentum reflects a positive change in market sentiment, suggesting that investors may be less inclined to liquidate their positions at current price levels. As selling activity decreases, Ethereum could gain some much-needed breathing room to recover from its recent decline. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Holds Above $140 As Funding Rate Signals Bullish Momentum Moreover, increased confidence among investors might lead to upward price movement in the coming days. Ethereum may be positioned for a resurgence if this trend continues, potentially setting the stage for a bullish breakout as market dynamics shift in its favor. As traders remain vigilant, all eyes will be on ETH to see if it can capitalize on this improved sentiment and regain upward momentum. ETH Testing Crucial Supply Levels Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,448 after facing rejection at the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $2,516. The price also struggled to maintain momentum above the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) at $2,458, indicating a critical moment for ETH. If Ethereum fails to reclaim both of these key levels in the coming days, it may be at serious risk of dropping towards the $2,200 area, potentially triggering a deeper correction. Conversely, if ETH manages to break above and hold these crucial indicators, it could signal a bullish trend reversal, opening the door for a surge toward the $2,700 resistance area. The outcome in the next few days will be vital for determining Ethereum’s trajectory. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Target $0.20 Soon, Analyst Predicts – Is DOGE Primed For A Rally? Traders and investors will closely monitor these levels, as the ability to reclaim them could provide the momentum needed for ETH to regain strength and attempt to test higher price levels. The current price action reflects the uncertainty in the market, making it imperative for ETH to assert itself decisively to inspire confidence and drive a rally.

Less than a month after launching Agile Coretime, the first core was bought for 69 DOT over the weekend. This purchase is a significant milestone for the modern blockchain that’s been pushing to attract more users and developers on its rail by making block space accessibility easier and more flexible. Polkadot Coretime Purchased For 69 DOT According to on-chain data from the Coretime Hub, one core was bought for 69 DOT out of the five available for sale. The purchased amount was burned, a move that helps reduce inflation in the long term. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Could Hit $100,000 Before The End Of The Year Agile Coretime, which went live in September, is a massive boost for Polkadot. Under this framework, Polkadot seeks to allocate network resources more efficiently while offering greater accessibility and flexibility for new startups and developers planning to build. A core aspect of this framework is introducing a market-driven approach to block space data. In this model, it becomes easier for projects to purchase core, on-demand, or bulk, depending on their needs. Accordingly, projects can prudently use their resources, and the resulting flexibility is empowering. Polkadot developers also said Agile Coretime will enable developers to optimize for network performance. Beyond these advantages, since coretime can be traded as NFTs, it can create fresh avenues for monetization for smart traders. Reducing Inflation, Will Prices Recover? Even with this purchase, whether DOT’s inflation will rapidly fall in the coming months remains to be seen. Currently, the network’s inflation is at around 10%. However, the community has already voted and approved Referendum 1139, which seeks to reduce inflation from 10% to 8%. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst: Why Memecoins Are Still The Next 100x Opportunity Over time, developers will aim to further reduce inflation, even below 5%, depending on network growth, and a big part of Coretime purchases. The more users buy Coretime, the more DOT will be burnt and removed, reducing inflation. For now, even after the purchase of the first core DOT, it remains under immense selling pressure, mirroring the general performance across the board. Although DOT is still in the top 20, the coin is down nearly 70% from March highs. Any dump below $3.8 could accelerate the sell-off, pushing DOT to fresh 2024 lows.
