Investors are optimistic about a potential price surge in the coming days, driven by encouraging on-chain data. Key metrics from Glassnode indicate a decline in ETH inflows into exchanges, suggesting that investors are holding onto their assets rather than selling. This trend typically points to increased accumulation and could foreshadow a bullish breakout. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Bullish Pattern Could Ignite A Breakout: Analyst Sets $15 Target As the broader crypto market evolves, Ethereum investors remain vigilant, anticipating a bullish reclaim that could propel prices higher. The decrease in exchange inflows could signify that traders are positioning themselves for a potential upward movement, as they seem more inclined to retain their holdings during this crucial phase. Should Ethereum successfully break above critical resistance levels, it could reignite bullish momentum and attract further investment. The next few days will be pivotal for ETH, as traders closely monitor price action and on-chain metrics for signs of a resurgence. With the right conditions, Ethereum may set its sights on new highs, reinforcing the overall positive sentiment in the market. Ethereum Exchanges’ Net Position Change Decreases Ethereum (ETH) is currently at a crucial price level following a 15% dip from its local highs. The broader crypto industry is brimming with anticipation for a massive rally after the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates a couple of weeks ago. However, despite the optimistic outlook, prices have struggled to climb higher, leaving many investors on edge. Fortunately, on-chain data from Glassnode suggests a reduction in selling pressure, which could improve market sentiment and pave the way for a potential ETH rebound. One key metric to consider is the Ethereum Exchanges’ Net Position Change indicator, which has been downward since mid-September. This indicator tracks the flow of ETH into and out of exchanges, and its recent decline signifies that inflows have dropped significantly. Lower inflows typically indicate reduced selling pressure, as fewer investors are moving their assets onto exchanges to sell. This shift in momentum reflects a positive change in market sentiment, suggesting that investors may be less inclined to liquidate their positions at current price levels. As selling activity decreases, Ethereum could gain some much-needed breathing room to recover from its recent decline. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Holds Above $140 As Funding Rate Signals Bullish Momentum Moreover, increased confidence among investors might lead to upward price movement in the coming days. Ethereum may be positioned for a resurgence if this trend continues, potentially setting the stage for a bullish breakout as market dynamics shift in its favor. As traders remain vigilant, all eyes will be on ETH to see if it can capitalize on this improved sentiment and regain upward momentum. ETH Testing Crucial Supply Levels Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,448 after facing rejection at the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $2,516. The price also struggled to maintain momentum above the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) at $2,458, indicating a critical moment for ETH. If Ethereum fails to reclaim both of these key levels in the coming days, it may be at serious risk of dropping towards the $2,200 area, potentially triggering a deeper correction. Conversely, if ETH manages to break above and hold these crucial indicators, it could signal a bullish trend reversal, opening the door for a surge toward the $2,700 resistance area. The outcome in the next few days will be vital for determining Ethereum’s trajectory. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Target $0.20 Soon, Analyst Predicts – Is DOGE Primed For A Rally? Traders and investors will closely monitor these levels, as the ability to reclaim them could provide the momentum needed for ETH to regain strength and attempt to test higher price levels. The current price action reflects the uncertainty in the market, making it imperative for ETH to assert itself decisively to inspire confidence and drive a rally.

Less than a month after launching Agile Coretime, the first core was bought for 69 DOT over the weekend. This purchase is a significant milestone for the modern blockchain that’s been pushing to attract more users and developers on its rail by making block space accessibility easier and more flexible. Polkadot Coretime Purchased For 69 DOT According to on-chain data from the Coretime Hub, one core was bought for 69 DOT out of the five available for sale. The purchased amount was burned, a move that helps reduce inflation in the long term. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Could Hit $100,000 Before The End Of The Year Agile Coretime, which went live in September, is a massive boost for Polkadot. Under this framework, Polkadot seeks to allocate network resources more efficiently while offering greater accessibility and flexibility for new startups and developers planning to build. A core aspect of this framework is introducing a market-driven approach to block space data. In this model, it becomes easier for projects to purchase core, on-demand, or bulk, depending on their needs. Accordingly, projects can prudently use their resources, and the resulting flexibility is empowering. Polkadot developers also said Agile Coretime will enable developers to optimize for network performance. Beyond these advantages, since coretime can be traded as NFTs, it can create fresh avenues for monetization for smart traders. Reducing Inflation, Will Prices Recover? Even with this purchase, whether DOT’s inflation will rapidly fall in the coming months remains to be seen. Currently, the network’s inflation is at around 10%. However, the community has already voted and approved Referendum 1139, which seeks to reduce inflation from 10% to 8%. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst: Why Memecoins Are Still The Next 100x Opportunity Over time, developers will aim to further reduce inflation, even below 5%, depending on network growth, and a big part of Coretime purchases. The more users buy Coretime, the more DOT will be burnt and removed, reducing inflation. For now, even after the purchase of the first core DOT, it remains under immense selling pressure, mirroring the general performance across the board. Although DOT is still in the top 20, the coin is down nearly 70% from March highs. Any dump below $3.8 could accelerate the sell-off, pushing DOT to fresh 2024 lows.

While Ethereum is considered as a “technology bet,” the investment behemoth sees Bitcoin as a “gold alternative.” This point of view captures a major change in the way conventional finance is starting to welcome digital assets. Related Reading: Bittensor (TAO) Soars 130% – What’s Behind The Altcoin’s Recent Surge? The company’s findings show that people are becoming more and more sure that Bitcoin can protect against inflation, just like gold has in the past. BlackRock’s Chief Investment Officer, Rick Rieder, recently said that Bitcoin is appealing to investors who want to protect their wealth in uncertain economic times because there is a limited quantity. Many investors who are growingly concerned about market volatility and inflation will find resonance in this mindset. Bitcoin: The Modern Gold? For those looking for stability in the realm of finance, gold has traditionally been the preferred asset. BlackRock contends, though, that Bitcoin is filling in this function. As the company points out, Bitcoin’s limited supply and spread-out nature could make it a more interesting purchase than gold. Central banks around the world are printing money at rates that have never been seen before. This makes Bitcoin an even better way to save money. “More institutional investors entering the market will only speed up the acceptance of Bitcoin at an incredible rate,” says Rieder. With this new money coming in, demand will grow even faster, making Bitcoin even more of a digital gold standard. Additionally, BlackRock believes that with increased realization of worth and scarcity, the price of the blockchain will keep moving upwards. BlackRock considers Bitcoin a “risk-off” asset like gold. At a recent conference, BlackRock’s Robbie Mitchnick argued that Bitcoin might hedge against fiat currencies and government trust. Mitchnick said Bitcoin is a safe shelter for investors, especially during economic turmoil. As inflation, monetary devaluation, and banking crises develop, Bitcoin’s potential as a worldwide monetary alternative makes it important for financial security. Ethereum: A Technological Transformation Although Ethereum is seen via another perspective, Bitcoin attracts attention as a store of value. BlackRock sees Ethereum as a platform for innovation as much as a cryptocurrency. With its smart contract capability, developers may create decentralized apps (dApps), therefore transforming many sectors, including gaming and banking. Ethereum has great future potential. Ethereum demand may explode as more companies investigate blockchain technology. The analysts of BlackRock are positive about Ethereum’s future and indicate that its core technology might cause rapid increase in the coming years.

There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $63,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another increase unless there is a close below the $61,650 zone. Bitcoin Price Corrects Gains Bitcoin price extended its increase above the $63,500 zone. BTC even cleared the $64,200 resistance zone. However, the bears were active below $64,500. It traded as high as $64,419 and the price is now correcting gains.

Amid this maintenance above the $60,000 price level, analysts have continued to speculate on BTC’s future trajectory especially when the asset would make the play out of the long-anticipated rally to a major highs. One such analyst, CryptoBullet on X, has brought attention to a particular indicator— the Puell Multiple— suggesting that Bitcoin may be on the cusp of reaching a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Skyrocket To $118,000 By Year-End: Here’s Why Understanding The Puell Multiple According to CryptoBullet, the behavior of the Puell Multiple indicator often correlates with Bitcoin’s market cycles, potentially offering a clue into where the asset is headed next. The Puell Multiple, calculated by dividing the daily issuance of Bitcoin in USD by the 365-day moving average of the daily issuance, is used as a measure to understand the miners’ profitability and their potential influence on Bitcoin’s price. Historically, when the Puell Multiple entered its “Green Zone,” it indicated that Bitcoin may have reached a market bottom, which often preludes a significant upward trend. CryptoBullet points out that this phase of the cycle often sees Bitcoin bottoming out before starting its ascent toward a new ATH. #BTC Puell Multiple indicator 💡 This is why I think $BTC is not done yet and we’ll get a new ATH soon According to this chart, #Bitcoin Bear Markets end (#BTC finds the bottom) when Puell Multiple reaches the Green Zone Then Puell Multiple bounces as $BTC price prints the… pic.twitter.com/pL1ShFxcwE — CryptoBullet (@CryptoBullet1) October 6, 2024 Bitcoin Puell Multiple Hints At Potential New All-Time High CryptoBullet’s analysis shows how the Puell Multiple has behaved across different market cycles. Specifically, he noted that Bitcoin’s bear markets tend to end when the Puell Multiple hits the Green Zone, when Bitcoin finds a bottom. Once this bottom is established, the Puell Multiple begins to bounce, indicating the first significant upward leg in Bitcoin’s price movement. The significance of the Puell Multiple, according to CryptoBullet, lies in its pattern of “higher lows” and “higher highs.” After reaching the Green Zone, Bitcoin’s price often experiences a mid-term correction that corresponds with the Puell Multiple creating a higher low. From this point, both the price of Bitcoin and the Puell Multiple tend to rally upwards, often reaching new highs. Related Reading: Is The Worst Over For Bitcoin? Analyst Suggests Local Bottom May Be Here Currently, CryptoBullet believes that Bitcoin is in the early stages of its next significant leg up. The higher lows and a potential for higher highs in the Puell Multiple may signal that both Bitcoin’s price and its market momentum are aligning for another rally. In the context of Bitcoin’s current trajectory, this suggests that a potential breakout to a new ATH could be imminent.

The price is trading below $2,450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2,450 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must stay above the $2,400 support level to start another increase in the near term. Ethereum Price Corrects Gains Ethereum price extended its upward move above the $2,400 level. ETH was able to clear the $2,450 resistance to move into a positive zone like Bitcoin. The price was able to climb above the $2,500 resistance zone. However, the bears were active above $2,500. A high was formed at $2,519 and the price started a downside correction. There was a move below the $2,450 support level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,311 swing low to the $2,519 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2,450 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. However, the bulls are protecting the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,311 swing low to the $2,519 high. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,450 level. A clear move above the $2,450 resistance might send the price toward the $2,500 resistance. An upside break above the $2,500 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,580 resistance zone in the near term. The next hurdle sits near the $2,650 level or $2,665. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,450 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,420 level. The first major support sits near the $2,400 zone. A clear move below the $2,400 support might push the price toward $2,320. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,250 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,120.

What Is Ethereum Improvement Proposal – 7781? EIP-7781 has garnered attention from the Ethereum (ETH) community due to its potential impact on the smart contract platform. Proposed by Ben Adams, co-founder of Illyriad Games, the new EIP promises several benefits, including reducing network slot times from 12 seconds to eight seconds, resulting in a 33% increase in transaction throughput without a corresponding rise in data blob counts. Related Reading: Vitalik Buterin Proposes A Privacy Fix for Ethereum For the uninitiated, data blob counts in Ethereum refer to the number of chunks of data included in a block for future use by rollups or layer-2 scaling solutions. These blobs help offload data storage and processing from the base Ethereum network, reducing congestion and improving scalability. EIP-7781 also aims to distribute network bandwidth more evenly, effectively lowering peak bandwidth requirements without sacrificing network efficiency. In his proposal, Adams explains: This would be equivalent to increasing blob count from 6 to 8 or gas limit from 30M to 40M; however this approach does not increase peak bandwidth. Commenting on the proposal, Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake said he supports reducing slot times to eight seconds. Drake added that the proposal would help DEXes like Uniswap v3 become 1.22 times more efficient, saving approximately $100 million in CEX-DEX arbitrage annually, resulting in better user trade execution. Similarly, Pseudonymous developer Cygaar shared their thoughts on EIP-7781, saying, if approved, the proposal can increase Ethereum’s throughput by as much as 50%. The developer also confirmed that the proposal would help lower Ethereum gas fees. However, Cygaar cautioned that reducing slot times should not come at the expense of significantly increasing hardware requirements for solo validators. To clarify this concern, shorter block times could cause the Ethereum blockchain’s data to grow more rapidly, requiring stronger hardware and faster internet to keep up with the quicker updates. This could present challenges for solo stakers and node operators. EIP-7781 Raises Concern For Solo Stakers While EIP-7781 promises to address several of the current challenges on the Ethereum network, there are concerns about its impact on solo stakers. Related Reading: Ethereum Inflation Surge Casts Doubt On “Ultrasound Money” Claim: Report For instance, Cinnehaim Ventures partner Adam Cochran noted that the proposal “seems reasonable in terms of bandwidth on solo stakers” as long as the gas limit per block remains unchanged. Cochran added: Would want to see some tests on I/O hardware and staker return ping times to make sure it doesn’t cut off some home stakers but, it seems like it should be within range for most. It should be recalled that recently, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin advocated lowering the ETH requirement for solo stakers from 32 ETH to 16 or 24 ETH. Buterin stressed the importance of solo stakers in securing the Ethereum network, suggesting that an increased proportion of solo stakers could provide an extra layer of protection against network attacks. At press time, ETH trades at $2,469, up 1.7% in the last 24 hours.
